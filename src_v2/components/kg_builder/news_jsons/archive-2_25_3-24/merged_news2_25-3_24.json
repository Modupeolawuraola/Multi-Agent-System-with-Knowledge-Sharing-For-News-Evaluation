            "full_content": "Summary Louis DeJoy resigned Monday as head of the US Postal Service after announcing plans to step down in February.\n\nDeJoy, a businessman and Trump donor, led the struggling agency through financial challenges following the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDeputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will lead USPS until a permanent successor is named by the Board of Governors.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has discussed giving Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick oversight of the independent government agency.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLouis DeJoy resigned from his role as head of the US Postal Service on Monday, leaving the independent government agency at a time when it faces calls for privatization and scrutiny from the Trump administration.\n\nIn a statement released by USPS, DeJoy said while the 250-year old-service had made \u201cbeneficial change to what had been an adrift and moribund organization,\u201d more work was necessary \u201cto sustain our positive trajectory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been one of the pleasures of my life and a crowning achievement of my career to have been associated with this cherished institution,\u201d he added, noting that Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take the reins until the USPS Board of Governors names a permanent successor. A statement from USPS said there is no \u201cestablished timeline\u201d for the announcement of DeJoy\u2019s replacement.\n\nDeJoy, who was appointed postmaster general as the agency struggled to survive financial woes from the Covid-19 pandemic, announced plans to step down in February.\n\nThe former businessman and GOP donor led the agency through the coronavirus pandemic and two high-turnout presidential elections that saw surges in mail-in ballots. He has sought to modernize the service, unveiling a 10-year plan in 2021 to stem ongoing losses.\n\nSome of his plans drew criticism, with many claiming that his efforts to consolidate deliveries ultimately slowed them down.\n\nHe also advocated for raising the postage rates, saying in 2022 that Americans should get used to \u201cuncomfortable\u201d rate increases to help get the agency, which is self-funded, on better financial footing. A First-Class domestic postage stamp for a standard sized envelope is currently $0.73, up from $0.55, when DeJoy arrived at the agency.\n\nWhile the USPS is four years into a reorganization initiative designed to cut costs and improve efficiency, President Donald Trump has said he wants to see more changes. He has floated plans to give Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick oversight of the agency, which is currently overseen by its board of governors, not a Cabinet secretary.\n\n\u201cWell, we want to have a post office that works well and doesn\u2019t lose massive amounts of money, and we\u2019re thinking about doing that, and it will be a form of a merger,\u201d Trump said at Lutnick\u2019s swearing-in ceremony on February 21, days after DeJoy said he would resign. \u201cIt\u2019ll remain the Postal Service, and I think it\u2019ll operate a lot better than it has been over the years.\u201d\n\nThe move could be a first step towards privatization \u2013 a change tech billionaire and White House adviser Elon Musk called for earlier this month.\n\nDays later, DeJoy told Congress that he had signed an agreement to let Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency work with the Postal Service. The agency, DeJoy said, will focus on improving the management of USPS retirement assets and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Program, which he argued have been \u201cmismanaged.\u201d\n\nRoughly 30,000 employees have been cut from the agency since 2021, and there are plans to slash another 10,000 people through a voluntary early retirement program, he added. The agency currently employs approximately 635,000 workers across the US.\n\nMark Dimondstein, the leader of the the American Postal Workers Union, encouraged the USPS to ensure that its next postmaster general is opposed to privatization as he warned of \u201ca White House intent on breaking up and selling off the public United States Postal Service.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, and I will say it again, this attack on the USPS is part of the ongoing coup by oligarchs against the vital public services APWU members and other public servants provide to the country,\u201d he added. \u201cPrivatized postal services will lead to higher postage prices, and a lower quality of service to the public.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Gabe Cohen contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "A network of progressive non-profits has quietly spent years pushing the IRS\u2019s new \u201cDirect File\u201d service.\n\nProgressive supporters of Direct File claim to advocate for low-income taxpayers. Research shows that key organizations promoting Direct File are closely tied to Arabella Advisors and its billion-dollar network of left-leaning dark money groups.\n\nOne Arabella-backed organization, the Economic Security Project (ESP), has funded advertising and research in support of Direct File. Last year, the group received a $752,197 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to \u201cconduct research on the impact and usage\u201d of Direct File.\n\nThat work culminated in a media blitz encouraging largely low-income taxpayers to adopt Direct File, which was first made available as a pilot program in 2024 for taxpayers across a dozen states. Last year, the IRS agreed to make the program permanent, but it has since come under fire from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump-appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent agreed to temporarily keep the program through the 2025 tax season, earning him praise from progressive groups including ESP.\n\nESP is fiscally sponsored by the Hopewell Fund, a nonprofit managed by Arabella Advisors. The arrangement allows ESP to operate as a project of the Hopewell Fund, taking advantage of Hopewell\u2019s nonprofit status without having to register with the IRS or publicly disclose its own finances.\n\nESP\u2019s goal isn\u2019t simply to make filing taxes easier. Adam Ruben, a former aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) who is now managing outreach for the group, called Direct File \u201c[o]ne of the best tools we have to create the infrastructure for guaranteed income in this country\u201d and said Direct File \u201cis a huge opportunity for economic security and racial equity.\u201d\n\nGroundwork Collaborative, another non-profit receiving funding through the Arabella Network, has led its own media blitz supporting Direct File. Groundwork Action, the group\u2019s advocacy arm, funded a \u201cBetter IRS\u201d ad campaign promoting direct file and attacking private-sector tax preparers. Like ESP, Groundwork is led by a former policy advisor to Elizabeth Warren.\n\nESP and Groundwork help fund and operate The Coalition for Free and Fair Filing, which \u201csupports the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s efforts to create a free online direct tax filing tool,\u201d according to the group\u2019s website. \u201cThe coalition is composed of organizations committed to racial and economic justice, consumer protection, the advancement of civic technology and the promotion of equity in tax administration.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Direct File frame it, in part, as an effort to help low-income tax filers and also as a better way to ensure collection of higher tax revenues by the IRS.\n\nCritics of Direct File highlight the inherent conflict of interest in having the IRS prepare people\u2019s tax returns. Last year, a group of Republican Senators challenged the IRS\u2019s ability to unilaterally launch such a program, saying \u201c[s]erious legal questions exist about the IRS Direct File launch,\u201d which was undertaken without Congressional approval.\n\nThe IRS initially received funding for a pilot program for an in-house tax filing tool through the Inflation Reduction Act. Last year, Direct File was made available to users in 12 states. For 2025, availability has expanded to 32 million taxpayers in 25 states.\n\nJacob McLeod is a researcher and writer focusing primarily on corruption in politics."

            "full_content": "The death of former U.S. Rep. Mia Love has brought renewed attention to an aggressive form of brain cancer that killed her at age 49\n\nWhat is glioblastoma, the aggressive brain cancer that killed former US Rep. Mia Love?\n\nSALT LAKE CITY -- The death Sunday of former U.S. Rep. Mia Love, the first Black Republican woman elected to the U.S. House, has brought renewed attention to an aggressive form of brain cancer that killed her at age 49.\n\nThe former lawmaker from Utah had undergone treatment for glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumor, and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial. Her daughter said earlier this month that she was no longer responding to treatment.\n\nLove died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement shared by the family.\n\nLove, born Ludmya Bourdeau, was a daughter of Haitian immigrants and a pioneering Republican congresswoman who represented Utah on Capitol Hill from 2015 to 2019.\n\nShe entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City, and later became the city\u2019s mayor. While in that role, Love spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention and drew rousing cheers with her criticisms of then-President Barack Obama.\n\nThat year, she narrowly lost a bid for the House against the Democratic incumbent. She ran again two years later and defeated a first-time candidate by about 7,500 votes, becoming the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress.\n\nLove was briefly considered a rising star in the GOP, but her power within the party petered out as President Donald Trump took hold. Love kept her distance from Trump and called him out in 2018 for vulgar comments he made about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations. Later that year, she lost in the midterm elections as Democrats surged.\n\nLove was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2022. She said her doctors estimated she had only 10-15 months to live, but she surpassed that.\n\nShe described during a speaking engagement in Salt Lake City how she discovered the tumor. Love said she was on vacation with her family and developed a bad headache when the plane landed. When she went to the beach, the sun\u2019s reflection on the water made her headache unbearable. Her husband brought her to the hospital, and a series of X-rays revealed a tumor in her brain.\n\nLove rushed home to Utah and had surgery to remove about 95% of the tumor. Biopsy results revealed it was cancerous and likely to spread to surrounding brain tissue.\n\nShe entered a clinical trial at Duke University's Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center in Durham, North Carolina, that involved using her body\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor. At first, the tumor shrank, but eventually it stopped responding to treatments.\n\n\u201cGlioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor that's known to mankind, and there is no cure for it,\u201d said Dr. Yasmeen Rauf, a neuro-oncologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who treats the disease. \u201cIt keeps mutating. No matter what you do, it always comes back.\u201d\n\nA glioblastoma is a fast-growing glioma, a type of tumor that arises from glial cells, which protect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nWhile there is no known cure, aggressive treatments such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and other targeted therapies may slow the growth of the tumor. Even if a surgeon is able to remove all that can be seen, Rauf said there are typically still some tumor cells left in the brain that cannot be seen and will multiply quickly.\n\nAbout 13,000 Americans are diagnosed with glioblastoma each year, accounting for almost half of all cancerous brain tumors, according to the Cleveland Clinic. More than 10,000 people in the U.S. will succumb to the disease every year, the National Brain Tumor Society reports.\n\nGlioblastoma can occur at any age but is more commonly found in older adults. The average age at diagnosis is 64.\n\nIt's the same type of brain cancer that killed former President Joe Biden's son Beau Biden in 2015 and Sen. John McCain in 2018.\n\nResearchers have not found a way to prevent glioblastoma, and the cause of most of these tumors is unknown. Glioblastoma occurs when glial cells in the brain or spinal cord mutate, altering their genetic makeup.\n\nIt does not run in families, and you won't pass it on to your children, Rauf explained.\n\nPeople who have been exposed to significant amounts of radiation have an increased risk of developing glioblastoma.\n\nPeople diagnosed with glioblastoma typically have about 15-18 months to live, with only a 10% chance of survival after five years, according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nWith aggressive treatments, Love lived for about three years after receiving her diagnosis.\n\n\u201cMy life has been extended by exceptional medical care, science and extraordinary professionals who have become dear friends,\u201d Love wrote in a recent op-ed in the Deseret News. \u201cMy extra season of life has also been the result of the faith and prayers of countless friends, known and unknown.\""

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Justice Department pressed a federal appeals court on Monday to lift a judge\u2019s temporary block against President Donald Trump\u2019s use of a sweeping wartime authority to quickly deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n\nThe nearly hour-long hearing before the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals was the latest front in what has become a bitter fight between the administration and the targets of a proclamation Trump signed earlier this month invoking the Alien Enemies Act to summarily remove them from the US.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the three-judge panel considering the Trump administration\u2019s request to put on hold a pair of lower-court orders will rule, or how quickly that ruling will come.\n\nTwo members of the panel \u2013 one liberal, one conservative \u2013 peppered attorneys for both sides with a series of questions on various issues central to the case, including whether the individuals subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation lacked any due process rights that would give them a chance to defend against claims that they are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2013 and what the appropriate place for such complaints to be raised is.\n\nBut one member of the panel \u2013 Judge Karen Henderson, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush \u2013 did not ask any questions during the proceedings.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the appeals court hearing:\n\nJudge: \u2018Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act\u2019\n\nJudge Patricia Millett, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, was the most active member of the panel on Monday, starting her line of questioning before Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign could even finish his opening arguments. Throughout the hearing, Millett voiced her concern with how Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act deprived those targeted by the president with any due process rights to challenge the government\u2019s allegation that they\u2019re members of the gang.\n\nAt one point, Millett went so far as to say that Nazis removed from the US decades ago under the wartime authority were afforded more rights than the foreign nationals challenging Trump\u2019s novel use of the law.\n\n\u201cThere were planeloads of people \u2013 there were no procedures in place to notify people,\u201d Millett said, referring to two deportation flights the administration allowed to continue earlier this month after Trump invoked the law.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Honig on what stood out to him in appeals hearing over Trump's 'alien enemy' deportations 02:42 - Source: CNN Honig on what stood out to him in appeals hearing over Trump's 'alien enemy' deportations 02:42\n\n\u201cNazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they had hearing boards, before people were removed. And yet here, there\u2019s nothing in there about hearing boards. There are no regulations, and nothing was adopted by the agency officials that were administering this. People weren\u2019t given notice \u2013 they weren\u2019t told where they were going.\u201d\n\nLater, when pressed by Millett about whether the DOJ agrees that the accused gang members are \u201centitled to notice that they are being removed based\u201d on their classification as alleged gang members, Ensign said he didn\u2019t think that was necessary.\n\n\u201cYour honor, we don\u2019t agree to the notice point,\u201d he told Millett. \u201cWe agree that if you bring habeas (complaints) you can raise such challenges.\u201d\n\nTrump appointee seizes on DOJ argument\n\nJudge Justin Walker, who was put on the bench by Trump during his first term, appeared to agree that the individuals challenging the president\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act deserved a chance to challenge their removal under the act, but seemed less persuaded that the wholesale challenge to Trump\u2019s proclamation could be brought and reviewed by the federal court in Washington under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nInstead, Walker repeatedly indicated that he believed the individuals singled out for deportation under the AEA should be able to funnel their removal challenges through habeas complaints brought in the district courts where they\u2019re being detained.\n\nThe argument is one also being pushed the Trump administration.\n\nAt one point the judge said that the claims being raised by some migrants that they\u2019re not members of Tren de Aragua can be made \u2013 just in the \u201cright\u201d court and \u201cthe right court is in Texas, not here.\u201d\n\nBut Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the challengers, said that wouldn\u2019t be a workable solution since if the orders from US District Judge James Boasberg are lifted, his clients would be loaded on to planes and removed from the US with no time for them to raise such claims.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear, Gelernt said, where everyone is who would be subject to such orders.\n\nChallengers want a more orderly process\n\nIn trying to persuade the appeals court to keep the block in place, Gelernt also argued that doing so would let the litigation continue to unfold before the district court, allowing the factual record to be more fully developed for when the case lands back before the intermediate court.\n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented move to use the Alien Enemies Act for only the fourth time in our country\u2019s history without a declared war,\u201d Gelernt said at one point, adding that Boasberg is saying to \u201cpreserve the status quo until we can find all the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think what we\u2019re going to show in the district court is that many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the people removed had no connection to the gang,\u201d Gelernt said.\n\nGelernt went on to say that the case was still in an early phase and that more facts were likely to emerge in coming days that, he argued, would ultimately buttress their case. If the appeals court allowed the administration to proceed with the deportations, all that work could be erased.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Sister searches for answers after her brother was deported to El Salvador 03:13 - Source: CNN Sister searches for answers after her brother was deported to El Salvador 03:13\n\nHe also argued, more broadly, that the orders at issue on Monday were not appealable in the first place. Temporary restraining orders are generally unappealable, as opposed to preliminary injunctions, which are regularly appealed to federal circuit courts.\n\nEarlier Monday, Boasberg told Gelernt and his colleagues that if they wanted to convert his orders to preliminary injunctions, they must inform him of their decision by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to move on a preliminary injunction very quickly,\u201d he told the appeals court. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back here \u2013 no doubt.\u201d\n\nWhat comes next\n\nRegardless of how the appeals court rules, it\u2019s likely the decision will be appealed to the Supreme Court by the losing side.\n\nWalker at one point asked Gelernt whether they should put their eventual decision on hold to give the losing side a chance to seek the high court\u2019s intervention before it goes into effect: In other words, should the appeals court be mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s role in all of this?\n\n\u201cIf that were going to happen and you were going to rule for the government on this then I would hope that your honors would give us time to seek a stay at the Supreme Court without allowing everyone to be put on a plane to El Salvador in the interim,\u201d Gelernt replied.\n\nBoasberg\u2019s orders are set to expire on Saturday."

And Democratic pollsters fret that if liberal politicians, in particular, do not address these issues, the party is at risk of losing more men to the GOP.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump talks about fixing the economy and being strong, they hear someone who gets it,\u201d said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, and an adviser to Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they trust him. But it does mean he\u2019s speaking to their reality in a way most Democrats aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer hopes to boost men's enrollment in higher education and skills training. Matt Rourke / AP file\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kamala Harris often spoke about issues of importance to women, emphasizing reproductive rights, for instance, and paid family leave policies. But soul-searching over her loss has prompted Democrats to reach out more aggressively to men, by engaging more with sports, for instance, and looking for ways to make the party seem less \u201cuncool\u201d to young voters. Shauna Daly, a Democratic strategist and co-founder of the Young Men Research Project, said candidates need to do more than show young men that they can hang. \u201cWhere the Democratic Party has really fallen short with this cohort is that they don\u2019t feel like Democrats are fighting for them,\u201d she said.\n\nThey need policies like those the governors have proposed, Daly said, that address men's tangible problems.\n\nIn every state, women earn more college degrees than men. Boys are more likely to be disciplined in class, and less likely to graduate high school on time than girls. Men die by suicide at higher rates than women and are more likely to rely on illicit drugs and alcohol. And while women increasingly participate in the workforce at higher rates, men have steadily dropped out of the labor market.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont launched a plan to help more men enter the teaching profession and serve as mentors. Jessica Hill / AP file\n\nThe governors\u2019 speeches touched on many of these issues, and earned cautious applause from masculinity researchers, who said they reflected a promising shift. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of a growing recognition among Democrats that neglecting the problems of boys and men is neither good policy nor good politics,\u201d said Richard Reeves, founder of the American Institute for Boys and Men, who has informally advised Moore\u2019s staff. \u201cIf Democrats weren\u2019t thinking about male voters, and especially young male voters, then it would be a pretty serious dereliction of duty, looking at the polls.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Democrats might have been wary of targeting programs toward boys and men for fear of excluding girls. Whitmer seemed aware of this dynamic in her speech, when she followed her announcement about young men with a shoutout to women and a vow not to abandon her \u201ccommitment to equal opportunity and dignity for everyone.\u201d\n\nA handful of other states, including some run by Republican governors, have already launched initiatives targeting men in recent years. Utah established a task force that aims to help \u201cmen and boys lead flourishing lives,\u201d and North Dakota created the position of a men\u2019s health coordinator to study and raise awareness of disparities affecting men.\n\nMoore said he was partly inspired by his own experience growing up in the Bronx after his father passed. He has described how troubles in his youth \u2014 including a brush with the police for vandalism, skipping school and getting poor grades \u2014 led his mother to send him away to military school, which he credits with helping him straighten up. \u201cIt is very personal for me, because I was one of those young men and boys that we\u2019re trying to reach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I felt like so many of the conversations that were being had about me were not being had with me.\u201d\n\nMoore will hold a cabinet meeting in April to discuss plans for the state agencies, but he has some initial goals: to encourage more men in his state to pursue jobs in education and health care, help boys within the juvenile justice system, and make sure he solicits input from boys and men on how the initiatives are designed.\n\nFor Della Volpe, from the Harvard Kennedy School, the governors\u2019 announcements are encouraging. \u201cThe truth is, young men are speaking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been telling us they want respect, opportunity, and strength. If Democrats don\u2019t listen \u2014 and act \u2014 they\u2019ll keep losing ground. But this moment offers hope.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Monday! We hope your brackets are intact after this weekend. (If you picked the favorites, you\u2019re probably in good shape.)\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we dive into the fallout over a journalist appearing to have been accidentally added to a group chat among Trump administration officials about U.S. plans to strike Houthis in Yemen. Plus, with the shutdown fight behind them, Sahil Kapur lays out the key hurdles Republicans in Congress must now clear to pass a massive bill to enact the president\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe Trump administration is reviewing how its national security team sent war plans to a magazine editor\n\nThe White House said it was reviewing how the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine could have accidentally been added to a group text where people who appeared to be members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration discussed plans to launch airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen, Kelly O\u2019Donnell and Daniel Arkin report.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\u201d the National Security Council said in a statement to NBC News.\n\nThe statement came in response to an article published Monday by The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran national security and foreign affairs journalist. Goldberg reported he had been added to a group chat called \u201cHouthi PC small group\u201d on March 13 via Signal, an encrypted messaging service widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications.\n\nGoldberg reported that he went on to receive a series of messages on Signal that appeared to come from Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and other prominent officials in the Trump administration.\n\nGoldberg reported that he exited the Signal group after he personally concluded it was \u201calmost certainly real.\u201d\n\nHow Trump responded: Trump claimed he had no knowledge of the matter, telling a reporter in the Oval Office: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me about it for the first time.\u201d\n\nHow Democrats are responding: Democrats were quick to sharply criticize the Trump administration.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said: \u201cEvery single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime \u2014 even if accidentally \u2014 that would normally involve a jail sentence.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for \u201ca full investigation into how this happened, the damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future.\u201d Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., blasted the episode as \u201camateur hour.\u201d\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, who drew intense criticism from Republicans for her use of a private email server, tweeted a screenshot of The Atlantic article with a simple message: \u201c\ud83d\udc40 You have got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\nHow Republicans are responding: Republicans have so far been more muted in their response. At least one GOP member of Congress chided Trump\u2019s national security team.\n\n\u201cClassified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\u201d said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. \u201cSafeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the administration is \u201caddressing\u201d the situation and has acknowledged \u201cit was a mistake,\u201d adding that he expects the White House to \u201ctighten up and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\n4 hurdles facing Republicans as they shift focus to a bill to pass Trump's agenda\n\nBy Sahil Kapur\n\nCongress is back after weeklong recess with Republicans planning to shift focus to a party-line bill to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar agenda after having dispensed with a separate government funding deadline.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has set a target of passing the legislation through the House in April before the Easter recess, which leaves Republicans in the House with three weeks \u2014 and a lot of work. And then the bill would go to the Senate, which has a different idea of how to proceed.\n\nHere are four hurdles they face.\n\nMedicaid cuts: A recent analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it\u2019s mathematically impossible for House Republicans to meet their own budget targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nPursuing hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts would put swing-district Republicans in a politically precarious position. But abandoning those cuts would anger hard-line conservatives who voted for the budget blueprint to begin the process because they were promised steep spending reductions.\n\nA $4.6 trillion asterisk? Extending Trump\u2019s expiring 2017 tax cuts would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the CBO. And that\u2019s before tackling Trump\u2019s other pursuits, like ending taxes on tips and overtime pay.\n\nTo get around the problem, Republicans are considering a far-reaching accounting change to hide the deficit impact, known as \u201ccurrent policy baseline,\u201d instead of \u201ccurrent law baseline,\u201d which would treat the cost of making Trump\u2019s tax cuts permanent as $0. Democrats are preparing to fight that with the parliamentarian, the in-house referee overseeing the reconciliation process.\n\nHouse-Senate divide: The two chambers adopted conflicting budget resolutions before Trump sided with the House version. On Monday, House GOP leaders called on the Senate to adopt the House measure. But Republican senators are waiting to see whether the House can deliver on the actual bill. Despite the paper-thin House majority, senators are in no mood to let the House dictate the outcome.\n\nDebt limit: The exact date by which Congress will need to act to raise the debt ceiling this year is still unknown. House lawmakers\u2019 budget plan called for a $4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, but they need to pass the reconciliation bill to make it official. That means they\u2019ll have to send the legislation to Trump\u2019s desk before the deadline or risk economic calamity.\n\nRead more from Sahil \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \u27a1\ufe0f Latest from Gaza: Israel is ramping up the risk of \u201call out war\u201d in Gaza as it escalates a renewed bombing campaign .

            "full_content": "Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s not often that the U.S. Supreme Court sees a lawsuit that directly invites it to overturn a long-established precedent. So given the overall atmosphere of authoritarianism and Donald Trump\u2019s very specific and long-standing interest in muzzling media criticism, many legal eagles trembled when Las Vegas casino mogul and Trump donor Steve Wynn petitioned the Court to reverse New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark 1964 decision that insulated the press from libel suits over good-faith criticism of public figures. More specifically, Wynn objected to a Nevada law incorporating the Sullivan standard that requires \u201cclear and compelling evidence\u201d of \u201cactual malice\u201d in libel suits involving public figures. Wynn felt this denied him the right to a jury trial over his claims against the Associated Press for accusing him of sexual misconduct without (he claims) sufficient evidence.\n\nThere were signs that at least two Supreme Court justices were ready to take the plunge on a review of Sullivan, as Adam Liptak observed when Wynn\u2019s petition was filed:\n\nStarting in 2019, Justice Clarence Thomas has repeatedly called for the Supreme Court to reconsider New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark First Amendment decision that made it hard for public officials to prevail in libel suits.\n\nThat project gained momentum in 2021, when Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said the decision \u201chas evolved into an ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods by means and on a scale previously unimaginable.\u201d\n\nCertainly, there was interest in the White House in determining if there was now broader interest among Court conservatives for helping the president activate his repeated threats to \u201copen up the libel laws\u201d to enable legal harassment of his media critics. Trump, as is very well known, was famed for using litigation to intimidate and even bankrupt his adversaries long before he ever ran for public office.\n\nBut now, the Supreme Court has dismissed Wynn\u2019s petition without dissent or comment. The unanimity was the most surprising development, as MSNBC\u2019s Jordan Rubin explained:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising that the court rejected Wynn\u2019s petition. It takes four justices to grant review. What was less clear heading into Monday was whether any of the justices would dissent from the denial. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 two of the court\u2019s six GOP-appointed justices \u2014 have previously questioned the Sullivan precedent, but they didn\u2019t do so on Monday. That doesn\u2019t mean their views have changed or that the precedent will stay on the books forever as challenges to it continue. But Wynn\u2019s rejection is the latest evidence that it isn\u2019t immediately at risk at the high court.\n\nSo it appears Thomas and Gorsuch haven\u2019t made enough progress toward undermining Sullivan among their colleagues to even merit a squawk in this case. This deafening silence represents extraordinarily good news for media folk who have wondered if they will soon get the same sort of harsh treatment being meted out to federal employees and contractors, not to mention noncitizens who thought they had permanent-resident status, at the hands of the second Trump administration. The 47th president may still freak out journalists by singling them out for abuse on Truth Social, and Elon Musk\u2019s vast troll army may menace them on X. But odds are they won\u2019t be hauled into court for saying the emperor has no clothes."

Circuit heard arguments from the Trump administration in its emergency appeal of a lower court ruling, which temporarily blocked its use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nDuring the hearing Monday, Judge Patricia Millett grilled Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign over the timing of the deportations, which sent at least 261 migrants to El Salvador, including more than 100 Venezuelan nationals who were subject to removal \"solely on the basis\" of the law temporarily blocked by the court.\n\n\"The point here was that there were planeloads of people,\" Millett told him. \"There were no procedures in place to notify people.\"\n\n'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO\n\n\n\n\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act than has happened here,\" she said, noting, \"They had hearing boards before people were removed.\"\n\nMillett pressed Ensign over whether the individuals deported under the law had any time to seek relief or challenge their status as a member of the gang in the form of a habeas petition before they were deported.\n\nJUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA\n\nThe government's position was not immediately clear, though Ensign noted they disagreed with the contention that Nazis got better treatment.\n\nCongress passed the Alien Enemies Act immigration law in 1798, and it has since been used only several times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the appeals court plans to issue its ruling.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

Yerlikaya also alleged that weapons were seized during the protests and the individuals detained were found to have ties to different terrorist organizations and prior criminal records.\n\nSome experts believe the move was orchestrated by Erdo\u011fan to sideline the opposition, silence political dissent and increase his own power.\n\n\"This is a dark time for democracy in Turkey, with such a blatantly lawless move to weaponize the justice system to cancel the democratic process,\" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\nTRUMP UNIQUELY PLACED TO \u2018WHISPER\u2019 IN ERDOGAN\u2019S EAR OVER TURKISH REGIONAL AMBITIONS: GREEK DEFENSE MINISTER\n\nBIPARTISAN LEGISLATION SEEKS TO REIN IN ERDO\u011eAN'S TURKEY OVER TIES TO US FOES\n\nIn an address to celebrate the festival of Nowruz on Friday, Erdo\u011fan said Turkey was not a country that was found on the street and will not submit to street terrorism.\n\n\"We will not allow public order to be damaged. We will not give in to vandalism or street terrorism,\" Erdo\u011fan said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) held a symbolic primary vote over the weekend and nominated \u0130mamo\u011flu to be the party\u2019s candidate for president to face Erdo\u011fan in the 2028 elections.\n\nDespite the increased repression and threats to their own safety and security, the Turkish opposition does not yet seem to be backing down.\n\n\"We, as the main opposition party that emerged as the first party in the last local elections in March 2024, will stand firm and resist any kind of oppression by the government,\" \u0130lhan Uzgel, CHP Deputy Chairman for Foreign Policy, told Fox News Digital.\n\nUzgel said Erdo\u011fan seems frightened of losing power, and is urging opposition supporters to take to the streets to defend democracy, challenge lawlessness, and challenge the Erdo\u011fan government's abuse of power.\n\n\"We are happy to see that our people take to the streets despite the occasional use of force by the riot police, and demonstrate peacefully, which is a constitutional right,\" he added.\n\nImamoglu, who is presently jailed and is awaiting trial on corruption charges, was viewed as the most serious challenger to the decades-long rule of Erdo\u011fan. His detention will likely keep him out of the political opposition for the foreseeable future, dealing a huge blow to Turkey\u2019s pro-democracy movement.\n\nTol of the Middle East Institute said Erdo\u011fan is banking on people\u2019s anger dissipating over time and that the mass protests will eventually die down. The election is not scheduled until 2028, and people, Erdo\u011fan hopes, will most likely forget and move on.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe danger, according to Tol, is that street protests in the Middle East and elsewhere tend to go in many different directions, and there is no telling how long the public anger over the arrests will last and how much more popular support the movement will gain.\n\n\u0130mamo\u011flu, member of the secular Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019 and re-elected in 2023. In both elections, he defeated Erdo\u011fan-backed opponents.\n\nTurkey\u2019s problems come at a time when President Trump is reportedly considering lifting sanctions on the NATO member and resuming the sale of F-35 fighter jets following a recent phone call with Erdo\u011fan.\n\nReuters contributed to this article."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS officials reacted with shock\u2014 and in many cases, horror \u2014 to revelations in The Atlantic that top members of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet sent detailed operational plans and other likely highly classified information about US military strikes on Yemen to a group thread on a messaging app to which a reporter had accidentally been added.\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledged the messages, sent over the nongovernment encrypted chat app Signal, seem to be authentic without offering any explanation for why senior officials were discussing national defense information outside of approved classified government systems.\n\nAlmost immediately, senior officials scrambled behind the scenes to review the use of Signal amid concerns that Trump administration officials are relying too heavily on it to conduct sensitive government work \u2013 posing a potentially grave risk to US national security, current and former officials said.\n\nAs soon as the story published, it was blasted out in multiple text threads throughout the Trump administration, with officials reacting with disbelief, according to those who spoke to CNN privately.\n\nMultiple administration officials told CNN they were shocked, with at least two speculating that this could result in the dismissal of one of their colleagues.\n\nAnd career national security officials expressed deep dismay to CNN, noting that having such sensitive conversations on an unclassified platform risked exposing the information to foreign hackers \u2013 and that any other employee who had done so would almost certainly have been immediately fired and probably referred for prosecution.\n\nAccording to the Atlantic, national security adviser Mike Waltz earlier this month convened a text conversation with top US officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to discuss strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen who had been threatening international shipping in the Red Sea. Waltz, apparently accidentally, added Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the chain.\n\nThe messages started with a discussion about when the action should be launched while Goldberg followed along. The strikes were carried out and the principals congratulated themselves on a job well done during a brief after-action discussion before Goldberg removed himself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Jeffrey Goldberg describes moment he realized Trump cabinet group chat about military strikes \u2018might be real\u2019 01:24 - Source: CNN Jeffrey Goldberg describes moment he realized Trump cabinet group chat about military strikes \u2018might be real\u2019 01:24\n\n\u201cDear Sweet Baby Jesus,\u201d said one former senior US official, reacting to the reporting.\n\nHegseth \u2013 who, according to The Atlantic, sent \u201coperational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen\u201d during the course of the conversation \u2013 denied on Monday evening that war plans were discussed over text, despite the Trump administration\u2019s earlier acknowledgement that the messages appeared authentic.\n\n\u201cNobody was texting war plans and that\u2019s all I have to say about that,\u201d Hegseth told reporters when asked why those details were inadvertently shared with Goldberg, after landing at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. The defense secretary also took jabs at the journalist, who he described as \u201cdeceitful and highly discredited.\u201d\n\nSignal is an encrypted messaging app that is popular around the world, including among journalists and government officials. Biden administration officials also routinely used it to discuss logistical planning for meetings and at times to communicate with foreign counterparts.\n\nBut the use of Signal to discuss planning for military operations \u2013 among the most closely guarded secrets the United States has in part because of the potential impact on American service members\u2019 lives \u2013 is a shocking risk to national security, current and former officials said. Multiple officials said they could recall no instance in which Signal was used to communicate classified information or discuss military operations. The top officials on the group chat have access to classified communications systems \u2013 including secure lines in their cars, according to one former senior official \u2013 and they have staff whose job it is to ensure communications of sensitive information remains secure.\n\n\u201cThey broke every procedure known to man about protecting operational material before a military strike,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official. \u201cYou have a total breakdown in security about a military operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d another said, flatly, when asked if there was any analogous use of the app during the Biden administration.\n\nEven as Trump\u2019s press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that he had the \u201cutmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz,\u201d a sense of concern was palpable inside the West Wing and across key agencies as questions emerged over whether new guidance or rules should be put in place for internal communications.\n\n\u201cEveryone is on Signal, all day and night,\u201d one official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations in the West Wing. \u201cThat may well change.\u201d\n\nTrust in the security of Signal is bolstered by the fact that the app is open-source, meaning its code is available for independent experts to scrutinize for vulnerabilities. But like any messaging app with high-value targets, state-backed hackers have tried to find a way into Signal chats \u2013 leaving open the possibility that it may be vulnerable to prying eyes.\n\nA report last month from Google-owned security firm Mandiant found that Russian-linked spies had tried to break into the Signal accounts of Ukrainian military personnel by posing as trusted Signal contacts.\n\nFor now, Trump has given no indication that he plans to fire anyone over the matter. He expressed surprise when asked about the story, telling reporters Monday afternoon, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it. I\u2019m not a big fan of The Atlantic. It\u2019s, to me, it\u2019s a magazine that\u2019s going out of business. I think it\u2019s not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\u201d\n\nBut several Trump administration officials noted that not only was the move seen as a major unforced error with serious national security implications, Trump holds a personal disdain for Goldberg, adding insult to injury in the matter.\n\nWhen the president was briefed Monday afternoon on The Atlantic story, he expressed his contempt for the journalist, two sources familiar with the briefing told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have picked a worse person than Goldberg to add to the chat,\u201d one person close to Trump said.\n\nA mistake that would normally prompt an investigation\n\nUsing a Signal chat to share highly classified information and accidentally including a reporter on the discussion also raises the possibility of violations of federal laws such as the Espionage Act, which makes it a crime to mishandle national defense information. It\u2019s a law that was used in the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of Trump for hoarding classified documents in unauthorized locations such as a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago after leaving his first term.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a mistake such as this would prompt an investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, according to former Justice Department officials.\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely here, in part because some of the top Trump administration officials on the Signal chat would be the ones to ask for such an investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department typically relies on receiving a crime report from the originating agency of the national defense information \u2013 in this case the Defense Department. The senior officials in the discussion also have what\u2019s known as original classification authority, meaning they can downgrade the classification status of the information.\n\nBut if lower-level government officials made a similar mistake, there\u2019s little doubt there would be consequences, including possible loss of their security clearances, current and former officials say. Pentagon regulations specifically state that messaging apps, including Signal, \u201care NOT authorized to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anyone else did it, no question it would be investigated,\u201d a former Justice official said.\n\nThe response amongst Republicans on Capitol Hill was mixed. Sen. John Cornyn, a senior Texas Republican, called it a \u201chuge screw up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there any other way to describe it? I can use a different word but you get the drift,\u201d Cornyn told CNN and other reporters.\n\nHe added: \u201cI would hope the interagency would look at that. It sounds like somebody dropped the ball.\u201d\n\nBut Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson downplayed the significance of the incident, \u201cWhat you did see, though, I think, was top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They\u2019re going to track that down and make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\u2018Somebody needs to get fired\u2019\n\nOver the course of the conversation, Hegseth sent \u201coperational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\u201d according to The Atlantic. Elsewhere in the conversation, CIA Director John Ratcliffe sent \u201cinformation that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\u201d\n\nAll would almost certainly be classified at the highest level, former officials said.\n\n\u201cSomebody needs to get fired,\u201d former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta told CNN. \u201cHow the name of a journalist was added to that list \u2013 this is just a serious blunder,\u201d he said, noting that if it had been someone other Goldberg, they \u201ccould reveal this information immediately to the Houthis in Yemen that they were about to be attacked and they in turn could have\u2026 attacked US facilities in the Red Sea, causing casualties of our troops.\u201d\n\nThe US government has several systems in place to transfer and communicate classified information, including the Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) network and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). Senior government officials, including the defense secretary, vice president, secretary of state, and others have access to these systems at virtually all times, including phones and laptops specifically configured for classified information.\n\nA former senior US defense official said you cannot send secret information from one of these systems to an unclassified network. Hegseth - or someone working for him - would have had to do it manually. The official said this amounts to a blatant mishandling of classified information and an illegal transfer of the material from a classified system to an unclassified network.\n\nHegseth \u201csomehow had to transfer it or copy it to get it onto Signal in the first place,\u201d the official said. \u201cYou can\u2019t forward a classified email to an unclassified system. You would either have to print it out or type it up while looking at both screens. So he had to have done it or somebody would\u2019ve had to have done it for him that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security,\u201d Brian Hughes, National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nVance is quoted in the texts expressing concern about the strikes being a \u201cmistake\u201d and uncertainty that Trump was aware of how strikes on the Houthi rebels would be inconsistent with messaging on Europe.\n\n\u201cI am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There\u2019s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\u201d Vance wrote in the Signal group chat, according to The Atlantic.\n\nTrump administration officials appear to have reacted to that element of the reporting \u2013 not any suggestion that the use of Signal at all for this purpose raised national security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, William Martin, communications director to the vice president, said, \u201cThe Vice President\u2019s first priority is always making sure that the President\u2019s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations. Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration\u2019s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill instantly reacted with outrage, with at least one senior member signaling that he planned to press senior intelligence officials when they appear before Congress at a previously scheduled hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on national security threats on Wednesday. (The same officials, including Ratcliffe, will also appear before a Senate panel on Tuesday.)\n\n\u201cI am horrified by reports that our most senior national security officials, including the heads of multiple agencies, shared sensitive and almost certainly classified information via a commercial messaging application, including imminent war plans,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes, Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, citing the \u201ccalamitous risks of transmitting classified information across unclassified systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf true, these actions are a brazen violation of laws and regulations that exist to protect national security, including the safety of Americans serving in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nSome of the participants in the text chain have in the past railed against the use of nongovernment platforms to conduct sensitive official business.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton put some of the highest, most sensitive intelligence information on her private server because maybe she thinks she\u2019s above the law,\u201d then-Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said at a town hall event in Iowa in 2016. \u201cOr maybe she just wanted the convenience of being able to read this stuff on her Blackberry. This is unacceptable. This is a disqualifier.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Alayna Treene, Josh Campbell, Alex Marquardt, Manu Raju, Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed reporting."

            "full_content": "Trump\u2019s congressional leaders don\u2019t see eye to eye on much. Photo: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nAfter the debacle over Senate passage of a spending bill earlier this month, it\u2019s abundantly clear that congressional Democrats do not have the power to get in the way of Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive 2025 plans. The administration and its own congressional allies now plan to bundle most of his legislative agenda in a budget-reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered, meaning that so long as Republicans stick together, Democrats literally do not have the power to stop it. So far, fear of and loyalty to Trump have kept the GOP in harness on key House and Senate votes.\n\nSo why are the House and Senate moving so slowly toward enactment of that \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d Trump has endorsed? Here\u2019s the problem: The arithmetic of enacting Trump\u2019s tax and spending must-haves without market-terrifying new budget deficits is devilishly difficult, and many small but bright-red devils lurk in the details. The president is famously uninterested in details, so his vague \u201cget it done\u201d injunctions to Republicans on the Hill have not kept them from serious disagreements on those details. The road ahead is long: The House and Senate have passed separate and very different budget resolutions (the blueprint that outlines the numbers and key assumptions behind them) that must be reconciled, and once they are, the House and Senate must pass the same reconciliation bill to send to Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nHere are some of the major issues still dividing them after countless meetings.\n\n.\n\nCongressional budget rules prohibit reconciliation bills that increase the federal budget deficit beyond a ten-year \u201cwindow.\u201d That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s tax cuts in 2017 were designed to expire at the end of 2025. Extending them before year\u2019s end (and adding on tax cuts Trump promised during the 2024 campaign) is the biggest deficit-booster in the whole GOP package this year, and is what\u2019s forcing unpopular domestic-spending cuts. But Senate Republicans, with some private encouragement from the White House, want to make these tax cuts permanent, which would add roughly $4 trillion to the amount of offsetting budget cuts needed to make the arithmetic work out.\n\nSince, if anything, the GOP\u2019s senators are less interested than their House colleagues in deep cuts to popular programs like Medicaid, they came up with a convenient trick: a way of \u201cscoring\u201d tax cuts that makes extending them \u201cfree\u201d from a budget point of view, even though they were very deliberately \u201cscored\u201d as expiring this year when they were enacted.\n\nHouse Republicans didn\u2019t buy this idea in the budget blueprint they passed last month. And deficit-sensitive financial markets (not to mention the Federal Reserve Board) aren\u2019t likely to be fooled, either. Trump will probably have to insist on this crucially important scam if it is to be incorporated in the budget blueprint and the reconciliation bill, and there will definitely be a backlash in the real world that could make it problematic.\n\n.\n\nThe House budget resolution assumes $880 billion in cuts to programs under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee, in which Medicaid looms large. The Senate Budget Committee includes nothing like that level of cuts. House Speaker Mike Johnson has argued that Republicans won\u2019t cut Medicaid benefits, but would go after that familiar phantom menace: \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d As Congress gets closer to the detailed provisions of a reconciliation bill, how cuts will affect actual Medicaid benefits will become clearer and more controversial. And while many Senate Republicans and House members from marginal districts are reluctant to cut Medicaid, the powerful deficit hawks of the House Freedom Caucus are avid for such cuts. Something has to give.\n\n.\n\nCurrent estimates are that the federal government will reach the limit of its borrowing authority (a.k.a. the \u201cdebt limit\u201d) at some point between July and October of this year. A vote to increase or suspend the debt limit is always controversial, particularly for fiscal hawks, some of whom are proud of never having backed such a step. The public isn\u2019t crazy about authorizing new public debt either, although support for the kind of budget cuts or tax increases necessary to reduce existing debt is limited as well.\n\nAnticipating that his agenda would breach the debt limit, Trump abruptly demanded that a suspension or even an abolition of the debt limit be included in the stopgap spending measure Congress was struggling to enact last December. Trump wanted, you see, for this measure to be enacted before he took office, so that Joe Biden would be forced to sign it and receive the blame. But House Republicans rebelled and the bill required to avoid a Christmas government shutdown did not include the debt provision. So now it needs to happen on Trump\u2019s watch.\n\nThe obvious thing to do is to nestle a debt-limit increase or suspension into the giant reconciliation bill that every Republican will be expected to support as a matter of fealty to the 47th president, and indeed, the House-passed budget resolution provided for that measure. But the Senate\u2019s didn\u2019t, and there remains some nervousness that a few House Freedom Caucus debt warriors won\u2019t ultimately go along, threatening the entire Trump agenda. If Republicans decided to drop it from reconciliation, then they will have to risk the possibility of Senate Democrats filibustering it if it comes up as regular legislation.\n\n.\n\nOne complication that represents a completely unprecedented problem is that even as congressional Republicans crawl toward enacting the major fiscal legislation of 2025, Trump\u2019s minions at DOGE (via \u201cefficiency measures\u201d) and OMB (via plans for impoundment of appropriated funds) are racing ahead with unilateral spending cuts in defiance of congressional prerogatives. Whatever they think privately about this fiscal banditry, congressional Republicans have publicly either praised Elon Musk\u2019s and Russell Vought\u2019s power grabs, or fallen silent. On the one hand, it may be politically useful for GOP elected officials to let Trump and his sidekicks take the blame for some of the more unpopular parts of his agenda. On the other, Musk and Vought cannot give the president tax cuts or direct cuts in entitlement benefits (though they can screw up the administration of programs like Social Security, as DOGE is doing energetically).\n\nWith House and Senate Republicans having enough trouble coordinating their actions with each other, taking full account of what Team Trump is doing without them, even as Trump himself declines to give them detailed instructions on legislation, could make life a living hell for Mike Johnson\u2019s and John Thune\u2019s troops. Democrats may not have the power to stop the Trump locomotive, but they can definitely call attention to all the dysfunction and the damage it is causing."

            "full_content": "CNN staffers feel executive Adam Levine got a raw deal when he was stripped of responsibilities on Friday, only two months after taking one \"for the team\" during a high-profile defamation trial.\n\nLevine, who was CNN\u2019s senior vice president of Washington newsgathering and is now SVP Investigative and Washington News served as CNN\u2019s corporate representative in January during the two-week trial that saw the network settle punitive damages after a jury found it committed defamation against U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young. Levine was the only CNN employee to sit in the Panama City, Florida courtroom for the entire trial, which was seen as an uncomfortable situation for the since-relegated executive.\n\n\"He always takes one for the team\u2026 now this,\" the current staffer told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Adam is one of the smartest editorial leaders and hardest workers at CNN. He has been a true leader during some tumultuous times these last few years,\" they added.\n\nJURY FINDS CNN COMMITTED DEFAMATION AGAINST NAVY VETERAN, SETTLEMENT REACHED ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\nCNN announced changes to its politics unit on Friday. The moves, which were first reported by Status and confirmed by Fox News Digital, include Levine losing supervision of the majority of political coverage from Washington to overseeing only two smaller units.\n\nThe staffer, who said \"many of us\" inside the D.C. bureau feel Levine deserves better, added that there is no animosity toward new SVP Editorial Strategy and News Phil Rucker, who will assume many of Levine\u2019s responsibilities after joining CNN from the Washington Post earlier this year. The CNN employees simply feel Levine is being treated unfairly.\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen him make so many sacrifices for the good of CNN,\" the staffer said, adding that Levine is \"brilliant\" and \"deserves much respect.\"\n\nCNN has given no indication the restructuring is related to the defamation trial.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJanuary\u2019s defamation trial saw a six-person jury rule that CNN defamed Young and was responsible for punitive damages after he successfully alleged the network smeared him by implying he illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan on the \"black market\" during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021.\n\nAs the jury was gearing up to determine punitive damages, 14th Judicial Circuit Court Judge William S. Henry announced that Young and CNN had reached a settlement for the amount that would be awarded to the Navy veteran.\n\nCNN DEFAMATION TRIAL: LOSING CASE EXPECTED BUT STILL A BAD BRUISE FOR THE NETWORK, INSIDER SAYS\n\nThe settlement amount was not disclosed. The settlement announcement came after an expert witness suggested $150 million was a fair amount to punish CNN. During the explosive trial, Levine testified that an on-air apology CNN offered to Young was only issued for legal purposes.\n\n\"We felt in order to resolve the legal discussion at hand, a correction was due, or at least our legal department felt that way, I should say,\" Levine said.\n\nLevine acknowledged that the apology was made in hopes for the network to quash the \"potential for a lawsuit\" by Young, but spent several minutes dodging questions about whether CNN thought Young's concern was \"reasonable\" enough to issue the apology.\n\n\"This was a decision made for legal reasons, and the correction was issued at the direction of our legal department,\" Levine said. \"So, CNN thinks that the decision by the legal department was the right one for the company based on them being our legal department.\"\n\nCNN DEFAMATION JUROR WOULD HAVE AWARDED NAVY VETERAN \u2018UP TO $100 MILLION\u2019 BEFORE SETTLEMENT WAS REACHED\n\nYoung himself believes Levine probably \"expected better\" from CNN after being put in such a tough spot.\n\n\"I imagine he probably feels slighted considering the amount of fire he took for CNN during my trial,\" Young told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"He had to sit there on the witness stand, across from the jury and testify under oath that CNN did nothing wrong, and as their corporate representative he stands behind their story and conduct. He was also put in the impossible position of retracting CNN's apology to me and admitting it was only a legal maneuver to try to mitigate damages,\" Young continued. \"My impression was that Levine was simply toeing CNN's unbelievable narrative during my trial, and he probably expected better treatment for his loyalty, even though his effort to mitigate failed miserably.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital\u2019s Joseph A.

Photo: Christian Klindt Soelbeck/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s expansionist dreams have become a hallmark of his second term. The president continues to advocate for the annexation of Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal despite the strong opposition of the involved citizens and their leaders.\n\nThe administration has announced its plans to send a delegation to Greenland in the coming days, which will include Trump\u2019s national security adviser Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Second Lady Usha Vance. According to the New York Times, Vance is set to make a number of cultural stops, including attending a national dogsled race, while Waltz and Wright are expected to visit a U.S. military base.\n\nIn the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq, outgoing Greenland prime minister Mute Egede blasted the scheduled trip as\ufeff \u201chighly aggressive,\u201d labeling it a clear attempt by the United States to flex its power as Trump threatens to take over the island. \u201cWhat is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,\u201d Egede said, per CNN. \u201cHis mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump\u2019s mission \u2014 and the pressure will increase.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is poised to succeed Egede as prime minister, also rejected Trump\u2019s calls to annex Greenland. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be Americans. No, we don\u2019t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders, and we want our own independence in the future,\u201d Nielsen said, per The Guardian. \u201cAnd we want to build our own country by ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe issue has even united the five political parties in Greenland\u2019s parliament with the leaders issuing a joint statement against Greenland becoming part of the United States. \u201cWe \u2014 all party chairmen \u2014 cannot accept the repeated statements on annexation and control of Greenland,\u201d they said. \u201cWe, as party chairmen, find this conduct unacceptable to friends and allies in a defense alliance.\u201d Residents of Greenland also appear opposed to the administration\u2019s threats of annexation. A January poll found that 85 percent of Greenlanders are against the island becoming a part of the United States with only 6 percent of respondents in favor, according to Reuters.\n\nVance\u2019s visit comes as her husband, Vice-President J.D. Vance, has echoed Trump\u2019s position on Greenland while escalating tensions with Denmark, which controls the territory. In a Fox News interview, Vance accused Denmark of not being a \u201cgood ally\u201d and suggested that controlling Greenland was a matter of national security. \u201cSo you have to ask yourself: How are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security?\u201d the vice-president said, per the Associated Press. \u201cIf that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn\u2019t care about what the Europeans scream at us.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s focus on Greenland dates back to his first term, when he floated the idea of buying the island from Denmark. In January, the president paired his announcement of Ken Howery as his nominee to serve as U.S. ambassador to Denmark with a blunt call for annexation. \u201cFor purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social."

Vance and his best friend and boss, Donald Trump, do not march in lockstep.\n\nIn a jaw-dropping report today from The Atlantic, editor Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that earlier this month he was added to a private Signal chat group with senior Trump officials called \u201cHouthi PC small group.\u201d The members appeared to include Tulsi Gabbard, Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance, and senior representatives across various government agencies. They had gathered to debate the merits of doing some bombing in Yemen. (They then did the bombing, which was when Goldberg realized the group chat was real.)\n\nApart from everything that\u2019s notable about that, also J.D. Vance disagreed with Trump in the group chat. The person who appeared to be Vance wrote that delaying bombing in Yemen might be best:\n\nI am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There\u2019s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\n\nFor ten days now, the U.S. has stepped up bombing Yemen, with the stated goals of preventing further attacks in shipping lanes in the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. (We have low-key been at war with the region since January, 2024; President Biden had also bombed lots of people.) Vance\u2019s point was that, while the U.S. does ship plenty of material through those lanes, it is a small percentage of our total intake, compared to Europe at large. \u201c3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real risk that the public doesn\u2019t understand this or why it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just hate bailing Europe out again,\u201d he added to the person who appeared to be Pete Hegseth, the secretary of Defense.\n\nHegseth agreed that Europe sucks. \u201cI fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It\u2019s PATHETIC,\u201d Hegseth wrote. But, he pointed out, America was the only power that could get it done. A few days ago, Hegseth committed a second Navy carrier group to the region. Bombings will continue until Americans understand we\u2019re doing it for them, not those idiots in Europe."

Photo: Thomas Peipert/AP Photo\n\nBetween bullying America\u2019s allies, harassing federal judges, and acting as an amateur Tesla salesman, Donald Trump has a lot on his plate. But the president took a break from his busy schedule to complain about a portrait of him that\u2019s been hanging in the Colorado State Capitol for five years.\n\nIn a Sunday night Truth Social post, Trump said his portrait in the Colorado State Capitol \u201cwas purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.\u201d\n\nTrump said that the same artist painted Barack Obama and \u201che looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst.\u201d\n\nThe president then attacked the state\u2019s governor, while asking that he do him a favor and take the portrait down. Trump claimed that \u201cmany people from Colorado have called and written to complain,\u201d so \u201cI am speaking on their behalf to the Radical Left Governor, Jared Polis, who is extremely weak on Crime \u2026 to take it down. Jared should be ashamed of himself!\u201d\n\nTrump followed up by posting his two official White House portraits, presumably because he\u2019d prefer that we picture him either smiling and eight years younger, or giving \u201cmenacing AI mug shot\u201d vibes.\n\nTrump did not explain why he\u2019s raising this issue now. Nor did he provide any evidence that people have complained about the painting, or that the artist, Sarah Boardman, \u201cpurposely distorted\u201d his image. The Trump portrait project was already underway when Governor Polis assumed office in January 2019, and it initially didn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d be giving into Trump\u2019s demand. A Polis spokesperson told The Hill:\n\nGov. Polis was surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork. The State Capitol was completed in 1901, and features Rose Onyx and White Yule Marble mined in Colorado, and includes portraits of former Presidents and former governors. We appreciate the President and everyone\u2019s interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience.\n\nBut later in the day the AP reported that the painting is coming down:\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump portrait to be taken down at Colorado Capitol after president claimed it was \"distorted.\" \u2014 Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) March 24, 2025\n\nWhile this certainly isn\u2019t the most flattering portrait, it seems everyone involved was actually trying to treat Trump like a normal president. The effort to add Trump to the state Capitol\u2019s Gallery of Presidents was led and approved by Republican state officials, as 9 News Denver reported:\n\nRepublican-led efforts to get Trump\u2019s painting hung on the Colorado Capitol wall began in the summer of 2018. Republican State Sen. Kevin Grantham raised $10,000 in a few hours on GoFundMe for the portrait.\n\nThe painting, which was approved by Colorado Republicans, was put up in August 2019 at an event hosted by the Colorado Senate Republicans and artist Sarah A. Boardman. The unveiling event was described as nonpartisan in a Facebook post.\n\nNothing on the Colorado-based artist\u2019s website or Facebook page is partisan. And while Trump accused Boardman of making him look much worse than his predecessors, her portraits of Barack Obama and George W. Bush are also a tad jowly:\n\nPresident Obama, 20 x 24 inches, oil on canvas. This was a commission by the State of Denver, and hangs in the State Capitol Building, Rotunda (3rd floor) Gallery of Presidents. Posted by Sarah A. Boardman, Portraits on Thursday, April 5, 2012\n\nThe speeches at the unveiling of Trump\u2019s portrait on August 1, 2019, emphasized unity and bipartisanship. Boardman said she was striving to make Trump look \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy portrait of President Trump has been called thoughtful, non-confrontational, not angry, not happy, not mad, not tweeting,\u201d she said, drawing chuckles from the audience.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason for that is because in today\u2019s environment it\u2019s all very up front. But in five, 10, 15, 20 years, he will be another president on the wall with his own historical background and he needs to look neutral,\u201d she continued.\n\nIronically, during the same event, the Republican state senator who spearheaded the portrait project, Kevin Grantham, said that regardless of political party, the unveiling \u201creminds us of the ideals we hold so dear as Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2019, there are still nations across this globe that are led by those who rule simply by the force and fear they command. Leaders that do not allow dissent and do not allow critique,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether this portrait bring a smile or a scowl to your face, remember that you have the right to do so because this is the United States of America.\u201d\n\nWell, that America was nice while it lasted!\n\nThis post has been updated."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to put on hold a federal judge\u2019s ruling reinstating thousands of probationary federal employees who were fired as part of the government\u2019s efforts to quickly downsize its workforce.\n\nThe emergency appeal is the administration\u2019s latest attempt to get the nation\u2019s highest court to intervene on its behalf as lower courts frustrate \u2013 even on a temporary basis \u2013 key parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term agenda.\n\nIn the case at hand, a federal judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month that required half a dozen federal agencies to \u201cimmediately\u201d offer over 16,000 probationary employees their jobs back.\n\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s extraordinarily overbroad remedy is now inflicting ongoing, irreparable harm on the Executive Branch that warrants this Court\u2019s urgent intervention,\u201d acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers.\n\nHarris went on to say that the ruling from US District Judge William Alsup \u201chas compelled the government to embark on the massive administrative undertaking of reinstating, and onboarding to full duty status, thousands of terminated employees in the span of a few days.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s request comes as the federal appeals court based in San Francisco is considering a similar emergency appeal from the administration. That appeal was filed on March 14.\n\n\u201cEvery additional day the injunction remains in effect is a day that six executive agencies are effectively under the district court\u2019s receivership, necessitating immediate relief from this Court,\u201d Harris argued.\n\nAlsup\u2019s ruling was one of the rare wins for federal labor groups challenging the administration\u2019s efforts to cull its workforce. Though other federal judges declined to stop a wave of firings in the opening weeks of Trump\u2019s second term, Alsup said he was making his decision because he believed the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.\n\n\u201cEach agency had (and still has) discretion to hire and fire its own employees. Here, the agencies were directed by OPM to fire all probationary employees, and they executed that directive. To staunch the irreparable harms to organizational plaintiffs caused by OPM unlawfully slashing other agency\u2019s staff required immediately reinstating those employees,\u201d Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by labor unions and others challenging OPM\u2019s role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.\n\nThe Trump administration has been targeting probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While they generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can if the action stemmed from \u201cpartisan political reasons\u201d or \u201cmarriage status.\u201d\n\nHarris told the high court that \u201csome\u201d of the fired probationary employees have filed complaints with the Office of Special Counsel and argued that Alsup\u2019s ruling ran headfirst into the administrative avenues set up by Congress to address such terminations.\n\n\u201cDeclaring open season on challenges to federal personnel management is especially unsound because Congress has created an entirely different framework for resolving legal challenges to the terminations of federal employees,\u201d she wrote, adding that allowing the unions \u201cto head straight to district court and raise claims that the affected federal employees themselves cannot raise would upend that entire process.\u201d\n\nNorm Eisen, representing the plaintiffs as part of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, said the court will uphold Alsup\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration illegally terminated tens of thousands of federal employees, as duly noted by Judge Alsup,\u201d Eisen said in a statement. \u201cThe administration\u2019s efforts to block relief have so far failed and now they are turning to the Supreme Court \u2013 baselessly.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comment."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 Congress returns Monday from a weeklong recess as the fallout continues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's move to help Republicans advance a controversial spending bill earlier this month to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nAs lawmakers left Washington following many weeks in session, a recess that Democrats initially hoped would be marked by a show of force against the Trump administration and Republican control of Washington was punctuated by handwringing over the party's direction \u2014 and questions about its leadership.\n\nDemocrats remained mum as they left Washington in the aftermath of the tense funding fight. And at town halls from Colorado to California, Democrats sidestepped questions about Schumer's decision and his leadership of the upper chamber more broadly, previewing a messy return to Washington as the party contends with its divisions.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, dodged a question about Schumer being replaced as leader last week, before pivoting to former President Joe Biden and urging that \"it's important for people to know, you know, when it's time to go.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) walks in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol on March 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images\n\n\"We're going to have conversations I'm sure in the foreseeable future about all the Democratic leadership,\" Bennet said at a town hall in Golden, Colorado.\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland became the first Democratic lawmaker to openly call for new Senate leadership at a town hall last week, saying that though he respects Schumer and his long tenure in Washington, \"it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward.\" Rep. Delia Ramirez followed suit at a town hall in Chicago last week. And progressive youth groups joined in on the criticism, urging Schumer in a letter obtained by CBS News to \"fight for us or step aside.\"\n\nStill, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who initially opted not to comment when asked whether he was confident in Schumer's leadership, weighed in with support for Schumer last week. And Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi echoed the confidence in Schumer's leadership, though she delivered a stinging rebuke.\n\n\"I myself don't give away anything for nothing,\" Pelosi said. \"And I think that's what happened the other day.\"\n\nSchumer had initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded after the House passed the measure in a narrow vote that came as a surprise to some. But a day later, Schumer reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage.\n\nThe New York Democrat has stood by his decision, while arguing that he remains the \"best leader for the Senate.\" He told \"CBS Mornings\" last week that as bad as the founding bill was, \"a shutdown is 10 times worse.\" On Sunday, he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he's not stepping down.\n\nThe backlash against Schumer has come as Democrats contend with the party's direction and approach more broadly after the 2024 elections delivered bruising defeats up and down the ballot.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, shifted the blame away from Schumer, saying on CNN last week that although \"no one is in the caucus\" is more critical of the minority leader than he is, \"it's not Schumer\u2026 it's the Democratic party.\"\n\nLater in the week, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez held a rally in Las Vegas. In an interview with CBS News at the rally, the Vermont independent said the \"Democratic party has not been the kind of party we need to represent the working class of this country in so many ways.\"\n\n\"There is no reason why we have massive income and wealth inequality, why we're the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,\" Sanders added.\n\nAcross a number of town halls last week, constituents turned the focus from possible threats to Medicaid under GOP control of Washington to criticism of the Democratic Party itself.\n\nDuring a town hall held by Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego in Arizona last week, one constituent questioned the party's overall messaging strategy, suggesting they should get \"dirtier\" with their approach against Republicans.\n\n\"They fight dirtier and we are not willing to get in the mud with them,\" the constituent said. \"Maybe it's time we start getting a little bit dirtier with our messaging.\"\n\nand contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map that was used in the 2024 elections and includes two majority-Black districts.\n\nThe dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the recrafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.\n\nIt was unclear following arguments whether the high court was inclined to preserve Louisiana's map for use in future elections. New district lines are drawn after every Census.\n\nThe justices have in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities \u2014 mostly Southern \u2014 with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.\n\nBut in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.\n\nThe latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.\n\n\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting.\n\nThe dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"\n\nThe case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's six congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.\n\nThat initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.\n\nThe judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its six districts had to be majority-Black.\n\nThe plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.\n\nIt did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.\n\nShortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nA divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.\n\n\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"\n\nThe first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.\n\nIn filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nBut as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.\n\nThe state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.\n\n\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"\n\nBut during the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned how the high court is supposed to reconcile the state's acknowledgement that it took race into consideration to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act with the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\"How do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role [in our laws]?\" he asked.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts also highlighted the shape of District 6, which he said runs from one corner of the state to another, \"picking up Black populations as it goes along.\"\n\nBut several of the liberal justices appeared to support Louisiana's argument that it was motivated by politics when it drew the lines of District 6, and decided to draw its own map to protect incumbent lawmakers rather than continue with litigation and risk the district court implementing its own voting lines.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan said state lawmakers had good reason to create a second majority-minor district, given the lower court's order, and implemented a map that reflected its political considerations.\n\n\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room\" when drawing voting boundaries, she said.\n\nIn their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.\n\nThey also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.\n\n\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"\n\nNo other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and his view was not raised during the arguments. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.\n\nSarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.\n\n\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.\n\nOn the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's six House seats.\n\nDistrict 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"\n\nThey also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.\n\n\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.\n\nA decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June."

            "full_content": "London CNN \u2014\n\nMoya O\u2019Sullivan looked in her cabinets, and saw a problem: her cream cheese, toothpaste, mouthwash, whiskey and soft drinks were all American. They had to go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not buying Philadelphia (cream) cheese anymore,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan tells CNN. \u201cNo more Oreos either.\u201d Oral-B and Listerine have been replaced in her bathroom closet, while Jack Daniel\u2019s and Coca-Cola have been banished from her drinks cabinet.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan, 29, teaches history and English to pupils in Kilkenny, southern Ireland. But by changing her shopping list, she\u2019s hoping to school the 77 million Americans who voted to elect President Donald Trump to a second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to me to see that half of America would choose (Trump),\u201d she says.\n\nSlipping into a voice more commonly heard in a classroom, she adds: \u201cThe Americans didn\u2019t learn their lesson the first time. There unfortunately do need to be consequences.\u201d\n\nAs the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with the European Union intensifies, a ripple of reciprocal, economic nationalism is percolating across Europe; and O\u2019Sullivan is part of a small but dedicated group hoping to hurt the United States with their wallets.\n\nJames Blackledge and Moya O\u2019Sullivan are avoiding American products, hoping to send a message across the Atlantic. James Blackledge/Moya O\u2019Sullivan\n\nTrump has said that as of April 2, a slew of new tariffs will be announced on goods coming to the US from all over the globe as part of his package of reciprocal tariffs. The EU is primed to unleash countermeasures of its own, including higher tariffs on American whiskey, motorcycles, beer, poultry, beef, and produce such as soybeans, tomatoes and raspberries.\n\nBut protesting the Trump administration is a tougher sell in Europe than it was eight years ago. Europe\u2019s leaders have taken great pains to build bridges with Trump, eager to avoid the brunt of his tariffs regime, or guide him towards acceptable outcomes in Ukraine and Gaza. And there\u2019s fatigue in the air. \u201cMany people are just a bit exhausted this time around,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan concedes.\n\n\u201cThe first time (Trump\u2019s election) happened, people were outraged, and they thought they could fight back against it and win,\u201d says Zoe Gardner, a spokesperson for the UK-based protest group Stop Trump Coalition. Now, \u201cpeople feel much more beaten down,\u201d she tells CNN. \u201cPeople feel less confident in their ability to oppose this.\u201d\n\nDo boycotts work?\n\nJames Blackledge, a 33-year-old postman in Bristol, England, has made sacrifices too. Like O\u2019Sullivan, he\u2019s turned to a locally-made \u2013 if more expensive \u2013 alternative to Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a mayo monster,\u201d he admits, but he\u2019s stopped buying Hellmann\u2019s and started making his own: \u201cI\u2019ve got a little blender, it\u2019s quite easy to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to get a coffee from McDonald\u2019s every now and then, which I don\u2019t do,\u201d he adds. Sierra Nevada beers are down the drain too. And he\u2019s not alone. \u201cA lot of my friends, who I\u2019ve mentioned this to, say they\u2019ve been doing it already for a while,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d already stopped (buying US products) when Trump was elected.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Sullivan and Blackledge aren\u2019t screaming into a void; their anger is shared by many on message boards and forums, and both have exchanged ideas online about how to make their points.\n\nA price tag marked with a small black star in a Danish supermarket, indicating that the products are EU-produced. Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd the hunger to fight back against American corporations is evident. Denmark\u2019s largest retailer , the Salling Group, introduced black, star-shaped stickers to supermarket labels earlier this month that indicate whether a product was made in Europe. Trump\u2019s threats to annex Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, have particularly angered Danes.\n\n\u201cWe have recently received a number of inquiries from customers who want to buy groceries from European brands,\u201d Salling Group chief executive Anders Hagh wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cOur stores will continue to have brands on the shelves from all over the world, and it will always be up to customers to choose.\u201d\n\nA Swedish Facebook group calling for people to boycott American goods has 81,000 members; a Danish equivalent has 90,000. Every hour, people ask whether their dog food, soda, cheese or chocolate is connected to the US and look for alternatives.\n\nIt is too early in Trump\u2019s administration to tell whether these efforts will impact the exports of American-made staples to Europe. The early economic protests across Europe are ad-hoc and haven\u2019t taken hold among a significant segment of the population, but the looming threat of new tariffs has hardened the resolve of some groups and organizations to buy EU-produced items over American versions .\n\nPrevious, more widespread economic boycotts in Europe, like recent campaigns to avoid companies with ties to Russia and Israel in the wake of their offensives in Ukraine and Gaza, have recruited willing disciples and claim success in prompting some companies to cut their ties with those countries, but deciphering their economic impact is difficult.\n\n\u201cInternational conflicts often provoke boycott calls targeted at a foreign adversary, but whether consumers actually participate has been an enduring puzzle,\u201d researchers at the University of Virginia wrote in a 2016 study. Their work did indeed find that in the US, consumers \u201creduced their purchases of French-sounding supermarket brands\u201d in the wake of a dispute between Washington and Paris over the war in Iraq.\n\nAnother study, which analyzed boycott movements in the US between 1990 and 2005, found that these efforts can impact companies\u2019 reputation even if they don\u2019t hurt their bottom line.\n\nBut whether or not it takes hold, O\u2019Sullivan is undeterred when it comes to Trump. \u201cWe vote with our money \u2026 Even if it makes no difference, I just don\u2019t want my money going to support his economy.\u201d\n\nTargeting Tesla\n\nTrump remains broadly unpopular in Europe, and polling suggests his election win has hurt the continent\u2019s sentiment towards America. But the huge demonstrations that greeted the president on his travels to the continent in his first term have been replaced by piecemeal protests more visible in kitchen cabinets than on city sidewalks.\n\nIn London, a gigantic demonstration gripped the city on the eve of the president\u2019s visit in 2018; around 250,000 people showed up, according to organizers, while an orange-hued, 20-foot tall \u201cTrump Baby\u201d balloon, depicting the president clutching a mobile phone and sporting a giant diaper, sailed in the skies overhead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether the same numbers would come out of one event this time,\u201d admits Gardner, of the Stop Trump Coalition, which organized that protest and has re-formed since Trump\u2019s re-election to shepherd British opposition to the administration.\n\nInstead, demonstrators are trying to get creative. Protests have been organized outside Tesla showrooms in the UK, to oppose owner Elon Musk\u2019s involvement in the administration. But fewer than 20 people showed up to one event on Saturday in Leeds, northern England, according to photos published by organizers, illustrating the struggle to mobilize Brits so far in Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nA massive protest clogged London's streets when Trump visited in 2018. But organizers admit it would be difficult to attract a similarly large crowd this time. Yves Herman/Reuters\n\nSales of Tesla have declined in Europe since Trump took charge \u2013 Tesla registered just 9,913 new units in January across the continent, down from 18,121 last January, according to automotive analysis firm JATO \u2013 though the group noted that the upcoming release of its updated Model Y would likely help sales rebound.\n\nTrump is set to visit the UK on a second state visit soon; this time, the invitation from King Charles III was gleefully unfurled by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, in the White House, and was met with tacit acceptance back home.\n\nBut outbursts in Washington are awakening anger in Europe. \u201cThat meeting (with Volodymyr Zelensky) in the Oval Office was a real flashpoint of disgust, and people felt like they needed to do something,\u201d notes Gardner, who says Trump\u2019s furious tirade against the Ukrainian president prompted a surge in emails and calls to the anti-Trump group.\n\nThe next day, the right-leaning Daily Mail tabloid led its front page on calls to \u201cStop the state visit for \u2018bully\u2019 Trump\u201d \u2013 a surprising rallying cry for a paper that is more sympathetic to his brand of politics than most British outlets.\n\nGardner has supported economic boycotts on US goods, and says she no longer shops on Amazon, though she acknowledged that she organizes protests with fellow anti-Trump activists on WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by US tech giant Meta. \u201cThere are contradictions in this, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a worthwhile thing to do,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd there is one more tool always available to Trump\u2019s critics on the continent: provocation. \u201cGive us back the Statue of Liberty,\u201d Raphael Glucksmann, a French member of the European Parliament who represents the small left-wing party Place Publique, said during a rally at the weekend. \u201cIt was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty. The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone,\u201d he said later on X. \u201cAnd if the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.\u201d"

Trump rescinded the order against Paul Weiss last week after the firm struck a deal with the president. David Laufman, a former head of the DOJ\u2019s counterintelligence section who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, described the move as \u201can authoritarian plan to silence and punish the legal profession\u201d that would have triggered swift intervention.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s chilling the very sector of society that stands between Trump and tyranny,\u201d said a former federal prosecutor and senior lawyer at a law firm that has sued the administration.\n\nLegal experts accused Trump of hypocrisy, noting that his own lawyers have violated Rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure, which bars lawyers from making false or frivolous claims in court, when falsely saying Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance will travel to Greenland this week along with two other administration officials as Trump ramps up calls for U.S. ownership of the Danish territory.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress is eyeing an April deadline to pass Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar agenda, which includes extending his 2017 tax cuts and a debt ceiling increase.\n\nIn an unusual case before the Supreme Court today, civil rights groups are in a tentative alliance with Republican officials to defend a Louisiana congressional map that includes two majority Black districts.\n\nWildfires burn in the Carolinas\n\nWildfires feeding on dry woodlands that were damaged by Hurricane Helene last year have together burned thousands of acres in North Carolina and South Carolina over the weekend. Despite possible rain in the region today, federal forecasters warn that fire weather could return this week.\n\nA trio of fires is burning in Polk County, in the western part of North Carolina. The Black Cover Fire was more than 2,000 acres as of Sunday afternoon and 0% contained, while evacuations were ordered for some residents in the area, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Deep Woods Fire nearby has burned more than 2,500 acres and was 0% contained. And the Fish Hook Fire has burned 199 acres and was 50% contained. In South Carolina, a fire is burning in Table Rock State Park, in the northern part of the state.

            "full_content": "The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will hear oral arguments Monday on whether a lower court can properly address the Trump administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan nationals via a 1798 wartime law.\n\nThe administration asked for a stay pending appeal shortly after an initial March 15 order was issued, calling it a \"massive, unauthorized imposition on the Executive\u2019s authority to remove dangerous aliens who pose threats to the American people.\"\n\nThe Trump administration had attempted to invoke a 1798 wartime authority to deport Venezuelan nationals , including alleged members of the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA), for a period of 14 days.\n\nCOURT ORDER HALTING DEPORTATION FLIGHTS \u2018UNCONSTITUTIONALLY IMPEDES\u2019 EXECUTIVE BRANCH, TRUMP ALLIES ARGUE\n\nLast week, Obama-appointed, D.C.-based Judge James Boasberg issued an order to immediately halt any planned deportations of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador. A plane carrying hundreds of U.S. migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed under the law, arrived in El Salvador hours later despite the order.\n\nBoasberg held a Monday evening fact-finding hearing, where he ordered the Trump administration to submit more information on the flights, including information on how planes departed the U.S. that were carrying any people who were deported \"solely on the basis\" of that proclamation, how many individuals were on each plane, where the planes landed and what time each plane took off from the U.S., and from where.\n\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS FEDERAL JUDGE IT MIGHT INVOKE STATE SECRETS ACT ON HIGH-PROFILE DEPORTATION CASE\n\nBoasberg imposed a Tuesday noon deadline to submit the information and also ordered the parties to appear in court again on Friday.\n\nIn a reply brief submitted to the D.C. Circuit on Wednesday, the government said \"the district court is continuing to attempt to pry sensitive information from the Government. All of the district court\u2019s orders should be stayed, and the Executive Branch\u2019s standing as a coequal branch of Government should be respected.\"\n\nThe Trump administration called the additional requests \"intrusive inquiries that could hamper negotiations in the future.\"\n\nThe government repeatedly failed to comply with the order to submit additional information, citing national security issues. Boasberg then said the government could submit the information under seal by Thursday.\n\nJUDICIAL HALT OF DEPORTATION FLIGHTS PUTS US FOREIGN POLICY AT RISK, CAREER STATE DEPT OFFICIAL CLAIMS\n\nIn a Thursday evening order, Boasberg slammed the administration after it missed his deadline, saying it \"again evaded its obligations\" to submit the requested information.\n\nBoasberg wrote in his order that the government had, instead, sent a six-paragraph declaration from a regional ICE office director in Harlingen, Texas, which notified the court that Cabinet secretaries are \"actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets [act] privileges over the other facts requested by the Court\u2019s order.\"\n\nBoasberg called the submission \"woefully insufficient.\"\n\nJudges Karen Henderson, Patricia Millett and Justin Walker will preside over the Monday oral arguments. Two of the three judges were nominated by Republican presidents, with Henderson appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 and Walker by Trump in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMillett was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013.\n\nFox News Digital's Breanne Deppisch and David Spunt contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Denton in 2016. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: AP Images\n\nIf \u00e9minences grises like Graydon Carter embody the glory days of New York print media in the 1980s and \u201990s, Nick Denton is perhaps the prime avatar of the city\u2019s freewheeling early digital media era. Denton founded Gawker Media in 2002, and oversaw its expansion into a profitable mini-media empire over the next decade. At its height, the company employed a raft of now-name-brand journalists, and its rambunctious flagship site was mandatory reading for the city\u2019s elites and creative underclass. It all came crashing down in baroque fashion in 2016, when Hulk Hogan \u2014 backed by a long-aggrieved Peter Thiel \u2014 sued Gawker.com out of existence.\n\nDenton has kept a generally low profile since then, but recently he has popped his head back into the fray. On his X feed, he has been sounding off on what he sees as an inevitable decline in the dollar, and a corresponding rise in China\u2019s fortunes. He is backing up his pessimism on America\u2019s near-term prospects by selling his SoHo apartment, once a new-media mecca and party hub, and moving to Hungary, where he has family roots, with his husband and two children. I spoke with Denton in a wide-ranging conversation about why he was \u201cashamed\u201d of Gawker by the end, why he\u2019s so bearish on America right now, and what his new life in Budapest will look like.\n\nYou\u2019re leaving New York \u2014 that\u2019s big. You\u2019ve been here for 23 years, I think?\n\nActually, we went away for Trump One.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize that.\n\nSo I guess unlike a lot of people who say \u201cIf he wins, we\u2019re leaving \u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re one of the few who mean it.\n\nI think my timing has actually been almost perfect. I left in December 2016. I obviously had some special circumstances there because of my opponent in the legal battle over Gawker, who is now pretty much one of the most powerful men in the States \u2014 Trump\u2019s biggest Silicon Valley backer, Peter Thiel. And then I guess this time I\u2019ve been a little slower off the mark. It\u2019s only \u2014 what, two months into Trump Two?\n\nAn interior of Denton\u2019s apartment, which went on sale last week. Photo: Courtesy the subject\n\nSo you really can\u2019t abide living in America while Trump is president?\n\nI\u2019m actually not as anti-Trump as some people. I don\u2019t think that what\u2019s going on now is all down to Trump. This is a lot of chickens from a lot of administrations coming to roost. It\u2019s pretty much the culmination of 25 years of delayed decisions and delayed reform. I\u2019m a former financial journalist. I was with the Financial Times and the Economist, and I don\u2019t see any way for equilibrium to be restored without a dollar devaluation. The dollar should not be six reais to the dollar; it should probably be about three or four reais, which is what it was 20 years ago.\n\nThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve been tweeting quite a bit about. Tell me a little more about where you see things going, financially speaking.\n\nWell, to my mind, the last significant correction was 2000 and the dot-com crash. That was a true purge of the system. It was certainly a purge of excess and enthusiasm for the internet, but I always remained enthusiastic about the internet. And I was always convinced that it was real, despite the disillusionment of 2001, 2002, 2003. I guess it was three or four years before it came back with Flickr and other companies like that. So I still remained a believer, but it was definitely a purge of the excess and the speculative excesses of Cisco being an incredibly highly valued company. I don\u2019t know whether you remember that time?\n\nSure, Pets.com and so forth.\n\nIt was even crazier than the AI-driven boom and the Big Seven. And it was purged. I\u2019m a market guy. I believe in the cycles, and the cycles have to be allowed to cycle. And that was the last time, to my mind, that that was the case. Every single correction since then has been met very quickly with reinflation of the economy, as if the American political system cannot abide any significant or sustained decline in the S&P. Everything is so wrapped up in stock-market valuations. Every single administration \u2014 its credibility depends on stock-market appreciation. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen since then, not even in 2008, a true purge of the system.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying there\u2019s artificially inflated stuff in the market that should be purged and hasn\u2019t been?\n\nYes. Correct.\n\nAnd now it might be happening?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I kind of doubt it. Scott Bessent talks about the economy being brittle, needing a \u201cdetox\u201d period. Things get ahead of themselves and then you need to restore equilibrium. But they\u2019re pursuing it through this kind of slapdash, haphazard austerity that Musk is in charge of, which doesn\u2019t feel to me like it has a broad base of political support.\n\nIt obviously has support among the tech right, but the tech right is just a small part of the Trump coalition. And I don\u2019t believe that the hillbillies are into this, and I don\u2019t believe that the Mar-a-Lago crowd are into this at all. And ultimately, I don\u2019t believe that Trump will be into this, even if he is attached to Musk at the hip. Did you see Tara Palmeri\u2019s reporting about how they are avoiding even polling Musk\u2019s numbers? They\u2019re actually suppressing the data, because if the data came out, it would be devastating for the administration and certainly for the Trump-Musk axis. My theory, and Michael Wolff\u2019s working theory, and anybody who\u2019s followed Trump through the years, in politics and outside of politics \u2014 is that eventually Trump dumps everybody. If someone is weighing him down politically, ultimately, even if he behaves like he\u2019s Lil\u2019 X\u2019s grandfather, even if he is the father that Musk never had, when it comes down to it, Trump will choose himself over his allies. Musk is not the only force within the administration \u2014 there\u2019s a triangle, and Vance represents a significant part of the coalition. And Trump himself represents, I guess, the boomer, Mar-a-Lago crowd that are definitely deeply into the S&P. Even a 10 percent correction for them is enough to turn those Mar-a-Lago parties into wakes.\n\nBut are you saying that some version of what Musk is doing, perhaps a less haphazard version, would actually be a good idea? Because that\u2019s what Bessent seems to be getting at. Most mainstream economists think the economy was running decently well before Trump got in. With flaws, sure, but not ones that necessitate this kind of drastic shake-up.\n\nAmerica\u2019s got $30 trillion worth of debt to insure over the next few years, both to roll over existing debt and to finance new debt with the level of budget deficits. The economy is clearly out of equilibrium. Did you see those stats for agricultural trade?\n\nI haven\u2019t, no.\n\nEven if you think America\u2019s manufacturing sector is weak, and maybe there\u2019s a structural deficit there \u2014 that America in the long term will not be such an important manufacturing power, that it\u2019s already lagging two to one behind China, that Tesla sales are lagging two to one behind BYD sales, and that if you projected forward with pretty conservative assumptions, you get to BYD at 10X Tesla sales by 2030 \u2014 the optimistic view then is that America\u2019s a very important oil-producing power, and actually, in the fracking industry, it\u2019s basically turned around the decline in its oil production, and that\u2019s definitely an area in which America is world-leading. And you think, okay, even if the manufacturing isn\u2019t going to come back then, raw materials, energy, metals, agricultural commodities \u2014 that\u2019s enough to sustain an economy, together with American soft power, dollar supremacy, and, well, I guess they used to think AI supremacy.\n\nBut I don\u2019t see how equilibrium is restored without a significant devaluation in the dollar. Maybe America should be thinking about its farmers, who are extremely efficient, world-class farmers who are basically crippled by this high exchange rate. They would benefit enormously from a devaluation.\n\nAnd then Trump was signaling that the dollar would be allowed to decline or that there\u2019d be some Mar-a-Lago accord with a debt renegotiation combined with a reset of the dollar, in I guess what they hoped would be an orderly fashion. I question whether it\u2019s going to truly be orderly with this administration.\n\nNot much of what they do is orderly.\n\nIt\u2019s a very delicate operation to do a debt restructure. This is like brain surgery conducted by three drunken surgeons who are all fighting with each other at the same time, and they can\u2019t decide whether to use a chain saw or a scalpel.\n\nAmerica has some amazing companies. Its logistics system is incredible. There are giant warehouses and a highway network that make England, where I am now, look kind of rinky-dink and inefficient. Warehouses at highway intersections alone explain \u2014 was it an eighth of the GDP gap between the U.S. and the U.K.? So just simple scale and having one gigantic continental market is a huge, huge deal. And that\u2019s why I came to America in the first place. It wasn\u2019t necessarily the towns or the people, just that it\u2019s the biggest place, and it\u2019s the first place where you can get to scale if you\u2019re starting a new business. So it is naturally the place that an entrepreneur goes, because the future has happened first in America.\n\nWe will see whether that remains the case. But regardless, even just to bring agricultural trade into balance, a significant devaluation is needed. And then I started thinking about how we were wanting to go back to Europe, and then I\u2019m looking at all this from a European perspective and thinking, well, our dollar assets are highly valued, and in Europe, that money goes a very, very, very long way. And maybe now, before things get a little too crazy, maybe now is the time to rebalance my portfolio.\n\nHow much of your bearishness on America\u2019s future led to your decision? You\u2019ve got roots in Hungary, but you also think it\u2019s financially advantageous to leave now?\n\nI don\u2019t think you can really distinguish one from the other. We have a house in the Buda Hills that we\u2019re moving into. And the kids \u2014 we\u2019re trying to choose between two schools for them to go to. And obviously, in Hungary, you barely even have to think about money. I don\u2019t really want to say this in front of Hungarian friends, because for them it\u2019s kind of expensive, but coming from America \u2026 You see it on TikTok, the American tourists arriving in some place, marveling at how low the rents are, whether it\u2019s Medell\u00edn or Lisbon or \u2014\n\nYeah, I was just in Mexico City. It was crazy that way.\n\nYou live like a king. I feel like anyone who goes to a country like Mexico or Colombia or Brazil or Hungary feels like they take not one but two steps up the social ladder. And so there\u2019s basically a powerful economic force which is attracting people to those cities, particularly if that\u2019s where you\u2019re from. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m from \u2014 H-town.\n\nH-town. It\u2019s a slightly different place, I imagine, than it was, with the political system being what it is. What do you think about that? Are you an Orb\u00e1n guy?\n\nI\u2019m not an Orb\u00e1n guy, but I knew him back in the day.\n\nReally?\n\nUh-huh. I was a Financial Times correspondent in Budapest in \u201989 when he was a young radical. He was, I think, the first to just out-and-out call for Russians to go home, and it was, \u201cOh my God, did he just say that?\u201d In retrospect, it\u2019s obvious that they should go home, and everybody\u2019s going home now.\n\nHe\u2019s a bit more pro-Russian these days, I think.\n\nLook, he\u2019s playing all the superpowers. So yes, he wants cheap oil and gas from Russia. Europe needs cheap oil and gas from Russia if it\u2019s going to compete industrially. Yes, he has some domestic political reasons to be allied with Trump, because he plays the anti-Soros, anti-woke card himself. But the hard fact of Hungary is that it has a gigantic BYD factory, 500,000 cars a year coming out of that thing, and the giant CATL factory. And half the Chinese trade finance for Europe, for the E.U., passes through Hungary. So yeah, I think in the end, he\u2019s going to be \u2014 and maybe Europe as a whole is going to be \u2014 in the Chinese zone. Not the Russian zone, not the American zone, but the Chinese zone.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve followed European politics at all. The administration\u2019s quite circumspect when it comes to China. But they love to bully small countries. They love to bully Canada, they love to bully Denmark. Even Rubio joined in on the abuse of Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign affairs minister, and one of the last Atlanticists in Europe. That was foreign-policy malpractice.\n\nOh, it\u2019s all malpractice.\n\nYou\u2019re attacking your best friends, your best allies in Europe. I mean, it\u2019s absurd. Little Denmark has done nothing but be a loyal American ally. I think that was the one that did it for me. Like, really, Denmark? You can\u2019t even say that Denmark is part of this civilizational suicide that Vance sees taking place in Europe, because actually they\u2019ve addressed their migration crisis and the political fallout from it more forcefully than any other country in Europe. The far right has been utterly defanged in Denmark.\n\nAll of their policies have basically been stolen by the mainstream parties, and immigration is no longer a poisonous political issue. And then you had the Vance speech, and there was that frankly disgusting insult where he couldn\u2019t even remember that England and France had sent troops in support of America\u2019s idiotic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq out of loyalty. Because people actually did care. They did care about 9/11. They felt like it was an attack on the whole West. I\u2019m getting worked up now.\n\nIt\u2019s the only time Article 5 has been invoked.\n\nMy dad was an Atlanticist, and I was an Atlanticist, I was a man of the West, but there are no men of the West left in Europe now. There are European nationalists, yes. There are people who are circumspect because they know that at least temporarily they depend on the American nuclear umbrella. But Europe is out. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to be Poland that leads it or France. Do you follow Donald Tusk? That great line he has \u2014 how come 500 million Europeans are begging 300 million Americans for help in dealing with 100 million Russians who can\u2019t even deal with 40 million Ukrainians? He\u2019s my hero. Donald Tusk for president. He was president of Europe before; he should be again.\n\nSometimes I think that actually \u201989 was only a partial revolution, where half of Europe was liberated from external occupation. And actually that occupation \u2014 in some ways it was easier to spot, because there were full-on tanks and an uprising, like in \u201956, the uprising in Hungary \u2014 suppressed by gunfire and tanks. Whereas the American domination of Europe was rather more insidious and subtle and has left the western part of the continent infantilized. It can\u2019t even imagine what life is like in charge of its own destiny, after 80 years of America basically being the security provider. To that extent, the American right advance is totally correct. Europe does need to stand up and take more responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe Chinese have described Trump as the great nation-builder. He is the great nation-builder. He\u2019s the great nation-builder of Canada, the great nation-builder of Mexico, and the great nation-builder of Europe. So thank you very much.\n\nThough the last 80 years have been pretty decent for Western Europe compared to the previous 80 years, and that was largely due to the American umbrella of security. So it worked until it didn\u2019t.\n\n\ufeffThere was clearly a point in it. And I moved over to the States to seek my fortune. I didn\u2019t establish my companies in Europe. I use European software developers, and I use Europe as a base for a town. But Silicon Valley was the place where the future was being invented. Now it seems like China might be the place where the future is being invented.\n\nHow does this shake out in the near term?\n\n\ufeffI think there\u2019s going to be a classic political struggle between the capitalist class and the competitive producers in tradable sectors and companies with significant international business. And that is the real underlying political battle, and not between the Democrats and the Republicans, but actually between those interested in the strong dollar and those who aren\u2019t interested in a strong dollar, who actually need the dollar to be at a more realistic level in order for them to be able to compete.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be watching it all from 4,000 miles away.\n\n\ufeffI\u2019ll be coming back on visits and hopefully it won\u2019t be quite so expensive to visit New York. New York actually could do quite well because it\u2019s become excruciatingly expensive for people to visit.\n\nHow do you feel about leaving the city? Has it lost the thing that attracted you to it in the first place?\n\n\ufeffI was attracted first and foremost by the Valley. The Financial Times wanted me to go to New York, and I didn\u2019t want to go to New York. I took like a 30 percent pay cut to go to Silicon Valley because I was obsessed with the internet and I just knew it was going to be a huge deal and I had to get myself into it. I had to go to the epicenter. And Steve Jobs was my hero. And he wasn\u2019t really a Valley figure, but people like Vannevar Bush \u2014 20th-century American technologists, they were my heroes. And frankly, Peter Thiel was one of my heroes. He totally was. Gay guy. I guess it wasn\u2019t completely clear back then that he was gay, but a gay guy, libertarian, trying to free money from the malign control of government. These were the people.\n\nAnd now I look at it and I see seven monopolies. Seven rather slow-moving monopolies that are now \u2014 suddenly it seems, although it\u2019s been building for a while \u2014 in competition as an ecosystem. They are in competition with another ecosystem, the Chinese technology ecosystem. You\u2019ve seen those charts where it shows these giant bubbles of American market cap and the companies in these tiny little dots of European companies, and they laugh at us. The Europoors.\n\nI look at that and I question the size of those bubbles. And maybe those bubbles are, metaphorically, bubbles \u2014 that Silicon Valley is massively overvalued and that the DeepSeek drop exploded in an instant the idea of American AI supremacy. It was a subtle dagger in the heart of Silicon Valley. You barely even notice the knife going in it was so subtle. But the end result of it is you have OpenAI, which was the greatest start-up of this phase, now going to lobby the U.S. government to restrict DeepSeek access because it can\u2019t compete with a company that is at least nearly as good and offering its services at a fraction of the cost, in the classic Chinese fashion. Just as they did in cars, just as they did in drones, just as they are doing in robots. So if you ask me what is not what it once was, or what does not seem to be the draw that it once was? I would say above all it\u2019s Silicon Valley.\n\nIn Europe, manufacturing actually does count, and the economy is probably on a more sound footing and there\u2019s less financialization. The health care is kind of affordable, and it costs half as much, and Europeans live five years longer. So just in terms of outcomes, the health-care system, the education system, it\u2019s leaner. Europe has tons and tons of problems, but having had a 25-year-long bubble is not one of them. Europe has had austerity on and off pretty much since 2008. The austerity has only now ended, and the austerity in the U.S. has only now begun.\n\nSo it\u2019s a lack of dynamism among the top dogs of American technology. Things have become sclerotic.\n\n\ufeffThe VCs say it themselves. Absolutely nothing that I\u2019m saying has not been said by Palmer Luckey or Marc Andreessen, a bunch of right-wing tech guys. They are actually the most powerful critics of Silicon Valley. I actually don\u2019t really understand why people don\u2019t see that. I guess the left is a complete distraction. They\u2019re so easily dismissed. They know nothing, and they come at it with so many prejudices that they can\u2019t see anything clearly at all. But when Palmer Luckey talks about Apple, when Palmer Luckey talks about how easily Apple could be shut down with the stroke of a pen by Xi Jinping \u2014 all it would take would be just to nationalize the factories, declare them to be strategic or whatever. And Apple was supposed to be trying to diversify its supply chain to Vietnam and India and has totally failed in that. It\u2019s failed to produce a car. It\u2019s failed to produce a Vision Pro at an acceptable price and basically left that entire future open to Xiaomi and probably a dozen other Chinese companies that we haven\u2019t heard of.\n\nSo in terms of the States, that\u2019s what I\u2019m most negative about \u2014 that Silicon Valley companies became monopolies. It\u2019s sort of the ideology of Peter Thiel: Don\u2019t compete. That\u2019s pretty much the core philosophy of Zero to One. Competition is for losers. Go find yourself a monopoly and have a good life with enough money to afford a bolt-hole in New Zealand in case it all goes wrong.\n\nHow do you think about Gawker and the way that all ended?\n\n\ufeffI\u2019m not going to say Gawker was perfect. It was a relief when it could finally be put out of its misery. It dragged down the other sites. I was embarrassed by it at the end. It basically fell into the same trap as Musk and Rogan are falling into now, where they\u2019re paying way too much attention to their audience. And that feedback loop can drive people crazy.\n\nYou\u2019ve posted a lot lately about people being driven insane by the internet, by social media, et cetera. Whether it\u2019s Musk or Rogan or, as you put it, Gawker staffers in a certain era.\n\n\ufeff2012 to 2015.\n\nSo what was it about those years?\n\n\ufeffI took a little bit of a break in 2011 for personal reasons. And then I came back and it was like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Seriously. Not for the guys writing Gizmodo or Lifehacker \u2014 they were the same as they\u2019d ever been. But I just felt like I absolutely could not connect with the Gawker writers. I thought it was a generational change. There had been a bunch of new people hired, a lot of them from Ivy League schools, whereas the early Gawker writers had been misfits, unemployable in most other places. The later Gawker writers were credentialed. And there\u2019s a pipeline from Ivy League gender studies into Jezebel. That\u2019s pretty much one of the only jobs that you could do if you were a gender-studies major.\n\nAnd there was something more than that. They seemed somehow lobotomized. I would get frustrated, not able to understand where they were coming from. What motivates you? Seriously, what drives you, what motivates you, what are you passionate about? And it was like talking to a bunch of robots. And these are smart people. I hated Gawker. I was not reading it. And I fired half the staff in an afternoon. Thank God, thank God. Because I was ashamed. I was just ashamed.\n\nI assume what you\u2019re saying about the staffers, partly, is that things had become political, had become left wing.\n\n\ufeffI think it had become homogenous. I was designing and redesigning the comment system to allow for some diversity of opinion. I was writing essays about intellectual diversity way before its time. Hey, this stuff is better if people debate it. I came up through the Oxford tutorial system in which you are expected to be able to argue either side of an argument. You\u2019re supposed to be able to switch over and put yourself in the position of another perspective. I\u2019ve always found that very useful. I find it very useful now in making investment decisions and trying to work out whether Tesla really is going down or not \u2014 trying to steelman the case. I respect Elon Musk. Elon Musk was one of my heroes. Our son\u2019s middle name is Elon.\n\nWow.\n\n\ufeffI mean, not specifically for him.\n\nOh, okay.\n\n\ufeffWe liked the sound of the name. And it was absolutely not a problem that the world\u2019s most successful man, achiever of reusable rockets that have revolutionized the cost of space travel, the electric car, and global internet in the ether \u2014 to have done one of those things would be a major achievement. And I think he\u2019s serious about being the first leader of the Mars colony. I think he\u2019s absolutely dead serious about that. And I think that would be the absolute best outcome.\n\nI would prefer a different leader, personally. I just want to put that on the record.\n\n\ufeffMaybe. But there is nobody else presenting themselves. I would prefer for there to be somebody. Columbus wasn\u2019t a good guy. None of these people are good guys. They\u2019ve usually lost in some way back on their home continents or home planets. And exploration \u2014 exit \u2014 is their only option. That\u2019s how progress happens. The crazy ones leave. The crazy ones left Europe, and you got all our crazies. This one I apologize for: You got the Scots-Irish too. You\u2019ve got the hillbillies who were so toxic, so pernicious \u2014 I think the word they used at the time \u2014 that the Quakers in Pennsylvania and the gentry in Virginia pushed them up into the hills.\n\nWe\u2019re finally paying that price with J.D. Vance.\n\n\ufeffJ.D. Vance is the revenge of the hillbillies. J.D. Vance is getting revenge for that betrayal. There are many things I think America should be thanking Europe for. I did a little Twitter essay on this. Basically all the things that we gave you, all the talents, the patience that we gave you, the loyalty that we gave you, the fact that we don\u2019t pull our money out of Treasuries right now as any rational investor would. But the one thing I would like to apologize for is the hillbillies. We gave you the hillbillies, and now you\u2019re paying the price, because the hillbillies are at the core of MAGA.\n\nTo go back to Gawker for a second \u2014 were you actually glad when the ax came down in 2016?\n\n\ufeffI was glad when Univision said they didn\u2019t want it. I was glad that it had a good clean end.\n\nAnd not some kind of bastardization that\u2019s happened with some other sites. Though it did relaunch later, I suppose.\n\nIt did come back in some bastard form. But I think it was a sufficient interval that that was clearly another thing. But yeah, I agreed with Peter Thiel\u2019s criticisms.\n\nYou recently posted that Thiel was \u201cright, as usual,\u201d in this case about Democrats.\n\nWell, I would like to know about his positions right now. First, I want to know why he\u2019s so quiet when he ought to be at his point of maximum power. I\u2019m super-curious about his attitude toward Vance, while Vance is busy destroying the Atlantic alliance, and Palantir depends on the Atlantic alliance for a large portion of its contracts. I\u2019m very curious as to how Peter Thiel thinks about the abuse of America\u2019s most loyal allies in Europe.\n\nAre you nostalgic for the previous era of Gawker? The Wild West era, which is when I started reading it in the mid-aughts?\n\nI mean, it was fresh. It was fun. It was a \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say a breath, it was a blast of fresh air.\n\nThere was energy behind it, there was novelty behind it.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s the first time in eight, ten or maybe even longer \u2014 12 years that I\u2019ve felt sufficiently free and sufficiently \u2026 I guess angry about the vandalism and the wanton destruction of the western alliance that the words just come out.\n\nYeah. You\u2019ve been fairly quiet the last few years.\n\n\ufeffEight years.\n\nYeah, so why now?\n\nIt just happened. Seriously. I was on Twitter \u2014 I never stopped being on X \u2026\n\nThis is how every bad story starts. \u201cI was on Twitter \u2026\u201d\n\n\ufeffI was on X and I guess I can\u2019t remember exactly which one it was, whether it was Denmark or whether it was Poland. I mean, everybody was upset about Ukraine and I guess I wasn\u2019t any more upset than anybody else was. Denmark definitely got to me. I love Denmark. Denmark is kind of like a model country as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nI\u2019m with you.\n\n\ufeffIf you do talk shit about it, that says something about you. It says much more about you than it does about Denmark. I have these little weird obsessions. Like, I love Singapore.\n\nYou\u2019re a fan of Lee Kuan Yew, I recall.\n\n\ufeffYeah. I think he\u2019s the greatest statesman of the 20th century. Deng Xiaoping is probably the second greatest statesman of the 20th century.\n\nYou like the benevolent authoritarians?\n\n\ufeffI like countries with rising GDP. That\u2019s what I like. I like rising GDP.\n\nFair enough.\n\n\ufeffI like prosperous countries in which people can bring up kids and rely on an excellent state education system and get good health care. Where the country just gets better and better every single year, every single decade, every single generation. So the track record of Singapore deserves respect.\n\nSure, though GDP is a measure that people often point to as an illustration of how great the U.S. is doing, even when health care, cost of living, life expectancy isn\u2019t so great.\n\n\ufeffI\u2019m much more skeptical of American GDP numbers than of other countries\u2019 GDP numbers. And it seems like the administration has begun the process of a reevaluation of American GDP numbers \u2014 they are themselves saying, \u201cOh, hey, you shouldn\u2019t really be counting any of the government spending.\u201d Then half of health care is completely dysfunctional, so subtract 10 percent of GDP for that. And while you\u2019re at it, subtract the 3 percent of GDP that basically goes on litigation, and maybe the 6 percent that goes on broker fees on real estate, and the 7 percent on IPO fees, and the billion dollars a year on scaffolding in New York, which is completely unnecessary, and $120,000 that I paid for some pathetic legal dispute that actually should have been resolved for a thousand dollars. So all of that counts toward GDP, but it absolutely does not count toward well-being.\n\nI get the sense you\u2019re excited to be sharing these ideas after some time in the wilderness.\n\n\ufeffPart of it is that I\u2019m on my way out. I don\u2019t have to think about, Oh, maybe you need to sell to Silicon Valley, about Silicon Valley being the acquirer, the ultimate acquirer of everything. Silicon Valley exerts a huge, huge amount of power. And when you no longer are looking for money from Silicon Valley in any way, that is actually extremely liberating.\n\nTo end where we began, you\u2019re putting your apartment on the market. How do you feel about that? It seems like the end of an era.\n\n\ufeffI was just thinking if there was a physical manifestation of the digital-media era, it was that.\n\nDenton\u2019s kitchen. Photo: Courtesy the subject\n\nLook, for everything there is a cycle. It was a great bachelor pad and party pad with an independent entrance \u2014 doorman building, but independent entrance opposite Balthazar. So you\u2019d have parties and they wouldn\u2019t bother the neighbors and you never even saw your neighbors. It was awesome. And then it had a period as a refuge during the pandemic. I\u2019m sorry to say this, but we loved the pandemic, because we were in the apartment, and Crosby Street was completely deserted. And we loved the apartment. And you could hear the birds tweeting and I could sunbathe out on the fire escape and it was like being the last man in the city. I guess everybody else had gone off to their country houses or whatever.\n\nBut it felt like you\u2019re in the absolute middle of the bustle \u2014 the epicenter of downtown, the coolest district, the best location in the coolest district in the whole of the United States. That\u2019s how I felt. And you could retreat up the stairs into the apartment. There\u2019s double-pane glass in the bedrooms, and it\u2019s completely silent. So you\u2019re basically in the thick of things, in the fray and at the same time, just a few steps away \u2014 peace. Like a total haven.\n\nAnd it was a family apartment for us. The kids had their first two, three years there, rushing to the windows to watch the fire engines going back to the fire station over on Lafayette Street, and the ambulances and the police cars. Some kids in the country might be obsessed with horses or animals or whatever, but our kids are completely vehicle-obsessed. I\u2019m showing them pictures of trams in Budapest and cogwheel railways and things basically to console them, to provide some kind of replacement for basically the vehicle extravaganza that they could see from the windows of that apartment.\n\nWell, they can marvel at BYD cars now.\n\n\ufeffMy husband Derrence wants a G-Wagon. He wants a full suburban life in a G-Wagon: garden, own house, no neighbors, all that kind of stuff.\n\nBut bringing all of this together with the economics: The apartment has been a safe haven for us as a family during COVID and after, but as an investment, I think a lot of the smart money is out of the market. I think a lot of people are like me, that basically they\u2019ve sold down a significant portion of their U.S. stocks. I saw Chamath from the All-In podcast said that he was short Wall Street, long Main Street.\n\nA lot of people have taken this up. Jamie Dimon just sold a huge chunk of his JPMorgan stock, and I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t get more notice. So you\u2019ve got a lot of these people sitting on a lot of cash and there isn\u2019t anywhere really very obvious to put it. They can\u2019t, for political reasons, put it in China. Gold is already at $3,000. What other markets are attractive? I think people are going to be buying land, they\u2019re going to be buying prime apartments. They\u2019re going to be seeking refuge, finding safe haven in the real.\n\nSo I\u2019m looking at this from a euro perspective. I want euros, so I want to get a sale done promptly. I don\u2019t want this hanging around through rounds and rounds of tariff wars and devaluation, speculation and all that kind of stuff. I hedge myself some, so I\u2019m not totally exposed to the dollar. But I feel like now is actually probably quite a good time to sell. We put it on, deliberately, probably about a million dollars below where it ought to be. Basically that\u2019s a low price as a lure for, \u201cHey, come and look.\u201d But I\u2019m expecting that it\u2019s going to get bid up into probably the low fours at least.\n\nWhat are you actually going to be doing in Hungary, if anything, professionally? Or is it just family life?\n\n\ufeffThe only site I ever wrote for among the Gawker sites was Valleywag, which was kind of gossipy financial. My specialty is financial gossip, not sexual gossip. I\u2019m not that interested in sexual gossip, but I love financial gossip. Give me more and more and more of it. I did a book on the Barings derivatives scandal and the collapse of England\u2019s oldest merchant bank. That\u2019s why I went to Singapore for the first time. I\u2019m a psycho-historian. I love all this stuff. So when AI came along \u2014 first of all, Claude, and then I, switched to DeepSeek, and now I\u2019m using Deep Research \u2014 I\u2019ve tried them all. I think I\u2019m pretty good at it, at getting answers out. And so I do scenario planning, I do timelines, and then I set the timelines off against each other.\n\nI was a huge Asimov Foundation fan along with Paul Krugman, Elon Musk, and God knows who else. And the core of that is, can you predict the future? I guess his idea was mathematically, and I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s really possible. But you can certainly predict the future by playing out a story, writing a story of the future and judging how credible it is, or writing two different stories of the future.\n\nWill Elon Musk make it? Will he pull Tesla out of this death spiral? Can the Optimus compete with Unitree\u2019s latest? Is he going to show up to the big human-robot race in Beijing next month, which is going to be kind of like the test, just as much as the N\u00fcrburgring is a test of the speed of the SU7 Ultra versus the Tesla S Plaid. So you can use the AI to play out these scenarios and then, depending on what stories you get out, you can trade. And I have been trading. Just last week, I did a whole extensive timeline game for the F-35. At what point do these cancellations in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, put the F-35 program into a death spiral? And I\u2019m not the only one. There\u2019s a lot of people using AI to do this kind of thing.\n\nSo you\u2019re a futurist AI speculator trader?\n\n\ufeffPretty much.\n\nThat\u2019s a growing industry, they tell me.\n\n\ufeffI think it is. I think all these things are merging. The short sellers have always been journalists as much as they\u2019ve been traders. They do a trade and they put out a story. And so I don\u2019t see why it can\u2019t work the other way around.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "A U.S. Navy F-35 performs during the Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach, California in 2022. Photo: Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Getty Images\n\nNot so long ago, the F-35 fighter jet was the hottest ticket in the international arms market. Though it had suffered teething pains in development, going over budget by 50 percent in its first decade, Lockheed Martin\u2019s Lightning II glowed up into a remarkably capable weapons platform. Stealthy, supersonic, and able to both dogfight and strike targets on the ground, it\u2019s arguably the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S. arsenal and undeniably the most sought-after. As nation after nation held competitions to choose their next frontline fighter, the F-35 came in and trounced its rivals time and again. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a competition that it entered in Europe that it didn\u2019t win,\u201d says Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cAnywhere Lockheed Martin pitched the F-35, it wound up getting chosen.\u201d Today, some 18 years after its first flight, more than 1,000 F-35s are in operation in 20 countries.\n\nBut then, earlier this month, something happened. One after another, nations that had signed up for the F-35 started voicing qualms. On March 13, Portugal\u2019s defense minister said that the country would cancel plans to buy the plane. Then Canada\u2019s prime minister said it would reconsider its purchase. Germany, too, is said to be wavering in its commitment to the jet.\n\nNothing had changed about the plane\u2019s performance. It\u2019s just that, in the eyes of some international customers, the F-35 can\u2019t fully be trusted anymore because of who is the commander-in-chief. Donald Trump has an affinity for authoritarianism, has exhibited poor treatment of NATO (whose Article 5 obligates collective defense), and, in particular, has threatened to annex Greenland and Canada.\n\n\u201cCanada is one of our closest allies, and they have fought with us. They have died with us,\u201d says Cynthia Cook, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd to have the new president of the United States cast doubt on their independence is really viewed as a challenging pill to swallow. It\u2019s making the U.S. be seen as a less reliable ally.\u201d\n\nThe long-term effects of America\u2019s heel turn might not just be deleterious for the F-35 program but for the $238 billion U.S. weapons-export industry as a whole, including the recently announced Boeing F-47 next-generation fighter, which could enter service in the 2030s. If the \u201carsenal of democracy\u201d no longer stands on the side of democracies, what is it good for?\n\nTo understand why the F-35 is suddenly in trouble, the first thing you need to know is that a state-of-the-art fighter jet isn\u2019t just a physical airframe. It\u2019s both hardware and software, a whole suite of networked systems that requires software patches and data in order to work effectively. It\u2019s a bit like a smartphone: If you don\u2019t update the software, it gradually works less and less well and eventually bricks.\n\nThe F-35 has to depend on software because of the environment it will fight in. Even though the plane is stealthy, meaning hard to detect by conventional radar, it is not invisible and will not survive long in a modern air-defense environment unless it can track and assess enemy radars and countermeasures. To do that, it needs to constantly update its assessment of the threat environment. That information is stored inside a software package called the mission data file, or MDF. The software is updated by a civilian unit located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida called the F-35 Partner Support Complex, whose website explains that nations deploying the F-35 \u201care not allowed to conduct independent test operations\u201d outside the U.S. and that \u201cU.S. citizens perform specific functions in order to protect critical U.S. technology.\u201d\n\nIn other words, any one nation that flies the F-35 is wholly dependent on the U.S. to keep the planes functioning properly. When the program launched, this provision rankled some allies, but it didn\u2019t prove to be a deal-breaker because it was inconceivable at the time that the U.S. would ever be anything other than a trusted ally. (Israel, presciently, insisted on retaining control of the F-35\u2019s software and today operates the aircraft with considerably more autonomy.)\n\nBuying planes that they don\u2019t fully control now looks like an incredibly poor decision. Since Trump took office, Europe\u2019s trust in its ally has withered as the U.S. has pivoted from democracy toward autocracy, increasingly aligned with Europe\u2019s most dangerous adversary, Russia. As the legendary aviation journalist Bill Sweetman writes, \u201cA hypothetical: A crisis is emerging, and U.S. strategy and policy differs from that of a partner nation; the U.S. is not going to intervene militarily at any likely threshold. The pressure point is simple: The door code at Eglin is changed. The partner nation\u2019s people can\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\nEffectively, the F-35 is bricked.\n\nThe delicacy of the situation that Europe now finds itself in goes far beyond the F-35 or any of the other major weapons systems that it is heavily dependent on the U.S. to maintain and operate, like the U.K.\u2019s nuclear-weapons program. It\u2019s that the whole defense edifice, from top to bottom, has been designed with a deep level of interdependence baked in. \u201cOne of the strengths of the U.S. defense industrial cooperation is we\u2019re able to incorporate the best offerings from our allies and partners from their technological advances,\u201d Cook says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that our adversaries like Russia and China can envy but not replicate.\u201d\n\nThe idea that the U.S. would just walk away from a global security system that it has spent the better part of a century building and nurturing, and which undergirds the country\u2019s global power, is nearly incomprehensible. For Europeans, it\u2019s a bit like coming home and finding your husband in bed with the au pair. The swiftness and profundity of the betrayal is so enraging that a lifetime of commitment can vanish in an instant.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been born, all I\u2019ve ever known was a U.S. alliance,\u201d says Thomas Withington, a white-haired associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, Britain\u2019s venerable defense think tank. \u201cOccasionally, there\u2019s been good-natured criticism on both sides of the Atlantic. But nobody has ever envisaged a world in which the U.S. and Europe are not very strong security partners. And what\u2019s shocking to me now is that I have a number of friends \u2014 mainly French but German and Italian as well \u2014 who were quite strong Atlanticists but have totally changed their position in the last two weeks.\n\n\u201cI was having a drink with a colleague last week, and he said that he remembered vividly how in the wake of 9/11, the U.S. declared Article 5 and pretty much all allied nations around the world stepped up. And he said, \u2018God forbid if that happens again, because we would never assist America in any future wars.\u2019 He was very adamant: Europe must not come to U.S. aid in the future. The U.S. is on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust is hard to win, and it\u2019s really easy to lose,\u201d Barrie says. \u201cEven if this is a four-year blip in terms of the transatlantic relationship, it\u2019s going to take a bit of time to move back toward a more balanced position.\u201d\n\nFor now, even if Trump\u2019s most ominous pronouncements turn out to be mere bluster, Europe has been forced to confront how exposed it is. With remarkable speed, it has pivoted to the consensus that it needs to achieve self-reliance as quickly as it can, and that means replacing U.S. weapons and capabilities with those of a more dependable origin. With a friendly neighbor locked in an interminable and grinding bloodbath, the sense of urgency is real.\n\nAs for the U.S., it is hard to see how it is going to come out ahead in this realignment. Trump often talks about rebuilding American manufacturing and restoring American military power around the world, but by torpedoing allies\u2019 trust in us, he has profoundly undermined the strategic capabilities of the U.S. military and tied an anchor around the defense industry, which last year reached a record-breaking $318 billion in overseas sales.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. defense industry lives off exports,\u201d says Withington. \u201cAnd anything that that reduces that will have a serious effect \u2014 and not only on the defense companies themselves but all of the businesses around them geographically. Think about all of the businesses that support the F-35 line in Fort Worth, everything from sandwich joints to real-estate agents and Uber drivers. There\u2019s a whole ecosystem that\u2019s developed. I saw what happened when the U.K.\u2019s defense industry had to retool post\u2013Cold War. Towns that were dependent on it just died.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a winner in all this, it\u2019s Vladimir Putin. \u201cIf you were to sit down with a blank sheet of paper and say, \u2018What are the things, both in terms of domestic and international policy, that an American leader could do that would best suit Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s long-range strategic goals and visions?,\u2019 it looks a lot like the last 70 days,\u201d says Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nAnother big beneficiary is European weapons-makers. Amid a planned surge in regional defense spending, French president Emmanuel Macron is pushing the Dassault Rafale as an alternative to the F-35, and Airbus is doing the same with the Eurofighter Typhoon. Sweden\u2019s Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter jet, has seen its share price double since Trump took office, and German arms titan Rheinmetall has also doubled its stock value since last year. \u201cIf you\u2019re a European defense aerospace manufacturer,\u201d says Barrie, \u201csomebody else is doing your marketing work for you at the moment, and that\u2019s the U.S.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

MS-13 deportations, particularly of leaders, who are a priority for Salvadoran officials, and Trump officials agreed, according to a US official.\n\nBut bringing MS-13 leaders to face charges in the US has been a top priority for the Justice Department, and the transfer is a major loss of potential intelligence for investigators who helped track down L\u00f3pez-Larios for his arrest in Mexico last year, current and former officials say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historical loss,\u201d says a former federal agent who spent years working on MS-13 and other gang cases. \u201cHe was a potential high-level source. And he doesn\u2019t get to face US justice.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios was arrested last year and charged by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn with directing the transnational gang\u2019s activities in the US, El Salvador, Mexico, and other countries.\n\nHe was flown a week ago Saturday to Central America as part of a broader deal under which El Salvador accepted 238 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua held by the US, along with 22 other MS-13 members, according to court documents and US officials briefed on the matter.\n\nThis notice released by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows Cesar Humberto Lopez-Larios. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nIn the US, the flights have become the subject of an intense legal and political fight over whether the Trump administration violated an order from a federal judge who had ordered deportations under the Alien Enemies Act halted even as planes carrying deportees were en route to Central America. The White House and allies have accused US District Judge James Boasberg of intruding on Trump\u2019s executive powers and aiding terrorists.\n\nIn San Salvador, Bukele, whose crackdown on gang violence has buoyed his popularity, is touting the intelligence value of L\u00f3pez-Larios, one of the so-called Twelve Apostles of the Devil, the gang\u2019s top leadership group.\n\nUS prosecutors allege that top gang leaders negotiated deals with the Bukele government to reduce the number of public murders, thereby creating the impression of lower murder rates, in exchange for facilitating the gang\u2019s operations, according to a 2022 indictment filed in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios\u2019s attorney, the Salvadoran Justice and Foreign Relations ministries, and the president\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios was a key capture of Task Force Vulcan, formed in the first Trump term and continued by the Biden administration, which has been elevated under Attorney General Pam Bondi to operate from her office and given broader authority.\n\nGiven his leadership seniority, sources believe L\u00f3pez-Larios could provide a window into not only the gang\u2019s operations in Mexico and the US, but deals made with government officials that have helped gang members avoid US prosecution.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback On GPS: Trump vs the courts 05:55 - Source: CNN On GPS: Trump vs the courts 05:55\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios was awaiting trial in Brooklyn on charges including material support to terrorists and narco-terrorism conspiracy when US Attorney John Durham asked a judge this month to dismiss the charges, citing \u201csensitive and important foreign policy considerations.\u201d Durham, in a letter to the judge overseeing the case, said the US was allowing El Salvador to first pursue prosecution against L\u00f3pez-Larios. (The judge dismissed the case without prejudice.)\n\nThe Brooklyn US Attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nThe former agent who worked on MS-13 investigations says Bukele and Salvadoran officials have resisted extraditing gang members to the US and investigators believe that at least part of the reason Salvadoran officials wanted L\u00f3pez-Larios and other MS-13 members back was to ensure they didn\u2019t cooperate with US investigations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to make sure we won\u2019t get the evidence from someone who can corroborate that he has been cooperating with a terrorist organization,\u201d the former agent said.\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors describe the sophisticated leadership structure that allowed the Twelve Apostles of the Devil members, including L\u00f3pez-Larios, to oversee a vast territory stretching from Long Island, New York, to southern California to Central America. Leaders greenlit murders, directed drug trafficking and weapons smuggling networks, prosecutors say.\n\nAnd they entered into deals with successive Salvadoran governments, extracting better treatment for gang members in prison in exchange for reducing public violence to aid election campaigns, according to the 2020 federal indictment of top MS-13 leaders including L\u00f3pez-Larios filed in Brooklyn.\n\nThis includes the government of Bukele, which has formed close ties with conservative figures, including private military contractor Erik Prince and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Bukele, who became president in 2019 and won reelection last year, celebrated this weekend\u2019s gang deportees\u2019 arrival at the country\u2019s notorious prison called CECOT. He posted a social media video set to dramatic music showing handcuffed prisoners, including L\u00f3pez-Larios, being roughly marched from aircraft to buses and then to the prison facility.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump said he didn\u2019t sign controversial proclamation. The Federal Register shows one with his signature 03:15 - Source: CNN Trump said he didn\u2019t sign controversial proclamation. The Federal Register shows one with his signature 03:15\n\nIn one such deal negotiated between top MS-13 leaders and Bukele government officials, gang leaders \u201cnegotiated with high-level government officials for financial benefits, control of territory, less restrictive prison conditions\u201d to enable MS-13 leaders to keep controlling gang operations, according to a separate 2022 Brooklyn indictment of MS-13 leaders. Gang leaders also \u201cdemanded that the government of El Salvador refuse to extradite MS-13 leaders,\u201d to the US for prosecution, the indictment says.\n\n\u201cIn exchange, MS-13 leaders agreed to reduce the number of public murders in El Salvador, which politically benefitted the government of El Salvador, by creating the perception that the government was reducing the murder rate. When in fact, MS-13 leaders continued to authorize murders where the victims\u2019 bodies were buried or otherwise hidden,\u201d the 2022 indictment says. Gang leaders also agreed to use their influence to direct gang members and their families to support Nuevas Ideas, Bukele\u2019s political party in legislative elections, the indictment says.\n\nAfter elections in 2021, Bukele\u2019s party won a legislative supermajority and promptly ousted the country\u2019s attorney general, who had endorsed extraditions of MS-13 gang leaders to the US, and members of the Salvadoran Supreme Court, according to the 2022 indictment of MS-13 gang leaders filed in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions against two Bukele government officials who the U.S. alleged were involved in negotiating deals that included financial incentives for MS-13 and another group known as the 18th Street Gang in exchange for reduced violence. \u201cIn addition to Salvadoran government financial allocations in 2020, the gangs also received privileges for gang leadership incarcerated in Salvadoran prisons, such as the provision of mobile phones and prostitutes,\u201d the Treasury Department said at the time.\n\nBukele didn\u2019t mention L\u00f3pez-Larios by name but said in a social media post that one of the deportees was \u201ca member of the criminal organization\u2019s highest structure.\u201d He added that \u201cthis will help us finalize intelligence gathering and go after the last remnants of MS-13.\u201d\n\nSaturday night flights\n\nThree government planes carried deportees on March 15, two carrying alleged Tren the Aragua gang members whose deportation was authorized by Trump\u2019s invocation of a 1798 law mostly used in wartime called the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe two planes carrying the Tren de Aragua gang members were already in the air and, according to Justice Department court filings, in international airspace when US District Judge James Boasberg issued to halt the deportations. As a result, government lawyers say, Boasberg\u2019s order that the planes turn around and return to the US didn\u2019t apply.\n\nJustice Department lawyers have cited national security reasons for refusing to disclose more about the third flight that carried the MS-13 members. They also say the plane carrying the MS-13 members was carrying deportees under a separate authority not covered by Boasberg\u2019s order to ground the planes.\n\nBukele, for his part, appeared to relish his role in the controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s defiance of Boasberg\u2019s order.\n\nHe reposted on social media a newspaper headline on the judge\u2019s order with a laughing emoji and a comment: \u201cOopsie\u2026 Too late.\u201d"

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY -- Former U.S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died Sunday.\n\nShe was 49.\n\nLove's family posted news of her death on Love's X account.\n\nShe had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University\u2019s brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment.\n\nLove died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement posted by the family.\n\n\u201cWith grateful hearts filled to overflowing for the profound influence of Mia on our lives, we want you to know that she passed away peacefully,\u201d her family said. \u201cWe are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences.\"\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox referred to Love as a \u201ctrue friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer legacy of service inspired all who knew her,\u201d Cox said in a statement. \u201cWe pray for her family and mourn with them.\u201d\n\nLove entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, a growing community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. She later became the city\u2019s mayor.\n\nIn 2012, Love narrowly lost a bid for the House against the Democratic incumbent, former Rep. Jim Matheson, in a district that covers a string of Salt Lake City suburbs.\n\nShe ran again two years later and defeated first-time candidate Doug Owens by about 7,500 votes.\n\nLove didn\u2019t emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who had suggested that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman couldn\u2019t win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.\n\nShe was briefly considered a rising star within the GOP and she kept her distance from Donald Trump, who was unpopular with many Utah voters, while he was running for president ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2016, facing reelection and following the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump made lewd comments about groping women, Love skipped the Republican National Convention and released a statement saying definitively that she would not vote for Trump. She instead endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP race, but he dropped out months later.\n\nWhile seeking a third term in 2018, Love tried to separate herself Trump on trade and immigration while still backing her party's positions on tax cuts. Despite Republican voters outnumbering Democrats by a nearly three-to-one margin in her district, though, she lost by fewer than 700 votes to former Salt Lake City Mayor Ben McAdams, a Democrat.\n\nTrump called out Love by name in a news conference the morning after she lost, where he also bashed other Republicans who didn\u2019t fully embrace him.\n\n\u201cMia Love gave me no love, and she lost,\u201d Trump said. \u201cToo bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\u201d\n\nAfter her loss, Love served as a political commentator on CNN and as a fellow at the University of Sydney.\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s election in November, Love said she was \u201cOK with the outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Trump says a lot of inconsiderate things that are unfortunate and impossible to defend. However, his policies have a high probability of benefiting all Americans,\u201d Love wrote in a social media post."

People diagnosed with GBM typically have just a year-and-a-half to two years to live, with only a 10% chance of survival after five years, according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nLove told Tapper she began receiving immunotherapy every three weeks since August 2023 as part of a clinical trial at The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University. Love discussed her hopeful outlook despite her then-prognosis of 10-15 months to live \u2013 which she surpassed \u2013 and how her Mormon faith has helped her persevere.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a cure in my faith and in science,\u201d she said. \u201cFunny thing is, my patriarchal blessing said you will have a long and prosperous life, a rich and rewarding life, so long as you decide to remain in public service.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Love later joined CNN as a political commentator and was a rotating guest on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a number of new initiatives to bolster defence in a speech in Warsaw, as European powers appear set to comply with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands that the continent pay for its own protection rather than relying on America.\n\nSpeaking before the Sjem parliament, Prime Minister Tusk declared Friday: \u201cHope is no substitute for strategy. Hope is a beautiful feeling, but in politics, it is often adjacent to naivety or illusion\u2026 Today, Europe is beginning to understand that since the United States expects much greater outlays, determination and courage from us, it must be met.\u201d\n\nDespite already being one of the top spenders in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on NATO defence at around 4 per cent, Poland should increase its spending to at least five per cent of GDP, Tusk said, according to the Gazeta Wyborcza.\n\nThis goal puts Poland in line with Estonia and Lithuania as the first countries in Europe to agree to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for NATO allies to increase their defence spending to at least five per cent of GDP compared to the current baseline of two per cent, which is still unmet by many within the alliance.\n\nAdditionally, Prime Minister Tusk called for Poland to build an army of at least half a million people, including reservists, up from around 200,000 today. To help accomplish this aim, the Polish leader called for the return of military training for all adult men in the country.\n\nTusk denied that this would represent a form of universal military service, saying that it would function more like the Swiss reservist model, in which every man is required to either serve in the military or join another civil service.\n\nFinally, the prime minister also said that Warsaw may consider withdrawing from international treaties such as the Ottawa Treaty and Dublin Convention, which prohibit the use of land mines and cluster bombs.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a profound correction of American geopolitics. We cannot be offended by reality. Every country, especially a power such as the United States, has the right and obligation to shape its foreign policy and strategy,\u201d Tusk told the Polish parliament.\n\n\u201cPoland is not changing its opinion on maintaining the closest possible bond with the United States and the North Atlantic Pact, and at the same time we need to know what is happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis correction primarily concerns the [US]\u2019s change of attitude towards the two warring parties in Ukraine. To Ukraine and Russia. It is not our job to review for the sake of satisfaction and rhetoric the policies of our greatest ally. Our task is to draw conclusions for our safety from these moves and from this change.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of Poland doubling down on its defence comes amid a broader movement across Europe to increase military spending following the re-election of President Donald Trump in the United States.\n\nTrump has long been critical of European nations, preeminent economic powers such as Germany, failing to meet their minimum NATO spending requirements while funding lavish welfare programmes and sending money to Moscow for natural gas.\n\nWhile German politicians previously mocked Trump for warning against overreliance on Russian energy, his warnings were later vindicated following the invasion of Ukraine, after which the Kremlin took retaliatory action against EU sanctions by cutting off natural gas flows to Germany.\n\nBerlin also appears set to invest heavily in its own defence. The likely next coalition government agreed earlier this week to change rules on debt spending to fund a trillion euro ($1.08 trillion) investment in German defence and infrastructure. The European Union is also preparing measures to help member states finance fresh defence spending."

            "full_content": "Big business! Photo: AFP via Getty Images\n\nCryptocurrency investors spent the week waiting for the high-profile \u201csummit\u201d between President Donald Trump and the top suits in decentralized finance. The meeting was supposed to provide some clarity on how the administration would make America more crypto-friendly \u2014 rather than just another proclamation from the new president that everything in token world would be made great again in his second term.\n\nInstead, Trump began yesterday\u2019s meeting, formally known as the White House Digital Assets Summit, by bringing out a soccer trophy.\n\nDoes the WH Crypto Summit get any more unserious?\n\n\n\nAfter disappointing the crypto bros with a nothingburger EO on Bitcoin yesterday, he opens up the Crypto Summit with Gianni Infantino, the President of FIFA, showing off a new trophy.\n\n\n\nOther than FIFA is one of the few\u2026 pic.twitter.com/cOMtWjPbPr \u2014 Novacula Occami (@OccamiCrypto) March 7, 2025\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump had hosted the soccer association\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, to create a task force to organize the 2026 World Cup hosted around the unhappy throuple of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. So he must have felt inspired to bring the soccer guy to the crypto guy conference. Infantino then pitched the crypto billionaires in the room on a coin for FIFA to \u201cconquer the 5 billion soccer fans in the world.\u201d The crowd, with crypto CEOs ranging from Michael Saylor to the Winklevii, did not seem interested in the investment opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt could be quite a coin actually,\u201d Trump said, in one of his few ad-libs of the afternoon. The president is clearly not comfortable riffing on the importance of cryptocurrency beyond just providing value to some of the richest donors to his inaugural fund. Instead, he preferred to stick to the script, telling the multi-millionaire and billionaire men around him that they\u2019ve been \u201cworking very hard and very successfully\u201d and describing how his bitcoin strategic reserve announced last night would become a \u201cvirtual Fort Knox for digital gold.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the summit was devoted to thanking Trump for his interest in cryptocurrency and for putting the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s many crypto investigations on pause.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be more proud of you,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\n\u201cAs a crypto founder, I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be part of your administration,\u201d said Small Business Administration administrator Kelly Loeffler. \u201cYou\u2019re moving at the speed of tech for sure,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cGod bless you for doing this,\u201d said House majority whip Tom Emmer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because of your love of innovators,\u201d said White House crypto adviser David Sacks, who added that the crypto industry was the victim of \u201clawfare\u201d under Biden, just as Trump was. Sacks then kicked a question to one of the Winklevoss twins (Sacks forgot which one) who told him that a year ago he thought he\u2019d \u201cbe more likely to end up in jail than in the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d get attacked the way we did,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss. He was referring to he and his brother\u2019s crypto exchange Gemini, which was charged by the SEC for the sale of unregistered securities under Biden. Now freer to operate with far less regulatory oversight, the Winklevii seemed happy to be there and happy with the summit: \u201cThe U.S. won the internet and the U.S. should win crypto.\u201d\n\nWhat do you notice first about the folks at Donald Trump's first White House Crypto Summit? pic.twitter.com/fkzwQ0aOQX \u2014 Art Candee \ud83c\udf7f\ud83e\udd64 (@ArtCandee) March 7, 2025\n\nWith all this gladhanding, one would expect that the price of major cryptocurrencies would be way up. But bitcoin is down about 4% over the last day. (This is mostly because Trump\u2019s announcement of a bitcoin strategic reserve did not include an order for the government to buy any new coins, only to hold onto the crypto assets that the feds have already seized). While attendees left happy, in terms of actual movement it was another bust in Trump\u2019s strange week toying with crypto. After about 20 minutes, reporters were kicked out of the room and the investors at hand began the work on Trump\u2019s next symbolic announcement that will surely be the one to change cryptocurrency forever."

            "full_content": "Jessica Tisch with senior officials at the 11 p.m. roll call of the 103rd Precinct in Queens. Photo: Natalie Keyssar for New York Magazine\n\nEarly every morning, Jessica Tisch starts getting a series of emails she says she \u201clives or dies\u201d by. They detail for the police commissioner how many murders and rapes, robberies and felony assaults, were recorded over the past day \u2014 how many shooters, how many guns, how many victims, and where it all took place. The slashing on the F train, the Wingstop robbed on Edson Avenue, the elderly man from Williamsburg gone missing, the body found floating near Pier 1 in Brooklyn Heights. In the reports are the running tallies of protests around the city, the street encampments cleared, the unlicensed scooters seized, the cops who were recently disciplined. These are the figures and facts by which she and the more than 50,000 employees of the world\u2019s largest police department will be judged. And if that were all the role entailed, it would be the sort of big-as-the-city challenge she has always chased.\n\nBut doing it all under Eric Adams as his administration cracks beneath scandal has made her whole job particularly complicated. One morning a few weeks ago, his lawyers filed a motion to have his federal bribery indictment tossed; those same lawyers had promised the Justice Department that Adams would use his \u201cpolitical muscle\u201d to make Tisch\u2019s department comply with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda once the case is dismissed. Minutes later, she went to midtown to announce new recruiting initiatives to replace the thousands of cops who left under the previous three police chiefs, two of whom are under federal investigation. It\u2019s diabolically difficult to balance her duties to the NYPD with a need to keep close to the mayor. He shares her views on public safety but also considers the NYPD his \u201cbaby\u201d and himself its \u201coverbearing dad.\u201d\n\nTisch does not need any of these headaches. Her extended family is worth billions. She earned three degrees from Harvard. She has already proved her ability to run big organizations, winning positions at three of the city\u2019s agencies \u2014 information technology, sanitation, and police \u2014 all by age 43. Still, she has pursued these jobs with the sort of fervor that can drive some of her less intense co-workers crazy; one former colleague spoke of 2 a.m. emails that would be followed by another at 4 a.m. if Tisch hadn\u2019t received a reply. During a previous stint at the NYPD, she helped deploy the citywide expansion of the department\u2019s surveillance and data networks and was responsible for introducing the body cameras cops now wear and the specialized phones they carry. If you got a COVID-vaccination appointment at the height of the pandemic, that was thanks to the system the city\u2019s chief information officer built with her team. And if you\u2019ve noticed that mountains of trash bags are now only foothills, you\u2019re seeing her handiwork, too. Largely from behind the scenes, she has been at the center of many of the city\u2019s most important moments over the past two decades, amassing influence and emerging as one of this town\u2019s most consequential figures. Perhaps it\u2019s a bit of false modesty, but even the ultra-ambitious Tisch expresses a bit of surprise at this. \u201cWhen I started at the police department, I didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be here too long,\u201d she tells me when I visit her on the 14th floor of One Police Plaza, the NYPD\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIf back in the day you told me I was going to be the CIO of the city, I would never believe you. Or Sanitation commissioner \u2014 never. And police commissioner \u2014 also never. Like, all of these things were highly improbable to me.\u201d\n\nMayoral candidate Brad Lander on the left is publicly courting her to stay on if Adams leaves, as is the New York Post on the right, which has even been trying to draft her to run for mayor, putting her on the front page over and over. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s mayoral campaign isn\u2019t ruling out another term for her at the NYPD. (Members of the two families have been allies for more than a decade.) \u201cI think she has the ability to be the first female mayor in New York City,\u201d says Bill Bratton, her mentor and a former police commissioner. But after spending time with her and talking to dozens of her friends, colleagues, and adversaries, it\u2019s a little hard for me to see. She can sometimes be awkward in crowds, even crowds of cops, and doesn\u2019t have a politician\u2019s hunger to be on-camera. When I press her about the chatter, her expression goes from uncomfortable to deeply uncomfortable. \u201cI am the police commissioner. I have no ambition to run for office,\u201d she says. I point out that\u2019s not a definitive \u201cno.\u201d And it certainly doesn\u2019t rule out a future run. She just repeats the same two sentences in reverse.\n\nWhat\u2019s undeniable is that Tisch, candidate or not, has been dragged into the city\u2019s politics. At a time when so many of New York\u2019s wannabe leaders seem to be corrupt, lacking substantial experience, only kinda-sorta concerned with public safety, or some combination of all three, Tisch has become a figure for people looking to be led again by a Bloomberg-style technocrat. In a speech in late January, she lashed out at district attorneys who let repeat criminals back on the streets, promised to expand the city\u2019s surveillance systems, and pledged to tackle \u201caggressive panhandling, unruly street vending, public urination\u201d with the rigor once reserved for violent felonies. The quality-of-life push is data-driven, but in this case, it\u2019s about vibes as much as numbers. New York, as measured by major-crime statistics, may be one of the safest major cities in the country, she tells me, \u201cbut without that sense of order in the streets, in the neighborhoods, people don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\n\nClockwise from top left: With Georgina and Emma Bloomberg at the Young Lions Party at the New York Public Library in 2010; in front of a snow plow as Sanitation commissioner in 2023; working as NYPD information-technology deputy in Brooklyn in 2015.

They wore matching blue blazers, and she had a Magen David on her neck. More than a dozen relatives, buddies from Harvard, a group of moms from her kids\u2019 Manhattan prep school, and the mayor were all standing for her. She was about to be sworn in as New York\u2019s 48th police commissioner.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d she said, recalling her first day at the NYPD in 2008: She was a counterterrorism analyst, fresh out of Harvard with a joint law and business degree. \u201cI was in a dark conference room. Well, actually, conference room is quite generous. It was really an oversize closet with a giant refrigerator,\u201d she said, laughing. It was the candidate-processing unit of the personnel bureau. \u201cThe name says it all. I really felt like I was being processed. Streams of outrageously repetitive paperwork, so many rules.\u201d\n\nMany ambitious, civic-minded Ivy League lawyers were joining the NYPD then, in the middle of the \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d They knew it might be different, but this was \u201ca bit like Mars,\u201d recalls Rebecca Weiner, the current intel chief, who came straight from Harvard too. The paramilitary, outer-borough energy of the department was running particularly high when Ray Kelly, a former Marine and beat cop, was in charge.\n\nTisch adapted much more quickly than most. That first day, she began a lifelong professional partnership with another civilian analyst, Ryan Merola; he\u2019s now her chief of staff. She also started bonding with some of the uniformed officers \u2014 the tendency for cops to be the children of cops appealed to someone who came from a tight-knit family. She loved their sense of mission. The rules became a comfort (some of them, anyway). The power to make things happen in a hurry in a top-down organization was thrilling in its own way. \u201cRay Kelly definitely taught me the value of command and control,\u201d Tisch tells me.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Tisch, 27, was tasked with figuring out what to do with more than $100 million in unspent grant money from the federal Department of Homeland Security, which had just built a surveillance network to prevent another terror attack downtown. What if, she asked, the Domain Awareness System went citywide? And what if, instead of trying to stop a suicide bomber, the system tried to spot all kinds of crooks? What if it included the NYPD\u2019s trove of arrest reports and criminal histories? When Tisch sent the privacy guidelines for the system to the lawyers at the New York Civil Liberties Union, they retched. \u201cShe was devastated,\u201d says one colleague from that time. The bosses had the opposite reaction: \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019ve made it. Congratulations,\u2019\u201d the former colleague recalls them saying. Civil libertarians continue to view it \u2014 and her \u2014 with suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s really alarming to see a commissioner who built her career on the infrastructure of mass surveillance,\u201d says Albert Fox Cahn of the NYU Information Law Institute.\n\nIn 2014, when Kelly was replaced by his old rival Bratton, who preferred a team-sport approach to management, Tisch figured she would be fired any day and boxed up her office. Instead, she was given a promotion. She became the NYPD\u2019s first-ever deputy commissioner for information technology, responsible for putting access to the Domain Awareness System into the hands of cops with phones, some of whom still relied on radios and typewriters. Tisch initially contracted to get 36,000 Windows-based smartphones from AT&T, but two years later, Microsoft discontinued its mobile operating system. The Post beat up on Tisch for allegedly wasting $160 million. (AT&T changed out the devices for iPhones for free, so no money was wasted.) It stung. Tisch was (and is) a daily Post reader. \u201cYou believe everything else there,\u201d one former colleague teased her. \u201cBut when the Post is wrong about you, it\u2019s a one-off.\u201d\n\nEight years later, Tisch is still annoyed by the negative coverage. It implies she was sloppy with the small stuff, when she\u2019s absolutely obsessive about it. \u201cShe cared about details down to where the buttons were located \u2014 even the colors of the icons,\u201d says a former colleague who worked on the phone project. He meant it as a compliment. Others differ. \u201cThe most difficult person I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d says another former colleague. A third, who says \u201cit was a good day\u201d if he didn\u2019t cross her path, admitted Tisch was effective. \u201cShe was a positive force, and I had every reason to think that she wasn\u2019t,\u201d this person says. \u201cThe department was better off for her, for her time there.\u201d\n\nBy the time she finished at the NYPD in December 2019, she had learned up close from Bratton and Kelly what it takes to do the job of police commissioner. \u201cNo schooling could ever compare to the opportunity to learn directly from these extraordinary men,\u201d she would later say.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio put her in charge of her own agency and named her the city\u2019s chief information officer \u2014 a promotion, for sure, but one that might have seemed a little sleepier than the previous gig. Until COVID hit. Then the entire city government went virtual. Procuring nearly 100,000 iPads in a single week for public-school kids shifting to remote learning. Helping put together a contact-tracing system for hundreds of thousands of people in less than six weeks. Taking over and replacing the city\u2019s online portal for vaccine shots after the initial one crapped out. Suddenly, the police job was the one that looked easygoing.\n\nAt one point, de Blasio asked what she wanted to do next. Tisch had an answer ready that confused everyone. Munib Islam, a close friend and Upper East Side neighbor, tells me, \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone. My dream job is to be sanitation chief.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe name Tisch was not previously associated with trash collection. At New York University alone, there\u2019s a school for the arts, a center of hospitality, and an entire hospital all named for various Tisches. Then there are the galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the children\u2019s section of the Central Park Zoo, the 92nd Street Y \u2014 you get the idea. Forbes estimates the family\u2019s net worth at north of $10 billion, a financial empire that started with hotels and has grown to include natural-gas pipelines, pharmaceutical packaging, insurance, entertainment, and the New York Giants.\n\nShe grew up on the Upper East Side, went to the Dalton School and then Harvard (with Jared Kushner and Natalie Portman, both of whom remain friends), and eventually returned to the neighborhood, paying $8 million for a duplex there. But Tisch is unusual for women \u201cin our setting,\u201d says her friend Islam. For example, he adds, she has a full-time job; many others don\u2019t. When she goes to see the Rangers with her sons, they get normie seats, not a luxury skybox. When her family and Islam\u2019s went out to eat, he jokes, \u201cthey\u2019d offer a kids\u2019 menu for the two young ones and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Also get a third one for Jessica.\u2019 Her eating habits are like a 10-year-old\u2019s\u201d \u2014 more chicken strips, less omakase. At her wedding to hedge-funder Daniel Levine, she had one request: a Carvel ice-cream cake, just like every middle-class New Yorker had for a fifth-grade birthday. Her mom ordered 500 custom-made individual Fudgie the Whales, one for every guest.\n\nShe and her family are close, but it\u2019s her mother\u2019s side \u2014 which included a rabbi and a Jewish community-center principal from the immigrant, working-class heimische era of the Lower East Side \u2014 where Jessica had her strongest bond. She was her maternal grandmother Sylvia Hiat\u2019s favorite and vice versa. \u201cI think perhaps a lot of my strength comes from having someone who was just so unconditionally focused on me,\u201d she says. When she decided to go into policing, Sylvia was the most supportive. When Jessica later became Sanitation commissioner, responsible for cleaning up the city after a snowstorm, Sylvia \u201cwould wake up every morning, four in the morning \u2014 she was in her 90s at this point \u2014 and pray to Hashem that it wouldn\u2019t snow. Every day, 365 days a year, even in the summer,\u201d Tisch says.\n\nSylvia\u2019s daughter Merryl married James Tisch in 1975 (her sister married his brother). Over time, Merryl became a player in New York\u2019s political, philanthropic, and policy circles. During Cuomo\u2019s time as governor, she was named chancellor of the Board of Regents, the state\u2019s top education position, then chair of the board of the State University of New York. She became known for her work ethic and her enthusiastic deployment of money and power. \u201cWhen my refrigerator is broken, I don\u2019t call the service department,\u201d she was once quoted as saying. \u201cI call the head of G.E.\u201d The mother and daughter still talk all the time, and Merryl is, shall we say, generous with her opinions on \u201ceverything from trash policy, hairstyle, criminal-justice reform,\u201d Tisch says. \u201cShe has a lot of feedback.\u201d\n\nTisch\u2019s mother told the Times that while she loved being a Tisch, she also made sure to cultivate \u201cthe Merryl part of my name.\u201d Multiple people who know the Tisches well say this is a key to the clan\u2019s dynamics. The family name may come from the men. The men may make the money. (Jessica\u2019s younger brothers, Ben and Sam, are in the family business and in finance, respectively.) But the women \u2014 her aunt Laurie, a former Whitney Museum board chair; Sylvia; and Merryl \u2014 have the power to make an impact on civic life. And they have a notion, according to one relative, that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get anything unless you ask for it. But also, you have standing to ask for it.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m not surprised when a former colleague tells me Tisch \u201csaid to me once that one of her biggest personal regrets is that she didn\u2019t take her husband\u2019s name. She\u2019s like, \u2018It would have saved me a lot of drama if I was just Jessica Levine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople ask me why I\u2019m so \u2018driven,\u2019\u201d Tisch says, making air quotes with her fingers. \u201cMy mother is definitely my role model.\u201d Merryl was on her left side when she was sworn in as police commissioner. Her hand was on her grandmother\u2019s Bible.\n\nYou could see this as the culmination of a long family arc \u2014 or another sign of the alliance between the city\u2019s privileged and its police. Jessica\u2019s uncle Andrew served as chairman of the New York City Police Foundation, which funds all sorts of initiatives for the NYPD, and she used a foundation event in January to outline her vision for the force. Some of her predecessors got themselves into trouble by using the foundation for their own purposes. It did pay for an early pilot test of the body cameras Tisch would later deploy, but \u201cevery time Bratton or somebody wanted to do a foundation-related project, I remember her being like, \u2018Can someone else do this? Because I don\u2019t want to do this, given family,\u2019\u201d one colleague tells me. \u201cShe likes to keep up the wall.\u201d\n\nThat seems typical of how Tisch operates: Her single run-in with the city\u2019s conflict-of-interest board in almost 17 years came when she helped pay off a onetime colleague\u2019s student loan; she was fined $2,000. When she was running Sanitation, she and her staff had to work at Times Square through New Year\u2019s Eve to clean up after the open-air party. Business groups would rent out locations like the Hard Rock Cafe, and Sanitation executives would get invited. Tisch told them not to go \u2014 it would violate the gift ban. A former colleague recalls, \u201cNone of us had ever even thought about it.\u201d\n\nHer directive is a little ironic in retrospect. Tisch\u2019s boss is not exactly famous for turning down perks.\n\nAdams and Tisch didn\u2019t know each other well before he became mayor. She spoke to a number of candidates during the election, including his rival Andrew Yang, but she soon saw in the former police captain a \u201ckindred spirit\u201d who shared a back-the-blue worldview and a disdain of the activist left. He gave Tisch her dream job: responsibility for the cleanup of 45 million pounds of garbage every day.\n\nHow was this, of all things, her dream? Was it really her dream? I admit I was skeptical. Tisch, I\u2019ve come to learn, is someone who gets a kick out of making order out of messes \u2014 she completes puzzles for fun. And she likes to measure her successes; she still gets a daily email from Sanitation about the number of rat sightings in the city. (It\u2019s about 2,500 this year, down 25 percent from this time in 2024.)\n\nTisch introduced to Sanitation a bunch of changes: specialized trucks that allowed composting to go citywide, surveillance cameras to catch illegal dumping. Perhaps more important was a shift in attitude. Case in point: An obscure interagency memo resulted in a number of city-owned properties not being cleaned. For 37 years. \u201cOne day, she was like, \u2018Well, how many of these spots are there?\u2019\u201d a high-level Sanitation Department employee says. They counted more than 1,700. \u201cAnd then she was like, \u2018And what would it cost to clean?\u2019 We did the math. We came up with $14 million a year. She went to the mayor and made the case, and we\u2019ve been cleaning them ever since.\u201d\n\nAnd all the while, there was that unrelenting Tisch approach. Kenneth Corey, then the NYPD\u2019s top uniformed officer, remembers getting a call at 8 a.m. one Sunday. \u201cHey, I just sent pictures to your email about this encampment on 14th Street,\u201d Corey remembers her telling him. \u201cHow quickly can you get some people, with my people, to go out and clean this up?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdams was loving all of this. He had been elected to restore a sense of law and order to the city after COVID, and Tisch\u2019s so-called trash revolution became a rare win. \u201cJessica Tisch has risen to every challenge our administration has set before her, proving time and again her commitment to being a part of the team,\u201d he tells me in a statement. She admired him, too. \u201cHe had an 8 a.m. call every morning with a bunch of commissioners and a bunch of deputy mayors,\u201d Tisch tells me. \u201cAnd I would hear him talk about sanitation stuff or policing stuff, and I was like, Oh my God, I can complete this guy\u2019s sentences. This is incredible.\u201d\n\nAt the same time as he set up Tisch at Sanitation, Adams named the highly regarded Keechant Sewell the NYPD\u2019s first female commissioner \u2014 then quickly undercut her. He gave his ex-cop buddies jobs in the administration with authority over the department. Take Tim Pearson, a former detective who put associates in key positions throughout One Police Plaza, naming one head of internal affairs and installing another as Sewell\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cThere were all these ways that people could circumvent the chain of command,\u201d Corey tells me. Corey was replaced with another longtime friend of Adams, Jeff Maddrey, whom Sewell had tried to discipline when Maddrey dropped the case against a gun-waving ex-cop who had menaced a group of children. Adams stepped in to protect him.\n\nSewell quit in June 2023, and Tisch put out the word \u2014 quietly \u2014 that she was interested in the job, according to one former colleague, so Adams didn\u2019t feel boxed in. She thought it was a long shot because even if she was deeply immersed in cop culture, she still wasn\u2019t a cop. \u201cShe would kind of whisper, \u2018I\u2019d love to be police chief, but it\u2019ll never happen,\u2019\u201d Islam says.\n\nEdward Caban, who had joined senior leadership just a year earlier, became commissioner. Kaz Daughtry, Maddrey\u2019s former driver, was promoted six levels to assistant commissioner despite 51 misconduct allegations having been filed against him. John Chell \u2014 who a civil jury found had intentionally shot a man in the back, killing him \u2014 was named chief of patrol. With the mayor\u2019s blessing, they pushed the image of a chest-pounding, deeply political NYPD. Daughtry was sued after a viral video appeared to show him slamming a protester\u2019s head to the ground. Chell savaged reporters, left-wing politicians, and even a judge on social media. Together, they championed an aggressive vehicle-pursuit policy that resulted in the deaths of 13 people. Police morale, already in the toilet, dropped into the sewer. Retirements and resignations remained nearly double from the pre-pandemic levels. Hundreds of officers were transferred without paperwork to desk jobs or to pad out the chiefs\u2019 entourages. Meanwhile, more cops were pulling extra shifts, and overtime spiked to $1.1 billion. Lawsuits piled up against the top brass, too. In April 2024, a reform advocate who worked closely with the police sued Maddrey, Chell, and Daughtry for organizing a smear campaign \u2014 by leaking details of her rape.\n\nIf any of this changed Tisch\u2019s mind about the mayor, she and her circle kept those opinions to themselves. In their view, Adams had always done right by them. And if lots of people around the mayor were getting sued or investigated or both, they reasoned, that wasn\u2019t exactly uncommon in City Hall. Adams \u201csupported me when I wanted to ask every New Yorker to change the way they do something three to five times a week, taking out the trash,\u201d Tisch says. That\u2019s something \u201cno other mayor in 50 years would take on.\u201d\n\nBut by September, the scandal and dysfunction were impossible to ignore. Things hit a comically awful nadir on Labor Day when a gunman killed one person and shot four more at the West Indian Day Parade \u2014 Adams cheered \u201chats off\u201d to the NYPD for the people who didn\u2019t get shot. A little more than three weeks later, the mayor was indicted. (Damian Williams, another Harvard classmate of Tisch\u2019s, filed the charges.) Caban resigned after federal investigators seized his phone as part of an investigation into him and his brother over an alleged protection racket involving the police and nightclub enforcement. His interim successor was promptly raided by the Feds in another matter, and Pearson was also pushed aside. By this point, the administration had been decimated by scandal.\n\nIt was then that Tisch started angling a little less quietly for the commissioner\u2019s chair. She talked to some of the deputy mayors and finally to Adams himself. Given all the allegations of City Hall\u2019s meddling in One Police Plaza\u2019s business, you might expect Adams offered the job with caveats. Or that Tisch took the gig only with promises she would be given independence. Yet some people in her orbit swear there were no terms and conditions from either of them. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t do well with people giving him ultimatums,\u201d says a source close to the administration. \u201c\u2018Come in and save my ass\u2019 doesn\u2019t work because there\u2019s no way to guarantee it saves his ass. And if it\u2019s a \u2018Come in and leave my friends alone,\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nMaybe that sounds like na\u00efvet\u00e9, believing in a guy who has trouble answering honestly whether he\u2019s vegan or not. But in Tisch\u2019s case, trust had been built up over time in her relationship with the mayor and, more important, in herself. \u201cShe has that unbridled faith in her ability to do these things and manage it and get the principal\u201d \u2014 Adams \u2014 \u201cto where the principal needs to go,\u201d Merola says. \u201cShe damn well knows she can accomplish things most can\u2019t.\u201d For a few weeks, there was silence from City Hall. Then Tisch got the word: Her whispered hope was coming true. Now she just had to hope the mayor would actually let go.\n\nLess than three weeks later, she found herself leading a manhunt that had become a global fixation. An unidentified person had assassinated a health-insurance executive in midtown. Five days into the investigation, in a conference room on the 14th floor of One Police Plaza, the department\u2019s chiefs were briefing Tisch on what they had so far on the guy. They had pulled DNA from what they thought were the suspected shooter\u2019s Kind bar and water bottle, but there were no matches. The surveillance-camera network Tisch had helped build wasn\u2019t of much use. Detectives had to go building by building collecting footage, which produced only a handful of partial photos of the shooter, none of them complete enough for a successful facial-recognition match. Adams might have promised over the weekend that the \u201cnet is tightening,\u201d but it was bullshit. Despondent, Tisch slumped in her high-backed leather chair at the head of the table. Kenny, the chief of detectives, started mapping out the next steps in the investigation as the trail cooled. \u201cOh, that sounds like it could take a long time,\u201d she told him, and Kenny agreed. \u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is we could get this guy six months from now.\u201d\n\nSince receiving a text about the shooting while making breakfast for her kids, Tisch had authorized the department to throw everything at finding the shooter: drones, canines, scuba divers, hundreds of detectives and beat cops. She restrained herself from micromanaging the investigation, even though she was dying to call Kenny every 15 minutes for an update. The only break she took was to bring detectives corned beef and pastrami from her grandmother\u2019s favorite, the 2nd Ave Deli.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, she took ten analysts from the NYPD\u2019s intelligence division to help with the case. They scoured social-media profiles of hundreds of young men who both looked like the shooter and had posted about their rage at the health-insurance industry. Tisch debated with Weiner whether potential matches were hot enough to be the guy in the surveillance footage. \u201cI looked at so many photos of people with brown hair, the same complexion. I\u2019d be like, \u2018No, that jawline is not chiseled enough. Those eyebrows are not wild enough,\u2019\u201d Tisch tells me.\n\nShe found herself staring at the possibility of a catastrophic setback \u2014 for the department and for her personally. The killer was already emerging as a folk hero. Who knows how long she would have the job if he wasn\u2019t caught. \u201cI was anxious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m always anxious.\u201d Kenny tried to reassure the room that the global interest in the case could well result in the right person at the right time seeing the photo. Once that happened, Kenny said, the whole thing could be done in as little as five minutes.\n\nFive minutes passed. A call came in to the 14th floor. Someone in Altoona, Pennsylvania, had seen the photo. Tisch started pelting Kenny with questions: \u201cChief, is this right? Do they have him? And who the heck is he?\u201d Then she asked what all the New Yorkers in the room were thinking: \u201cWhere the hell is Altoona?\u201d Tisch hugged everyone when confirmation came back that they had the suspect. Then she told Daughtry to book it to Pennsylvania \u2014 the NYPD had to beat the Feds. She owed it to her detectives, and she knew that was what the mayor would want.\n\nWhen pictures of the alleged shooter, Luigi Mangione, started coming out, he was even better looking than his surveillance shots had suggested. \u201cOh God, this is gonna be a problem,\u201d Tisch said, according to a police colleague. His online fan base was already massive, much to her disgust, and she wanted to bring him back to New York quietly to avoid publicity. But City Hall apparently craved that attention. You\u2019ve seen the pictures: in the foreground, Mangione in an orange jumpsuit; trailing him, a crowd of cops in riot gear \u2014 and Adams.\n\nNotably absent from the photo op was Tisch. Six weeks later, I\u2019m in that conference room and I ask her why. She looks at me like I\u2019ve grown a second head. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to be at a perp walk,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a police commissioner.\u201d Then I press her on what Adams was doing there. It\u2019s the only time in our conversation she can\u2019t quite stay perfectly attached to her boss. \u201cI\u2019m sure he had his own reasons for it. I don\u2019t, don\u2019t \u2014 you can ask him.\u201d\n\nTwo days after Mangione\u2019s arrest, an aide to Maddrey told the Post that the $204,000 in overtime she made was actually a payoff for enduring the senior cop\u2019s sexual abuse. Tisch hadn\u2019t planned on a wholesale housecleaning at headquarters, at least not right away; to her, integrity issues were important but not the most urgent. Then Maddrey forced her hand. She was \u201cbeyond pissed\u201d when she found out, according to one police colleague, and less than three hours later, Maddrey was gone. The next day, she sacked the head of internal affairs, another Pearson ally. The department advocate, in charge of the discipline system, was changed out. Days after that, internal-affairs officers joined the FBI in raiding Maddrey\u2019s home. Adams called the allegations \u201ctroubling,\u201d but according to people in Tisch\u2019s orbit, this time he made no attempt to protect his old friend. Tisch gave Adams a heads-up before major moves, and the unspoken agreement between them held.\n\nThe cleanup is incomplete by design. Tisch gave two of Adams\u2019s people another shot. Chell was promoted to Maddrey\u2019s job, and Daughtry, a self-described student of the \u201cUniversity of Maddrey,\u201d stayed on as deputy commissioner for operations. They appeared to be loyal to Tisch, and they hustled. \u201cYou know who else got promoted seven ranks in two years?\u201d she asks, pointing her thumbs at herself. \u201cPeople rise to meet challenges. That guy\u2019s a crime fighter. So is John Chell,\u201d she adds, citing declining felony statistics.\n\nAnd while Chell toned down his broadsides against progressive judges and district attorneys, Tisch ramped up hers, accusing the authors of Cuomo-era reform bills of turning New York\u2019s criminal-justice system into \u201ca revolving door where there are no consequences\u201d for \u201crepeated violent crime. It is out of all control \u2014 and something has to give.\u201d\n\nThe changes at the top have given senior leaders I spoke with a renewed sense of purpose and energy. How much of that has trickled down to the average cop? I asked around and got a lot of eye rolls: Police commissioners come and go; getting more officers through the door, and more money for the cops who are here, matters more than whoever\u2019s at the top.\n\nWith Mayor Adams at the Luigi Mangione press conference in lower Manhattan in December. Photo: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTisch is trying to undo some of the worst parts of the Adams administration\u2019s legacy at the NYPD, such as the deadly vehicle-pursuit policy, without getting on the wrong side of Adams himself. She\u2019s trying to keep the department out of his machinations with the Trump administration without showing him up and without bringing the cops into direct conflict with the Feds. Meanwhile, she\u2019s got an agenda to push for however long she\u2019s in the commissioner\u2019s chair.\n\nAt the top of her list is doubling down on data-driven policing and surveillance. The city\u2019s camera network showed its limits during the Mangione case; Tisch wants to expand it to include more privately owned cameras so the next manhunt won\u2019t be so labor intensive. Alerts from the ShotSpotter gunshot-detection system may result in confirmed shootings only less than 15 percent of the time, according to the comptroller\u2019s office, but Tisch extended ShotSpotter\u2019s contract, arguing that something is better than nothing. She\u2019s looking to use the data that\u2019s now collected in the Domain Awareness System and measured by CompStat to surge police resources down to a single block. Perhaps the biggest change is that she wants to use those same systems and processes to fight \u201cchaos,\u201d not just crime. Major felonies may be down, especially under Tisch, but complaints about crime reached a ten-year high last year. There\u2019s still a widespread sense of unease, a feeling that the next jump scare is just out of frame. Combating that could be seen as deeply necessary \u2014 and as opening the door to something dystopian: Giuliani-style crackdowns, only with better gear.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many questions about how all that technology is used. These are systems, originally designed for counterterrorism, that Tisch helped expand to general policing. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine their being repurposed again to target immigrants.\n\nThe NYPD already shares information with any number of federal agencies \u2014 and functionally has zero control over what happens next. Tisch says, carefully, that \u201cour policy is very clear that we will not participate in civil immigration enforcement.\u201d As in, the police won\u2019t arrest you if your visa runs out. Of course, the NYPD will work with Homeland Security on criminal cases, but state law forbids anything more. Cops technically aren\u2019t supposed to cooperate on workplace immigration raids or let U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement into schools without a warrant. \u201cWe have policies and procedures in place for this,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is nothing new to this department.\u201d\n\nIt was a by-the-book answer from someone who operates by the book, reassuring in its certainty \u2014 as long as the laws are respected and the entire justice system isn\u2019t suddenly turned upside down. Days after we spoke, the mayor made a joint appearance with \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan on Fox & Friends, floating (and then quickly walking back) the idea of breaking local law to help with Trump\u2019s deportation agenda. Homan promised he would be in the mayor\u2019s office and \u201cup his butt\u201d if Adams didn\u2019t deliver.\n\nTisch didn\u2019t meet with Homan when he was here, and less than four hours after Fox & Friends hit, the NYPD\u2019s official account tweeted that the department will not participate in civil immigration enforcement, \u201cperiod.\u201d Some informed observers saw this as Tisch drawing a line against mayoral pressure \u2014 and as another shrewd political move by someone who seemed to be making a lot of them recently. Others took it as a subtle indicator that Adams was doing Tisch (and his beloved department) a solid, routing the most uncomfortable elements of the ICE relationship through City Hall under Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker and thereby keeping the NYPD out of it. \u201cChauncey is handling all of that,\u201d one police colleague tells me the day after a meeting between Parker, Adams, and Homan.\n\nLess than 72 hours later, Parker and three other deputy mayors announced they would be resigning. Parker was replaced by Daughtry, one of Adams\u2019s most eager, most willing prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n\nThroughout the past few tumultuous weeks, Tisch and Adams have kept up their normal conversations about the department as if there weren\u2019t a shitstorm raining down. \u201cI talk to him often, not as much as I talk to my mother,\u201d she says. The NYPD has been doing its best to show Washington that it cares about catching immigrants accused of felonies. The department added a couple dozen people to the various federal-local task forces. It was being as cooperative as it could on criminal matters, but when ICE calls and says it\u2019s doing a purely immigration-related raid or when new DHS boss Kristi Noem pulls some migrant-bashing publicity stunt, \u201cwe stay the fuck away,\u201d a source close to the Adams administration says of the NYPD. The question is how long they can keep it up.\n\nTisch has spent her entire career putting her faith in the chain of command. What happens now, when the person up the chain is compromised? Throughout her career, she has followed the rules, stuck to the letter of the law. \u201cHer opinion about the law is clear, right? If the law changes, that\u2019s a question for another day,\u201d says a former colleague. She became a star in local government for solving seemingly intractable problems. What if her solutions are reprogrammed for cruelty? What happens when the rules are rewritten? We\u2019re in the Trump years. Norms and traditions and common sense and legal niceties keep getting smashed against the wall."

In one of President Donald Trump\u2019s first moves after returning to office, the White House ordered federal employees in any DEI and accessibility offices to be placed on paid administrative leave. Federal agencies were then directed to terminate the offices themselves.\n\nD3FEHX Georgetown University Law Center building - Washington, DC USA B Christopher/ Alamy Stock Photo/File\n\nCNN has reached out to Martin\u2019s office for comment on Treanor\u2019s response.\n\nTreanor added in the letter Friday that the university \u201cwas founded on the principle that serious and sustained discourse among people of different faiths, cultures, and beliefs promotes intellectual, ethical, and spiritual understanding.\n\n\u201cFor us at Georgetown, this principle is a moral and educational imperative,\u201d the dean continued.\n\nMartin, a right-wing activist and staunch Trump ally, has used his office to aggressively push Trump\u2019s retribution agenda. Within hours of becoming interim US attorney for DC on Inauguration Day, Martin swiftly used his powers to dismiss pending January 6-related cases. He then fired prosecutors who were involved, and launched an internal review to hunt for possible misconduct. Last week, Martin demoted at least eight senior federal prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases.\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Evan Perez, Jamie Gangel, Casey Gannon and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report."

Cabello described Bukele as a \u201cfascist, a creep, and a flatterer of the gringos\u201d and claimed that Bukele is creating \u201cconcentration camps\u201d for \u201cmostly Venezuelan\u201d migrants.\n\n\u201cYou have to be very, very creepy to do what Bukele does,\u201d Cabello said. \u201cI call him so, this is not new \u2014 since he received the presidency I have said that he is a fascist, since he appeared in politics, and what I do is to confirm it now.\u201d\n\nBukele has not publicly commented on Cabello\u2019s accusations at the time of this writing.\n\nThroughout the week, socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and several members of the Venezuelan regime\u2019s top brass have condemned President Donald Trump over his use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport to El Salvador 238 Venezuelans suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua terrorist organization as per the terms of a U.S. agreement signed with Bukele.\n\nThe Maduro regime\u2019s official responses to the deportation of the Venezuelan illegal migrants have included a statement comparing the deportations to \u201cslavery\u201d and \u201cNazi concentration camps,\u201d Maduro publicly vowing to \u201crescue\u201d the migrants \u201ckidnapped\u201d by Bukele, and the opening of a website that allows individuals to denounce the \u201cunjust deportations\u201d of Venezuelan illegal migrants from the U.S., among other local campaigns and events.\n\nAs is customary of Cabello and his socialist talk show, the Venezuelan Interior Minister \u201cdedicated\u201d a Twitter hashtag to Bukele that translates to \u201cBukele Puppy and Lackey\u201d to condemn the Salvadoran president over the deportation of the Venezuelan migrants into his country.\n\nDespite the fact that the Maduro regime banned Twitter from Venezuela in August, Cabello launches new hashtag campaigns on the social media platform every week during the broadcasts of his show to accuse, criticize, or ridicule \u201cenemies\u201d of the Venezuelan socialist regime.\n\nCabello, without presenting proof to substantiate his claims, accused Bukele of allegedly charging $2,000 per each \u201ckidnapped\u201d Venezuelan sent to El Salvador. Cabello threatened Bukele with \u201cjustice in the future\u201d for his actions.\n\n\u201cThey [the United States] pay him 6 million dollars, they paid him right now, but he also charges two thousand dollars for each Venezuelan kidnapped,\u201d Cabello said. \u201cBukele is a kidnapper, he has kidnapped Venezuelans and for them he collects a reward and the world says nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great thing is that we know these characters, and you will see Bukele sooner rather than later in the hands of the U.S. justice. They are going to charge him,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe Venezuelan Interior Minister condemned the United States for allegedly subjecting Venezuelan migrants to \u201charassment, humiliation, mistreatment, persecution with absolutely no respect for anything.\u201d According to Cabello, Venezuelans who have called for human rights sanctions against the Maduro regime also engage in the alleged \u201chumiliation\u201d of Venezuelan migrants.\n\n\u201cAmerican dream? There is no American dream. No, no, no, no, that is not true. What happens is that they always accuse us of not wanting the United States,\u201d Cabello said. \u201cNo, we have nothing against the United States, nor against the people of the United States, much less the people of the United States. Against imperialism, yes. We will be rebels, we will rise up.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday a group of Venezuelans is being subjected to humiliation, humiliation, one could say it, right? To mistreatment, to persecution, they respect absolutely nothing,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere in the United States, here in Venezuela they have their counterpart. There are those who asked for sanctions, asked for the blockade, asked for persecutions.\u201d\n\nCabello further accused the Venezuelan opposition of furthering the \u201cnarrative\u201d that the Maduro regime sent people to other countries to become an \u201carmed wing of the Bolivarian Revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe narrative was made to put Venezuelan men and women in the mouth of the whole world. It is being reversed and will be reversed, you can be sure of that,\u201d Cabello said.\n\nShortly before the start of Cabello\u2019s talk show, dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced the creation of a \u201cCommittee of Relatives of Venezuelans Kidnapped in Concentration Camps in El Salvador.\u201d According to Maduro, the group has contacted \u201cimportant law firms and human rights defenders\u201d in El Salvador to achieve the release of the 238 Venezuelan deportees.\n\n\u201cThis committee will act on the legal side while we act on the diplomatic side, to achieve the goal of freeing these young boys,\u201d Maduro said, calling for Salvadorans and the nation\u2019s Supreme Court to take action to make President Bukele understand that he is \u201ccommitting an illegality that violates human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupreme Court of Justice of El Salvador, magistrates, for the love of God, in the name of Oscar Arnulfo Romero, I ask for justice,\u201d Maduro continued. \u201cThese boys have not committed crimes in El Salvador and must be released and quickly handed over to their families in Venezuela.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s February memo ordering all diversity, equity and inclusion-related content to be removed from Pentagon websites was so vague that military units were instructed to simply use keyword searches like \u201cracism,\u201d \u201cethnicity,\u201d \u201chistory\u201d and \u201cfirst\u201d when searching for articles and photos to remove, and to interpret the directive \u201cbroadly,\u201d multiple defense officials told CNN.\n\nThe implications of Hegseth\u2019s memo were overwhelming, since the Defense Department manages over 1,000 public-facing websites and a huge visual media database known as DVIDS \u2013 with officials expected to purge everything relevant within two weeks. As a result, the manual work of individual units was supplemented with an algorithm that also used keywords to automate much of the purge, officials explained.\n\nOther keywords officials were instructed to search for included \u201cfirsts\u201d in history, including content about the first female ranger and first Black commanding general, as well as the words \u201cLGBTQ,\u201d \u201chistoric,\u201d \u201caccessibility,\u201d \u201copportunity,\u201d \u201cbelonging,\u201d \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201cprivilege,\u201d respect\u201d and \u201cvalues,\u201d according to a list reviewed by CNN.\n\nOne of the articles removed from the US Air Force Air Mobility Command website was about Jaspreet Singh, who was among the first Airmen in the entire US Air Force to be approved to wear a turban as a part of his uniform. The article was also removed from the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst website. Airman 1st Class Briana Cespedes/US Air Force\n\nA defense official acknowledged that, in hindsight, the strict timeline could have been handled differently and said the search terms were suggestions from an internal defense agency to help units meet the secretary\u2019s directive.\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a video posted to X on Thursday that the effort \u201cwas an arduous \u2013 but incredibly important \u2013 undertaking,\u201d with an \u201caggressive timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery now and then, because of the realities of AI tools and other software, some important content was incorrectly pulled offline to be reviewed,\u201d Parnell said. \u201cWe want to be very, very clear: History is not DEI. When content is either mistakenly removed \u2013 or if it is maliciously removed \u2013 we continue to work quickly to restore it.\u201d\n\nOne defense official said of the removal of \u201cfirsts\u201d in the military, \u201cThat\u2019s just history. It\u2019s not really DEI \u2013 it\u2019s literally just history.\u201d\n\nOther keywords to look for included \u201cgender based violence,\u201d \u201ccultural observances,\u201d \u201ccultural awareness,\u201d \u201cAfrican ethnicity,\u201d \u201cAsian ethnicity,\u201d \u201cCaucasian ethnicity\u201d and \u201cHispanic ethnicity.\u201d\n\nOne defense official said every social media post was being pored over to the most minute detail, particularly for things like military partner training abroad. The people tasked with doing so had to determine if a post about a training event for another country\u2019s military that included women, for example, could be tied back to some diversity or inclusion initiative \u2014 or if it was simply because the unit in question was largely made up of women.\n\nMultiple units had to ask for extensions on the deadline because of the amount of content they were combing through in a short period of time, three officials said.\n\nOne of the officials raised concerns with their superior about potential violations of government record retention laws and asked for an extension to ensure everything was in compliance, but their request was denied, according to emails reviewed by CNN.\n\nAnother of the officials said they had to bring in a few other people to their team to help complete it in time, pulling them away from other tasks.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cvalidation teams\u201d are now being dispatched to military bases to ensure that troops are complying with Hegseth\u2019s directive, according to one official and a statement from the Air Force. Multiple officials also confirmed to CNN that a lieutenant colonel has been dispatched from the Pentagon to travel to every combatant command around the world, holding meetings with staff and ensuring compliance with the policy.\n\nThe lack of guidance and the pressure from above to comply has led to a massive \u201covercorrection\u201d and the removal of thousands of articles and images that were either completely unrelated to DEI issues \u2013 like Holocaust remembrance, suicide prevention and the Enola Gay aircraft \u2013 or that commemorated war heroes like World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves and historically significant service members like Jackie Robinson and the Navajo code-talkers.\n\nThis image provided by the US Marine Corps shows World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves during World War II. US Marine Corps/AP\n\nAnd while units made an effort to archive content internally, limitations that exist on various social media platforms made it difficult to do so in the instance officials determined the posts should be brought back. One defense official said Facebook and X, or Twitter, don\u2019t have good archiving tools to keep posts, which meant they were left to take screenshots of them and delete them for good.\n\nThe department is now scrambling to republish some of the content, officials said. But the confusion reflected the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d approach the Trump administration has taken across the federal government that has at times gone too far and forced officials to reverse themselves.\n\nThe time and resources that have been spent on deleting websites and images has also struck officials as at odds with Hegseth\u2019s stated focus on returning the focus of the military to \u201clethality\u201d and \u201cwarfighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf all the things they could be doing, the places they\u2019re putting their focuses on first are really things that just don\u2019t matter \u2026 This was literally a waste of our time,\u201d a defense official said. \u201cThis does absolutely nothing to make us stronger, more lethal, better prepared.\u201d\n\nAnother defense official told CNN on Wednesday that the department is now planning on doubling back and going through the content again with \u201chuman beings\u201d to conduct a more thorough review \u2013 a process that will take even longer to complete."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Thursday and welcome to the start of March Madness. In today\u2019s edition, we explore how Democrats are dealing with calls at town halls to more forcefully push back against President Donald Trump \u2014 and how one lawmaker is stepping into the party\u2019s leadership void. On that note, Jonathan Allen writes that some Democrats are already antsy to get to the presidential primary process started.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\n\ud83d\udea8Breaking news: Trump signed an executive order to begin the dismantling of the Education Department. Completely eliminating the department would require the approval of Congress. Read more \u2192\n\nDemocrats face demands to step up their opposition to Trump\n\nIt isn\u2019t just Republicans getting an earful at local town halls in the wake of President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s federal job and spending cuts, Sahil Kapur, Scott Wong, Brennan Leach and Syedah Asghar report.\n\nDemocrats, too, this week have faced fired-up crowds who want them to step up their fight against Trump. The anger has intensified since Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, prompting questions about whether party leaders are up to the task.\n\nThe most recent example came Wednesday night just outside Denver, where a town hall attendee tore into Sen. Michel Bennet, D-Colo., for voting to confirm some of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. \u201cThe words are great, but I\u2019m really not seeing any action,\u201d the person said.\n\nToward the beginning of the event \u2014 which Bennet held alongside Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo. \u2014 attendees shouted for one full minute as Bennet attempted to calm the crowd.\n\nPressed about whether Schumer should remain Senate Democratic leader, Schumer referred to his call for President Joe Biden to step aside during the 2024 campaign.\n\n\u201cIn dodging your question, let me just say it\u2019s important for people to know, you know, when it\u2019s time to go,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we\u2019re going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\n\nKey numbers: A recent NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats want their elected representatives to stick to their positions and hold the line against Trump, while 32% favor compromising with him. That\u2019s a dramatic shift from Trump\u2019s first term: An April 2017 NBC News poll found that 59% of Democrats favored compromising with Trump, while 33% said lawmakers should stick to their positions.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 leadership void: As Democrats scramble to find an authentic and effective messenger for the second Trump administration, there is a growing desire to elevate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., within the party in some way, according to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists.\n\nAs Ryan Nobles, Melanie Zanona and Jonathan Allen report, some of the initial skepticism among Democrats about the progressive star when she first arrived in Washington six years ago has started to fade as she has established herself as a political player on Capitol Hill and demonstrated a unique knack for communicating with a younger generation.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a Senate primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nStarting Thursday, she is taking her message on the road with a fellow progressive heavyweight, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The pair will hold a series of rallies in swing districts and on college campuses in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado that are expected to draw massive crowds, sparking inevitable questions about her considering a run for higher office \u2014 perhaps even president.\n\nAs for the Republicans: Meanwhile, few GOP lawmakers held town halls this week during the congressional recess after they drew angry and frustrated crowds of their own earlier this year. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised members against holding in-person town halls.\n\nOne who did, though, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., faced a torrent of heckles and boos Wednesday night in Laramie, Wyoming, as she tried to downplay concerns about Trump and Musk, Kate Santaliz and Megan Lebowitz report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with federal government,\u201d Hageman said, adding that the attendees\u2019 \u201chysteria is just really over the top.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats are eager to jumpstart the 2028 primary\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nNikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, can\u2019t wait for the 2028 presidential primaries to get underway.\n\n\u201cThey all need to declare sooner than later,\u201d Fried said of the prospective White House hopefuls. \u201cThey need to get out there. They need to sharpen their knives. They need to excite the base. They need to be able to stand up against what is happening in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nFried said that the energy from campaign events would siphon media attention from President Donald Trump and that she wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the party\u2019s picking its nominee early and all at once.\n\n\u201cWhy not just run and vote in November \u201926?\u201d she said. \u201cForget all of this \u2018Iowa has to go first\u2019 or North Carolina or South Carolina. F--- all that. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nFried isn\u2019t alone in feeling added urgency in the early months of Trump\u2019s term, according to several Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss party strategy. Nor, these officials said, is she the only one who wants to hold primaries and caucuses before the traditional start at the beginning of the election year.\n\nBut it\u2019s too early to begin making decisions about the calendar, three of the officials said. So early, one Democratic National Committee adviser said, that it\u2019s \u201cnot generally on the radar of the leadership of the DNC\u201d yet. And even if the party wanted to change its primary dates, state laws could prevent official contests from taking place before 2028.\n\nAt the same time, new DNC Chair Ken Martin wants to bring back a form of Democrats\u2019 long-abandoned midterm convention in 2026, the DNC adviser said. The party wouldn\u2019t pick its nominee at that time, but it would hold a high-profile conference.\n\nIn small ways, the shadow primary has already begun, with prominent Democrats holding campaign-style rallies, using their elected offices to oppose Trump and, in the case of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, hosting a politics-focused podcast.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s playing this tiptoeing game. [People] know you\u2019re all running \u2014 just go,\u201d Fried said. \u201cThe base wants to know who is our next leader, when can we get out of this funk and start moving on to the next chapter.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udcfa On air: In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Schumer said Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on the judiciary have resulted in a constitutional crisis.

            "full_content": "After having sunk more than a quarter-billion dollars into the 2024 election and then taken a central role in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, billionaire Elon Musk is demonstrating that he\u2019s not done with his efforts to reshape American politics.\n\nMusk, the public face of Trump\u2019s attempts to take a chain saw to the federal bureaucracy, is a constant fixture on White House grounds and on his social media platform, X. Meanwhile, the super PAC he founded is the top outside spender in the April 1 election that will determine the majority on Wisconsin\u2019s state Supreme Court, and he is also demonstrating his willingness to use his wallet to reward Trump loyalists in Congress \u2014 and, some fear, to punish others \u2014 as he closely watches the political landscape.\n\nIt all makes Musk a megadonor without much parallel in modern political history \u2014 someone who not only can fundamentally reshape a campaign with a single check but is also a prominent political figure in his own right, both as a business executive and as the de facto leader of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nIn short, Musk\u2019s prominence, his virtually unlimited bank account and his penchant for controversy are poised to play a big role in upcoming elections \u2014 for both parties, in different ways.\n\nAmerica PAC \u2014 the super PAC Musk started during the last presidential election, which spent more than $261 million primarily on helping Trump \u2014 is the top outside spender in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, having spent about $6.6 million so far on ads and organizing. While the group\u2019s fundraising isn\u2019t public yet, Musk, whose net worth is north of $300 billion, was responsible for the vast majority of the money it raised last year.\n\nThe third-largest outside spender in that race is Building America\u2019s Future, a Republican-aligned nonprofit group to which Musk has previously sent millions of dollars, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Building America\u2019s Future has spent $4.5 million so far in the race, Wisconsin campaign finance documents show, though it\u2019s unclear whether Musk has any current involvement in the effort.\n\nStill, Musk\u2019s past donations and prominent political role have made him a boogeyman in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. A recent ad for Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate running against Republican-backed Judge Brad Schimel, claims that \u201cElon Musk is trying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court because he knows Schimel always helps his big campaign donors.\u201d It\u2019s the first time Musk has appeared in a TV ad in Wisconsin, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending and content, following repeated Democratic mentions of Musk on the trail and in digital ads.\n\nMusk has also been rewarding members of Congress who have expressed support for impeaching judges who issued rulings against elements of Trump\u2019s agenda. A person familiar with Musk\u2019s donations confirmed to NBC News that he gave $6,600 apiece, the maximum campaign donations under federal law, to Reps. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., and Brandon Gill, R-Texas, as well as Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. (Only Van Orden is expected to be running in a competitive race next year.)\n\nThose donations, first reported by The New York Times, were made after the president and his allies railed against a ruling Saturday from Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Boasberg ordered the administration to return flights to El Salvador deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members and return them to the United States. The administration didn\u2019t do so.\n\nTrump has called for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment, while Musk has spent days posting on X in support of efforts to remove judges he perceives to be anti-Trump.\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide said Musk\u2019s direct contributions are \u201cobviously always appreciated\u201d but are \u201cbasically marginal in races like that,\u201d especially when those direct contributions are capped at such a low level, unlike super PAC donations that Musk can make with no limits.\n\nBut it\u2019s \u201cdefinitely beneficial for [Musk] to be involved though,\u201d the aide wrote, adding that Musk was \u201ca huge help in PA and a few other states for us last cycle.\u201d\n\nWhile a handful of $6,600 donations are basically nothing to the world\u2019s richest man, they still send a loud message: He\u2019s watching what congressional Republicans do very closely. And though Musk has focused most of his spending so far on general elections, the notion that he could bankroll an insurgent Republican in a primary race looms large.\n\nMusk said in November that America PAC\u2019s future included playing a \u201csignificant role in primaries\u201d and implied that there\u2019s \u201cno other way\u201d to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d besides funding primary challenges against Republicans who don\u2019t back Trump\u2019s agenda. The warnings aren\u2019t lost on Republicans, including the small sliver who aren\u2019t in lockstep behind Trump.\n\nAt a media availability event this week at the Alaska Legislature, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a critic of some of DOGE\u2019s cuts, lamented that other Republicans may see some of the criticism she has faced from within the party and decide to be \u201czip-lipped, not saying a word, because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to be taken down, they\u2019re going to be primaried.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be that Elon Musk has decided he\u2019s going to take the next billion dollars he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you know what? That may happen, but I\u2019m not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to try to stand up for Alaskans.\u201d\n\nMusk the donor for GOP ads, Musk the character for Democratic ads\n\nMusk didn\u2019t just bankroll America PAC like an ordinary megadonor last year\u2014 he barnstormed swing states on Trump\u2019s behalf, appearing at events held by his group and at rallies alongside Trump as he made the case for the future president. And as he continues to engage on social media and with his political spending, it seems likely he will remain active.\n\nA Trump ally said Musk\u2019s cash would be a huge boost in the 2026 midterm elections \u2014 while noting the GOP could face the typical midterm headwinds, something a check alone wouldn\u2019t be able to fix.\n\n\u201cI think any money is good money to put into these races,\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd it will matter. But what matters more is the environment. If the environment is good, they will need less money. If it\u2019s bad, they will need more.\n\n\u201cWe are in an environment where Republicans have become less reliable voters than Democrats,\u201d this person continued, adding: \u201cWe need to change the composition of the electorate. That\u2019s a much harder task than straight persuasion. And it is a rarity in politics, certainly something that we have not done in decades without Donald Trump on the ballot.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats will have an opportunity, they believe, to use Musk and DOGE\u2019s cuts against the Republican Party \u2014 and to use Musk as a proxy, as in the new TV ad airing in Wisconsin.\n\nThe new NBC News poll found that 39% of registered voters view Musk positively and 51% view him negatively, making his public image worse than both Trump\u2019s and Vice President JD Vance\u2019s. (He\u2019s also far less popular than federal workers, according to the survey.)\n\nVoters are split on DOGE in new NBC News polling, with 46% saying it\u2019s a good idea, 40% saying it\u2019s a bad idea and 14% unsure. But 41% view DOGE positively, and 47% view it negatively. And while a third want DOGE to continue as is, the remaining share of the electorate either want DOGE to slow down or think it\u2019s reckless.\n\nSome of that frustration has fueled criticism at Republican lawmakers\u2019 town halls in recent weeks, energy Democrats believe they can harness.\n\nVoteVets, a progressive veterans group, announced this week it\u2019s launching a six-figure ad campaign criticizing five vulnerable House Republicans with messaging that focuses on Musk and DOGE alone, with no mention of Trump.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans are not going to speak out against Elon Musk buying access to fire middle-class veterans, they\u2019re going to be held accountable to it in the midterms,\u201d said Matt Corridoni, the vice president of communications at VoteVets.\n\nHouse Majority Forward, a super PAC that supports the House Democrats\u2019 political agenda, launched ads and billboards featuring Musk, too, using him as a face of the GOP budget resolution, which Democrats warn could lead to Medicaid cuts. Last month, the group put out messaging guidance telling Democrats: \u201cOn Elon Musk, it is important to focus on how his conflicts of interest as head of DOGE could lead to cuts to Medicare and Social Security and leave the interests of the middle class behind.\u201d\n\nAnd Musk is a fixture in Democratic fundraising ads \u2014 lawmakers like Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Reps. Sean Casten, D-Ill., Robert Garcia, D-Calif., Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., are among those who have launched digital fundraising appeals evoking Musk in recent weeks, according to AdImpact.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re using him as a foil to explain what Republicans are doing \u2014 they\u2019re laying off people, they\u2019re cutting Medicaid benefits, X and Y and Z, and then they are profiting off of that,\u201d said a Democratic strategist involved in House races, explaining the emphasis on Musk. \u201cYou can use Musk as a boogeyman, but you have to relay it back to real-life things that are happening.\u201d\n\nAnother Democratic strategist at a group that\u2019s attacking Musk told NBC News that attacking him serves multiple purposes, both electoral and personal.\n\nIt\u2019s a way to highlight Trump\u2019s \u201cpolicies that are actively harming people,\u201d the strategist said, \u201cand also get under his skin, reminding him he\u2019s not the center of his own show.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get into a mud fight over whether people like Donald Trump, we\u2019ve been shown time and time again that we lose that,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nBut, this person added, \u201cif we show people how these policies are hurting them and we make Trump feel less secure, we win on two planes.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Win McNamee/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn 1994, Democrats lost both chambers of Congress for the first time since 1952 as well as many down-ballot races. Afterward, journalist E.J. Dionne penned a book about the Democratic Party titled They Only Look Dead. Indeed, a comeback began before the ink was dry on this optimistic message. Right now, Democrats are at an emotional low ebb even worse than the one they experienced 30 years ago. After losing the White House and Senate in November, they face an unprecedented onslaught on everything held dear by liberals from a lawless president whose congressional allies have green-lit unimaginable power grabs. And after failing to exploit their one point of leverage over an appropriations bill that consolidated these power grabs, Democrats are at one another\u2019s throats even as a radicalized GOP runs wild and an overwhelmed judiciary seeks to impose some kind of constitutional order on the prevalent chaos.\n\nYes, Donald Trump\u2019s popularity is already flagging, and relief from his reign of terror may lie on the horizon in the midterm elections as his party is very likely to lose its governing trifecta. But with Elon Musk and Russell Vought racing to do permanent damage to the public sector and other institutions that stand in Trump\u2019s way, 2026 seems far away. What can Democrats do right now other than whale at one another? Here are a few ideas.\n\n.\n\nRepublicans were able to enact their spending bill because Senate Democrats (or at least ten of them) decided not to filibuster it to death at the expense of triggering a government shutdown. This sheathing of the filibuster sword was significant because the spending bill was the one clearly identifiable major point of leverage for Democrats, at least until late September (when that spending bill expires). Why? Because most of Trump\u2019s agenda will be advanced through a giant budget-reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered and can pass both Houses on a strict party-line vote.\n\nBut as Bill Scher recently pointed out in Washington Monthly, the threat of a filibuster still matters on those occasions when Republicans want to enact laws that clearly don\u2019t meet the requirements for inclusion in a reconciliation bill:\n\nTwo weeks ago, Senate Democrats blocked a bill that would have banned schools that receive federal funding from allowing transgender girls and women from playing on female sports teams. In January, they derailed a bill that would have put doctors performing emergency late-term abortions at risk of criminal penalties, as well as a bill that would have sanctioned International Criminal Court officials for issuing an arrest warrant to the Israeli Prime Minister. Filibustering those bills was not without political risk for Democrats, but they did so anyway.\n\nThere may be more opportunities in the future: Potentially, a lot of Trump\u2019s agenda items that don\u2019t involve spending or revenues could be ruled out of a reconciliation bill by the Senate parliamentarian (who referees these things) and would thus have to pass through the regular legislative process, which includes the Senate filibuster. Reasserting their willingness to use this weapon where they can is important for Democrats.\n\n.\n\nRepublicans have managed to get two very important bills (the initial budget blueprint and the spending bill) through the closely divided House and Senate with minimal help from Democrats thanks mostly to pressure from the White House. But divisions between House and Senate Republicans still exist. Most crucially, they are not on the same page for the balance between the tax cuts Trump has demanded and the spending cuts necessary to pay for them. There\u2019s potentially an even bigger problem approaching: Senate Republicans are trying to convince the parliamentarian to accept a radical new \u201cscoring\u201d process for tax cuts to pretend the extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 legislation will be \u201cfree\u201d from a budgetary viewpoint. If that fails, they suddenly have a $4.5 trillion hole in the budget to fill.\n\nThe larger point is that there are a variety of fault lines in the GOP\u2019s legislative plans that Democrats should expose, promote, and, where possible, exploit. That could mean siding with Senate Republicans on one issue (e.g., how horrible Medicaid cuts would be) and with House Republicans on another (e.g., how horrible unpaid-for tax cuts for billionaires would be), while encouraging friendly media and activist voices to do the same.\n\n.\n\nThere have been many arguments between Democrats since November about the nature of the anti-Trump message they should be sending, with some focused on the not-so-hidden authoritarianism of the new administration and others insisting on a purely economic pitch. There\u2019s really no time to sort this out, so Democrats may be well advised to adopt a message that includes both the \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cpopulist\u201d angles. Something like: Trump and his lawless band of billionaires led by Elon Musk are breaking laws and the Constitution in order to pull off a massive redistribution of wealth from middle-class Americans to themselves. This has the added advantage of being true.\n\n.\n\nThe best way to signal to Republicans, and to themselves, that the Trump-Musk rampage is undermining whatever limited mandate his narrow 2024 election victory provided is to do well in some special and off-year elections. Quite a few of them are coming up soon, beginning on April 1 when Wisconsin holds a high-stakes, very expensive Supreme Court election and Florida will hold two congressional special elections (which Republicans will likely win but possibly by reduced margins). Later in the year are competitive gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia and much-watched mayoral elections in New York and Pittsburgh, among other cities. Democrats could get early validation of the hypothesis that non-presidential turnout patterns now favor them, particularly without Trump on the ballot.\n\n.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t have the luxury of devoting time to ideological knife fights between progressives and centrists with the wolf quite literally at or even inside the door. The strategic and tactical differences of opinion that afflicted congressional Democrats during the spending-bill struggle need to be resolved quickly (with or without changes in leadership) and should not be conflated with ancient battles between different \u201cwings\u201d of the party. There will be time enough to determine the party\u2019s future shape during the 2028 presidential-nominating contest, which should be wide-open and robust. But it\u2019s not too early to begin thinking about a positive Democratic message and agenda that take fully into account what we have learned about the party\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 particularly the need for a compelling, distinctive approach to inflation, immigration, and government reform. Those weaknesses aren\u2019t just going away, so the time to begin thinking through how to address them begins right now."

            "full_content": "Today, President Donald Trump delivered one of the most influential reforms yet of his presidency: reducing the size of the Department of Education and returning education back to state control. With his Executive Order, President Trump has boldly reimagined what education can \u2013 and should \u2013 look like in our country.\n\nFunding for the Department of Education has more than doubled since 1980 \u2013 yet billions more in funding hasn\u2019t contributed to better education results. In fact, it\u2019s done the opposite.\n\nOver the past 10 years, 8th grade math achievement has dropped two grade levels, while 8th grade reading scores include some of the lowest ever recorded. Over 70 percent of 8th graders are below proficient in reading and math, while nearly one-third of all public school students are behind grade level.\n\nPresident Trump knows that we can \u2013 and must \u2013 do better.\n\nThat\u2019s why I support President Trump\u2019s proposal to return control of our education system to the states, where it belongs. The role of government should be to empower, not over-regulate, and this move will allow for a more localized, innovative, and accountable approach to education that truly serves the needs of our students, families, and educators.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Executive Order will enable long-awaited curriculum and administrative reforms, while expanding opportunities for school choice and educational freedom.\n\nBy returning curriculum to the state and district level, we will finally be able to teach common sense instead of Common Core. It\u2019s time we move past outdated national standardized testing, and instead focus on fresh accountability for academic achievement and new choices for students and parents.\n\nStates will also be able to retool high schools, so that students can get critical work experience in high school. This will enable students to graduate ready for local careers, apprenticeships, or college. Last year, I hosted the National Governors Association on a tour of Southeast Career Technical Academy in Las Vegas, where we saw students graduating ready for careers in construction, the automotive industry, culinary arts, cosmetology, and cybersecurity.\n\nMy fellow governors would agree with me: we desperately need to invest in more vocational high schools and make them more available to more students that wish to pursue that educational path. President Trump\u2019s Executive Order will enable us to do just that.\n\nFor too long, federal mandates, and sometimes partisan politics, have tied our hands and prevented us from implementing school choice programs that empower families. By reducing the size, bureaucracy and power of the U.S. Department of Education, we can create more opportunities for parents to choose the best educational setting for their children. Parents should always have the final say in their child\u2019s education \u2013 not Washington D.C. bureaucrats.\n\nBy removing harmful DEI policies, restoring integrity in women\u2019s sports, and implementing educational freedom, President Trump has already made significant progress in our schools and universities. Returning education to the states is the next critical step in President Trump\u2019s transformational education agenda.\n\nI\u2019m committed to working alongside my fellow governors and President Trump to champion policies that prioritize parental choice, promote accountability and transparency, and put our students first. Education should be about opportunity, and this move will empower states to deliver unprecedented opportunity for every child, regardless of household income or where a child lives.\n\nEducation decisions are best made closest to the student by the people that care most about that student. President Trump understands that, and I\u2019m grateful he took a major step toward improving the lives and preparedness of an entire generation of American children.\n\nJoe Lombardo is the governor of Nevada."

            "full_content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 19 episode of \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes.\u201d\n\nThe movement to resist Donald Trump\u2019s unconstitutional power grab faces two fundamental questions: How bad are things right now? And when is it time to use every possible democratic means to slow his assault?\n\nThis is how democracies end. When independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer joined \u201cAll In.\u201d The interview was clarifying in many ways, but one of my main takeaways is that there is a fundamental difference between how some people view this moment.\n\nSome people think we are in a constitutional crisis \u2014 that there is a plan in place to impose a dictatorship in the United States. On Tuesday\u2019s show, Schumer told me he was not quite ready to declare a constitutional crisis yet. Now, I truly hope Schumer is right, but it makes it very hard to imagine a leader \u201cmeeting the moment\u201d if they don\u2019t believe the moment is even here.\n\nFor me, Trump\u2019s intentions are so clear. He is in the process of attempting to undo the constitutional republic. His executive branch is in the process of overtaking the legislative and judicial branches of government, Congress and the courts, so that he gets to act unilaterally.\n\nEven within his executive purview, this president is purging anything and anyone who falls short of pledging unshakable loyalty to him and his political project. From the FBI to the Justice Department to the Federal Trade Commission, these institutions are being cleared of career officials who may favor the rule of law over Trump\u2019s whims, and they are being replaced with loyalists.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Trump is using the vast powers of the presidency to hobble his political opponents, including bogus investigations into Democratic fundraising platforms and threats to shut down nonprofit organizations he sees as oppositional.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the government or partisan entities. Trump wants to dismantle all forms of public opposition to his power grab, starting with all sources of independent authority. Any institution with credibility must either be bent to Trump\u2019s will or destroyed.\n\nHe has repeatedly threatened independent media outlets, including this one, for coverage he deems to be insufficiently fawning. He is conducting an unprecedented attack on American higher education, including freezing $175 million in federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. And he is seemingly openly defying the Constitution as he tries to deport a legal resident over his protected political speech.\n\nThis is how democracies end \u2014 when independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured. It is clear as day to so many of us, including scholars of authoritarian regimes and especially folks who have lived through those regimes.\n\nI think part of the issue, which is a legitimate concern, is how we got to this point. There is a sense among Democrats \u2014 one that is not totally wrong \u2014 that democracy is not a particularly salient political issue. Democrats spent the entire 2024 election cycle hammering their messaging about the threats to democracy and civil society, but voters were more concerned with pocketbook issues, like the cost of living. Therefore, some Democrats think democracy is a losing issue politically and that we should talk about Medicaid cuts or the effect of Trump\u2019s trade war on the economy.\n\nI understand the instinct to stick to these kitchen-table issues. I don\u2019t think it is necessarily the wrong lesson to have learned from the election. But the terrain has shifted too much since November. Democrats should not be fighting the last war. While that type of resistance worked eight years ago, now is not the time for politics as usual. This is a break-glass moment.\n\n\u2018This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,\u2019 Sen. Chris Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday.\n\nFirst of all, Trump is already underwater on questions about the economy. The state of the stock market is doing a pretty good job messaging pocketbook issues all on its own. But more importantly: Democrats don\u2019t have to choose. It\u2019s all one thing. The threat to democracy has become so much more tangible than it was when folks went to the ballot four months ago, in part because Trump\u2019s entire mad king act is wreaking havoc in every direction.\n\nWith that in mind, a lot of Schumer\u2019s Democratic colleagues believe it\u2019s time to fight back harder, as Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been out there saying.\n\n\u201cThis moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,\u201d Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday. \u201cAnd I get it. A lot of my colleagues said shutting down the government, being in a government shutdown, that\u2019s a risk; that hands power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But how on Earth are we going to ask the American people to take risks for us, right, when there\u2019s a five-alarm constitutional fire and we need them to be out on the streets \u2014 not with hundreds, not with thousands or tens of thousands of people, but with hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 if we\u2019re not willing to take risks ourselves?\u201d\n\nNow is the time to take political risks \u2014 before it is too late. Not to oversimplify, but the whole point of America is that you cannot have one guy in charge of everything, without checks or balances. That is literally the foundational insight upon which the country was built. No kings. Not ever. There is quite possibly nothing that is more fundamentally American."

            "full_content": "A majority of Americans oppose controversial environment, social, and governance (ESG) policies, which state financial officers across the nation have committed to fighting, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.\n\nA survey conducted by TargetPoint, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, found that 56 percent of Americans agree that \u201cESG is a highly subjective, politically charged idea that is forcing progressive policies on everyday Americans resulting in higher prices for nearly everything.\u201d In contrast, 27 percent disagreed with that statement, and 17 percent did not know enough to register an opinion.\n\nEighty-eight percent agreed that the government should focus more on protecting individual rights so that Americans can achieve prosperity, and 86 percent agreed that open debate and civil discourse should be encouraged to find solutions to financial and policy challenges.\n\nESG has become the latest vector through which Wall Street asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Baillie Gifford & Company, and others push companies to adopt leftist policies they otherwise would not back. Asset managers often push companies to adopt policies intended to fight climate change, diversity requirements, and other policies advocating for racial justice.\n\nO.J. Oleka, the CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), said in a statement to Breitbart News that the poll reveals that Americans are increasingly tired of corporations becoming politicized.\n\nHe said:\n\nThis survey shows that most Americans are rooting for what our financial officers are doing. They see state financial officers defending their hard-earned tax dollars from being weaponized against them and their families, whether it\u2019s costly ESG activism or even the CCP. Our financial officers are also leading the fight to stop banks from denying service to American citizens based simply on their political views. It\u2019s no wonder they\u2019ve earned the public\u2019s trust.\n\nWhen asked who they might trust most to make the right decisions on fiscal and financial matters, 47 percent pointed to state financial officers, 31 percent said governors, and 22 percent said congressional lawmakers.\n\nAmericans trust state financial officers more than governors, attorneys general, and legislators when it comes managing a state\u2019s finances, overseeing state investments, ensuring taxpayer dollars are efficiently spent, and ensuring financial transparency.\n\nMany large asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have infamously pushed controversial policies through proxy voting.\n\nHere are some of BlackRock and Baillie Gifford\u2019s most egregious proxy votes:\n\nIn April 2021, BlackRock, which owns 7.5 percent of Abbott Labs, pushed the company to publish a report disclosing the company\u2019s plan to promote racial justice. BlackRock pushed for the move against the wishes of Abbott\u2019s leadership. In a comment about its vote for the proposal, BlackRock commented, \u201cWe recognize the Company\u2019s efforts to date, but believe that supporting the proposal may accelerate company\u2019s progress on material social issues.\u201d\n\nIn May 2021, BlackRock urged United Parcel Services (UPS), of which Blackrock owns 7.3 percent, to issue a report on how the company plans to reduce emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of reducing global temperatures by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius. BlackRock voted for this proposal, commenting, \u201c We are supportive of the company\u2019s efforts to date with respect to this material climate issue but believe that voting in favor may accelerate the company\u2019s progress.\u201d\n\nIn May 2022, BlackRock, which owns 6.8 percent of Home Depot, pushed the company to adopt a shareholder proposal to \u201coversee an independent racial equity audit analyzing Home Depot\u2019s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations, employees, and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed.\u201d BlackRock commented, \u201cWe believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to have access to greater disclosure on this issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nState financial officers have fought back against this sort of leftist encroachment in corporate America.\n\nFor instance, in 2023, 20 state financial officers sent a joint letter to 20 asset management firms and two proxy advisors demanding answers on their approach to shareholders\u2019 proposals.\n\nThe same year, Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ (R) blacklisted 13 financial institutions deemed to be boycotting the energy industry.\n\nIn 2022, Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, banned BlackRock and nine other finance firms from working with the Lone Star State after they declared their hostility to fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cThe environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,\u201d Hegar said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe strong pushback against ESG, in part from state financial officers, led BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in 2023 to lament that he no longer uses the term \u201cESG\u201d as it has been \u201cweaponized.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a mandate to keep fighting to protect the American people\u2019s money from the disaster that is woke political ideology,\u201d Oleka concluded.\n\nUtah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks, the State Financial Officers Foundation national chairman, told Breitbart News, \u201cThese results are certainly encouraging, but not surprising. Families in Utah and nationwide care deeply about their financial security, not just for themselves but for future generations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see radical forces and ideologies being financed with their dollars and rightly expect us to push back. That\u2019s what every SFOF member is doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t rest until these political movements are no longer threatening Americans with our own money to put far-left politics over retirement profits,\u201d he vowed."

            "full_content": "Photo: Paul Christian Gordon/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAcross the country, critics of Elon Musk have taken to town-hall meetings and sidewalk demonstrations to protest the Tesla CEO\u2019s outsize role in the federal government that has resulted in mass layoffs and steep cuts among agencies. But some detractors have escalated their dissent, vandalizing Tesla dealerships and charging stations, many times with arson, to send a message to the world\u2019s richest man and his political partner, Donald Trump.\n\nIn the days since, the Trump administration has rallied behind Musk with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi denouncing the Tesla vandalism as a form of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d and vowing to prosecute the perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law. Bondi made good on her promise on Thursday announcing that the Justice Department has levied charges against three people accused of using Molotov cocktails to destroy Tesla property.\n\n\u201cThe days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\u201d Bondi said in a statement. \u201cLet this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Bondi announces \"severe charges\" aimed at \"wave of domestic terrorism\" against Tesla dealerships/charging stations. pic.twitter.com/e9mL2mgV3p \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) March 20, 2025\n\nOn Friday, Trump jumped in with his own bluster, writing in a Truth Social post that \u201cI look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!\u201d\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s press release, the Justice Department did not name the three individuals but outlined their actions in incidents that occurred in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina. Though the announcement was new, it appeared to be more of a summary of recent actions undertaken by the Justice Department in multiple states over the past few weeks.\n\nIn Oregon, one person was arrested after allegedly throwing multiple Molotov cocktails at a Salem Tesla dealership. Per the agency, they were also armed with a suppressed AR-15 rifle. This account lines up with the arrest of Adam Matthew Lansky, a 41-year-old man whom the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Oregon reported was charged earlier this month with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in South Carolina, 24-year-old Daniel Clarke-Pounder was witnessed spray-painting \u201cF*ck Trump\u201d and \u201cLong Live Ukraine\u201d in red at Tesla charging stations, and reportedly he later used five Molotov cocktails to destroy the chargers. He was arrested and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.\n\nIn Colorado, an individual was arrested after attempting to light Teslas on fire with Molotov cocktails at a dealership, the agency noting that they were found \u201cin possession of materials used to produce additional incendiary weapons.\u201d In February, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Colorado announced 42-year-old Lucy Grace Nelson had been charged with one count of malicious destruction of property.\n\nThe FBI is said to be investigating more recent incidents at Tesla dealerships. On Tuesday, Teslas at a Las Vegas\u2013area center were set on fire and shot numerous times. Musk himself responded to a video of the burning cars on social media. \u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d"

            "full_content": "It isn\u2019t just Republicans getting an earful at local town halls in the wake of President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s federal job and spending cuts.\n\nFrom Colorado to Maryland, Democrats, too, this week have faced fired-up crowds who want them to step up their fight against Trump. The anger has intensified since Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, prompting questions about whether party leaders are up to the task.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers also distanced themselves from Schumer, dumping further criticism on his strategy during the funding fight.\n\nAt a town hall Wednesday evening just outside Denver, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., found himself on the receiving end of anger and criticism from voters for being too passive when it comes to battling Trump.\n\nOne attendee tore into Bennet for voting to confirm several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\n\u201cNone of this feels like you\u2019re fighting for us, for Colorado, for our kids, for our grandkids,\u201d an attendee told Bennet as the crowd cheered. \u201cThe words are great, but I\u2019m really not seeing any action.\u201d\n\nToward the beginning of the event \u2014 which Bennet held in Golden, alongside Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo. \u2014 attendees shouted for one full minute as Bennet attempted to calm the crowd.\n\n\u201cHey. Hey! We\u2019re not going to do it this way,\u201d Bennet yelled, before repeatedly shouting, \u201cStop it!\u201d\n\nBennet was also pressed on whether Schumer should remain Senate Democratic leader. He referenced his call for then-President Joe Biden to step aside during the 2024 campaign.\n\n\u201cIn dodging your question, let me just say it\u2019s important for people to know, you know, when it\u2019s time to go,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we\u2019re going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., was also grilled on how Democrats would confront Trump and Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe need to say \u2018hell no,\u2019\" one attendee told the genteel Ivey at a town hall he hosted this week in Suitland, a suburb outside of Washington. \u201cAnd thank you for being polite with us, but when it comes to fighting these fights, we need you to be a little bit less polite, a little bit more hell no, instead of a little bit no.\u201d\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., called for new Democratic leadership in the Senate. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images file\n\nIn a separate exchange, another attendee repeatedly interrupted the two-term congressman as he tried to answer someone else\u2019s question: \u201cThe House is on fire. It is not business as usual. \u2026 This is outrageous. \u2026 This is bulls---.\u201d\n\nBut Ivey drew loud applause when he became the first Democratic member of Congress to call for Schumer to step down from his post as party leader.\n\n\u201cI respect Chuck Schumer. I think he\u2019s had a great, longstanding career. He\u2019s done a lot of great things, but I\u2019m afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward,\u201d Ivey said.\n\nIn Arizona on Monday, Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego appeared before a less hostile crowd, but faced pointed questions from attendees about how they would protect programs they rely on. Kelly encouraged them to make phone calls and go to the offices of Republican members of Congress.\n\n\u201cYou show up in front of their office, tell them how pissed off you are and how bad this is for our country and how there are people inside the house that you were trying to burn down,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nA Democratic 'tea party' movement?\n\nThe town hall events underscored the increased pressure Democratic members of Congress are under from their base to use every tool possible to block Trump\u2019s agenda, even as they are limited in their role as the minority party in Washington. The scenes mirror the events of 2009, which were directed simultaneously at the Democratic governing trifecta in Washington and at members of the Republican minority who were accused of being too passive in opposition.\n\nA recent NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats want their elected representatives to stick to their positions and hold the line against Trump, while 32% favor compromising with him. That\u2019s a dramatic shift from Trump\u2019s first term: An April 2017 NBC News poll found that 59% of Democrats favored compromising with Trump, while 33% said lawmakers should stick to their positions.\n\nThat\u2019s also led some progressive activists to call for new leadership in Congress. It\u2019s a matter several Democrats declined to directly address this week while offering criticism of Schumer.\n\nAt a town hall in Lowell, Massachusetts, this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Schumer\u2019s decision to allow the GOP funding bill to move through the Senate was \u201cwrong,\u201d but didn\u2019t say whether he should remain the party\u2019s leader.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., dodged a question on Schumer\u2019s future at a news conference in San Francisco, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201copine on internal caucus politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do a lot better the next time a key issue like this comes up,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nFor his part, Schumer canceled a planned book tour this week amid the backlash, citing security concerns. But he has continued to defend his funding strategy in TV interviews, saying that a government shutdown would have resulted in a worse outcome for federal workers and further empower Trump and Musk. And he\u2019s brushed off calls to step down from his leadership position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the best leader for the Senate,\u201d he said Tuesday on CBS Mornings.\u201d\n\nFrustrations mount with lawmakers in both parties\n\nMeanwhile, few Republican lawmakers held town halls this week during the congressional recess after drawing angry and frustrated crowds of their own earlier this year. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised members against holding in-person town halls.\n\nOne who did though, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., faced heckles and boos Wednesday night in Laramie, Wyoming, as she tried to downplay concerns about Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with federal government,\u201d Hageman said, adding that the attendees\u2019 \u201chysteria is just really over the top.\u201d\n\nAnd not every Democrat who has held a town hall in recent days received an icy reception.\n\nAt a Wednesday town hall in Frederick, Maryland, Democratic Reps. April McClain Delaney and Jamie Raskin faced a largely friendly, energized crowd that cheered lines about protecting Medicaid and Social Security and stopping DOGE in the courts, as well as hints of impeaching Trump if Democrats retake the House in 2026. (Raskin is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and any impeachment push would start in his committee.)\n\nStill, several constituents told NBC News they were frustrated by a lack of \u201csubstance\u201d at the town hall.\n\nJuliana Lufkin, 33, a self-employed resident of Hagerstown, said the lawmakers were \u201ctooting their own horns\u201d when she would\u2019ve liked to hear a strategy for combating Trump.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve liked to hear the plan, instead of a little bit of tooting their own horns and saying the things they\u2019re doing and the things that we can do. This is not the leadership that we all hope for,\u201d Lufkin said."

            "full_content": "A series of swatting incidents targeting conservative commentators and journalists have transpired nearly every evening since March 11, according to X posts in which the victims shared video surveillance footage and photos of the events, sparking questions as to who is engaging in what Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) called \u201cdomestic terrorism and attempted murder.\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have also reacted to the wave of dangerous crimes.\n\nThe term \u201cswatting\u201d refers to an anonymous attacker targets someone by making a false call to emergency services \u2014 using anonymous tools like Google Voice or VPNs to make it appear the call is coming from a certain location \u2014 and telling authorities a murder or hostage event is transpiring at a particular address. Swatting is designed to prompt SWAT teams to arrive at the targeted home and descend on unsuspecting victims, which in the past has lead to deadly encounters and murder charges for the offender.\n\nAt the time of this writing, at least 15 figures in conservative politics and media have reported being swatted within the course of one week.\n\nThe string of swatting incidents seemingly began on the evening of March 11, with InfoWars reporter Chase Geiser revealing in an early morning March 12 X post that six to eight \u201cpolice officers used a PA system to call me by name and order me to walk out of my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was handcuffed in the middle of the street, presumably at gunpoint, though I couldn\u2019t tell because of the light being shined on my face,\u201d Geiser recalled. \u201cI was then led into the house where my wife was woken up and we were informed that they received a call from someone pretending to be me and threatening to kill my family.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nGeiser told Breitbart News that he was swatted \u201ctwice in one day, so I was bracing for the second one.\u201d He also noted that the incident occurred \u201cjust days after our reporter Jamie White was murdered.\u201d\n\nThe InfoWars journalist further surmised the swatting attacks are \u201ccoordinated\u201d adding that he believes they are \u201cconnected to antagonism toward Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese violent times have violent ends,\u201d Geiser said, adding, \u201cTo hell with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe following night, independent journalist Nick Sortor announced his family was swatted after his sister received a menacing email.\n\n\u201cBoth my dad and my sister were swatted tonight,\u201d Sortor wrote in an X post published in the early morning hours of March 13. \u201cA dozen cops attempted to kick my dad\u2019s door in at gunpoint. This is literal fucking terrorism. And the FBI should treat it as such.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore calling in the swat, this dumbshit sent my sister an email calling me a Nazi, of course. So the motive is clear,\u201d the journalist continued. \u201cIn my dad\u2019s case, the caller told police my dad was killing my entire family, requiring them to intervene with deadly force.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is nothing short of attempted murder. They wanted the police to kill my father,\u201d Sortor asserted.\n\nThe journalist suspected the attacker\u2019s motive was to encourage him to end his work in conservative media.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for the swatter, I WILL NOT stop. I WILL NOT shut up. And you WILL NOT win,\u201d Sortor declared. \u201cIf anything, my family is behind me even more than they were before. Because they just got a first hand look at the forces I\u2019m fighting with on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nConservative commentator Gunther Eagleman \u2014 who boasts 1.3 million followers on X \u2014 also took to social media to reveal he had been swatted the following day.\n\n\u201cSome ignorant fuck called in a fake hostage situation,\u201d Eagleman said. \u201cFortunately, I have good relations with law enforcement, and extra patrols will be added. I don\u2019t tolerate threats and will find the culprit.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up post, Eagleman shared photos of authorities outside his home, and praised them for \u201cquickly\u201d realizing the incident stemmed from a false report.\n\n\u201cWe have one hell of a SWAT unit out here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThankful for their commitment to ensuring safety and glad they QUICKLY understood what happened.\u201d\n\nEagleman told Breitbart News that the swatting unfolded with his family being held at gunpoint by authorities until his house was cleared, but noted the matter was rapidly deescalated.\n\nThe conservative commentator added that pizza his family never ordered was sent to his residence \u201ca few months ago,\u201d cash on delivery, \u201cthen the swatting on Thursday with another pizza order 30 minutes after the swatting.\u201d\n\nLike others who have been targeted, the receipt for the pizza included specific instructions for the delivery driver to \u201cbang on door.\u201d\n\nAs the multiple swatting incidents began circulating on social media, nationally syndicated conservative radio talk show host Joe Pagliarulo revealed in a March 13 X post, \u201cI was swatted two nights ago.\u201d\n\nPagliarulo shared video footage of the incident, explaining he had initially decided to refrain from disclosing the attack because he didn\u2019t want to give it \u201coxygen,\u201d but changed his mind after seeing it was not an isolated event, and hoping that shedding light on the matter may help others being targeted.\n\nThe conservative radio host explained that at 2:35 a.m. he received an alert on his phone notifying him that a home security camera sensed \u201cmovement at the front door.\u201d\n\nPagliarulo said that upon examining the footage, he saw \u201ca guy holding an AR-15, with a cap on, looking in my window,\u201d and was not immediately certain that the armed man outside his home was an officer.\n\n\u201cNow, at that point, you say to yourself, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got a rifle, too,'\u201d Pagliarulo said, adding that he instead decided to call the police on the off chance he was being swatted.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nThe radio host said the 911 dispatcher confirmed police were at his residence and informed him authorities had received a report claiming \u201cdogs have been shot, people were bleeding, and people were hiding\u201d inside his house.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018None of that\u2019s happening, please tell them to stand down. I\u2019ll come out with my hands up while I have you on the phone with me, and I\u2019ll explain what\u2019s going on,'\u201d Pagliarulo recalled.\n\n\u201cThankfully, one [of the officers] knew that it was me, and we had a conversation,\u201d the radio host added.\n\nPagliarulo deemed the swatting incident \u201ca tactic of the left.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tactic of those who don\u2019t like my politics,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir hope is to either scare you \u2014 or have you come out and confront the police officers and get killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I would have grabbed my AR-15 or my pistol and walked out the front door, I would have been dead in my doorway,\u201d Pagliarulo asserted. \u201cHad I taken any other action, I might have been killed at my house that night \u2014 and maybe that\u2019s the result they want.\u201d\n\nLater that evening, conservative commentator and host of LFA TV\u2019s UNGOVERNED Shawn Farash announced, \u201cI\u2019m being swatted right now\u201d in an X post.\n\nIn a follow-up post, Farash revealed that multiple pizzas he did not order were delivered to his address from at least two separate establishments.\n\n\u201cNow Dominoes showed up to the house,\u201d the conservative commentator wrote in a post one hour after his swatting announcement, adding, \u201cWe did not accept the pizza.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow Papa John\u2019s showed up,\u201d Farash revealed in a follow-up post, to which Eagleman replied by sharing that he, too, had received an unwanted pizza delivery surrounding his own swatting incident.\n\nFarash elaborated on the incident in a video posted to social media, stating, \u201cOfficers said they received a phone call that somebody murdered somebody in the house and was planning a suicide by cop,\u201d adding that he and his wife \u201ccooperated with police.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were very nice,\u201d Farash said. \u201cThey were not aware that this was going on across the country.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cIf not for the professionalism of our Sheriff\u2019s Department in Rutherford County, Tennessee, it could have been much worse,\u201d Farash told Breitbart News. \u201cBoth my wife and I have never had guns pointed at us before and that changed on Thursday, March 13th.\u201d\n\n\u201cI absolutely believe these attacks are coordinated due to the fact that many people who have been swatted had identical experiences, similar 911 calls, and the delivery of pizza to their homes with the same instructions to \u2018bang on the door\u2019 as well,\u201d Farash added.\n\nWhen asked if he noticed any patterns regarding those who are being targeted via swatting attacks, Farash \u2014 like Geiser and Pagliarulo \u2014 surmised it may have something to do with conservatives\u2019 commentary about Ukraine, adding, \u201cbut that hasn\u2019t been confirmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal here I believe is to scare people in to silence, much like the \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019 label scared parents away from school board meetings in 2021 and 2022,\u201d Farash presumed.\n\n\u201cWhile this will be difficult to trace, I believe it can and will be done thanks to new leadership at the FBI and the seriousness of these attacks,\u201d he added. \u201cThankfully, we remained safe and I hope that others can say the same thing if it happens to them. I believe those behind this will be caught and punished to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\nThe night after Farash\u2019s home was targeted \u2014 during the early morning hours of March 14 \u2014 independent investigative journalist Walter Curt proclaimed, \u201cWas just swatted\u201d in a 3:30 a.m. X post.\n\nCurt shared video footage of the incident and advised others to \u201csimply comply\u201d with authorities if they find themselves in a similar situation.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nCurt told Breitbart News that while he was surprised he was targeted, he fortunately \u201cdid not panic\u201d when he awoke in the middle of the night to find himself being swatted, as he had \u201cjust written an article about the swattings earlier in the evening\u201d and \u201cit was still fresh in my mind.\u201d\n\nThe journalist was nonetheless perplexed as to \u201cwhy exactly\u201d he was attacked, citing having only around 50,000 X followers at the time of the incident, and being \u201ca small account in comparison to the others who were targeted.\u201d\n\nCurt added that he believes this is a coordinated attack stemming from \u201ca single group\u201d using similar voice changers when placing fake calls to authorities across the country.\n\nLike the others who were assailed, Curt noted having been sent unordered pizza, adding that he and others have noticed a pattern of \u201creceiving pizzas within one day of the swatting, and all of them are the exact same order, and the phone numbers all link back to the local PD dispatch.\u201d\n\nCurt also told Breitbart News he believes it is unlikely that swatting targets are being chosen based on their Ukraine-related commentary, as \u201cthe list of people is growing daily,\u201d and while all of the victims are conservative, everyone\u2019s political commentary involves a wide range of topics.\n\n\u201cThe only link truly appears to be the X platform,\u201d Curt said, surmising the attacks could perhaps be adjacent to the left\u2019s targeting of Elon Musk, whose Tesla dealerships and vehicles have been blitzed with arson in recent months.\n\nThe same night Curt was attacked, the popular X account Catturd \u2014 who boasts 3.6 million followers on Musk\u2019s platform \u2014 revealed in a 3:45 a.m. post, \u201cI was just swatted again for the 4th time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live in the middle of nowhere and know all the cops here (because of the past swattings),\u201d Catturd explained. \u201cThey knew what it was immediately and just called me and sent one officer who I just had a great conversation with. Really nice guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the number they called from and will turn all the info over to the FBI today,\u201d Catturd added. \u201cMy last two swatters are sitting in prison right now, this new one will be joining them soon.\u201d\n\nConservative writer Mike Engleman responded to Catturd\u2019s post, declaring that he, too, was swatted that night \u2014 at 1:30 a.m.\n\nOn Friday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel addressed \u201cthe alarming rise in \u2018Swatting\u2019 incidents targeting media figures\u201d in an X post, declaring, \u201cThe FBI is aware of this dangerous trend, and my team and I are already taking action to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d Patel continued. \u201cWeaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers. That will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to working with local law enforcement to crack down on these crimes,\u201d the FBI director added, promising, \u201cMore updates to come.\u201d\n\nThen on Saturday night, conservative commentator Matt Van Swol announced in an X post, \u201cI am being swatted right now,\u201d later adding, \u201cA call was made saying that I had murdered my wife and I was hiding in the basement with a gun.\u201d\n\nVan Swol shared footage of the incident, imploring his followers to \u201cwatch and understand how this could have gone horribly wrong if this was you and your home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nLike other swatting victims, Van Swol also noted a \u201cpizza delivery has arrived,\u201d adding, \u201cThe phone number used to place the order was the number for our police department.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up post, Van Swol revealed he had a long phone call with one of the police officers who responded to the swatting call, adding, \u201cHe was so upset. We both acknowledged how the situation could have gone terribly wrong, for both of us.\u201d\n\nThe officer \u201calso informed me that two ambulances, a fire truck, and nearly every cop on duty that night in the entire county was staged or rushing to stage at our home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough it was scary for us, it was also absolutely terrifying for the police force in Western North Carolina as well,\u201d Van Swol added. \u201cI want to commend the officer who calmly assessed the situation under extreme stress, his level head saved lives.\u201d\n\nVan Swol told Breitbart News the police record from the swatting attack was \u201chorrifying to read,\u201d explaining that police had falsely believed multiple men were inside his house, shooting people.\n\n\u201cI have three kids who were asleep in their beds at the time of the swatting,\u201d he added.\n\nVan Swol said that before being targeted, he was already aware of swatting attacks transpiring across the country, and had therefore personally walked into his local police department to warn them of a potential false report.\n\n\u201cI thought I was crazy for even doing it, and even I did not expect it to happen to me,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cthe information was not passed along to the officers working that evening and it was a complete surprise to everyone,\u201d Van Swol said.\n\nLike Curt, Van Swol also surmised the swatting attacks have \u201conly to do with voices on X.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Townhall columnist Dustin Grage took to X to reveal that he and his family had been swatted on Saturday night as well, adding, \u201cShortly after, we were also delivered pizzas we never ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot every victim of swatting has the same relationship with law enforcement as our family, nor may they have as excellent police departments,\u201d Grage said. \u201cSome aren\u2019t as fortunate, and innocent people lose their lives as a result.\u201d\n\nThe Townhall columnist went on to say, \u201cWe aren\u2019t taking this lightly. We are treating this threat seriously and see it no differently than an intentional attack on the lives of my wife, our young children, and myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery law enforcement resource available will be used to track down whoever is responsible for these swatting attempts,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will also be lobbying the highest levels of government to ensure justice is served and to push for stronger deterrents against future acts of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThen on Sunday evening, Sean George \u2014 an elected delegate for the state of Nebraska and coffee company owner, known as Beard Vet on social media \u2014 proclaimed, \u201cWelp\u2026 Add me to the SWATTED List\u201d in an X post.\n\nGeorge told Breitbart News the incident occurred during the early hours of Sunday morning, at 2:43 a.m.\n\n\u201cI hope they find the perpetrators behind this and charge them with the highest crime they can,\u201d George said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s definitely a domestic terrorism, attempted murder case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have full faith in the authorities, and hopefully they can track these people down and bring them to justice,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the meantime, swatting attacks against conservatives continued into the following week, according to columnist Larry Taunton and Trump campaign media surrogate Chad Caton, who both reported becoming targets during the early hours of Monday morning.\n\n\u201cI was in bed, but noticed Ranger, my German shepherd, was on the prowl, his ears up,\u201d Taunton recalled. \u201cI then saw a flicker of light on my BR door. Ranger went to investigate, I got my gun.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI saw the silhouette of a man on my deck with an AR15,\u201d Taunton continued. \u201cI could hear whispers and saw two other men also in body armor, heavily armed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI turned on a light and told them to identify themselves,\u201d the conservative columnist explained. \u201cThey did as you\u2019ll see, by I kept my weapon. It de-escalated from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe officers told me they\u2019d received a call from someone claiming to be in my home and hiding while I shot people,\u201d Taunton added of the fake 911 call.\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cThese were good guys, just doing their jobs,\u201d Taunton stressed, but reminded his followers, \u201cThis might have been a bloodbath\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for \u201crestraint on both sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was an attempt to get me and my wife killed. It ended in smiles, handshakes,\u201d Taunton said.\n\nTaunton told Breitbart News, \u201cThis is fundamentally who leftists are these days. It\u2019s like what you\u2019re seeing with the burning of Teslas and the burning of cities in 2020. When they don\u2019t get their way, they adopt terrorist tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is. This is terrorism,\u201d Taunton continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to assassinate people by proxy. They\u2019re weaponizing local police and sheriff\u2019s departments as proxy assassination squads. And they don\u2019t care who gets killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care if police officers, deputies get killed, if I get killed, my wife and children,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re creating, very knowingly, a highly combustible atmosphere where this could happen.\u201d\n\nTaunton also pointed out that more lives in other parts of town could be put at risk due to police departments putting all of their resources into addressing false swatting calls.\n\n\u201cNot only can [fake 911 calls] get me or police killed, but let\u2019s say you live on the other side of the county or town, and you have a genuine emergency, and all resources are over at my house chasing down a bogus call, that\u2019s terrible,\u201d he said.\n\nCaton, meanwhile, shared photos of a similar event transpiring at his house the same night, telling Breitbart News the incident unfolded at 3:00 a.m. when he \u201cheard a bang at the door\u201d followed by his dog barking.\n\n\u201cI reached for my sidearm, of course, thinking I\u2019m being broken into, but then I remembered all my buddies had been getting swatted,\u201d Caton said. \u201cI put my gun down and walked in my living room. My glass door was filled with lights and an officer yelling at me to put my hands up.\u201d\n\nFrom there, police ordered Caton to walk to his door and open it slowly, \u201cThen they put me in handcuffs and asked who else was in the house. I said my wife was still in the house, and my dog,\u201d he said.\n\nCaton explained that his wife was then ordered to come to the door with her hands up.\n\n\u201cI will never forget standing behind one of the officers with a rifle trained on my door, and seeing my wife open the door with a rifle pointed at her head. And I just kept saying to him, \u2018Please don\u2019t shoot my wife,'\u201d Caton told Breitbart News.\n\nOnce Caton and his wife were outside, \u201call the officers lined up at the front door with their hands on each other\u2019s shoulders and their rifles trained inside my house, they then, just like the movies, went through and cleared my whole house,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir dog, who Caton\u2019s wife had locked in a separate room for safety measures, was then let out so that officers could clear that room as well. After authorities decided the area was secure, they removed the handcuffs and explained why they had arrived.\n\n\u201cThey said that they got a call from me, Chad Caton, that I was in my house, hiding, and that there were armed gunmen in my house,\u201d Caton told Breitbart News of the fake 911 call.\n\nLater that day, at around 6:00 p.m., \u201cI started getting pizzas delivered to my house, constantly,\u201d Caton added. \u201cThat\u2019s their [the attackers\u2019] calling card. They send pizzas after the swatting.\u201d\n\nAfter that, former nurse and alleged Bill Clinton rape victim Juanita Broaddrick \u2014 who announced on Friday that three pizzas she did not order were delivered to her house, also with instructions to \u201cbang on the door\u201d \u2014 revealed on Monday night that she, too, had been swatted.\n\n\u201cAbout ten police and swat team showed up,\u201d Broaddrick said. \u201cThey said the caller said there were two masked men and people inside had been shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shit needs to stop,\u201d she added.\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cWhoever is doing this needs to face justice,\u201d Elon Musk said in response to Broaddrick\u2019s post.\n\nThe latest swatting incident occurred on Tuesday night, according to InfoWars reporter Owen Shroyer, who shared harrowing footage of himself being detained by authorities outside his house after a fake call was made to police.\n\nShroyer shared several videos from the incident, including one captured on his cellphone that showcased how the swatting unfolded.\n\n\u201cI assure you, this is a nonstarter, gentlemen,\u201d the InfoWars journalist says to police, who respond by ordering him to remove his shirt and walk backwards, toward the officers, with his hands on his head.\n\nWhile approaching the officers, Shroyer adds, \u201cJust so you guys know, I\u2019m home alone. This is a false police report,\u201d to which one officer replies by demanding the journalist continue walking backward toward authorities, while another says, \u201cWe hear you, bro, we just gotta do our job.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Shroyer responds.\n\nThe journalist is then ordered to lay on the ground, where he is detained by authorities while sirens wail. Officers can then be seen descending on Shroyer\u2019s now-empty house, shouting, \u201cAustin Police Department, make yourself known! Come to the front door!\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cHere come the pizzas,\u201d Shroyer declared in an X post the following afternoon, sharing multiple videos of the bizarre pizza deliveries that infamously arrive before or after each swatting attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi reacted to the swatting crisis in an interview with Fox News, calling the incidents \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d adding that the Department of Justice is taking the matter \u201cvery, very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking into all of these swatting investigations,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cThey are not practical jokes. They are meant to terrorize the individuals within the homes, and they risk the lives of law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino also responded to the swatting incidents, declaring in a Wednesday night X post, \u201cCommunication and transparency are my priorities. We work for you, the American citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur teams are actively working on the Tesla incidents and the swatting incidents, along with our other responsibilities to keep the Homeland safe,\u201d Bongino added.\n\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will not sit idly by as conservative new media and their families are being targeted by false swatting,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a Wednesday X post.\n\nNoem added that the Department of Homeland Security \u201chas the ability to trace phone numbers and track location information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will use it to hunt these cowards down. This is an attack on our law enforcement and innocent families and we will prosecute it as such,\u201d Noem said.\n\n\u201cSwatting is domestic terrorism and attempted murder,\u201d Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) said on Monday. \u201cToo many of my constituents are being targeted by Leftists, hoping to silence their speech.\u201d \u201cThis is not a game. It\u2019s political violence. Someone could get killed.

            "full_content": "Anti-immigrant activist and presidential adviser Stephen Miller speaks to Trump in the Oval Office. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump campaigned in 2024 on a promise to launch the \u201clargest mass deportation in history\u201d of undocumented immigrants. It was one of his more popular promises, too, though polls show varying degrees of support for this effort depending on how sweeping it is and how much collateral damage to rights (and to the economy) is involved.\n\nFor all the noise and heat ICE raids are generating, large-scale deportations of illegal immigrants are rolling out slowly because they will require both significant new dollars that Congress has yet to provide, along with major requisitions of state and local law-enforcement resources. But at the same time, the administration is also challenging legal immigration, and those who have benefited from it in the past. Here are the four different avenues the administration appears to be pursuing to go after people legally in this country.\n\n.\n\nThe Trump administration is targeting people who have Temporary Protected Status, which protects them from deportation, because they are refugees from war-torn or tyrannical countries. During the campaign, Trump talked a lot about Venezuelan and Haitian migrants who were supposedly terrorizing American cities. But it still came as a surprise to Venezuelans \u2014 many of them avid Trump supporters \u2014 who at one fell swoop lost their TPS status when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled it on February 1. This action stripped 348,000 Venezuelan refugees of their right to stay in the country as of April.\n\nThe exposure to mass deportations of previously legal Venezuelan refugees has been fuzzed up significantly by the administration\u2019s claims that the people ICE is rounding up and flying to prisons in El Salvador are all members of violent gangs (claims that have produced a potentially catastrophic collision with the federal judiciary). But the TPS revocation applies to everyone, criminal or noncriminal, and represents a major restriction in legal immigration.\n\nVenezuelans are just the first group to lose TPS status; a previous extension for this group happened to expire earliest. On February 20, Noem also canceled TPS for Haitians beginning in August. That will expose about 300,000 legal immigrants to deportation.\n\n.\n\nIn recent weeks there have been reports of the Trump administration deporting immigrants who have permanent-residence status (known as a \u201cgreen card\u201d) or are in the country legally on various visas. The deportations have mostly been justified on national-security grounds, though nearly all of them are being challenged in federal courts. As my colleague Chas Danner explained, legal or illegal immigration status appears to have been disregarded entirely in such cases:\n\nThese incidents have come as President Trump cracks down on all kinds of immigration and as international tourists are reportedly canceling or reconsidering their U.S. travel plans in response to various administration policies. But it can be difficult to determine whether these are isolated cases of routine enforcement or whether they presage a new era of arbitrary punishment. Last week\u2019s arrest of green-card holder and former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was clearly political \u2014 which he is now calling attention to \u2014 while other cases seem more happenstance.\n\nRecent deportees have included those holding student visas, \u201chigh-skills\u201d H1-B visas, and even tourist visas. Again, these are not the \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants Trump promised to deport; they are fully documented. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\n\n.\n\nOn his very first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that purportedly ended \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d though the 14th Amendment says quite clearly, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d The administration is advancing a fringe argument that the children of undocumented immigrants are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. Trump\u2019s order would also deny birthright citizenship to anyone whose parents weren\u2019t at least permanent residents. As NPR explained, this is a deliberately provocative decision:\n\nAlready, three federal judges in three different states have blocked Trump\u2019s executive order voiding birthright citizenship, and three separate appeals courts have refused to unblock those court orders. Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee in Washington state, was the first judge to block Trump\u2019s executive order, calling it \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nBut Thursday, in three separate \u2014 but nearly identical \u2014 filings, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to narrow the lower court orders, which apply nationwide, so that the administration could begin planning to put into effect its new policy against birthright citizenship.\n\nThe administration may have put a toe in the water on this issue via the deportation of a 10-year-old citizen who was in the country to secure life-saving medical treatment, as NBC News reports:\n\nA family that was deported to Mexico hopes they can find a way to return to the U.S. and ensure their 10-year-old daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, can continue her brain cancer treatment.\n\nImmigration authorities removed the girl and four of her American siblings from Texas on Feb. 4, when they deported their undocumented parents.\n\n.\n\nStill another frontier in restricting legal immigration was initially broached during the first Trump administration: revoking naturalizations. This harkened back to a Cold War\u2013era drive to denaturalize communist citizens, as USA Today explains:\n\nThe Supreme Court put an end to politically driven denaturalization campaigns in 1967, ruling that the government could only revoke an immigrant\u2019s citizenship in the case of fraud or \u201cwillful misrepresentation.\u201d\n\nIn the quarter century before Trump first took office, from 1990 to 2017, the U.S. government targeted an average of 11 naturalized citizens per year, according to Frost\u2019s research.\n\nMost of those had committed war crimes or other atrocities, then lied about their past to obtain citizenship.\n\n\u201cIn the first Trump administration, we saw quite a large increase in the number of denaturalization proceedings,\u201d Burke Robertson said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear his (new) administration seems to be starting where they left off.\u201d\n\nNow Axios reports that denaturalization is back on the front burner:\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be on the horizon are denaturalization cases,\u201d said Mike Davis, a close White House ally and founder of the conservative Article III Project.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have Hamas supporters who have been naturalized within the last 10 years, and they are eligible to lose their status as citizens and get deported,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nGiven what we know about this administration\u2019s rather broad definition of \u201cHamas supporters,\u201d a lot of people are probably going to lose their citizenship along with their First Amendment rights."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nSummary The used Tesla market is struggling, with searches decreasing 16% while prices fall at double the rate of average used cars.\n\nSome Tesla owners report buyer's remorse amid vandalism concerns and personal feelings about CEO Elon Musk's government role.\n\nData shows Tesla loyalty declining in Democratic-leaning states while slightly increasing in Republican-leaning states.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have publicly supported Tesla, with Trump offering to purchase one at full price.\n\nAnalysts attribute Tesla's challenges to increased competition, with 76 used electric vehicle models now available compared to 58 last year.\n\nAs Elon Musk continues to take an outsized and controversial role in the US government, reports of harassment of Tesla owners and vandalism of showrooms and vehicles are on rise. That may, in part, be contributing to plunging resale values and interest in used Teslas in the United States.\n\nThough Tesla has enjoyed the attention of President Donald Trump, its stock price has erased all of its gains since Election Day. It reported its first-ever drop in global sales last year, and it faces stiff competition in China and slumping sales in Europe. In the United States, Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, has faced blowback for his cost-cutting actions in the federal government.\n\nDespite the record low prices for a Tesla on the used market and a prominent advertisement by the president of the United States, the cars have been having a tough time finding buyers, according to a March survey from Cars.com.\n\nSearches for used Teslas decreased 16% over the past month, while demand for used non-Tesla electric vehicles has increased 28% over the past year.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just internet searches. CarGurus, a car-buying site, found that used Tesla prices are falling at more than double the rate of the average used car price. The Cybertruck, the controversial steel-sided pickup, fared the worst of any Tesla vehicle, with a resale value 58% less than its original price, according to CarGurus.\n\nDemonstrators hold anti-Tesla posters during a protest encouraging people to boycott Tesla outside the Tesla Centre Park Royal in London, Britain, March 15, 2025. Chris J Ratcliffe/Reuters\n\nTesla owners who want to sell are also having a hard time finding buyers, much less ones that will buy for a decent price. Some Tesla owners say they have buyers\u2019 remorse amid reports of vandalism and protests against Musk, as well as their personal feelings toward the CEO.\n\n\u201cI would sell it in a heartbeat if somebody offered me a decent price, but the chances of that happening probably not the case,\u201d Pam Perkins, who\u2019s from Northern California, told CNN this month.\n\nJennifer Trebb, from Ohio, traded in her Tesla Model Y a few weeks ago and took an $18,000 to $20,000 financial hit.\n\n\u201cIt did lose a vast amount of value in the short two years that I had it. It only had 10,000 miles on it,\u201d she said. But Musk\u2019s role in the government \u201cdoesn\u2019t fall in line with my morals, my beliefs, and every time I looked at the car, that\u2019s what I thought of.\u201d\n\nLose some, win some\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether the politics of Musk, its CEO, have impacted new Tesla sales in the US, and there\u2019s a lot of compounding reasons why customers could be turning away from even used, cheaper Teslas.\n\nOutside of anecdotes, there hasn\u2019t been a definite connection made between the string of attacks against Tesla vehicles and facilities and any potential loss of sales. The company was booted from a Vancouver auto show over safety concerns.\n\nThe S&P Global Index broke down sales data based on \u201cred states\u201d where Republicans won four straight presidential elections and \u201cblue states\u201d where Democrats did. It showed Tesla loyalty was waning in blue states \u2013 there, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% the next year. Repeat Tesla buyers in red states increased slightly, from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% at the end of 2024.\n\nTrump, Musk\u2019s biggest political ally, and his administration seem to be taking it on themselves to protect the brand\u2019s reputation.\n\nTrump this month hosted a de-facto advertisement for Tesla on the White House South Lawn, where he said he would purchase a Tesla at full price. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the attacks on Tesla are \u201cnothing short of domestic terrorism,\u201d and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the \u201cDemocrats were big supporters of Tesla and of electric vehicles until Elon Musk decided to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk deliver remarks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nIt may be easy to look at public outrage and say the brand is weakening, Ike Silver, assistant professor of marketing at University of Southern California told CNN, but the reality is more complicated: As it\u2019s losing followers in one demographic, it could pick up fans in another.\n\n\u201cThe noise, the protests, make it seem as if the brand is sort of dropping, but the brand is strengthening among a different target audience, which is people on the right,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThe question is will the number of new customers being brought in on the right outweigh the number of angry customers who are leaving on the left.\u201d\n\nPrices don\u2019t tell a simple story\n\nDemand for used Teslas has been falling since last summer after peak interest hit the brand in May 2024, because of more inventory and Cybertrucks hit the used market, David Greene, Cars.com analyst told CNN.\n\nOne major reason the Tesla hype has faded isn\u2019t because of politics at all, but rather because of more competition. Cars.com counted 76 used EV models on the market in February, compared to 58 the year prior.\n\n\u201cTesla has to compete with all of those cars in a marketplace that they basically helped to define,\u201d Brian Moody, executive editor of car marketplace Autotrader, told CNN.\n\nThe used car market follows the new market, where Tesla has also initiated price cuts to better compete. If a car dealer is \u201csitting on your lot of used EVs, you can\u2019t sell it at the same high price you could have last week when you know all the brands just cut their prices on the new cars.\u201d Greene said.\n\nGreene also said about 70% of new EVs were leased, which could mean a bunch of used Teslas are hitting the market around the same time.\n\nAnd as far as price goes, electric vehicles tend to depreciate in value 11% more rapidly than a gasoline-powered car, Moody said. That\u2019s because customers tend to think of EVs more as technology than simple transportation, and they\u2019re more worried about battery health and whether they\u2019ll miss out on the latest updates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things happening at once (for Tesla) that it\u2019s difficult to point to any one cause,\u201d Moody said."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s the most powerful position in world sport with high stakes, high expectations and high consequences.\n\nIts occupant holds huge sway in shaping the global sporting landscape and narrative, wields extraordinary political clout, and presides over a multi-billion-dollar budget.\n\nOn Thursday, Kirsty Coventry became the latest occupant to hold this great responsibility when she was elected as the 10th President of International Olympic Committee (IOC), becoming the first woman and African to ever hold this position.\n\nCoventry, who will also be the youngest ever to assume the role at age 41, will follow in the footsteps of outgoing President Thomas Bach, who during his 12-year term has overseen one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the Olympic movement.\n\nCoventry \u2013 who will officially take the reins in June \u2013 will arrive at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe, question marks over the direction of the Olympic movement in the 21st century, and more scrutiny than ever on issues concerning gender identity and equality, among others.\n\nThe Olympic flag is raised during the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games Francois-Xavier Marit/Pool/Reuters\n\nRussia reintegration\n\nWith less than a year to go until the 2026 Winter Games in Milan-Cortina, one of the first items on the agenda will be whether and how to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes back into the Olympic fold\n\nFollowing Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the IOC imposed a blanket ban on athletes from both countries from participating in its events.\n\nJust over a year later, though, the organization approved allowing said athletes to take part in international sports tournaments as neutrals in March 2023, provided they met strict eligibility criteria.\n\nIn total, 32 athletes \u2013 17 Russian and 15 Belarusian passport holders \u2013 ended up accepting the IOC\u2019s invitation to compete under the Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) flag at last year\u2019s Paris Games.\n\nBach recently told CNN Sports that any decision moving forward should continue to be made with the best interests of the athletes and not their nationality or ongoing geopolitical events in mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Russia. It is about the athletes. Everybody who is following the rules has to have the right to participate in the Olympic Games, full stop,\u201d he told CNN Sports\u2019 Amanda Davies.\n\nRussia has already said it will fight for its participation in 2026, while Ukraine has urged the Olympic movement to hold firm and keep Russian and Belarusian athletes at bay.\n\nWith qualification events already underway for next year\u2019s showpiece event and the war in Ukraine still rumbling on, time will be of the essence.\n\nTrump presidency\n\nThen there is navigating the contentious and unpredictable Trump administration in the lead up to the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Bach has played up the relationship between the IOC and President Donald Trump and his hopes that LA will \u201cexpose the US as a sports-loving country,\u201d the US president\u2019s direct, disruptive style of leadership may severely test that resolve.\n\nTrump, perhaps more than any other world leader in Games gone by, will want to put his own stamp on proceedings.\n\nAs the host nation\u2019s head of state, he will likely help formally open the Summer Olympics on July 14, 2028.\n\nPresident Trump will likely play a role in the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cDonald Trump becomes the single most important player, the single most important figure outside of the Olympic movement,\u201d said CNN Sports analyst Christine Brennan. \u201cThis is a man who loves sports and wants to insert himself in sports every way he can.\n\n\u201cI see him being a huge force within that, and I also see him being a very disruptive force within that.\u201d\n\nTrump has already warned that visas could be denied to LA-bound competitors based on their nationality and who don\u2019t meet the administration\u2019s gender interpretations, among others.\n\nWith teams having already been denied entry into the US and relations having soured in recent months between the US and some of its long-time allies, the two-time gold medal-winning Olympic swimmer will need to tread a fine line between maintaining the IOC\u2019s principles of neutrality and universality, while also providing a pragmatic approach to ensure all 206 National Olympic Committees, plus the Refugee Olympic Team, are all present at the Athlete\u2019s Village.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback IOC President Thomas Bach talks about Trump and the 2028 Olympics 06:41 - Source: CNN IOC President Thomas Bach talks about Trump and the 2028 Olympics 06:41\n\nDSD and transgender rules\n\nAs it stands, there is currently no clear, unified approach or framework between the IOC and its International Federations (IFs) regarding the participation of athletes with differences in sex development (DSD) and transgender athletes from the local through to the national and global stage.\n\nIFs have been able to decide their own participation rules \u2013 based on fairness, inclusion and scientific evidence \u2013 following a revised framework put in place by the IOC in November 2021.\n\nSome IFs, like World Athletics, have subsequently adopted tighter regulations with stricter thresholds or additional requirements for DSD athletes, while others, like World Rugby, have taken a stronger position in banning transgender athletes from competing in elite women\u2019s competitions, citing competitive advantage and safety concerns, among others.\n\nThe lack of universal rules has been criticized for creating confusion among athletes and stakeholders.\n\nThis was especially evident during last summer\u2019s Paris Games when boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting became the targets of misinformation about their gender, triggering an onslaught of online, transphobic abuse toward athletes\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon of our world. What does social media do in such cases?\u201d Bach recently told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou had all sorts of people from all walks of life who were jumping on this without having any idea. We need to dig a little bit deeper how in this world you can really expose the facts and then discuss these facts \u2013 and then how to interpret these facts.\u201d\n\nChanges made by Coventry, who is currently Zimbabwe\u2019s sports minister, could include the implementation of standardized rules for all sports based on firm scientific evidence, with universal eligibility criteria that will help to simplify policies and subsequently help reduce current confusion.\n\nNew frontiers\n\nCoventry\u2019s eight-year mandate will run all the way through to 2033.\n\nAll Games in that window have already been picked \u2013 even the 2034 Winter Olympics, which will be staged in Salt Lake City.\n\nWith the next decade secured, attention will turn to the selection of the host for the Summer Games in 2036.\n\nIt will be the first time a decision has been taken since human rights commitments have been added to the Olympic Charter.\n\nFurthermore, the IOC has also modified its selection criteria changing the host from a single city to multiple cities, regions, or countries.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback New data: Many cities will become too warm for summer Olympics 02:51 - Source: CNN New data: Many cities will become too warm for summer Olympics 02:51\n\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, India and Indonesia, among others, have already all expressed an interest in hosting the Games.\n\nWhile there is no set timetable currently in place for a decision, the expectation is that an announcement won\u2019t be made until after 2025.\n\nWith climate concerns becoming an increasingly prominent consideration in decision-making, a review of the global sports calendar for both Summer and Winter Games could also be undertaken to allow for more interested parties to bid for the Games.\n\nSeoul 1988 and Sydney 2000, for example, hosted the summer edition of the Games in the window between September and October.\n\nAside from taking the Games to new corners of the world, the Olympic movement may also start to see a diversification of sports to cater for a younger, digital-minded audience.\n\nWith the inaugural Olympic Esports Games being held in Riyadh in 2027, a push for new forms of delivering the Games to audiences around the world in a rapidly changing entertainment-scape could also see the IOC embrace a push for technological transformation, the likes of which it has never seen before."

Department of Education\n\nPresident Donald Trump is poised to sign an executive order today to begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education, two administration officials told CNN. Last week, the DOE announced it was cutting 50% of its workforce, a move decried by unions representing federal workers and teachers. The department\u2019s civil rights office, which combats antisemitism, islamophobia, racism and discrimination against students with disabilities, was among the hardest hit. Nearly half of its staff was laid off and its regional offices in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco were closed.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP lawmaker explains why he supports dismantling the Department of Education 02:06 - Source: CNN GOP lawmaker explains why he supports dismantling the Department of Education 02:06\n\n2. Pentagon purge\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s order to remove \u201cdiversity\u201d content from all of the Pentagon\u2019s platforms has led to a massive purge of information. Tens of thousands of articles about cancer awareness, the Holocaust, the 9/11 terror attacks, sexual assault and suicide prevention were removed as was content about women, LGBTQ people and people of color \u2014 including baseball legend Jackie Robinson, who served in the US military during World War II. The automated process has led to \u201ca high level of irresponsible collateral damage,\u201d one defense official said. Separately, the Pentagon is considering making significant cuts to the top of the US military, according to a briefing document obtained by CNN and a US defense official. The plans under consideration include consolidating combatant commands, possibly eliminating a directorate that oversees development, training and education for the joint force and halting the expansion of US forces in Japan.\n\n3. Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military launched a new ground offensive in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday in an effort to \u201cexpand the security zone and to create a partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza.\u201d The move comes just one day after Israel broke a 2-month-old ceasefire with Hamas by conducting airstrikes in Gaza that killed at least 400 people, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Hamas described the latest offensive as a \u201cnew and dangerous breach,\u201d and said it remains committed to the ceasefire deal signed in January. Additional Israeli airstrikes overnight claimed at least 40 more lives, the European Hospital said.\n\n4. Taxpayer data\n\nThe IRS and the Department of Homeland Security are engaged in discussions about sharing highly confidential taxpayer data to help authorities ramp up deportations. Currently, undocumented immigrants can register with the IRS and pay taxes \u2014 and the agency is required to keep their private information confidential, except in very specific circumstances specified in the tax code. Two immigrant rights groups have already filed suit to block the effort, but on Wednesday, a district judge declined to issue an emergency order blocking the IRS from sharing the data.\n\n5. Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nScientists examining the brains of people destined to develop Alzheimer\u2019s dementia say there may be a way to keep symptoms at bay in certain patients. A new study published in the journal Lancet Neurology found that the risk of symptoms developing was cut in half if the participants had been taking an amyloid-lowering drug for about eight years. Beta amyloid plaques are known to collect between neurons in the brain and disrupt cell function. It\u2019s \u201cthe first data to suggest that there\u2019s a possibility of a significant delay in the onset of progression to symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Eric McDade, a professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis, who led the study.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSpring has officially sprung!\n\nThe vernal equinox has arrived.

And Steve Kornacki on the teams he\u2019s watching for in the opening round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know today.\n\nTrump to sign order shuttering the Education Department\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to close the Education Department today, fulfilling a yearslong pledge to dismantle the federal agency, the White House confirmed. The order will direct Education Secretary Linda McMahon to \u201ctake all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order will also direct McMahon to ensure the agency\u2019s funds do not go toward programs that advance DEI goals or gender ideology.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nMcMahon earlier this month cut the department\u2019s workforce in half, calling the job terminations the first step in shutting down the department. She vowed in her Senate confirmation hearing to work with Congress to advance Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the department.\n\nFormally closing the department requires an act of Congress. Trump has suggested that he could garner enough congressional support to do so. But even without formally shutting down the department, the administration could make it nearly impossible for employees to carry out their work, as it has done with USAID.\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s $268 billion appropriations last year represented just 4% of the federal budget. The department does not dictate curricula used in classrooms; it is largely a funding and civil rights enforcement organization, distributing money for schools with high rates of impoverished students and assisting children with disabilities. It also runs the public student loan program.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nUkraine agrees to move forward with partial ceasefire with Russia\n\nUkraine has agreed to move forward with a partial ceasefire with Russia, the Trump administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday after a phone call between the two leaders.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said that after Trump spoke to Zelenskyy by phone, the two leaders agreed \u201con a partial ceasefire against energy,\u201d according to a joint statement released by the White House. Rubio and Waltz\u2019s statement did not mention that the ceasefire would apply to civilian infrastructure as Zelenskyy suggested, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to answer questions at an afternoon news briefing asking for clarification about the discrepancy in details. The White House also rejected Kremlin demands that the U.S. stop sending intelligence and weapons to Ukraine. Read the full story here.\n\nWebsite maps Tesla owners and their personal information\n\nSome Tesla owners said they are worried that they could be targeted for vandalism after a map containing their personal information was published this week. The online map went live Monday, displaying the names, addresses and contact information of some Tesla owners and dealerships and members of the Trump administration in an attempt to whip up further backlash against Elon Musk. The website encourages visitors to commit vandalism and pushes Tesla owners to sell their vehicles.\n\nNBC News spoke to six Tesla owners or their representatives who confirmed that at least some of the information on the website was accurate, though some said that in some cases, phone numbers or addresses were out of date.

Those calls seemed to be loudest among Black people, whose dedication to the cause was the inspiration for this article. Reporter Claretta Bellamy and I spoke to nearly two dozen Black people of various ages from across the country who are boycotting retailers like Target, Walmart and Amazon about why they are abstaining from shopping at these stores. \u201cWhere you spend your money, it\u2019s an indication of where your values lie,\u201d one of those people said. \u2014 Janelle Griffith, national reporter\n\nNBCU Academy: How Keith Morrison perfects his \u2018Dateline\u2019 voice\n\nSometimes considered the \u201cgranddaddy of true crime,\u201d Keith Morrison has one of the most famous voices on television.

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: YouTube/Mark Rober\n\nThis week, engineer and practical joker Mark Rober, best known for a series in which he pranks package thieves with glitter bombs, released a characteristically elaborate two-part video. In the first section, he sneaks a lidar camera into Disney\u2019s Space Mountain to get a 3-D scan of the ride\u2019s design. In the second \u2014 the segment that has drawn much more attention \u2014 he runs a series of tests pitting a lidar-equipped test vehicle against his Tesla, which uses traditional cameras for its driver-assist and self-driving features.\n\nRober\u2019s Tesla does not come out ahead. It fails to automatically brake in multiple scenarios where the lidar-equipped car succeeds, thwarted by thick smoke, heavy spraying water, and a fake road superimposed on a foam wall. Getting a self-driving car to fall for a Wile E. Coyote trap is a pretty good bit, and Rober\u2019s video was hugely popular with his 65 million YouTube followers and beyond. It was also immediately controversial, with critics arguing that the tests were unfairly stacked against Tesla and suggesting that Rober, a former NASA engineer and Apple product designer whose past videos have contained misleading material, had rigged the result to make the company look bad. Setting aside the experiment\u2019s exact results, the video is clearly intended as a criticism of Tesla\u2019s choice to move away from technologies like lidar \u2014 a \u201cfool\u2019s errand,\u201d according to Elon Musk \u2014 in favor of cheaper but less reliable camera-based systems. Tesla\u2019s legion of online defenders has responded accordingly. \u201cMark Rober *just* DEFRAUDED Tesla [Lawsuit Likely],\u201d reads the headline of one popular response video. \u201cMark Rober Just Ended His Career,\u201d reads another.\n\nBut whatever one makes of Rober\u2019s experiment, his video marks the next stage of a subtle but significant shift on YouTube, a place where, in different but arguably no less significant ways than Twitter, the reputations of Tesla and Musk were built. For years, overlapping clusters of massively popular tech and science YouTubers \u2014 most of them studiously apolitical, or at least coy about their beliefs \u2014 have enjoyed a productive informal partnership with Musk\u2019s car company, sharing with their massive audiences their interest in and affection for the brand. This made sense: For relatively young audiences interested in engineering and science, Musk was a well-known and fairly accessible figure; for YouTubers who built audiences reviewing and talking about consumer tech, gadgetlike and novelty-rich Teslas were a great fit, as natural a subject for their channels as new iPhones or VR headsets.\n\nYouTuber Marques Brownlee, known as MKBHD (over 20 million combined subscribers), interviewed Musk and toured Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory in 2018, later calling the Tesla Model S Plaid \u201cthe best overall car in the last decade\u201d and using one as his daily driver. MKBHD competitor Zack Nelson, a.k.a. JerryRigEverything (over 9 million subscribers), gradually acquired four Teslas and made videos with and about them. For tech reviewers, science explainers, and project YouTubers, Teslas were a rich subject and source of engagement. Among an influential blob of YouTubers, they were also the default car. Linus Sebastian, who runs Linus Tech Tips (over 16 million subscribers), incorporated Teslas into his videos and walked subscribers through his (slightly reluctant) purchase. Unbox Therapy (over 24 million subscribers) bought a Model S Plaid. Engineer Simone Giertz chopped her Tesla into a \u201cTruckla,\u201d poking gentle fun at the company for its own delayed truck plans. For his part, Rober, who used his own Tesla for his new video, has spoken admiringly of Musk on numerous occasions:\n\nI feel like @elonmusk makes some announcement or demo that would be an amazing lifetime achievement for one person/company about every week. \u2014 Mark Rober (@MarkRober) May 4, 2017\n\nTech YouTube\u2019s relationship with Musk started to fray with his acquisition of Twitter in 2022, by which point Musk had become divisive in ways that many cautious general-audience YouTubers likely saw as risky. By 2024, Musk\u2019s heel turn had manifested in product form. YouTubers swarmed the release of the Cybertruck, reviewing and buying them for tests and stunts. Tesla had once again produced a vehicle that was good for engagement, and YouTubers got a lot out of it. Nelson shot his with a gun, while Brownlee reviewed his and concluded it was \u201ciconic\u201d but dangerously attention-grabbing. Elsewhere on YouTube, in a sign of things to come, criticizing and destroying Cybertrucks became a genre unto itself. Trollish, MAGA-dabbling YouTuber Cody Detwiler, a.k.a. WhistlinDiesel (over 9 million subscribers), subjected the Cybertruck to one of his over-the-top \u201cdurability tests\u201d that ended with a disabled truck and unusually harsh and earnest words for Tesla. The video supplied countless mega-viral clips to TikTok and Instagram Reels. (A second part came out two months ago; a segment in which Detwiler ripped a glued metal panel from the truck with his bare hands presaged a sales halt for a related issue this week.)\n\nMusk is now one of the most polarizing people in the country, making it difficult to talk about Tesla\u2019s products \u2014 even in the context of a gadget channel \u2014 without addressing his ownership. Brownlee, who sold his Plaid in early 2024, ditched his Cybertruck for a Rivian; despite efforts not to make too much of a spectacle of his choice, Musk took notice:\n\nNelson, meanwhile, recently released a video in which he stress tests (and destroys) his Cybertruck \u2014 a video that, like Rober\u2019s, was criticized by fans, Tesla, and Musk for being unfair. Maybe so, but it was revealing regardless: In 2024, getting your hands on a new Cybertruck was a shortcut to massive engagement; in 2025, within the YouTube economy, the shortcut to engagement is destroying your Cybertruck. (Nelson has since pledged to get rid of all his Teslas.)\n\nRober\u2019s recent video isn\u2019t explicitly anti-Tesla and doesn\u2019t call out Musk, but it has been widely perceived and treated as though it is and does. At the very least, it taps into an ambient interest in and anger about its owner \u2014 there\u2019s a real chance that some Teslas, or Tesla dealerships, are still smoldering as you read this \u2014 which is the sort of thing any successful YouTuber is acutely aware of and capable of exploiting.\n\nThat a handful of loosely affiliated popular YouTubers have adjusted their strategies around Tesla may not be hugely significant on its own. But if we\u2019re suddenly interested in who young men are listening to online, YouTube\u2019s cheery and mostly politics-averse ecosystem of tech and science personalities should be in the conversation. Their intuitions about their influential sector of the attention economy say something. Tesla used to be good for business. Now, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that."

            "full_content": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin CNN \u2014\n\nBackstage in a dressing room drinking a can of diet Mountain Dew as 900 people filled a theater in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he wouldn\u2019t be there if not for \u201cthe void.\u201d\n\nThe void is deep for Walz, who only in the last few weeks has begun to publicly address his and Kamala Harris\u2019 2024 loss with what he called \u201cthe most unsatisfying \u2018I Told You So\u2019 tour in the history of politics.\u201d He says too many Democratic leaders are still not truly grappling with how bad things are politically for them, what he believes is President Donald Trump\u2019s march toward authoritarianism or the anger and frustration at both parties building across the country.\n\n\u201cOur leadership\u2019s not going to be the charismatic DC leader or whatever. It\u2019s going to be the person who\u2019s reading the room the best of where these people are at,\u201d Walz told CNN.\n\nAs many Democratic voters have moved since November from dejection, to panic, to curdling anger at party leaders who haven\u2019t come up with a better way of fighting back, Walz\u2019s answer is a tour of Republican House districts to listen to stories of desperation, call on Democrats to lay out a policy agenda with clearer direct benefits for voters and try to build a new sense of community that he says he hadn\u2019t realized his party had lost so much.\n\nWalz has not made a final decision on running for a third term as governor next year, though he feels compelled to, if only to push back on Trump. And while he said he\u2019d feel \u201ca sense of allegiance\u201d to back Harris if she ran for president again in 2028, he tensed up a little as he answered, saying he didn\u2019t think the question was quite fair. He has deflected 2028 talk of his own, saying things like he thinks the next Democratic nominee should be young enough to have hair, but people who\u2019ve spoken to him acknowledge that running is not completely out of the question in his unexpected political journey.\n\nThat speculation is less important to him than addressing the reality of Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get very dark,\u201d Walz said, running through speculation that ranged from Trump soon ordering the arrest of a political opponent to trying to anoint a son as his successor in the White House.\n\nWhile the administration denies it defied a judge\u2019s order halting deportation flights to El Salvador over the weekend, the episode is proof to Walz that judges are set to be ignored and impeached going forward. Tuesday\u2019s statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts rebuking the president\u2019s rhetoric on impeaching judges, without naming Trump, tells Walz that Roberts is also \u201cscared of where things are going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty low-key, middle of the road guy on this stuff. And I\u2019m telling you, this is real,\u201d Walz said. \u201cMy one skill set is to see over the horizon a little bit of what\u2019s coming, and this is what\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nHope for Democratic revival, doubts about Schumer\u2019s leadership\n\nWalz was in Wisconsin not just because GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden isn\u2019t holding town halls himself, which the governor says is proof the congressman can\u2019t defend Trump\u2019s actions, but because the state has a state Supreme Court election on April 1.\n\nBoth parties have rushed to nationalize the race to determine the majority make-up of the bench \u2013 the Republican posing with a giant inflatable Trump balloon over the weekend and promising to be part of the backlash to judicial pushback on Trump, the Democrats running ads featuring Trump and Elon Musk (who\u2019s spending millions of his own money on the race) with a chainsaw.\n\nIf Democrats win in Wisconsin and then in the Virginia governor\u2019s race in November, Walz claimed, Trump\u2019s power will begin to erode as Republicans distance themselves. How that will happen when Trump is barely into a four-year term and already exerting executive power in unprecedented ways, and how Democrats keep their spirits up when even their chance at getting more power in the midterms is 18 months away, Walz is not sure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any limit to where he goes. The limit will be what the American public will put up with and when they push back,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThis has happened everywhere when these authoritarians have come in. One day it looks like they\u2019re absolutely infallible and in total power, and the next day they and their entire families are gone.\u201d\n\nWhat Walz is sure of is that Democrats who are counting on Trump overreaching or the pendulum just swinging back are delusional \u2013 and that it\u2019s not enough from the Democratic leaders basing their pitches around saying that what Trump is doing is not why people voted for him or that prices still haven\u2019t gone down.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re missing the people who stayed home that don\u2019t see us as any different. And I think just saying \u2018Trump did all that,\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that necessarily helps us,\u201d Walz said.\n\nWalz says he\u2019s also sure that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer didn\u2019t measure up with the way he handled last week\u2019s spending fight.\n\nThough he wouldn\u2019t answer if he has faith in the Senate minority leader going forward, Walz dismissed Schumer\u2019s talking point that he knows what to do because he\u2019s won Senate races before, including during the first Trump term.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a danger \u2013 and I would argue I did it maybe during the campaign \u2013 of fighting the last battle instead of the next one,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThis is a whole different opponent fighting a whole different battle. And all of our past history that tells us how we should have approached this, I don\u2019t think holds true.\u201d\n\nTrump-district Democrats worry about Walz\u2019s \u201cred district tourism\u201d\n\nThe House GOP campaign arm taunting Walz ahead of his Eau Claire stop and Trump\u2019s campaign manager Chris LaCivita challenging him to a fight on X aren\u2019t the only skeptics.\n\nSeveral Democratic operatives associated with candidates who did better than the presidential ticket last year told CNN they are annoyed and confused by Walz\u2019s assessment that most Trump 2024 voters are lost causes for Democrats. Some feel the same way about his tour, arguing that he\u2019s bringing a kind of politics that didn\u2019t work and is already of the past to parts of the country where Democrats are only going to win by creating distance.\n\nBut in a measure of how much even disgruntled Democrats still personally like Walz, several told CNN they didn\u2019t want to go public with those concerns.\n\n\u201cProgressive donors and consultants loved the Coach Walz persona, but it didn\u2019t actually land with the rural voters and men it was designed to win over. I think it looked like a performance trying to distract from the Biden record he and Harris never distanced themselves from,\u201d one House Democrat who won in a district Trump carried told CNN. \u201cThere were Democrats who won over Trump voters to win their races and will again in the future, but Tim, it\u2019s time for you to go home. This red district tourism is giving all the wrong signals to the voters you lost.\u201d\n\nRebecca Cooke, the top Democratic prospect who has already announced a repeat run against Van Orden for next year, did not attend Tuesday\u2019s event in her district.\n\nBut a Walz advisor told CNN that the governor has already received over 1,000 invitations for more appearances.\n\nNo clear plan for the future as last year\u2019s loss still haunts him\n\nOnly two Harris-Walz camo hunter\u2019s caps, which the campaign had been so proud to unveil the night he was picked for the ticket, were visible in the crowd in Wisconsin.\n\nFour-and-a-half months after he came within about 230,000 votes in three battleground states of being elected vice president, Walz doesn\u2019t even have a super PAC to handle logistics or costs, leaving aides on their off hours coordinating with staff at state parties for what he\u2019ll be doing and where.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz campaigns at State Fair Park on November 4, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nAs much as clips of Walz\u2019s best quips so far have raced around dejected Democrats \u2013 one from Eau Claire where he said he\u2019d added Tesla to the stock market app on his iPhone so he could get \u201ca little boost\u201d from watching the share price go down (he also suggested owners pulling the \u2018T\u2019 emblems off with dental floss), drawing an almost immediate response from Musk on X \u2013 there is no greater plan in play. Hundreds of people are showing up to see him at each stop, with several telling CNN after he finished in Eau Claire that their impression of him had improved, but he isn\u2019t even taking down their contact information, as most politicians who are keeping their options open tend to do.\n\nPart of the story of the 2024 campaign is how Harris picked Walz in large part for how much she liked his public demeanor, then because the new people around her running the campaign worried he\u2019d overshadow her, that guy effectively disappeared.\n\nBut it\u2019s the pre-running mate Walz who has been showing up at these town halls, ripping Musk as \u201ca dipshit,\u201d digging in deep on the relevance of Department of Education or Veterans Affairs programs for special needs, coming up with a line that Democrats should take back the Gadsden flag to tell Republicans to stop treading on them and responding with both sympathy and rage to a woman in Eau Claire who told him she\u2019d been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s at the age of 51: \u201cWe need to ask your member of Congress here why he doesn\u2019t care about this woman\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nWalz says now he should have been doing events all through last fall. He says he offered, but was told no, and in his bewildered daze, he decided to be a team player.\n\nWalz knew they lost early on election night. Sitting around a table in a suite at the Mayflower Hotel that he had walked into thinking he\u2019d be leaving as the vice president-elect, he could feel the mood shift among his staff as soon as the Virginia results started coming in soft for Harris.\n\nThey wanted to fly back that night. Gwen Walz, the governor\u2019s wife, told CNN that one of the things that sticks with her is that the Harris-Walz logo was already off the charter plane by the time they got to the airport.\n\nThese days, Walz said that thinking they were going to win \u201cfeels like an unforgivable sin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit jaded now, knowing how tough this is because of that,\u201d he said, then hearing the noise of the crowd waiting inside, said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see how these folks are.\u201d\n\nAfter he finished his hour on stage by asking the crowd to call out ideas for standing up to Trump, Walz participated in a line of photos \u2013 not backstage with donors, but with whoever from the crowd wanted to wait to climb up the stairs to be with him.\n\nAsked what he saw of where those folks were, Walz said that it felt like \u201ca little group therapy session of what they wanted to see out of Democratic leadership,\u201d adding, \u201cand look, it\u2019s good for me too, because I\u2019ve seen the energy still out there.\u201d"

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nLarry Taunton was in bed around 1 a.m. on Sunday in his Alabama home when he noticed his dog, Ranger, getting worked up.\n\n\u201cHis ears were up and moving like satellite dishes,\u201d Taunton told CNN in an interview.\n\nHe noticed a flicker of light, and then the German Shepherd headed toward the front door. Taunton grabbed his gun and followed, leaving the lights off. When he got to the kitchen, all he could see in the darkness was a figure in body armor holding a semi-automatic rifle trying to open his door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, if that man comes through my door, I\u2019m going to light him up,\u201d Taunton said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re just thinking, \u2018Somebody\u2019s here to murder me and my wife.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt turned out to be three officers, guns drawn. Police told Taunton that they received a call saying three men in hoodies were \u201cmoving throughout the house, executing everybody.\u201d\n\nHe had been swatted.\n\nTaunton, who has more than 177,000 followers on X and more than 140,000 YouTube subscribers, is one of at least a dozen influencers who have been \u201cswatted\u201d in the last two weeks. Swatting is a crime that involves making a bogus emergency call claiming a horrific emergency is taking place \u2013 often a shooting \u2013 to draw police and first responders to a person\u2019s home.\n\nAlmost all the influencers who have publicized their recent swattings are conservative supporters of President Donald Trump. Many have also interacted with top Trump adviser and donor Elon Musk on X over the years, with Musk either replying to them or reposting their X posts. The swattings are happening as Tesla owners and dealerships are experiencing a wave of vandalism in backlash against the company\u2019s billionaire CEO, and his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security say they\u2019re investigating this latest rash of swattings, which these influencers say could easily turn deadly.\n\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will not sit idly by as conservative new media and their families are being targeted by false swatting,\u201d Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem wrote on X on Wednesday. \u201c@DHSgov has the ability to trace phone numbers and track location information. We will use it to hunt these cowards down. This is an attack on our law enforcement and innocent families and we will prosecute it as such.\u201d\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X last week that the FBI is \u201calready taking action to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics\u2014weaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\u2018I just fell to the ground\u2019\n\nErin Derham lives in Western North Carolina with her husband, Mat Van Swol, and three children. Like Taunton, she was in bed early Sunday when she heard loud banging on her door at 1:30 a.m.\n\nDerham had an idea what might be happening. She and Van Swol had seen reports of other influencers getting swatted and warned their local police department that they might be a target. Van Swol, who says he\u2019s a former liberal, has become known alongside his wife as an activist calling for more aid to North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. Van Swol, who has more than 198,000 followers on X, has often interacted with Musk on the social media platform.\n\nBut Derham was not prepared to see someone holding a gun, banging at her door.\n\n\u201cI could hear loud sirens blaring down the street,\u201d she said to CNN. \u201cWe found out later four police officers and cars came to our house, but also there was a fire truck, two ambulances and all the county on-duty police officers flying towards my house.\u201d\n\nDerham chose to answer the door instead of sending her husband, believing she would look less threatening \u201cin my little polka dot pajamas.\u201d\n\n\u201c(The police) came in and I yelled, \u2018Matt, we\u2019re being swatted!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 and I kept yelling, \u2018We have three kids upstairs, we have three kids upstairs, do not (do anything), nobody is here.\u201d\n\nSomeone had called the police pretending to be her husband, Derham learned. During the call, the person claimed to be Van Swol and said Derham had been killed and he had been shot twice in the stomach.\n\nShe was also told the caller sounded like an older man and responses were slightly delayed, leading her to believe computer-generated manipulation may have been involved.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was going to pass out most of the time that they were in the house,\u201d Derham said. \u201cI held it together until they shut the door, and then I fell, like I literally just fell to the ground.\u201d\n\n\u2018A cheap form of terrorism\u2019\n\nSwatting is a form of harassment that\u2019s considered a crime at the federal and state levels.\n\nAnd it can be deadly. In 2017, police killed Andrew Finch after a group of online gamers \u2014 who were later imprisoned \u2014 called 911 to report that a man had shot his father in the head and was holding his mother and brother at gunpoint, while threatening to set their home on fire.\n\nFinch was shot by police when he dropped his hands as officers told him to raise his arms when he came out of the house, according to the US attorney.\n\nA 60-year-old Tennessee man reportedly died of a heart attack after police, responding to a swatting call, told him to come out of the house with his hands up during an incident in 2020.\n\nAnd swatting, which has been on the FBI\u2019s radar for decades, can be a tough crime to prosecute. Online methods make it easy to spoof a phone number and a voice.\n\nMany of the conservative influencers targeted in recent days are gun owners. Taunton said it was good sense from police, as well as \u201cgood trigger discipline on both parts,\u201d that kept his situation from turning into a tragedy.\n\nThe responding officers have in some cases been impacted, too. Derham said she and her husband have been in touch with the first officer who responded to the swatting call targeting their home. He has been \u201cvery affected,\u201d by the incident she said, considering he could have unintentionally harmed her, or her children, had the night gone differently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cheap form of terrorism, or it could be something else, we don\u2019t really know,\u201d Derham said. \u201cBut it is causing so much damage, way beyond my household.\u201d\n\nAnd the harassment hasn\u2019t stopped. Since the swatting, Derham said they are now getting pizza deliveries they have not ordered at all hours of the day and night. Some of the delivery people say the notes on the orders ask them to knock loudly, which Derham says is a scare tactic.\n\n\u201cThis was humiliating and terrifying,\u201d Derham said. \u201cAs it\u2019s happening, you\u2019re so scared and you just think, what if this is a dry run? This is really, really scary.\u201d\n\nBut despite the fear and trauma, many of the affected influencers say swatting has only further motivated them to continue speaking out on politics.\n\n\u201cTo the person/entity swatting people \u2026 you are not changing hearts and minds by doing this,\u201d Van Swol posted on X. \u201cIf the goal is to frighten people into silence, that won\u2019t work.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer/ANDRII BILETSKYI\n\nJim Acosta, the frequent Donald Trump antagonist who was all but pushed out by CNN earlier this year, may not be the type of person you\u2019d suspect would be a hit on Substack. In fact, when he signed off from his CNN show for the final time at the end of January, he barely knew what it was. \u201cI thought Substack was a place where people posted their articles and opinion pieces,\u201d he said. He could be forgiven for his mistake. When Substack took off in 2020 amid the newsletter boom \u2014 which came and went, then came back again, perhaps this time for good \u2014 it positioned itself as an email service.\n\nBut in the years since, Substack has transformed into something else: a platform for live videos and podcasts, a burgeoning social-media network, and a starter pack for fledgling newsrooms. Every day for the past six weeks, Acosta has been filming himself talking about the horrors of Trump\u2019s second term and posting the video on Substack. To his surprise, there\u2019s an audience for it. Each episode gets between 150,000 and 200,000 views and he has amassed about 280,000 subscribers, more than 10,000 of which are paid.\n\n\u201cThe response has blown me away. I did not anticipate this when I left my old job,\u201d Acosta told me recently, speaking from a hiking trail near Sonoma (working for yourself has its perks). \u201cI don\u2019t know where this is going to go,\u201d he added, noting that he was still adjusting to post-CNN life and had just bought his first personal laptop in 20 years. He is, as he says, \u201cliving in the moment,\u201d which \u201cmay sound too Gwyneth Paltrow for some people.\u201d\n\nAnd this is Substack\u2019s moment, it seems. Thanks to a combination of forces \u2014 the decimation of Twitter, the collapse of the media industry, the explosion in demand for video and audio content, and the reemergence of Trump \u2014 Substack has escaped its humble newsletter beginnings to become a juggernaut collective of independent voices. If you\u2019re looking to start a media operation, it\u2019s now the place to do so: The Free Press, The Bulwark, Zeteo, and The Ankler are among those housed there. If you\u2019re an established journalist or personality looking for your next act \u2014 Paul Krugman, Joy Reid, Taylor Lorenz, etc. \u2014 do it on Substack. Pete Buttigieg all but announced his future presidential run on there. In a sign of the times, Allure recently announced it is joining Substack to launch a newsletter called The Beauty Chat, even though readers of Allure could presumably get their Allure content from Allure itself.\n\n\u201cWhen I started my newsletter in 2021, I thought it was an email tool. I was like, Great, it\u2019s a very-easy-to-use MailChimp,\u201d said Rachel Karten, a social-media consultant who used to run social media at Bon App\u00e9tit and now writes the Link in Bio newsletter. \u201cAnd slowly and slowly it\u2019s become a lot more of a social-media tool \u2014 there\u2019s now live video and algorithms.\u201d\n\nSubstack today has all of the functionalities of a social platform, allowing proprietors to engage with both subscribers (via the Chat feature) or the broader Substack universe in the Twitter-esque Notes feed. Writers I spoke to mentioned that for all of their reluctance to engage with the Notes feature, they see growth when they do. More than 50 percent of all subscriptions and 30 percent of paid subscriptions on the platform come directly from the Substack network. There\u2019s been a broader shift toward multimedia content: Over half of the 250 highest-revenue creators were using audio and video in April 2024, a number that had surged to 82 percent by February 2025.\n\nSubstack initially rolled out livestreaming in September as a feature available only to publishers with a lot of subscribers; in January, it made live video available to everyone. There\u2019s a collaboration feature that allows you to co-host streams with up to three people, \u201cessentially what is one step up from a public FaceTime call,\u201d says Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie. \u201cIt lowers the barrier to entry to saying something important in public; it\u2019s also kind of fun.\u201d Acosta has kept his videos free for now, but others are offering the feature only to paid subscribers, as Tina Brown has for recent conversations with Maureen Dowd and Janice Min.\n\n\u201cEmail is something that we will absolutely never abandon,\u201d said McKenzie, noting it\u2019s \u201cimportant as a guarantor of that direct owned relationship that the writers and creators can have with their audience.\u201d But by limiting yourself to just email, \u201cyou\u2019re tying one of your hands behind your back.\u201d When someone like Acosta goes live on Substack, they announce that they\u2019re doing so to their entire email list, who can then jump on and watch. At the end of the stream, they are presented with the full video, which they can then blast out to their Substack followers as well as post on other social platforms.\n\nBut even those who\u2019ve resisted new features and kept their newsletters largely text based continue to see an uptick, like journalist Max Read, who writes the twice-weekly Read Max newsletter. \u201cTo the extent there\u2019s been a Trump bump in the media, it\u2019s all going to Substackers. I cover tech, not really politics. But I saw incredibly fast growth \u2014 it seems to finally be plateauing \u2014 between late October/the election last year and two or three weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI was growing twice as fast as I\u2019d been in the months before that.\u201d\n\nSports journalism has basically migrated to the platform, and food media seems not far behind \u2014 if not already there. In the past few months, renowned cookbook author and restaurateur Yotam Ottolenghi joined Substack, as did Ballerina Farm influencer Hannah Neeleman. \u201cThat\u2019s just such a clear indicator to me of how much money there is to be made,\u201d said chef and writer Clare de Boer. \u201cThere\u2019s no one that is too big for Substack.\u201d Live video seems particularly suited for the food category. Substack last week hosted a live three-day food festival called Grubstack featuring top food writers and chefs like de Boer, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, Ottolenghi, Caroline Chambers, and David Lebovitz participating in live conversations, cook-alongs, and virtual tastings.\n\nSubstack as a whole this month celebrated 5 million paid subscriptions \u2014 including 2 million to outlets that publish video \u2014 less than four months after it crossed the 4-million milestone. And it is intent on cracking new territories. \u201cSubstack\u2019s bread and butter has been journalists and analysts and academics and bloggers, which is a really elite class and very influential, but it\u2019s small in its total size compared to where most of culture is happening right now, which is on Instagram and TikTok and YouTube,\u201d said McKenzie. Substack saw opportunity amid the looming TikTok ban, offering a $25,000 prize to the creator who produced the most convincing video inviting their TikTok audience to Substack. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rescue the smart people from TikTok!\u201d Substacker co-founder Chris Best wrote.\n\nThe winner of that competition was Aaron Parnas, a 25-year-old D.C.-based creator who used to practice law but now practices Substack. \u201cMore or less my audience has followed,\u201d said Parnas, noting the \u201cbiggest thing has really been just introducing this new platform to them,\u201d because \u201ca lot of folks don\u2019t really know what Substack even is.\u201d He posts two to three videos a day in which he basically talks through the day\u2019s big headlines. Around 370,000 people subscribe \u2014 \u201c98, 99 percent of those subscribers are in the past two months,\u201d he says \u2014 and more than a thousand are paid. He typically reserves livestreams as a perk for paid subscribers.\n\nThe initial dream that Substack sold of individual journalists making a living through subscriptions has been eclipsed by a new hybrid model. More and more, people aren\u2019t on there to make money at all but to promote their stories and books and engage with fellow media types without being trolled by Elon-worshipping Nazi bot accounts (though Substack has its own Nazi problems). Meanwhile, money can feasibly be made from sources other than subscriptions. \u201cI felt like Substack was against brands and advertising early on. Now that more brands are joining, it does seem like it is welcoming them,\u201d said Karten, pointing out that Substack had hosted a joint event with luxury resale platform The RealReal at the Manhattan restaurant King on Tuesday evening. \u201cAs a user, it makes me wonder if we might start to see ads in Notes. As a marketer, I see the opportunity \u2014 but it can be a slippery slope.\u201d\n\nThe cynical take is that Substack \u2014 which takes a 10 percent cut of the paid subscription revenue \u2014 has shifted to trying to make money off only high-profile people. But the reality is there aren\u2019t many other places offering the kind of new venture that Substack has made possible for so many big names.\n\n\u201cWriters were not the obvious sexy customers to be building the tech company around,\u201d said McKenzie. But early on, he remembers talking with Best about how different it\u2019d look if \u201csocial networks had been built on subscription models rather than advertising,\u201d and how one day Substack could organically develop into its own ecosystem \u2014 which it now seems like it has. \u201cAs we matured and got more people using Substack over time,\u201d McKenzie said, \u201cthese wild imaginings became much more like plans.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is stepping into the Democrats\u2019 leadership void, picking up her powerful megaphone to channel the base\u2019s anger \u2014 toward both President Donald Trump and her own party.\n\nSome of the initial skepticism in the party around the progressive star when she first arrived in Washington six years ago has started to fade as she has established herself as a political player on Capitol Hill and demonstrated a unique knack for communicating with a younger generation.\n\nAs Democrats scramble to find an authentic and effective messenger for the second Trump administration, there is a growing desire to elevate Ocasio-Cortez, 35, within the party in some way, according to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists \u2014 especially after last week\u2019s government spending showdown left the base enraged.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was one of the most outspoken Democrats in torching Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for allowing a Republican funding bill to advance in the Senate to avoid a shutdown. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nStarting Thursday, she is set to take her message on the road with a fellow progressive heavyweight, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has also been critical of current Democratic leadership. The pair will hold a series of rallies in swing districts and on college campuses in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado that are expected to draw massive crowds, sparking inevitable questions about her considering a run for higher office \u2014 perhaps even president in 2028.\n\n\u201cShe would walk into any event in America and draw a significant crowd,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, a political adviser to Sanders. \u201cWhether they like her or not it doesn\u2019t even matter. There are people interested in what she has to say.\u201d\n\nSome of her Democratic colleagues once viewed Ocasio-Cortez as an attention seeker who was more interested in social media stardom than substantive policy. Others believed she fell into the job only accidentally after her upset primary win at age 28 and were skeptical she would be around for long.\n\nBut now Democrats across the ideological spectrum are starting to recognize that Ocasio-Cortez can grab the spotlight in a way that few others in the party can.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got boundless promise as the party leader in our country. But the question is who will have the language to express to America where we need to go,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order for anybody, but I would say she\u2019s definitely a contender. I don\u2019t know that anybody else seems to be a more obvious young candidate for that position.\u201d\n\nThere are still plenty of reservations among Democrats about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s becoming the face of the party. She is a frequent target of conservatives, who portray her as an out-of-touch extremist and often use her as a villain in campaign ads and fundraising efforts.\n\n\u201cHer politics are just too far left for this party,\u201d a chair of a state party that sends a large number of delegates to Democratic presidential conventions, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Ocasio-Cortez as a potential national candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with most of her policy positions, but she\u2019s showing fight, which a lot of people are looking for their members of Congress to do, and they\u2019re just not seeing it.\u201d\n\nStill, her ability to connect with the public is something her Democratic colleagues are starting to embrace. Recently, she conducted a presentation for her colleagues on how to reach influencers and use social media. She showed House Democrats a video she produced around the theme \u201cWhat\u2019s in my bag?\u201d in which she also discussed politics and policy. A Democratic lawmaker recalled the video got more than 2 million views.\n\n\u201cTwo million people, right?\u201d said a lawmaker who listened to the presentation. \u201cIf you added all of mine up together and multiplied them by 10, I wouldn\u2019t get to 2 million.\u201d\n\nA moderate House Democrat told NBC News that, despite not being a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of Ocasio-Cortez, they privately voted for her to be the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee when she unsuccessfully ran for the post last year. The moderate Democratic lawmaker said the reason is that \u201cshe is one of the top-tier communicators\u201d in the party and the Oversight Committee job is primarily a \u201cmessaging and marketing\u201d role.\n\nBut the lawmaker didn\u2019t wish to reveal the vote publicly, a sign there is still wariness about how Ocasio-Cortez might appeal to more centrist and independent voters.\n\nOcasio-Cortez ultimately landed a spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which deals with a host of issues she cares about related to climate change and income inequality. Her evolution from an outside agitator to an inside player in the party has fueled widespread speculation among Democrats about her political ambitions.\n\nOcasio-Cortez isn\u2019t entertaining the idea of seeking higher office. Her closest advisers reject the premise that Sanders is handing the baton to her as the titular leader of the progressive movement. They also insist she isn\u2019t plotting to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat in 2028, mount a run for governor of New York in 2026 or start organizing a bid for the White House. But they also aren\u2019t ruling anything out.\n\nOcasio-Cortez declined a request for an interview.\n\n\u201cThere is no 10-year plan,\u201d said a close Ocasio-Cortez adviser, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal planning. \u201cShe is going to be who she is. She is the last person to think about how a decision is going to impact her down the road, which candidly can be a little frustrating to those of us who are advising her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can move quickly and authentically in a way few other elected leaders can,\u201d the adviser added. \u201cIf she jumps into anything, it will be because she truly believes she can make real change.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic leaders said Ocasio-Cortez should keep all potential opportunities open.\n\n\u201cI think AOC has a massive future in front of her, and that\u2019s a decision that she\u2019s going to make. I mean, obviously you see lots of conversation about her running for Senate, her running for president. I think all of those options, if I was her campaign manager, are probably going to be on the table,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s association of state party chairs.\n\nIn the short term, her colleagues in the House believe her best play is to keep her focus on the job at hand.\n\n\u201cShe has matured and evolved as a political leader in remarkable ways,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cShe has gone from being a huge outside force to being a huge inside force.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Former Vice President Al Gore championed the development of the internet so enthusiastically that one of the first myths of the online era was that he claimed to have invented it.\n\nIt was in those early days of the world wide web that one of Gore\u2019s successors came of age.\n\nJD Vance grew up with chat rooms and email and instant messaging. He graduated into young adulthood at the dawn of blogging. He entered politics with a millennial\u2019s fluency in social media.\n\nNow, at 40, he is the nation\u2019s third-youngest vice president \u2014 and, nearly a quarter-century after Gore left office, the nation\u2019s first very online vice president. It\u2019s a pioneering distinction that reflects the serious time and thought, as well as the debate-me vibes, that Vance puts into his interactions with others.\n\n\u201cI tend to err on the side of openness,\u201d Vance said in a recent interview aboard Air Force Two. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a generational thing, right? I come from a very tech-forward generation.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s unfiltered use of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, sets him apart from many of his political peers \u2014 and certainly from past vice presidents who were older, far more restrained and far less eager to slide into your mentions.\n\nWhere other elected officeholders rely on staff to send out tightly crafted messages, Vance estimates that, even with a full White House portfolio, he writes 98% of his posts himself. And where President Donald Trump and his hit-and-run blasts have pushed social media into new frontiers of political communication and confrontation, Vance has pushed further. Unlike Trump, he engages directly in conversations with his allies and fights with his critics. He also sticks around to watch reactions pour in, replying when it suits him.\n\nAt times, Vance is in on the joke. His recent Oval Office upbraiding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ignited a raft of memes in which Vance\u2019s face was edited into a variety of images \u2014 flattering or unflattering, depending on the poster\u2019s opinion of him. Vance contributed to the discourse by sharing an image of his face in the well-traveled Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme \u2014 a winking acknowledgement that he was enjoying all of the online fuss.\n\n\u201cIt can become very addictive, right?\u201d Vance said of social media. \u201cSo I try to limit myself. We limit our kids\u2019 screen time. I try to limit my screen time, too.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s posts at times veer into hostility. Last month, after he called for the rehiring of a federal employee who had resigned over making racist remarks online, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., scolded Vance, noting how they are both fathers of Indian American children.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cRacist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don\u2019t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.\u201d\n\nHe accused Khanna of \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d before concluding: \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d\n\nWhile Vance and his advisers characterize his social media persona as a worthy effort to foster authentic discussion and debate, his detractors view it as abrasive and performative.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with him being active on social media and engaging in conversation with critics,\u201d Khanna said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not hoping here for Lincoln-Douglas. I wish he were using it to have an actual substantive exchange instead of trying to own the libs in every tweet.\u201d\n\nAboard Air Force Two, Vance wrestled with his social media habits, at one point calculating how much time he spends online and at another volunteering that he is trying to read more books.\n\n\u201cI actually try not to look at it most of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in my office in the West Wing, I usually have my phone in a secure box, because people come in, there\u2019s classified information flowing everywhere. I sort of assume the Chinese or somebody else are hacked into my phone.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s tough to resist a morning or afternoon scroll.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 15 minutes just to make sure I\u2019m staying up to date on the news and I know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI\u2019m probably a little bit more active after the kids go to bed, right between 8 and 11.\u201d\n\nStormy posts, \u2018Always Sunny\u2019 memes\n\nSince being sworn in as vice president two months ago, Vance has posted from his personal @JDVance X account more than 140 times, including reposts and replies to other accounts.\n\nIn that same period, the official @VP handle that is managed by his office has posted roughly 250 times, with a heavy concentration on traditional statements, as well as reposts of content from other Trump administration officials and White House-affiliated accounts.\n\nWhile he averages fewer than three posts a day from his personal account, Vance often maximizes them by taking advantage of the unlimited characters he\u2019s afforded as a verified user. He is known for seeking out thought leaders and others whose beliefs place them outside the bounds of Trump\u2019s right-wing ideology and his reluctance to involve the U.S. in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nOver two days last month, Vance tapped out more than 850 words in a pair of posts that chided Niall Ferguson of the Hoover Institution, a hawkish vestige of the old-guard Republican economic and foreign policy establishment. Ferguson had slammed Trump\u2019s approach to the war in Ukraine. Ferguson did not mention Vance in his original post, but the vice president nevertheless locked in on it, decrying it as \u201cmoralistic garbage.\u201d\n\nOn Presidents\u2019 Day, Vance replied to former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, who had referred to Vance\u2019s rebuke of European free speech laws and asked if he was aware of the White House limiting access to Associated Press reporters.\n\n\u201cYes dummy,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between not giving a reporter a seat in the WH press briefing room and jailing people for dissenting views. The latter is a threat to free speech, the former is not. Hope that helps!\u201d\n\nAnd though Vance said he locks his phone away for much of the workday, several of his more colorful missives have come on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhen Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a clip of a recent CNN appearance in which he accused the White House of being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Vance clapped back with a Monday morning \u201cCharlie Conspiracy\u201d meme from the sitcom \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore politicians should be accessible and responsive,\u201d said Khanna, who, like Murphy and Vance, is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a waste of time or a disservice. It\u2019s the manner in which he\u2019s doing it. \u2026 That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nA reply guy is born\n\nVance has always been eager to express himself online.\n\nIn the aughts and early 2010s he dabbled as a blogger \u2014 first as an amateur Blogspot author during his days in the Marines and at Yale Law School, later at a site led by former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum.\n\nHis earliest days on social media are tougher to excavate. Vance acknowledged during his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio that he had deleted his old tweets, including those critical of Trump.\n\n\u201cIn 4 years, I hope people remember that it was those of us who empathized with Trump\u2019s voters who fought him most aggressively,\u201d Vance wrote in a since-scrubbed post from 2016.\n\nThe posts Vance wrote and interacted with in those days, when he was best known for his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d previewed the range he would offer as his political instincts developed. His tweets then were a mix of lighter fare in line with the childless young professional he was at the time \u2014 he goofed on an Obama White House post playing off the Disney film \u201cFrozen\u201d \u2014 and the punchiness he would hone as he made his sharp right turn.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty insane tweet,\u201d he wrote in response to a December 2016 post by liberal columnist Paul Krugman that suggested Trump could benefit from a 9/11-style attack.\n\nVance\u2019s online posture became more combative as he transitioned from anti-Trump Republican to Trump-backed candidate and U.S. senator.\n\nWhile disparaging Democratic leaders as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d in 2021 \u2014 an attack that came back to haunt him in his early days as Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 Vance fired off a tweet that included Krugman in the smear. In the years since, he has embraced the role of reply guy.\n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t such a humorless scold you might be a senator right now,\u201d he tweeted at Jason Kander, a past Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri who had mocked a photo of Vance pointing a rifle toward the sky in 2023 as a Chinese spy balloon flew over the U.S.\n\nAnyone who wondered whether Vance would change his freewheeling ways after winning the vice presidency got their answer soon after November\u2019s election. When Grace Chong, an associate of influential MAGA movement leader Steve Bannon, criticized him for missing a Senate vote on then-President Joe Biden\u2019s judicial nominees, Vance fired back.\n\n\u201cGrace Chong,\u201d he wrote on X, in a post that he later deleted, \u201cis a mouth breathing imbecile who attacks those of us in the fight rather than make herself useful.\u201d\n\nThe angel on Vance\u2019s social media shoulder\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance has urged her husband to be nicer on social media \u2014 advice he is not always keen to take, he told activists at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\n\u201cI take it sometimes!\u201d he said when reminded of the comment on Air Force Two.\n\nIf his wife is the angel on his social media shoulder, who is the devil? The second lady, who was seated across from her husband on the plane and until that point in the interview had quietly kept her head down, looked up in amusement after hearing the question.\n\n\u201cI guess I have a few,\u201d Vance responded, after repeating it.\n\n\u201cThe only time that my staff ever tweets for me,\u201d he continued, nodding toward his communications director, William Martin, \u201cis if I\u2019m in a speech and I say, \u2018Hey, Will, can you just make sure a clip of this gets out in real time?\u2019 Or if I\u2019m in meetings all day, \u2018Hey, can you say something about this, and say it like that?\u2019 That happens probably 2% of the time. The other 98% of the time, it\u2019s all me. So I guess I don\u2019t have anybody else to blame when I get something wrong.\u201d\n\nVance has copped to being wrong, at least in his opinion, about Trump in 2016. Yet he has been more stubborn about his unsubstantiated claim last fall on X that Haitian migrants were abducting and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. When reporters confronted him about the absence of evidence, Vance made no apologies and instead took credit for drawing attention to other problems that immigration had stirred up in his home state.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conspiracy theories, some of which turn out to be legitimate, some of which turn out to be totally bats---,\u201d Vance, speaking broadly about the social media landscape, said aboard the plane. \u201cAnd I guess I just think openness is really important.\u201d\n\nHow does he muster the confidence to plow ahead with takes that may be proved wrong?\n\n\u201cBeing wrong is OK,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cI\u2019d rather be open with people and wrong than overly cautious, never take any risks in the service of never getting anything wrong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to change your mind. \u2026 I guess my confidence comes from the fact that, if I can argue somewhat successfully with my wife, I assume I can argue well with anybody.\u201d\n\nThe second lady, Vance admitted, wishes he would \u201cbe a little bit more gentle\u201d online.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s also encouraged me not to filter myself and not to just become a kind of creature of consultant guidance,\u201d he added. \u201cPoliticians, they get way too comfortable with slogans. Yeah, sometimes you need to hammer home a message, but you can\u2019t just do that, or you become a total robot.\u201d"

            "full_content": "TORONTO \u2014 China executed four Canadians in recent months, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister said Wednesday. Such executions of Westerners are relatively rare.\n\nForeign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said she and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked for clemency in the drug-related accusations involving the dual citizens.\n\nBeijing\u2019s embassy in Ottawa said the executions were due to drug crimes and noted that China does not recognize dual citizenship.\n\n\u201cWe strongly condemn the executions,\u201d Joly told reporters in Ottawa. \u201cI asked personally for leniency ... They were all dual citizens.\u201d\n\nJoly said Canada consistently asks for clemency for Canadians facing the death penalty abroad. She said the families have asked the government to withhold details of the identities of the four individuals.\n\nGlobal Affairs spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said the government continues to provide consular assistance to families and requested that the media respect their privacy. She said Ottawa continues to advocate for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian who was sentenced to death for drug smuggling.\n\n\u201cChina always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said. \u201cThe facts of the crimes committed by the Canadian nationals involved in the cases are clear, and the evidence is solid and sufficient.\u201d\n\nChina is believed to execute more prisoners each year than the rest of the world combined, though the total is a state secret. Executions are traditionally carried out by gunshot, though lethal injections have been introduced in recent years.\n\nThe embassy spokesperson said Beijing \u201cfully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned,\u201d and urged Canada\u2019s government to \u201cstop making irresponsible remarks.\u201d\n\nThe two countries have some tensions. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports earlier this month, after Canada imposed duties in October on Chinese-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminum products. The tariffs add to global trade tensions amid rounds of tariff announcements by the United States, China, Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cChina is sending us a message that we have to take steps if we want to see an improvement in the relationship,\u201d said a former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques.\n\nIan Brodie, a former chief of staff to former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, posted on social media that it turns out \u201cagricultural tariffs weren\u2019t the worst part of the PRC response to EV tariffs.\u201d\n\nAnd opposition Conservative lawmaker Michael Chong said \u201cexecuting a number of Canadians in short order is unprecedented, and is clearly a sign that Beijing has no intention of improving relations with Canada.\u201d\n\nChina is Canada\u2019s second-largest trading partner, but relations have been bad since Canadian authorities in 2018 arrested a former Huawei executive whom the U.S. had charged with fraud.\n\nChina jailed two Canadians shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, on a U.S. extradition request. They were sent back to Canada in 2021, the same day Meng returned to China after reaching a deal with U.S. authorities in her case.\n\nMany countries called China\u2019s action \u201chostage politics,\u201d while China described the charges against Huawei and Meng as a politically motivated attempt to hold back China\u2019s economic and technological development.\n\nAmnesty International condemned the executions and noted that China executed thousands of people in 2023.\n\n\u201cThese shocking and inhumane executions of Canadian citizens by Chinese authorities should be a wake-up call for Canada,\u201d the group\u2019s head for English-speaking Canada, Ketty Nivyabandi, said in a statement Wednesday."

            "full_content": "A federal judge on Thursday ruled the Trump administration could not deport Georgetown fellow Badar Khan Suri, who the university said was detained by the Department of Homeland Security as the Trump administration continues its immigration clampdown.\n\nUS District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said that while she reviews Khan Suri\u2019s petition in court challenging his detention, the administration is not to remove him from the country unless she issues another ruling to the contrary, according to the order.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s attorney, Hassan Ahmad, says he and his team are working \u201cdiligently\u201d to secure his client\u2019s removal from a detention facility in Louisiana where he has been since Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe welcome Judge Giles\u2019 ruling,\u201d Ahmad said in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt is the first due process Dr. Khan Suri has received since he was snatched away from his family on Monday night.\u201d\n\nKhan Suri is an Indian national who is in the US on a visa \u201cto continue his doctoral research on peace building in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d a court filing said.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity and we have not received a reason for his detention,\u201d the letter continued. In a statement to CNN, a university spokesperson said, \u201cWe expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier letter obtained by CNN, Georgetown University Interim President Robert Groves told its Board of Directors that Khan Suri had been detained by DHS and his visa had been revoked.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s detention comes as President Donald Trump continues to crack down on students who engage in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest case in a series of arrests and deportation proceedings the Trump administration has brought against people associated with US colleges and universities, sending shockwaves across the academic community and raising concerns about the protection of free speech.\n\nKhan Suri is married with children, but his family has not been given any information about his detention, his sister, Khushnuma Khan, told CNN. That includes their parents who live in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Khan said.\n\n\u201cWe know only as much as anyone else, which is what is reported in the media. We are currently confused about how and why this is happening to him,\u201d she said.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s petition, filed earlier this week, alleged that his \u201ctargeted, retaliatory\u201d detainment is tied to a broader effort by the Trump administration to allegedly revoke the visas of individuals \u201cpurportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech.\u201d\n\nSuch an approach is unconstitutional, his lawyers allege.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s sister added, \u201cMy brother\u2019s wife is from Gaza. So maybe that is why this is happening.\u201d\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s wife, Mapheze Saleh, is Palestinian, the petition notes, and a former employee of the Qatari-based news network Al Jazeera who had been \u201csmeared\u201d by an online group that \u201cspreads misinformation and seeks to discredit American Muslims,\u201d according to the court filing.\n\nA court declaration filed on Thursday by Saleh said she posted on social media to show her support of the people of Gaza after the start of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nSaleh notes that she was born in the US and moved to Gaza at age 5, according to her declaration. Her father, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as Deputy of Foreign Affairs in Gaza until 2010, the filing said.\n\nIn February, Saleh says she started to feel unsafe, as online websites falsely accused her of having ties to Hamas, according to her declaration.\n\nKhan Suri met Saleh\u2019s father on two occasions \u2013 once during a humanitarian visit to Gaza and a second time to ask for Saleh\u2019s hand in marriage, according to the filing. The couple moved to New Delhi in 2013 and Badar never returned to Gaza, the declaration adds.\n\nWhile the filing does not mention Saleh\u2019s father by name, The New York Times reported that Ahmed Yousef \u2013 a former adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh \u2013 confirmed in a voice message that he was Suri\u2019s father-in-law. Yousef told The New York Times that he had left his position with the Hamas-run government more than a decade ago, and that his son-in-law was not involved in any \u201cpolitical activism.\u201d\n\nGeorgetown University in Washington, DC, seen on October 18, 2024. Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters/File\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a Wednesday post on X that Khan Suri was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. Khan Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming unfortunately emblematic of this administration to conflate the acknowledgement of Palestinian humanity with Hamas propaganda,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, Khan Suri\u2019s attorney.\n\nWhen asked about Khan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, Ahmad said, \u201cI\u2019m only aware of one, possibly two times, that he\u2019s met his father-in-law.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the administration to say that it\u2019s a close tie to a known and suspected terrorist, well, where\u2019s the evidence? No administration official has put forth a shred of evidence that my client Dr. Khan Suri has been involved or is affiliated with any known or suspected terrorist,\u201d Ahmad told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday.\n\nKhan Suri is being detained in southern Louisiana, Ahmad told CNN.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still fasting as an observant Muslim during Ramadan and trying to keep his spirits up,\u201d Ahmad added. \u201cHe understands that he is a political prisoner. Those are his words and and he\u2019s grateful for the outpouring of support that he has received.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the DHS for further clarification. On Thursday, at an event in Florida, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem did not answer questions asked by reporters about Khan Suri.\n\nMcLaughlin also said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on Saturday that \u201c[Khan] Suri\u2019s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\u201d under an obscure legal statute that gives the secretary of state authority to act if he or she believes a non-citizen would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\n\nThe State Department declined CNN\u2019s requests for additional comment.\n\n\u201cI will say that seeing our government abduct and jail another innocent person is beyond contemptible,\u201d Ahmad said in an email to CNN earlier this week. \u201cAnd if an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar.\u201d\n\nAhmad wrote in a court filing that Khan Suri was targeted because of his wife\u2019s \u201cidentity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech,\u201d the Associated Press reported. She is an American citizen, according to the filing.\n\nDHS provided no evidence that Khan Suri has committed any crimes and his detention violates his free speech and due process rights, Ahmad wrote in the court filing.\n\nThe postdoctoral fellow \u201ccares deeply\u201d about human rights and peace, another attorney for Khan Suri said.\n\n\u201cDr. Khan Suri is a loving husband and father of young children. He was a distinguished faculty member of the prestigious Georgetown University, who specializes in peace and conflict studies, someone who cares deeply about human rights, dignity, peace, and safety for all people,\u201d Nermeen Arastu, an attorney on Khan Suri\u2019s legal team and associate professor of immigration law at CUNY School of Law told CNN.\n\nWhen DHS officers came for Khan Suri they were \u201cbrandishing weapons\u201d and wore black masks covering their faces, Arastu said.\n\n\u201cICE agents came in the night, took him captive, taking him from his wife and children, and hauled him away to an unknown location before transferring him to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, far from his family and attorneys,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is every family\u2019s worst nightmare. And let\u2019s be clear, this happened to him simply because President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his.\u201d\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, was arrested earlier this month after the Trump administration accused Khalil \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 of being a terrorist sympathizer and supporting Hamas. Khalil faces possible deportation until his case is heard. Khalil was arrested under the same statute used to detain Khan Suri.\n\nAccording to Khan Suri\u2019s bio page on the university\u2019s website, he is a fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown\u2019s school of foreign service. He was teaching a class this spring on majoritarianism and minority rights in South Asia.\n\nCNN\u2019s Evan P\u00e9rez, Tierney Sneed, Aleena Fayaz and Amanda Musa contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Barely two months into his second term, President Donald Trump has already become a consequential president. Unfortunately, no matter how good are his ends, he too often chooses maladroit and even destructive means. He has roiled international commerce, tanked domestic markets, turned friendly populations hostile, and staged embarrassing retreats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUp next may be yet another excessive attempt to immanentize one of his worst passions, hostility toward immigration. The administration apparently is preparing a much-expanded travel ban. Eight years ago he targeted seven Muslim-majority nations, halting political and religious refugees midflight. Among his victims were Iranian Christians, who had abandoned their homes and fled to Europe, awaiting entry into America, for which they had been vetted. The ill consequences of Trump\u2019s arbitrary diktat undermined his attempt to overhaul immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection has triggered a replay. In January he froze refugee admissions: \u201cThe order closed the country to 700 Iranian Jews who had applied for refugee [through a special Iran program],\u201d the Times of Israel reported. \u201cThese Jews were among more than 13,000 applicants from other religious minorities in Iran, including Christians, Baha\u2019is, Sabean-Mandaeans and Zoroastrians.\u201d Who, other than the Islamic extremists who dominate Iranian politics, benefits from this policy?\n\nThe administration apparently is developing a much larger travel prohibition. The purpose, Trump declared in a January Executive Order, is to protect Americans \u201cfrom aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\u201d Although the planning is more serious than in 2017, the means looks no less flawed.\n\nOf course, the government should screen foreigners coming to America, but the standards should be narrow and substantive. Domestic terrorism is a very low probability event. Governments routinely abuse the concept of national security. For instance, at the extreme, Hong Kong now deems essentially any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, or local CCP apparatchiks to \u201cendanger national security.\u201d\n\nPunishing \u201chateful ideology\u201d opens a Pandora\u2019s Box. Today the administration is targeting criticism of Israel. The next Democratic administration might use the rule to bar any foreigner who espouses a MAGAesque philosophy. Malevolence is in the eye of the beholder. That standard could apply to many red and blue activists alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually important, the means should be tailored to the end. First, standards should be looser for visitors than immigrants. The latter settle permanently, ultimately helping to shape what America is and becomes. In contrast, personal character, temperament, behavior, political views, and the like matter little for transitory contact. Absent a desire and ability to do harm, there are few reasons to prevent people from visiting for a specific purpose and a limited time.\n\nSecond, restrictions should be tailored to the threat, which is usually the result of individual, not national, characteristics. A ban rarely makes sense. There may be legitimate reasons to restrict travel, but rare is the justification for an absolute ban. Indeed, openness can boost national security. Meeting adversaries whose governments have poor relationships with the U.S. government can be useful, even vital. The right kind of contact can help subvert authoritarian regimes. At least one of Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s aides had long before visited the US.\n\nThe administration reportedly plans a three-tier system. At the bottom, countries would be given 60 days to meet complaints such as \u201cfailing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries.\u201d The tentative list has 22 nations: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Vanuatu, and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe group includes a rogues\u2019 gallery of authoritarian, corrupt, and hostile governments, failed states, and conflict-ridden lands. However, some democratic, reasonably liberal states, such as Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia, also are included. They are a category apart from many of the other targeted nations. Corruption and crime are issues for these governments, but their citizens aren\u2019t likely to pose a major threat to Americans. These nations should not be treated the same.\n\nFor countries which fail to meet the administration\u2019s standards, the response should be careful scrutiny rather than absolute prohibition. People have reason to flee the endless war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and religious violence in the Republic of the Congo (where Christians are most at risk). Political repression is high in Chad, Zimbabwe, and Angola. Washington should not trust their authorities, so a review of current practices may well be warranted. However, the abuses of these governments are an important reason not to shut off travel by their oppressed and persecuted peoples.\n\nThe administration plans to tightly restrict visas for ten countries: Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Turkmenistan. This list is also a curious mix. Turkmenistan and South Sudan compete to be the least free nations on Earth, rated worse than North Korea; Eritrea is another ruthless dictatorship, tied with the North on the Freedom House Freedom in the World index. In contrast, Sierra Leone is rated partly free and holds regular multi-party elections. It has serious problems, but nothing like the preceding states. Haiti is in violent chaos, Myanmar has descended into countrywide civil war, Pakistan is a faux democracy run by the military and pervaded by Islamic radicalism. Laos is a sleepy communist dictatorship. Belarus is allied with Russia, which is the target of an allied proxy war over Ukraine, but with which the Trump administration wants to improve relations.\n\nUndoubtedly, the president doesn\u2019t want to trigger another wave of mass migration from Haiti, but America should be willing to offer sanctuary to those most seriously threatened by violence. The totalitarian states are nasty but pose no meaningful security threat. South Sudanese continue to kill each other, not Americans. Similar is Myanmar/Burma. Isolating the Burmese people does not punish Myanmar\u2019s generals. Pakistan is a continuing source of radical Islamists, but Americans, in and out of government, should maintain a dialogue with more liberal Pakistanis. And given the dismal state of Washington\u2019s relations with Moscow, the U.S. needs more, not less, contact with the people of Russia and Belarus. While Washington won\u2019t easily drive Moscow and Beijing apart, the U.S. could at least stop driving them together.\n\nFinally, there are eleven countries from which all travel would be prohibited. The eternally damned are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. A full travel ban should require a compelling justification. However, that is largely absent in these cases. To start, Bhutan? Nestled between China and India, this Himalayan country has a population under 800,000 and is rated free by Freedom House. A few Bhutanese have been found to be living illegally in America, 17 in 2022, but that hardly constitutes a crisis. (Perhaps one of the president\u2019s factotums was denied a tourist visa to the mountainous kingdom and decided to use this opportunity to exact massive retaliation.)\n\nThe president apparently wants to restart negotiations with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Although there likely would be few visitors from the North, at least in the near term, Washington should encourage enhanced contacts. Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela are highly repressive and regime opponents might find America to be the only alternative to prison. Trump also is seeking talks with Iran, which would be advanced by allowing its people to visit America. Libya, Somalia, and Sudan are in various degrees of chaos, violence, and competing governments. While Washington has good reason to be careful in granting visas amid shambolic violence, it should not forbid all travel. Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban was recently at war with America, but dwelling on the past will not improve the future. The only certainty is that refusing to engage the ruling regime is not going to liberate anyone. Finally, the U.S. is fighting an undeclared war with Yemen. Ansar Allah might pose a terrorist threat, but, again, it is foolish to say never to Yemeni visitors.\n\nEight years ago Trump\u2019s hastily and carelessly drafted \u201cMuslim ban\u201d had to be twice rewritten, and even then its botched execution bedeviled the administration throughout the president\u2019s term. This time, at least, his officials appear to be debating the issue before crafting new rules. However, more work is necessary, assuming the leaks reflect reality. Ban travel from Bhutan? How would this protect America? And if Trump hopes to warm American relations with Russia and North Korea, how does prohibiting their people from traveling to the U.S. help? Instead, Washington should maintain a generally open door for visitors. Since its founding the U.S. has grown, prospered, and dominated because of its attraction to others. The president needs to reconsider his approach to other nations. Today more than a quarter of Canadians view America as their enemy, an astounding number. Trump needs to stop repelling and start persuading. Toward that end, his administration should continue to welcome visitors from around the world."

            "full_content": "Democrat-aligned Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford is an \u201cextreme abortion activist, not an impartial judge,\u201d read mailers sent out to Wisconsin voters on Wednesday ahead of the April 1 election.\n\nBreitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the mailer, which is being sent by Women Speak Out PAC, a partner of the leading pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, as part of its initial $1 million investment in the race. The PAC is specifically sending the mailer to people who voted for President Donald Trump, as well as pro-life voters in the Badger State, encouraging them to reject Dane County Circuit Judge Crawford and vote for former conservative Wisconsin Attorney General and Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Brad Schimel.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and Brad Schimel Agree: on the issue of abortion, the people decide, not judges,\u201d the mailer reads. \u201cBut Susan Crawford is an extreme abortion activist, not an impartial judge.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Exclusive \u2014 Eyes on Wisconsin: State Supreme Court Race That Could Bring Trump\u2019s Agenda to a Screeching Halt\n\nThe mailer further points out that Crawford represented abortion giant Planned Parenthood as a lawyer and that she is endorsed by pro-abortion groups like Planned Parenthood and EMILY\u2019s List.\n\n\u201cThousands of lives are at stake! Don\u2019t let Susan Crawford use Wisconsin\u2019s highest court to impose abortion on demand with no limits!\u201d the mailer concludes.\n\nThe mailer, along with text messages, are going out at the beginning of early voting, which goes through March 30. It comes after the Women Speak Out PAC deployed students in the state to knock on doors and encourage voter turnout. The door-knocking effort began on March 6 and finished over the weekend, with canvassers completing 152,000 visits.\n\n\u201cThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is being viewed as a bellwether for Donald Trump and his first 100 days. The results will impact whether Trump continues to have Republican majorities and whether the Wisconsin people will determine abortion policy or four activist judges,\u201d Political Affairs Communications Director for SBA Pro-Life America Kelsey Pritchard told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cLives depend upon Brad Schimel defeating Susan Crawford, a radical Planned Parenthood lawyer who calls abortion \u2018health care.\u2019 Our student canvassers have reached more than 152,000 voters at their doorsteps to sound the alarm on Crawford\u2019s radical abortion record,\u201d she continued. \u201cTheir conversations have changed minds in this close race and energized voters to show up on or before April 1 to elect Brad Schimel.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Left-Wing Megadonors Supercharge High-Stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court Race\n\nThe 2025 race follows a blowout Wisconsin Supreme Court election in 2023, in which liberal-leaning Janet Protasiewicz beat conservative candidate Dan Kelly and flipped the balance of the court 4-3 majority liberal. While conservatives have the chance to take back the majority once more with the retirement of liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, Democrats view the battle as a chance to push policy and redraw legislative maps that could ultimately lose Republicans two U.S. House seats and help them close in on the Republicans\u2019 slim majority.\n\nLike every election since the Supreme Court overturned the invented federal right to abortion in 2022, Democrats and left-leaning media are largely framing the election as another referendum on abortion. When Roe v. Wade was struck down, Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion restriction went into effect, but was put on hold in December 2023 and is expected to come before the state\u2019s high court later this year.\n\nAs a candidate, Crawford has declined to say how she would rule on the law, but she did say in an interview that the government should not regulate abortions, according to a New York Times article with the headline \u201cOne of 2025\u2019s Biggest Battles Over Abortion Rights Has Already Begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe as a woman that I should be the one to make decisions about my own body and my health care, together with my doctors,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust other women to make those same decisions.\u201d\n\nIn February, AdImpact Politics reported that 62 percent of Crawford\u2019s broadcast airings have mentioned abortion, surpassing Protasiewicz in 2023, who also campaigned on the issue.\n\nIn an article for Breitbart News, Pritchard wrote that Crawford \u201cfought against a law for women\u2019s safety requiring abortion businesses to have hospital admitting privileges\u201d and \u201crepresented the abortion industry in fighting a law to prevent women from being coerced into abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrawford has been publicly grieving the end of Roe v. Wade, the case that is responsible for the deaths of 63 million unborn babies. Maybe most disturbingly of all, she uses the same euphemisms as the abortion industry, calling abortion \u2018health care,'\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have wholeheartedly embraced Crawford\u2019s extremist history and are campaigning based on her clear messages of how she will rule in abortion cases,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis mirrors their efforts two years ago when the party lined up behind the liberal Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz who ran her campaign almost completely on the issue of abortion.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also view the race as a pathway to power in D.C. An email invitation obtained by Breitbart News to a briefing on Jan.13 with Democrat donors, Crawford, and Wisconsin Democrat Chairman Ben Wikler had a subject line that read: \u201cChance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut winning this race could also result in Democrats being able to win two additional US House seats, half the seats needed to win control of the House in 2026,\u201d the email reads.\n\nThe two seats are currently held by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) in the 1st Congressional District in southeast Wisconsin and Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) in the 3rd Congressional District in the western part of the battleground state.\n\n\u201cThey got caught saying the quiet thing out loud, and they revealed what they\u2019re up to. This is, as it was in 2023, a power play to attract enormous amounts of money from partisan donors and turn that into results on the court,\u201d Schimel told Breitbart News in an exclusive phone interview, referring to the email.\n\n\u201cThis is going to affect not just Wisconsin, this will affect the nation,\u201d Schimel continued. \u201cWhen people talk about the timeline that President Trump has to push his goals, that timeline will be cut short or even shorter if they use the Wisconsin Supreme Court to gerrymander the maps as a court and change our representation in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Crawford told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she \u201chas never publicly or privately commented on congressional redistricting at any time and did not at this meeting.\u201d\n\nCrawford previously told the publication: \u201cI got into the Zoom and introduced myself, told the group why I was running, that I pledged to be fair and impartial, to pursue common sense justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. After speaking for a few minutes, I exited the Zoom. I was not there to hear the rest of their agenda.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Complaint Filed Against Dem WI Supreme Court Candidate over Email Touting Chance to Put U.S. House Seats \u201cin Play\u201d\n\nThis race is expected to be even more expensive than the 2023 election, which shattered national spending records for a judicial contest at $56 million and brought in massive out-of-state spending. In Wisconsin, state Supreme Court justices serve ten-year terms.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News. You can follow her on X @thekat_hamilton."

And President Trump prods Ukraine and Russia toward peace.\n\nOvernight, the U.S. pounded Iranian-backed Houthi targets in Yemen again. And the backlash grows over the Trump administration's deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. We will talk to White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, the head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut's Jim Himes.\n\nMeanwhile, members of Congress may have been happy to head home for recess last week, but now they may be eager to get back to Washington.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMAN: Do you share a concern that we're careening toward an authoritarian country?\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As elected officials on both sides of the aisle got an earful from angry constituents.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMAN #1: The message that was sent by Democrats in Congress with the C.R. catastrophe was clear. It's not that you're in the minority. It's that you aren't even working together on a shared strategy. And that is failure!\n\nMAN #2: Why do you believe that President Trump is above the law? Why have you not spoken out for it?\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, measles infections have now been reported in 18 states. We will consult with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb about that and talk about the impact of Trump's cuts on medical research.\n\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nThere is a lot to cover on the home front, but we begin first on national security. In just a few hours, U.S. officials will be holding talks with Ukraine and tomorrow a separate round with Russia in pursuit of a 30-day cease-fire.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is ramping up the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, sending a second aircraft carrier to the region.\n\nWe begin this morning with White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nGood to have you here.\n\nMIKE WALTZ (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, the Iran-backed Houthis, they continue to fire at Israel. What has the last week of bombing achieved? And if you're holding Iran responsible, what's next?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, we have taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer. We have hit their headquarters. We have hit communications nodes, weapons factories, and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities just in the last couple of days.\n\nPresident Trump has decided to hit the Houthis and hit them hard, as opposed to, in the last administration, where literally weeks or months would go by with these kind of one-off pinprick attacks. And, as a result, we have had one of the world's most critical sea lanes get shut down.\n\nI mean, these guys are like al Qaeda or ISIS with advanced cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and some of the most sophisticated air defenses, all provided by Iran, Margaret. Just to \u2013 so everybody understands the impact here\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 the last time one of our destroyers went through the straits there, it was attacked 23 times; 75 percent of our U.S.-flagged shipping now has to go around the southern coast of Africa, rather than going through the Suez Canal.\n\nAnd keeping the sea lanes open, keeping trade and commerce open\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 is a fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration was not effective.\n\nThe Trump administration and President Trump have decided to do something much harder, much tougher, and much \u2013 and what \u2013 we will see, but I think will be much more effective.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said he's going to hold Iran responsible as well. Envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview that Iran had responded to this U.S. outreach via multiple channels in regard to a letter sent by the president.\n\nWitkoff described it as an offer to Iran to create a verification program so nobody worries about weaponization of nuclear material. Can you clarify, is the U.S. seeking the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program or verification, like what President Obama put in place back in 2015 and President Trump pulled out of?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Full dismantlement.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see.\n\nAnd this is \u2013 look, as President\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have they said they're interested?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: As President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table.\n\nAnd it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear weapon. That \u2013 and they will not and cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapons program.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have they responded to the president's call for these talks?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: That's enrichment, that is weaponization, and that is its strategic missile program.\n\nCan you only imagine?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We have seen the death and destruction that they're doing through its proxies, between Hezbollah, the Assad regime, the Houthis and what have you. If they had nuclear weapons, the entire Middle East would explode in an arms race.\n\nThat is completely unacceptable to our national security. I won't get into what the back-and-forth has been, but Iran is in the worst place it has been from its own national security since 1979, thanks to Hezbollah, Hamas, the Assad regime and its own air defenses being taken out by the Israelis.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So there's still a chance for diplomacy? I know you won't get into\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, of course.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: The president has all options on the table, but we want to be clear.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This isn't some kind of \u2013 kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration or Biden.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This is the full program. Give it up or there will be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, closer to home, what has been happening here with Tren de Aragua, TDA, we're going to call them, which have been designated by the Trump administration as terrorists.\n\nLast Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador; 137 of them were deported using this rarely used 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first if they come from countries at war with the U.S.\n\nIn the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people, one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum-security prison, the other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all.\n\nHow does that kind of high-consequence mistake happen?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs, we will deal with on an individual basis.\n\nBut, Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge there?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I \u2013 I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases.\n\nBut what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one.\n\nAnd, number two, the Alien Sedition Act fully applies because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have \u2013 I'm sorry, just to clarify on that, this is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We are saying \u2013 we are saying \u2013 we are saying that TDA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien Sedition Act applies. And we cannot have district judges interfering with the commander in chief's actions to take care of in the way he deems necessary a terrorist organization.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And I got to tell you, we can \u2013 we can debate on Article II, Article III. That's a fair debate.\n\nHowever, in this case, the commander in chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fashion.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 in a proxy manner to influence and attack the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's different \u2013 that's so different\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But that's how\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela.\n\nI know the attorney general said on another network\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Sure. That's fine. But\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: No, but, Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to \u2013 by, with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We have taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard.\n\nAnd we're making a Washington, D.C., distinction\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 when the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs. But there is concern\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats on the other side.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: It sounds like in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around full of gang members that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's \u2013 man's prison, and El Salvador said no.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I mean, OK.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you're suspending the ability to have a day in court\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, I can't speak to the those individual details, if you want to\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you get the list right, right\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you can verify that these people are gang members.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 look, every one of them were here illegally.\n\nSo, first of all, we had every right and every \u2013 and should deport every one of these individuals. If you want to make a special case for one, that's fine.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported. They were sent to the prison.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But underlying that \u2013 underlying that is the Alien Act that has determined the commander in chief has the absolute authority to do this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure.\n\nI need to get to Ukraine with you because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease-fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said only holding back on energy infrastructure.\n\nWhat's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes, well, first, we're moving closer and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back.\n\nWe then \u2013 Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility conducting proximity talks.\n\nAnd the progression will be, we have this cease-fire on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease-fire, so that both sides can move grain, fuel and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea.\n\nAnd then we will talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines. And that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are, and then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace and a lasting peace, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about or have talked about as security guarantees.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 by Russia to Russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia.\n\nWhy did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University program. And they said \u2013 the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who want to know why. Do you know why?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with the goal.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But I can say that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call.\n\nAnd he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly first and foremost in kind of confidence-building measures.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But, again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back.\n\nJust a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We were in an endless stalemate here. And now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence-building measure? Is that what you meant?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence-building measures. That's one of them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you, Mike Waltz.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thank you. All right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee. And he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky.\n\nGood morning to you, Senator.\n\nBecause\u2026\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.\n\nBecause of your role in on Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court, but there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all.\n\nDo these concern \u2013 does any of this concern you, along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there are some big legal questions here.\n\nOn the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy and you can be deported.\n\nSo, really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court's going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years or are they going to defer to Congress?\n\nIf you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said, we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question? And I think they should have ruled based on\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and then the president issued an executive order that defied the congressional \u2013 what Congress did.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Right. Right.\n\nBut my point is, is, I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision and you had to guess what the Supreme County is going to do, my guess is, they will uphold the Alien Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it.\n\nSo it's at least debatable on both sides who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 oh, it's constitutional chaos, there's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority on the one hand that's been around for over 200 years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nBut just \u2013 we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now and what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done essentially in the cover of night. This seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side.\n\nBut we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except when the president wants to deport people. So, these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision-making.\n\nOn the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question. And I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings.\n\nSo I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions. And the only way they begin is by a challenge.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So, on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It just sounds \u2013 I mean, these are debates for law professors, certainly. But, in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nAre you comfortable, as the man with oversight as chair of the committee, with what's being done?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you're comfortable with it?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think you're going to be able to deport people \u2013 so, no, I \u2013 well, I don't think \u2013 you're answering for me.\n\nI think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And, while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court, and there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.\n\nI want to ask you about some congressional business. I have seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed.\n\nDo you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back, and we approve the cuts through rescission?\n\nAnd this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people \u2013 can Secretary Rubio pause the spending?\n\nOn that issue, I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment. And I think the courts so far have said it has to come back\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 unless, as the Trump administration argues, that the Impoundment Act is unconstitutional.\n\nSo this one's headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk.\n\nHe seemed enthusiastic it can be done. No Democrats \u2013 you have to realize\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 no Democrat will cut one penny from any spending anywhere.\n\nBut can we get all the Republicans is the real question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think the president is going to have \u2013 the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not a given that Republicans will stand \u2013 will vote for this.\n\nWe tried it once in the first administration.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, I remember.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: It was only $15 billion. And we lost. We lost two Republicans.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two Republicans.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: But my suggestion to the Trump \u2013 my suggestion to the Trump administration is, come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them in advance.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Don't put it in their lap. Bring them $500 billion. And if they say, this $10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're going to have to pre-negotiate the rescissions package.\n\nBut I think you could get there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education.\n\nStates, as everyone, I think, knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title I programs, which are low-income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate.\n\nHow are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two-thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two-thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: So, it's been an utter failure. What I'd like to \u2013 let me finish.\n\nI'd leave it back to the states. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or, better yet, never take it from the states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states.\n\nI think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing, they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching to national testing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But when we looked at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives $2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide $2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I'd rather \u2013 well, no, I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math.\n\nThe amount of dollars \u2013 look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success. And I have talked a lot about this. I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers and we pay them more.\n\nI would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers, teach the entire country, if not the entire world.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who would run that, the Education Department?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: And some of them \u2013 no, what you would find is, they'd be selected out state by state, across the nation.\n\nLook, people say, oh, without the Department of Education, we would have no testing. I was in school before then. We did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: You don't need the Department of Education for any of that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: But what I can tell you is, the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: But they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time because it would be presented through the Internet, with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nWell, I'm sure we will be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with the top Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Greenwich.\n\nGood morning to you.\n\nI want to jump right into it on the conversation about this Venezuelan gang. You have said some of your fellow Democrats have been too quick to use the term constitutional crisis. But because of the use of the Alien Enemies Act and this gang, you have started to become concerned that's where we are. Can you explain that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, that's right, Margaret, and thanks for having me.\n\nYou know, constitutional crisis is a - a sort of broadly used term. Lots of people have different definitions for it. It's a lot of stuff you don't like.\n\nI'll tell you what I know is a constitutional crisis. If the president of the United States decides to ignore the orders of a court - we have not seen that since Andrew Jackson did that in 1834. When that happens, you have a supine on its back Congress of the United States, completely beholden to the president, not acting as a check. And if the president says, I don't care what the court - courts say, which, by the way, he has not said, but which Tom Homan, his czar for deportation has said, now you have a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nSo, I think these next couple of days, as we see how this administration goes after the many judges and the many courts - many of these judges appointed by Republican presidents who are stopping the wild and illegal actions of this administration, we're going to see whether we are in a true, you know, Jacksonian constitutional crisis.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because of your role on the Intelligence Committee, I know you have some visibility into the assessments of U.S. intelligence. \"The New York Times\" reported that the intelligence community said, with moderate confidence, that the gang, TDA, that we've been talking about, is not directed by the Venezuelan government. However, the national security advisor just told us on this program, TDA is acting as a proxy of the Venezuelan government. Why does that distinction matter?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, well, it doesn't matter. And I'll come back around to that.\n\nBut look, what - what - what people worry about is that this administration acts with an unbelievable kind of cocktail of incompetence and illegality. When you fire all of the people at the Department of Energy who look after our nuclear weapons and then say, oops, we need to hire you back, that's incompetence.\n\nI listened to Mike. Mike is a friend of mine. I have respect for Mike. But what he did was dodge your question. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read the first paragraph of the Aliens Enemy Act, which says very clearly that the authority that this administration claims is dependent on a declaration of war.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Not on acting as a proxy. So, Mike distorted the law. And, you know, I read \"The New York Times\" article, too. I haven't seen specific intelligence about whether there's any connection whatsoever between Venezuela and the TDA gang.\n\nBut you're right, \"The New York Times\" - and, by the way, I'll get an answer on this tomorrow and I'm going to have some questions for Mike. \"The New York Times,\" of course, reported that there's - that the intelligence community believes that there's not a meaningful connection between Venezuela and the TDA gang. So, again, it's a bizarre combination of acting incompetently because maybe there's a Venezuelan hairdresser, a gay Venezuelan hairdresser with no connection to TDA. And if he's in this country illegally, fine, deport him. But to do it in this way under authorities that are not legal is not the way to do this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nYou're - you're referring there to some reporting in \"Time\" magazine about what happened to some of these - one particular detainee. On Friday, the Justice Department announced a criminal investigation into what they described as the leak of classified intelligence about this group, TDA. The deputy attorney general said they won't \"tolerate politically motivated efforts by the deep state to undercut President Trump's agenda by leaking false information\" to \"The New York Times.\"\n\nDo you have any concern - or is there concern within the intelligence community about these leaks?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's always concerns about leaks, Margaret. As ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, I don't care who a leak benefits. Whether it benefits Joe Biden or Donald Trump or whatever, they are not OK. They are violations of the law.\n\nIt's very interesting though that characterization that you just read, that we will not tolerate leaks that are inconsistent with President Trump's agenda. And this gets at one of my worst fears with respect to the national security operates under Donald Trump. Everything is about Donald Trump, right? And where I work, inside and overseeing the intelligence community, it is absolutely essential that the intelligence community be about one thing and one thing only, which is giving Donald Trump and other national leaders unvarnished, unbiased advise. And if this is all about serving the president's agenda, that is a notion that is completely at odds with what the intelligence community and what we spend $90 billion on making sure that policymakers, the president chief amongst them, has good information.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I was listening to a town hall that you did this past Thursday in Connecticut, and you were asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is. You threw out some of the sort of known entities, governors out there, but you said, \"while the party's not leaderless, Hakeem Jeffries is young and untested and Leader Schumer is not a wartime president.\"\n\nDo you think that your party can afford to stay the course with the existing leadership they have?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, I think we can do a lot better job with the leadership that we had. What I was acknowledging in the town hall meeting - and I will tell you, I've seen a lot of town hall meetings. I saw Chuck Grassley's town hall meeting. I saw my colleagues from Wyoming - ruby red Wyoming's time in the barrel.\n\nAnd people are outraged. They're outraged mainly, by the way, because they're coming to understand what Medicaid cuts are going to look like for them, what it means to obliterate programs that so much of the country - 70 million people in the case of Medicaid - rely on. So, there's an immense amount of anger.\n\nWhat I do know is that it was not a good look for the two congressional Democratic leaders to be on opposite sides of the continuing resolution. That created a great deal of adjita (ph) out there, and legitimately so. So, I am quite certain that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer have learned from this experience and are going to, at a minimum, be unified going forward here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will see.\n\nCongressman Jim Himes, we'll be watching you and that worldwide threat briefing that will be happening this coming week.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to America's health care system and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's also a board member at Pfizer.\n\nWelcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, measles is now in 18 states, as I understand it. Mostly Texas and New Mexico. But we have seen a growing number of infections, particularly in children.\n\nWhat do parents need to know and are adults protected?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Adults who have been vaccinated should be protected. This vaccine provides durable immunity. And there's no recommendation that anyone who's already been vaccinated, had the full schedule of two doses of vaccine when they were children, would need to get another booster. But if people are concerned, they can check their titers (ph). The only recommendation that CDC makes is people who are taking care of those with measles, perhaps health care workers, might consider an additional booster later in life.\n\nThe bigger challenge is with children. So, children get vaccinated, as you know, at one year, and then again when they're entering school at around age four. There's a window where children probably don't have a lot of immunity. So, a child born, has some immunity passed from their mom up until about six months. But there's a window between six and 12 months where they are largely unprotected. Typically, we don't vaccinate at six months because babies don't have developed immune systems where they can develop a durable immunity from an immunization like this. But there's some recommendations now that children, between the ages of six and 12 months, might get a first dose of vaccine. They would still require a second dose at age one and a third dose at age four.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the former CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, was talking about that this past week.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The current secretary of HHS, Secretary Kennedy, has said he wants anyone who desires the vaccine MMR to be able to get one. But he also describes himself as a, quote, \"freedom of choice person.\" I want to get your analysis of what seemed to be a suggested alternative treatment.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (HHS Secretary): They are getting very, very good results they report from Budesonide (ph), which is a steroid. It's a 30- year-old steroid. And they're - and erythromycin (ph) and also cod liver oil, which has high - high concentrations of vitamin a and vitamin d. And they are seeing what they describe as almost miraculous, instantaneous recovery from that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are those viable alternatives?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: They're not viable alternatives to vaccination. And I'd much prefer if he made a full-throated recommendation to parents to get kids vaccinated, especially in a setting of the regions where there's virus now spreading. He's talking about steroids and antibiotics. Those will use in the setting of a child who has developed pneumonitis, who's hospitalized, has respiratory distress. And so you might dose them with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. And steroids can reduce some of the inflammation in the lungs. The hope is children don't get into that kind of distressed situation because they've been vaccinated.\n\nAs far as vitamin a is concerned, there's really scant evidence that it's effective in this setting. It's used in the setting of malnourished children where it might provide some benefit. But I think talking about those kinds of therapeutics in this context creates a false impression that there's treatments available for measles when, in fact, there's not. The only way to prevent measles and prevent the sequelic (ph) from measles is to get vaccinated.\n\nYou know, it's the same way people may consider whether or not they choose to get vaccinated for influenza, for the flu. Some people might make a decision not to get vaccinated because they know therapeutics are available. I certainly would recommend that - that they do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think everyone should get vaccinated for influenza. But some people might make that choice. There is no choice in this setting. There's nothing effective at mitigating the effects of measles once you get it. So, the only way to do that is to get vaccinated.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the CDC website describes vitamin a as supportive care, but vaccination the best defense. So, thank you for explaining that.\n\nThere's no CDC director right now. The administration had to pull their nominee, as you know, because they couldn't get enough votes. Alex Tin (ph) here at CBS is reporting Florida's surgeon general and a former Texas congressman, Michael Burgess, are both being floated for the job. How important is it to get someone confirmed and in the role quickly?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I think it's very important, especially when you see what's going on around the country with this measles outbreak in west Texas. We may have more measles cases this year than we've had in 25 years. And so having leadership at the CDC that can direct that response is exceedingly important.\n\nMike Burgess ran the health subcommittee on energy and commerce, worked closely with the FDA when I was there. He was very good, very effective. He did a lot - a lot to advance our interdiction work in mail facilities to stop opioids from flowing through those facilities. He was very dedicated to that effort. Actually visited the mail facility in New York at JFK Airport to see firsthand the operation before he led a charge in Congress to help provide more funding to get more inspectors into the facilities. He has a lot of experience in a lot of the areas where CDC has a very relevant mission.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And they'll have to face a potential vote once the president makes a selection here.\n\nI want to ask about some of the byproducts and some of them deliberate cuts from the president's so-called belt-tightening here. There have been impacts at, for example, Johns Hopkins, an institute that does medical research and receives USAID grants. There are also deliberate cuts that have been vowed at Columbia and UPenn, two universities that get federal funding and do health research. Do you have any insight into how many health programs or the significance of the health programs that will be affected?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think anyone has insight into it yet. I think this is still playing out. These impacts are happening across a couple of different domains. There is restrictions on the ability to go forward with new grants because of limitations, for example, posting things in the federal register. There's new grant making policies that are being implemented. So, certain entities, certain countries are being added to lists where you can't do research. There were recently some grants canceled that coincided with research that would be done in conjunction with China. They're terminating certain grants on the basis of policy considerations, like whether or not they have a certain DEI component and however they are defining that.\n\nAnd then you see the institutional wide cuts. I think that's what happened to Johns Hopkins with respect to the USAID cuts. It's also what happened to Columbia with respect to that $400 million cut - federal cut that impacted a lot of research. There's - so there's multiple domains where they're being impacted right now. This is - this isn't all DOGE led.\n\nI think we need to be very careful when it comes to research programs where patients are involved.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, if you make a mistake with a program like a website that you took down, you can always put it back up. But when you cut a grant to a program where patients are involved, where continuity of care is really important to those patients, you need to make accommodation for that, or not make those cuts in the first place.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: I do know - I've had some conversations - I think DOGE is aware of that and trying to be mindful of those impacts.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No, it's a - it's an important point to be strategic when it comes to medical care.\n\nDr. Gottlieb, thank you for your insight.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to the Venezuelan deportation case. And for what's next, we're joined by our Justice Department correspondent, Scott Macfarlane and our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez.\n\nIt's good to have you both here.\n\nCamilo, you did some extraordinary reporting this week and obtained the names of the migrants who were sent to El Salvador. That's information that the administration refused to share with a federal judge, but you got it.\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We're still investigating every single case on this list of 238 Venezuelan men who were sent to El Salvador to be imprisoned there, but this is what we know. We know that according to court filings and also our own findings here at CBS News, some of the people on this list do have criminal histories in the U.S. or abroad in countries like Peru, Chile and Columbia. But we also know that, according to the government, many of these people do not have any criminal record in the U.S. And we have received documents from lawyers and attorneys and also the family members of the deportees who say that these people, some of them, do not have any criminal history in the U.S. But the administration is accusing all of them of being part of this transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua.\n\nBut how that accusation is being made is at the center of this story. The administration says they have U.S. intelligence and other techniques to identify these people as suspected TDA members, but their relatives and their lawyers say that some of these men were identified as TDA simply because of tattoos.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that is really where we get to the legal nub of the argument is, can you, as - as Senator Paul was saying, bypass the right to a day in court on the basis of someone having some tattoos?\n\nSo, Scott, the Trump administration is going to have this appeal tomorrow, as I understand it. You were in federal court Friday when the judge said it was, quote, awfully frightening how the administration stretched the law. They are looking for this fight. Why?\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: There's two different fights they're looking for. The legal is one of them. They are going to be in the appeals court tomorrow. They'll go to the Supreme Court potentially eventually, trying to consolidate power to make it an 18th century reality right now where you can expel people who are locked up currently on U.S. soil without having to go through the courts, even though the courts are trying to catch mistakes and make sure nobody's scooped upper erroneously.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even though you could deport them anyhow?\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: You can still deport them anyhow. That's one fight they're looking to fight.\n\nThere's also the political one, Margaret. There is so much political upside\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: To all of this for the Trump administration. And you heard that from the national security advisor a few moments ago when he told you this is a D.C. distinction. That the administration is not exactly concerned about looking too aggressive in deporting suspected gang members. There's all kinds of wins there.\n\nAnd then there's the other one, Margaret. The villainization of Washington, D.C., federal judges, which can galvanize the conservative base and the Trump base. And you saw that Friday in the courtroom with the judge, James Boesberg, pushing back on the president's allegations that he just wants to set these gang members free. The judge said, they are still locked up. You can deport them the normal way without invoking this 18th century law. Let's see how much more pushback there is from the president to the judge. There was more overnight on Truth Social.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They're - yes, he's spoken about it. He's posted about this judge, raising other concerns.\n\nCamilo, though, you actually have reported out what was done behind the scenes to bring this all to a head, to set up this fight. What did you learn?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What I can tell you is that based on conversations with DHS sources, the administration was actively preparing for this operation well before the president actually signed this proclamation, unbeknownst to the public last Friday before the White House actually published the actual proclamation on Saturday, March 15th and before those planes took off -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning do it as quickly as possible?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. They staged a roundup across the country of suspected TDA members and transferred those people to a Texas detention center. And by the time the judge held the first emergency hearing on this case, there were already two planes in the air and another one ready to take off.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Knowing that they might have to face a fight back in the courts.\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, the president has issued at least three executive orders that we have clocked impacting private law firms who represented clients at odds with President - or then Mr. Trump. That's bad for private business. One of those law firms cut a deal, $40 million. What's the impact here?\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: I talked to one of the lawyers who's been targeted by one of these actions. He says, they're trying to take me off the playing field. They're trying to take others off the playing field as we continue to challenge the administration in course. A chilling affect to make it harder to file these lawsuits that have been the firewall so far on the Trump administration.\n\nBut there's a distinction in the latest round of actions prohibiting these law firms based in Washington from doing business in government buildings or with government employees. That is a death sentence for a Washington, D.C. law firm. And, in fact, one of those firms, Perkins Coie, the ones challenging this in court, said as much to the judge, this would kill us. And the judge here in Washington has, for now, held off on the Trump executive action to strip Perkins Coie. But we'll see how long that protection lasts.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And this has knock=on affects for others seeking legal services but also, as you said, makes them hard to just function.\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: Especially the stripping of security clearances, Margaret. That makes it harder for a whistleblower at the FBI, or the CIA, or the Pentagon to find a lawyer to blow the whistle. It makes it possible such whistles will not be blown.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they need to seek counsel who have ability to deal with classified information.\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Camilo, the administration announced Friday they're revoking legal status of half a million migrants who came here legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela during President Biden's term. This is another fight they wanted to have. But if the intention - the stated intention is to go after the worst of the worst and deport them, why focus on people who bothered to be here legally?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the administration would argue that the Biden administration abused its immigration executive authority to create this program without Congress and that the people who came here under this policy are undercutting American workers and that they are essentially illegal immigrants as well. And now they are turning them into illegal immigrants by stripping them of their legal status, their work permits, their deportations protection. Right now they have, for the next 30 days, a chance to self-deport through a smartphone app. If they don't do that, DHS is warning that they will be found, arrested and deported from the country.\n\nAnd this crackdown on immigration by the administration is also extending to other parts of the immigration system. We also know that the administration is suspending funding \u2013 federal funding for legal services providers and lawyers to help - who help migrant children, who have left federal custody, or who are still in federal custody and who are facing deportation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And this is all intentional, the taking funding away, even from migrant kids?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes, this administration does not believe that federal funds should be used for people who are in the country illegally or without legal permission.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, you're going to be busy. Thank you for breaking it all down for us. I appreciate it.\n\nMACFARLANE: Thank you.\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)"

We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st. Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile. He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends.

Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss. It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years -- so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller. We grieve with Brett, Jessica, Hunter, and their community of family and friends in mourning the loss of Miller, who had a spark in his eyes, an outgoing and feisty personality, and a warm and loving nature.

            "full_content": "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 23, 2025.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, and he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, because of your role in Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court. But there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all. Do these concern- does any of this concern you? Along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?\n\nSEN. PAUL: There are some big legal questions here. On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien and Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy, and you can be deported. So really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court is going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years, or are they going to defer to Congress? If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question Congress--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Right and then the president issued executive order that defied the- what Congress did--\n\nSEN. PAUL: Right, right. But my- my point is- is I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision, and you had to guess what the Supreme Court is going to do, my guess is they'll uphold the Alien and Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it. So it's at least debatable on both sides, who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say, oh, it's constitutional chaos. There's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority. On the one hand, it's been around for over 200 years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, but just- we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now. And what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done, you know, essentially in the cover of night, this seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court. Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?\n\nSEN. PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side, but we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except for when the president wants to deport people. So these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision making. On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question, and I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings. So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions, and the only way they begin is by a challenge.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah\n\nSEN. PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It just sound- I mean- these are debates for law professors, certainly, but in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction. Are you comfortable as the man with oversight, as chair of the committee, with what's being done?\n\nSEN. PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process. I don't think you are going to be able to deport people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you are comfortable with it?\n\nSEN. PAUL: So no, I- well, I think you're answering for me. I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien and Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court. And there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. I want to ask you about some congressional business. I've seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed. Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?\n\nSEN. PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back and we approve the cuts through rescission, and this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people, can Secretary Rubio pause the spending. On that issue I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment, and I think the court so far has said it has to come back, and less as the Trump administration argues that the empowerment Act is unconstitutional. So this was headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is, send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk. He seemed enthusiastic. It can be done. No Democrats- you have to realize, no Democrats will cut one penny from any spending anywhere. But can we get all the Republicans, is the real question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?\n\nSEN. PAUL: Well, I think the president's gonna- the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it. It's not a given that Republicans will stand, will will vote for this. We tried it once in the first administration it was only--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Right, I remember--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --15 billion, and we we lost. We lost two Republicans. But my suggestion to the Trump-, my suggestion to the Trump administration is come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them, in advance, don't put it in their lap. Bring them 500 billion. If they say this, 10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're gonna have to pre negotiate the rescissions package. But I think you could get there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education. States, as everyone I think knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title One programs, which are low income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate. How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?\n\nSEN. PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency? So it's an utter failure\u2013\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?\n\nSEN. PAUL: What I'd like to- let me finish, I'd leave it back to the States. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or better yet never take it from the States. About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states. I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching-\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Right--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --teaching to national testing. The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But when we look at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives 2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide 2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.\n\nSEN. PAUL: I'd rather well, no, what I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math. The amount of dollars, look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially, and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success, and I've talked a lot about this, I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers, and we pay them more. I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers teach the entire country if not the entire world--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Who would run that? The education department?--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --And some of them- no what you'd find is they'd be selected out state by state across the nation. Look, people say, oh, without the department education, we'd have no testing. I was- I was in school before then, we did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --You don't need the Department of Education for any of that. But what I can tell you is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids. What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more, but they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time, because it would be presented to the internet with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm sure we'll be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back."

The IRS has encouraged undocumented migrants to file taxes, a process that includes providing the agency with their addresses, employers and earnings.\n\nCNN reported earlier this year that DHS had circulated a draft memo to the IRS that represented a sweeping request for information about suspected undocumented immigrants, including the home addresses of several hundred thousand individuals who paid federal taxes based on their individual taxpayer identification numbers, according to a source with direct knowledge of the document.\n\nPrivacy experts say that would be a violation of the strict disclosure laws that the IRS operates under which prohibit the release of tax information by an IRS employee.\n\nThe draft the person described Sunday appears to be a narrower version of the earlier draft. Under the current iteration, the IRS would confirm migrants\u2019 addresses rather than provide the information to ICE.\n\nStill, it would amount to a major shift by the agency. Requests would need to be submitted by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem or acting ICE director Todd Lyons, and must include the name and address of the taxpayer, and the date of their removal order, which would allow the IRS to confirm the information.\n\nTwo immigrant rights groups in Chicago sued the Treasury Department and IRS earlier this month and asked a judge to block the agency from sharing taxpayers\u2019 identifying information with ICE or DHS, as Trump pushes for more deportations.\n\nThe groups claimed federal law \u201cforbids\u201d the IRS from giving this data to immigration authorities, because ICE and DHS aren\u2019t listed as exceptions to the confidentiality rules in the tax code."

            "full_content": "Cape Town, South Africa AP \u2014\n\nThe South African ambassador who was expelled from the United States and declared persona non grata by the Trump administration was given a hero\u2019s welcome on his return home Sunday, when hundreds of supporters gathered at an airport and sang songs praising him.\n\nThe crowds at Cape Town International Airport surrounded Ebrahim Rasool and his wife Rosieda as they emerged in the arrivals terminal in their hometown, and they needed a police escort to help them navigate their way through the building.\n\n\u201cA declaration of persona non grata is meant to humiliate you,\u201d Rasool told the supporters as he addressed them with a megaphone. \u201cBut when you return to crowds like this, and with warmth\u2026 like this, then I will wear my persona non grata as a badge of dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not our choice to come home, but we come home with no regrets.\u201d\n\nRasool also said it was important for South Africa to fix its relationship with the US after President Donald Trump punished the country and accused it of taking an anti-American stance even before the decision to expel Rasool.\n\nThe US president issued an executive order last month cutting all funding to South Africa, alleging its government is supporting the Palestinian group Hamas and Iran, and pursuing anti-white policies at home.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t come here to say we are anti-American,\u201d Rasool said to the crowd. \u201cWe are not here to call on you to throw away our interests with the United States.\u201d\n\nRasool told a crowd at Cape Town International Airport that he will wear his persona non grata \"as a badge of dignity.\u201d Esa Alexander/Reuters\n\nThey were the ex-ambassador\u2019s first public comments since the Trump administration declared him persona non grata over a week ago, removed his diplomatic immunities and privileges, and gave him until this Friday to leave the US.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the US to expel a foreign ambassador.\n\nRasool was declared persona non grata by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a post on X on March 14. Rubio said Rasool was a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates the US and Trump.\n\nRubio\u2019s post linked to a story by the conservative Breitbart news site that reported on a talk Rasool gave on a webinar organized by a South African think tank. In his talk, Rasool spoke in academic language of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdowns on diversity and equity programs and immigration and mentioned the possibility of a US where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.\n\n\u201cThe supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white,\u201d Rasool said in the talk.\n\nOn his return home Sunday, he said he stood by those comments, and characterized them as merely alerting intellectuals and political leaders in South Africa that the US and its politics had changed.\n\n\u201cIt is not the US of Obama, it is not the US of Clinton, it is a different US and therefore our language must change,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cI would stand by my analysis because we were analyzing a political phenomenon, not a personality, not a nation, and not even a government.\u201d\n\nHe also said that South Africa would resist pressure from the US \u2014 and anyone else \u2014 to drop its case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump administration has cited that case against US ally Israel as one of the reasons it alleges South Africa is anti-American.\n\nThe Breitbart story Rubio cited when announcing Rasool\u2019s expulsion was written by South African-born senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak, who is Jewish and an ally of the Trump administration. Pollak is also a contender to be the new US ambassador to South Africa, according to South African media.\n\nSome of the supporters welcoming Rasool, who is Muslim, home to Cape Town waved Palestinian flags and chanted \u201cfree Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we stand here, the bombing (in Gaza) has continued and the shooting has continued, and if South Africa was not in the (International Court of Justice), Israel would not be exposed, and the Palestinians would have no hope,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice the Palestinians\u2026 but we will also not give up with our relationship with the United States. We must fight for it, but we must keep our dignity.\u201d"

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that politicians are \u201cnot being honest\u201d when they say they won\u2019t touch Social Security.\n\nHis comments come as President Donald Trump has said his administration was \u201cnot touching\u201d Social Security and town hall attendees have expressed concerns about potential Social Security cuts. Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut spending, has vocally criticized Social Security, prompting concerns from some Trump allies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not being honest when we look people in the eye and say we\u2019re not going to touch it. If we don\u2019t touch it, it touches itself,\u201d Curtis told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cYou know that, right? That\u2019s not being honest with the American people, and I think that\u2019s one of the things that makes them not trust us, when we say something that they just know is not true.\u201d\n\nCurtis said the government does not \u201cneed to impact the people that are in Social Security,\u201d but instead can have a conversation about what Social Security looks like for younger generations that are further away from retirement, like 20- and 30-year-olds.\n\n\u201cWe all need to say, those in retirement and those near retirement, we\u2019re not going to touch it, you\u2019re safe. But let\u2019s have that conversation, because my kids don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why can\u2019t we have a conversation with them about moving some of the variables around, and the sooner we do it, the less dramatic it has to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it, we have worse decisions thrust upon us,\u201d he added.\n\nCurtis said he plans to introduce a change to Social Security in a few months. A spokesperson for the senator declined to preview the bill.\n\nSocial Security, which includes retirement and disability benefit programs, has been referred to as the \u201cthird rail\u201d of politics, meaning it is considered untouchable because of its widespread popularity.\n\nCurtis has previously been vocal about wanting to reform Social Security, saying last year that he told then-prospective GOP Senate leaders to \u201cuse me as your tip of the spear\u201d in discussions on Social Security reform, according to NBC affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City.\n\nRepublicans have frequently voiced concerns about the federal deficit and made government cost-cutting a centerpiece of the second Trump administration. As part of these efforts, DOGE has moved to close some Social Security offices and alter telephone services.\n\nAsked about Musk's involvement in decisions to cut federal programs, contracts and the federal workforce, Curtis said it was a \"false narrative\" that someone could not get involved in the government.\n\n\"President Trump can consult anybody he wants to,\" Curtis said. \"Elon Musk is not making any cuts. He's only suggesting the cuts, and then President Trump is making the cuts.\"\n\nAn NBC News poll this month indicated that 46% of registered voters believed creating DOGE was a \"good idea\" but that 47% hold negative views of DOGE and 51% hold negative views of Musk.\n\nCurtis was also asked about Trump ally Steve Bannon's comments in a NewsNation interview that he believes Trump will run for and win a third term, which the 22nd Amendment prohibits.\n\n\"I wouldn't have supported a third term for George Washington,\" Curtis said, confirming he would not support a third term for Trump, either.\n\nThe Trump administration is in court battles over deportations under the rarely invoked Alien Enemies Act. A judge had told a government lawyer to instruct his clients to turn around planes involved in deportations under the act, but the planes were later revealed to have landed in El Salvador. The timing of the flights and questions about the administration's responses to the judge are the centerpieces of a high-profile court battle.\n\nAsked about the legality of the Trump administration's action, Curtis noted that he was not a lawyer, adding, \"Let's let this play out.\"\n\n\"I think that's the beauty of the courts, is having confidence that it will play out and we'll get to the right answer,\" he said."

            "full_content": "Central Germany CNN \u2014\n\n\u201cDo you think you can trust Putin?\u201d German Brig. Gen. Ralf Hammerstein asks with a wry smile.\n\nIt\u2019s a rhetorical question to which most of Europe would give the same answer \u2013 no.\n\nAs the Trump administration continues to pursue a deal to end the war in Ukraine \u2014 one that may end up being more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv \u2014 Europeans, for the first time in decades, are focusing on their own military might.\n\nNowhere is that shift as prominent as in Germany. Its armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr, have been the victim of years of underinvestment \u2013 but that is set to change.\n\nPresumptive Chancellor Friedrich Merz has decided that now is the moment for Germany to invest in its military, on levels not seen since the Cold War.\n\nGermany has just passed a major reform to its constitutional debt brake, unlocking billions of euros in funding. One model shared with CNN suggested that over a 10-year period, with Germany spending 3.5% of GDP, it could amount to \u20ac600 billion ($652 billion).\n\nCNN spent the day with the Bundeswehr at an undisclosed location in central Germany as five NATO allies took part in training exercises. The simulation was an attack by a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d on another member of the alliance.\n\nSpeaking at the makeshift headquarters for the simulation, Hammerstein told CNN: \u201cGermany is a capable nation in Europe, and has to be a partner for other nations. We are a responsible partner in Europe and a big nation. We (have) got to step up, and we will do that.\u201d\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was a seismic moment for the continent. War had returned and the detente that had existed since the fall of the Iron Curtain was over.\n\nIn Berlin, it kickstarted the period known in German as the \u201cZeitenwende\u201d \u2013 or \u201cturning point.\u201d In effect, it was the beginning of the effort to step up military spending once again.\n\nOlaf Scholz, the now-outgoing chancellor, said the country needed a new defense and security policy \u2013 and that the Bundeswehr needed special attention.\n\nHe established a one-off \u20ac100 billion fund for \u201ccomprehensive investment\u201d into the Bundeswehr. To do so, Scholz had to amend the Basic Law \u2013 essentially, the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe change to the constitution could unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of debt just on military spending. Matthies Otto/CNN\n\nEven though that fund was welcomed, the implementation of the policy has been lackluster, and government squabbling and in-fighting ultimately led to Scholz losing his job.\n\nMerz now is looking to supercharge the \u201cZeitenwende.\u201d\n\nSudha David-Wilp, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank, told CNN that \u201cMerz and (his) coalition need to accelerate this\u2026 There\u2019s now a lot of great power competition and hard power is the currency of international politics.\u201d\n\nAs the simulated attack was unfolding, back in Berlin Merz was outlining his new vision for the armed forces. \u201cWe have believed in a deceptive security in our society for at least a decade, probably much more\u2026 This is now the paradigm shift in defense policy that lies ahead of us.\u201d\n\nSince the middle of the Cold War era, Germany\u2019s military expenditure as a percentage of GDP has dropped dramatically. Peaking at 4.9% in 1963, it fell to an all-time low in 2005 of just 1.1%.\n\nOnly as recently as 2024 did Germany meet the NATO threshold of 2% spending on defense \u2014 marking the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nHammerstein acknowledges that \u201cevery army in the world, in history and also in the future, will always claim not to have enough.\u201d But he equates Germany\u2019s current situation as a reliance on the \u201cpeace dividend\u201d from the 1990s that \u201cwas a decrease for all the militaries in the world, in Europe especially.\u201d\n\nHe thinks that Germany is on the right track now. Last year, for the \u201cfirst time, (we) were able to spend the 2% GDP NATO criteria, and we\u2019ll additionally spend money, like the \u20ac100 billion we did in 2022, and this will continue, and the new chancellor is absolutely dedicated to that.\u201d\n\nMerz may be committed to beefing up Germany\u2019s projected military power and putting its defense on a more secure footing, but a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, Eva H\u00f6gl, suggested the work to be done was significant.\n\nReleased last week, the report outlined that the Bundeswehr didn\u2019t meet recruitment targets, had an aging fighting force, with barracks and basic infrastructure lacking. Addressing journalists at its launch, she said, \u201cthe Bundeswehr still has too little of everything.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Germany committed to boosting its standing forces to 203,000 by 2025 \u2014 a target date that was later revised to 2031. As the report states, \u201cthe Bundeswehr once again failed to achieve its original target.\u201d H\u00f6gl said that the current Bundeswehr fighting force is 181,174 personnel.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Germany\u2019s standing army size has declined dramatically to over 500,000 to just over 180,000 in 2024. Matthies Otto/CNN\n\nAsked about how the figure should be reached, Hammerstein, who joined as a conscript in 1992, called for a period of military service. Germany officially put conscription into abeyance in 2011.\n\n\u201cI was convinced by the law to join the military. So, I think some kind of obligatory service has to be in place to increase the numbers in the way we want to see it,\u201d Hammerstein said. \u201cIt will not happen overnight - but the increase we will see\u2026 starting this year.\u201d\n\nThe H\u00f6gl report also highlighted the serving age of the army, saying servicemen and women are \u201cgetting older and older.,\u201d The average age in 2019 was 32.4, but has now increased to 34.\n\nPerhaps the most damning section of the report came with a bill attached. It said \u20ac67 billion were required for infrastructure projects, and described barracks and properties as \u201cstill in a disastrous state.\u201d\n\nFor Hammerstein, though, it isn\u2019t always about money. He insists that Germany has a sound platform to launch from, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s about the quality and what I see here during the training is that we have a good substance. We have really highly motivated soldiers\u2026 and that keeps me very optimistic that the substance is good, and now we have to increase it.\u201d\n\nBrig. Gen. Ralf Hammerstein joined the German Bundeswehr as a conscript in 1992. He says that armies have and will always seek more financing, but feels Germany\u2019s military is heading in the right direction. Matthies Otto/CNN\n\nThere is also a shift in the national psyche towards the Bundeswehr. While Germans are usually very image-conscious over their military, particularly given the country\u2019s history, polling suggests many now hold a more positive opinion.\n\nA survey conducted by German public broadcaster ARD in March found 66% of respondents believe it\u2019s right to increase spending on defense and the Bundeswehr, while 31% said spending should remain the same or be cut further.\n\nIt also found that 59% of those surveyed agreed that Germany should significantly increase its debt in order to \u201ccope with upcoming tasks, especially in defense and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAs Merz embarks on turning around the German juggernaut, he is confident that he is setting Germany on the right track towards a more secure and prosperous future.\n\n\u201cGermany is back,\u201d he declared a week ago in Berlin. \u201cGermany is making a significant contribution to the defense of freedom and peace in Europe.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The South African ambassador who was expelled from the United States and declared persona non grata by the Trump administration has been given a hero\u2019s welcome on his return home\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African ambassador who was expelled from the United States and declared persona non grata by the Trump administration was given a hero's welcome on his return home Sunday, when hundreds of supporters gathered at an airport and sang songs praising him.\n\nThe crowds at Cape Town International Airport surrounded Ebrahim Rasool and his wife Rosieda as they emerged in the arrivals terminal in their hometown, and they needed a police escort to help them navigate their way through the building.\n\n\u201cA declaration of persona non grata is meant to humiliate you,\" Rasool told the supporters as he addressed them with a megaphone. \"But when you return to crowds like this, and with warmth ... like this, then I will wear my persona non grata as a badge of dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not our choice to come home, but we come home with no regrets.\u201d\n\nRasool also said it was important for South Africa to fix its relationship with the U.S. after President Donald Trump punished the country and accused it of taking an anti-American stance even before the decision to expel Rasool.\n\nThe U.S. president issued an executive order last month cutting all funding to South Africa, alleging its government is supporting the Palestinian group Hamas and Iran, and pursuing anti-white policies at home.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t come here to say we are anti-American,\u201d Rasool said to the crowd. \u201cWe are not here to call on you to throw away our interests with the United States.\u201d\n\nThey were the ex-ambassador's first public comments since the Trump administration declared him persona non grata over a week ago, removed his diplomatic immunities and privileges, and gave him until this Friday to leave the U.S.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the U.S. to expel a foreign ambassador.\n\nRasool was declared persona non grata by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a post on X on March 14. Rubio said Rasool was a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates the U.S. and Trump.\n\nRubio's post linked to a story by the conservative Breitbart news site that reported on a talk Rasool gave on a webinar organized by a South African think tank. In his talk, Rasool spoke in academic language of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdowns on diversity and equity programs and immigration and mentioned the possibility of a U.S. where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.\n\n\u201cThe supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the U.S.A., the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the U.S.A. in which the voting electorate in the U.S.A. is projected to become 48% white,\u201d Rasool said in the talk.\n\nOn his return home Sunday, he said he stood by those comments, and characterized them as merely alerting intellectuals and political leaders in South Africa that the U.S. and its politics had changed.\n\n\u201cIt is not the U.S. of Obama, it is not the U.S. of Clinton, it is a different U.S. and therefore our language must change,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cI would stand by my analysis because we were analyzing a political phenomenon, not a personality, not a nation, and not even a government.\"\n\nHe also said that South Africa would resist pressure from the U.S. \u2014 and anyone else \u2014 to drop its case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump administration has cited that case against U.S. ally Israel as one of the reasons it alleges South Africa is anti-American.\n\nThe Breitbart story Rubio cited when announcing Rasool's expulsion was written by South African-born senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak, who is Jewish and an ally of the Trump administration. Pollak is also a contender to be the new U.S. ambassador to South Africa, according to South African media.\n\nSome of the supporters welcoming Rasool, who is Muslim, home to Cape Town waved Palestinian flags and chanted \u201cfree Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we stand here, the bombing (in Gaza) has continued and the shooting has continued, and if South Africa was not in the (International Court of Justice), Israel would not be exposed, and the Palestinians would have no hope,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice the Palestinians ... but we will also not give up with our relationship with the United States. We must fight for it, but we must keep our dignity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP news on the Trump administration: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump"

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO -- New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and his Conservative opponent kicked off their election campaigns Sunday against the backdrop of a trade war and annexation threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nCarney announced there will be a five-week election campaign before the vote on April 28.\n\nThe governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics.\n\nTrump\u2019s almost daily attacks on Canada\u2019s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump claims that Canada isn\u2019t a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen,\" Carney said.\n\nThe governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in January and Trump declared a trade war. Carney has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate.\n\n\u201cThe next election will be one of the most consequential in our lifetimes,\u201d he posted on social media overnight.\n\nThe election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days. While other parties are running, the Liberals and the Conservatives are the only two that have a chance to form a government. The party that commands a majority in Parliament, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.\n\nCarney replaced Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.\n\nTrump put 25% tariffs on Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products \u2014 as well as all of America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 on April 2.\n\nPierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney\u2019s main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada\u2019s federal election this year until Trump\u2019s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.\n\nPoilievre said he will stand up to Trump but Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a conservative ally, said in an interview Poilievre would be \u201cvery much in sync\u201d with the \u201cnew direction in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will insist the president recognizes the independence and sovereignty of Canada. I will insist he stops tariffing our nation,\" Poilievre said as he launched his campaign.\n\nPoilievre said he doesn't respect \u201cthe treatment that he has meted out to our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people are worried, angry and anxious. And with good reason as a result of the president\u2019s unacceptable threats against our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are worried about your job and the sovereignty of our nation. And you are angry at the feeling of betrayal that these unacceptable words and tariffs have made us all experience. I share your anger and I share the worry about our future.\"\n\nCarney still hasn\u2019t had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney\u2019s name.\n\nCarney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England \u2014 helping to manage the impact of Brexit.\n\nPoilievre, 45, for years the party\u2019s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put \u201cCanada first.\u201d He vows to defund Canada\u2019s public broadcaster and he won\u2019t allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes."

Hayes administration in 1878, has long been privately funded without taxpayer dollars, largely through the American Egg Board, which also provides tens of thousands of eggs for the occasion. And all money raised by Harbinger will go to the White House Historical Association.\n\nBut the solicitation for sponsorships marks an unprecedented offering of corporate branding opportunities on White House grounds running counter to long-established regulations prohibiting the use of public office for private gain.\n\n\u201cThis is an enterprise. This is not your grandmother\u2019s Easter Egg Roll where people lined up outside the gate and go and roll an egg and get a little gift bag and walk out,\u201d said a former official involved in planning the event, which has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years.\n\nThe pitch document laying out sponsorship opportunities includes logos for both the White House and Harbinger, which previously produced the event during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term and is offering \u201cinitial planning\u201d and \u201cevent day execution\u201d for sponsors that sign on. It features imagery of Trump, first lady Melania Trump, members of the Trump family, the Easter Bunny, and the White House press corps, including CNN correspondent Kaitlan Collins.\n\n\u201cSponsors of WHEER [White House Easter Egg Roll] provide financial support, activities, and giveaways to enhance the event while gaining valuable brand visibility and national recognition,\u201d reads the document.\n\nGuests participate in the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House.

Bush, told CNN that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t have gotten through Counsel\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would have been vetoed in about 30 seconds in my day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not running this like a football stadium where you get all logos all over the place for kicking in money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Trump White House has openly flouted norms and rules from the South Lawn. Earlier this month, the president touted a selection of Tesla vehicles accompanied by the company\u2019s CEO Elon Musk. In 2020, the Republican National Convention was held in part on the grounds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Elon Musk deliver remarks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025.

And as we do with other gifts to the White House collection, we receive contributions and in-kind gifts that are used on the grounds that day,\u201d the association\u2019s president, Stewart McLaurin, told CNN.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for a production company like Harbinger to be involved. The company, founded by former Mitt Romney campaign staffers in 2013, has produced large-scale corporate and government events, including Egg Rolls during Trump\u2019s first term, March for Our Lives, media spin rooms at presidential debates, and Pope Francis\u2019 2015 visit to the US.\n\n\u201cThere is a certain level of expectation by the public that these be amazingly grand affairs \u2013 memorable affairs \u2013 and every year, you try and top it with something new and different. But to do that, clearly, you need professional production companies. It\u2019s beyond the White House Visitor\u2019s Office and their little team of six people,\u201d the former official involved in planning the event said.\n\nPrivate contributions cover activity booths, artists, music, vendors, staging, equipment and d\u00e9cor, said a source familiar with the planning who was granted anonymity to detail specifics of the funding mechanisms. Any excess funding raised, that source said, will go toward other similar White House events, such as Halloween festivities and the Fourth of July. So far, one sponsor has been identified for the April 21 event, with other \u201csuccessful conversations\u201d underway, according to the source, who noted that the National Park Service, which oversees White House grounds, will be responsible for vetting prospective donors before gifts are accepted.\n\nThe White House, the office of the first lady, Harbinger, the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nIn the past, according to another official involved in the planning of previous Egg Rolls, there was an agreement on reimbursement for the event\u2019s cost between the National Park Service, the American Egg Board, the White House Historical Association and the White House. There have also been smaller-scale partnerships with organizations like NASA, the LEGO Foundation, and Disney. But any branding, the source said, was extremely limited due to severe constraints from the White House counsel\u2019s office.\n\nAsked for comment, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board told CNN that it plans to be involved in the Egg Roll this year.\n\n\u201cThe specific details are being finalized now with the White House,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that details of the board\u2019s partnership with the White House \u201care not shared publicly.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what social media channels would be used for the promised \u201cmentions in official event communications and social media posts,\u201d and whether they would be sent from official White House accounts. It\u2019s also unclear whether the White House Counsel\u2019s Office signed off on the solicitation document.\n\nPainter argued the move runs counter to free enterprise. The Trump administration, he said, \u201cjust have a different attitude\u2026 that \u2018America First\u2019 somehow requires the United States to pick winners and losers in the private sector.\u201d\n\nDonald Sherman, the chief counsel and executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), said he had \u201cnever seen anything like this before\u201d associated with a White House.\n\n\u201cI understand that there are corporate sponsors for the Easter Egg Roll,\u201d Sherman told CNN. \u201cWhat I have not seen before is sort of the outright solicitation and the use of the imprimatur of the White House to give corporate sponsorship.\u201d\n\nPrevious egg rolls have been a source of tension between those involved with planning and the Counsel\u2019s Office. Multiple administrations had to tell Coca-Cola that thousands of Dasani water bottles donated for the event could not be served in Coke-branded coolers, for instance, because of the branding restrictions placed by the White House lawyers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting agita thinking of the conversations I used to have with the Counsel\u2019s Office,\u201d said the first former official involved in planning the event. \u201cSometimes it went too far \u2013 yeah \u2013 but their goal is to protect the president.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nThere\u2019s a new war within the liberal intelligentsia, and it\u2019s got to do with a funny word: abundance. Is it good or bad to be abundant? Does it symbolize dynamism or shadow libertarianism? What ills will so-called zoning reform actually fix?\n\nTwo new books are at the heart of this struggle. One is called, of course, Abundance, by Ezra Klein, the star New York Times columnist and podcaster, and Derek Thompson, a journalist at The Atlantic. The other, Why Nothing Works, comes from Marc J. Dunkelman, a fellow at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. All three writers are Democrats or sympathetic to the Democratic cause. All dislike Donald Trump. All want blue cities, blue counties, and blue states from coast to coast.\n\nBut each man has riled up a certain number of left-leaning Democrats for somewhat similar reasons. One overriding issue is that many on the left are annoyed or even angered that such a debate is happening right now, against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s assault on the federal bureaucracy and democratic norms. Why care about abundance when the president is threatening judges and trying to deport legal residents for their political beliefs? It\u2019s a fair argument, as is the reality that such an agenda \u2014 making government better at building and doing \u2014 isn\u2019t an automatic salve for the Democratic woes in the heartland, or anywhere, really.\n\nWhat has become obvious, though, is that the United States, despite its inordinate wealth, is not matching its 20th-century dynamism. Could this government \u2014 Republican or Democratic run \u2014 build another interstate highway system? A network of railroads? Could this Department of Defense effectively invent the internet? There will be an America after Trump, and a republic, too, and it\u2019s worth mulling the greater arc of our nation. Not all issues are bound to electoral cycles, team red against team blue. If we are going to save our climate or guarantee every American an affordable place to live, these debates must be had \u2014 now.\n\nThe Klein-Thompson duo argues that an \u201canti-growth\u201d mentality has constrained the left for the last several decades. NIMBYism and aggressive regulations have strangled housing supply and innovation. As government support for research and development dried up, science produced fewer societywide breakthroughs. Once, we built whole subway systems in a decade, sent human beings to the moon, and created the internet. Klein and Thompson do blame neoliberalism \u2014 a long-running retreat from government investment and a foisting of responsibilities on the private sector \u2014 for this, which should make many progressives nod along. But they\u2019d prefer lighter zoning and environmental laws to speed up growth. Can the Green New Deal come to fruition if NIMBYs can always sue to halt new solar plants and transmission lines?\n\nDunkelman\u2019s thesis is similar. For New Yorkers, there\u2019s plenty in Why Nothing Works to devour. He begins with the great b\u00eate noire of the modern left, Robert Moses, and argues \u2014 as I have \u2014 that the master builder\u2019s legacy is somewhat misunderstood. Or, at least, we\u2019ve overlearned the lessons of the Moses era. Moses, of course, ran roughshod over much of New York, ramming highways through thriving neighborhoods and thwarting the expansion of mass transit. He behaved like a tyrant and cared little for conventional democracy. Politicians couldn\u2019t move him, nor could protest. For 40 years, he was emblematic of an imperial approach to governing, and it was Robert Caro\u2019s The Power Broker which exposed, finally, many of his excesses.\n\nBut Dunkelman, with a half-century of hindsight, is able to tell another story: Moses wasn\u2019t merely a villain. Harnessing the collective powers of the federal, state, and local governments, he built enormous amounts of public housing and parkland. He transformed the Valley of Ashes of Great Gatsby lore into Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park. He dreamed up Jones Beach and Riverside Park. He built Lincoln Center and the United Nations. He finished what was, at that time, the largest suspension bridge on earth. His public-housing developments ensured hundreds of thousands of working-class people could permanently reside in New York, no matter how expensive it became. Under Moses, the government could be unfeeling \u2014 but it worked. And it was not Moses-style development that triggered New York\u2019s decline in the 1970s, as Caro strongly intimated. Rather, it was the collapse of the manufacturing sector, white flight, and fiscal mismanagement. The public works Moses left behind were necessary for New York\u2019s post-fiscal-crisis renaissance.\n\nDunkelman frames American views of governance as a centuries-long clash between Hamiltonians, who argue for stronger centralized authority, and Jeffersonians, who are wary of government overreach. Both, in his view, have a point. In the 20th century, urban planning could go awry, leading to interstate highways obliterating vibrant, walkable downtowns. Ignoring the will of ordinary people had dire consequences. But the trouble began when the Jeffersonians kept winning. Beginning in the 1970s, skepticism of government power began getting baked into both political parties. Conservatives, of course, longed to dismantle the New Deal legacy: They wanted lower taxes, weaker unions, and more influence for private enterprise at the expense of federal oversight.\n\nThe left\u2019s role in this push is more poorly understood, and Dunkelman is a wonderful guide to this dispiriting stretch of history. Beginning with Watergate, which taught a generation of young progressives to distrust federal power, the left began to favor hamstringing government whenever possible. Numerous new choke points, some of them well-meaning, were invented, from arcane local laws to community boards that could stifle building that alienated locals. Preservationists warred to freeze urban neighborhoods in place, hoping to avoid catastrophes like the obliteration of the old Penn Station \u2014 but they also, in their zeal for saving the old, helped to ensure these cities would grow less affordable. Building new affordable housing, commuter railways, or any other type of large infrastructure project became far harder in the era of community control.\n\nHow to make America dynamic again? How to build here like they do in China and Japan, where it\u2019s routine to throw up new high-speed rail lines every decade? And if we solved these problems, would it be enough? David Sirota, the founder of Lever News and a former Bernie Sanders speechwriter, summed up one stinging progressive critique of the whole project: \u201cAbundance\u2122 being defined as \u2018kill zoning laws and corporate regulation\u2019 but not \u2018give everyone decent medical care\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s the tell, and you\u2019re the mark.\u201d It\u2019s true that this is not a focus among the advocates of abundance. Relaxing zoning laws won\u2019t do anything to bring us universal health care or bolster the social safety net. It may not even, in the short term, do enough to create affordable housing. One of the great divides within the YIMBY movement, which can be folded into the abundance push, is how much regulation should exist around what people pay in rent. Some YIMBYs do back stronger tenant protections and versions of rent control while others, like Klein ally Matthew Yglesias, plainly do not. Yglesias is also skeptical of lifting the federal law that effectively bans the construction of new public housing.\n\nAbundance, then, can hold different meanings for different advocates. If the belief is that a robust, efficient federal government should do more to help working-class Americans, then we need a new program of mass home-building like what we saw in the 1930s and 1940s. Without the New York City Public Housing Authority, the largest city in America would probably have an unfathomably large number of unhoused people, the tent cities in the five boroughs making the Tenderloin and Skid Row look like minor, quasi-pastoral encampments. If you believe zoning reform is enough \u2014 and the government need only get out of the way \u2014 then how much housing must be built, exactly, for rents to start falling enough that a family making well under $100,000 can comfortably afford a market-rate apartment? Turning New York (or any city) into Tokyo is easier said than done.\n\nWhat abundance advocates do get right is that governments \u2014 federal, state, and local \u2014 must do far better. We have fallen a long way from the 20th century; we led the world in building and innovation until we didn\u2019t. We are still a remarkably wealthy nation, and we must find a way, as we persevere in this new century, to beat back stagnation. Otherwise, the future is going to be much more frustrating."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDavid Bailey, a longtime Bitcoin investor and evangelist, had tempered expectations in early 2024 when he first pitched Donald Trump\u2019s campaign on the political upside of embracing cryptocurrency. Even after Trump pledged over the summer to make the US a Bitcoin haven and the industry spent tens of millions of dollars supporting his presidential bid, Bailey suspected Trump\u2019s overture might be a fleeting appeal for crypto voters rather than a lasting commitment.\n\nYet since returning to office, Trump has upended the federal government\u2019s wary stance toward cryptocurrency just as he said he would. Earlier this month, he signed an executive order directing the Federal Reserve to hold Bitcoin alongside gold\u2014a move long sought by crypto advocates and once considered improbable.\n\n\u201cIf a year ago you put me into hypnosis and said, \u2018Describe to me your deepest dreams of what could happen,\u2019 this would be straight-up fantasy,\u201d said Bailey, who owns the Bitcoin conference where Trump first stepped out as a pro-crypto candidate. \u201cI never would have believed it could happen.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s return to power was achieved in part through an unorthodox coalition-building strategy. He courted groups who might\u2019ve been overlooked by Republican candidates, like Bitcoin enthusiasts, making direct appeals with policy promises tailored to specific audiences.\n\nFor those who played along, the rewards have come swiftly.\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina, for instance, had reliably voted Democratic in presidential elections for decades. But an eight-year pursuit by Trump for the battleground state\u2019s predominant native group \u2013 culminating with his promise last fall to grant the tribe much-coveted federal recognition \u2013 appeared to resonate at the ballot box. In Lumbee-rich Robeson County, where Barack Obama twice won handily, Trump secured a 28-point victory, his largest margin across three races.\n\nThree days after taking office, Trump signed a memorandum declaring it US policy \u201cto support the full federal recognition\u201d of the Lumbee Tribe, the strongest statement to date from the Oval Office.\n\nTransactional? Perhaps, but that\u2019s politics, said Lumbee Tribe Chairman John Lowery, who told CNN, \u201cIt feels good to be courted.\u201d\n\nIn this October 2024 photo, Abigail Blue, a member of the Lumbee Tribe, walks by the stage during a campaign event in support of Donald Trump in Red Springs, North Carolina. David Yeazell/AP/File\n\n\u201cEveryone is in their lane and they\u2019re not going to get out of it. You\u2019re either hardcore this or that,\u201d Lowery said. \u201cWe are hardcore for those who are showing the effort and putting in the work to get our vote. And we have a tendency to reward that more than any ideological view. There\u2019s something about good old retail politics. Trump has done that on this issue.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s unconventional approach extended to union workers, a longtime Democratic stronghold. Amid the outreach, and with many of his members increasingly leaning toward Trump, Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien stunned Democrats by delivering a primetime address at the Republican National Convention (getting a lukewarm response from the GOP audience). Later, the union withheld an endorsement in the presidential race for the first time in decades, a considerable blow to the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe strategy paid off for Trump: He won 45 percent of the vote from union households, according to a CNN exit poll, a striking watermark for a GOP candidate.\n\nFor O\u2019Brien, the calculated risk proved worthwhile during a Nov. 21 visit to Mar-a-Lago, where he advocated for Lori Chavez-DeRemer, then a Republican lawmaker from Oregon, to lead the Department of Labor. After three hours of intense discussions, Trump agreed to nominate Chavez-DeRemer and, most critically, vowed not to relent in face of expected pushback from business groups who saw her as too sympathetic to unions, O\u2019Brien told CNN. The next day, his transition team announced Chavez-DeRemer as his pick for Secretary of Labor and she was confirmed earlier this month.\n\nThe episode solidified the Teamsters as \u201cone of the most influential unions in the country,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cWe know we got criticized by our peers in organized labor, but we\u2019ve watched our organization do the same thing every single campaign and expect a different result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to take that approach.\u201d\n\nPresident of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Sean O\u2019Brien speaks on stage at the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 15, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nTrump\u2019s early efforts to appease key constituencies comes as his political operation is already plotting how to motivate his unconventional coalition to show up for Republicans in next year\u2019s midterm elections. While some in Trump\u2019s movement have predicted a more permanent political realignment is in the offing, the White House remains concerned that the president\u2019s appeal to certain groups may not translate to GOP congressional candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, for example, whether Libertarian voters and supporters of ex-presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can be convinced Trump needs to keep Republican majorities in Congress, a White House official told CNN. Trump appealed to both groups during the campaign \u2013 a calculation his political team made early after watching the Libertarian candidate siphon votes from him in 2020.\n\nTrump\u2019s effort to court Libertarians last summer\u2014including a speech at their national convention where he endured boos before promising to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned founder of an illicit online market called Silk Road\u2014seems to have worked. The Libertarian ticket garnered its smallest share of the vote since 2008. A day after taking office, Trump fulfilled his pledge to pardon Ulbricht.\n\nSimilarly, Trump named Kennedy Secretary of Health and Human Services shortly after the election after vowing the prominent vaccine skeptic would have a role overseeing health issues in his administration.\n\nAngela McArdle, the Libertarian Party chair at the time, has publicly insisted giving Trump a platform at the convention has paid off for her members.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect perfection,\u201d she posted on X this week. \u201cTake the wins!\u201d\n\nBut not everyone is pleased with the arrangement. Steven Nekhaila, the current party chairman, called Ulbricht\u2019s clemency a \u201cgood transaction from the libertarian movement,\u201d but added that Libertarians were naive if they thought Trump wanted \u201canything more than our vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more naive to think we won\u2019t be discarded when we\u2019re no longer convenient the same way Rep. Thomas Massie was cast aside when he was no longer in line,\u201d Nekhaila said, referring to Trump\u2019s threat to primary the conservative Kentucky congressman after he defied the president on a vote to fund the government.\n\nTrump\u2019s early actions on cryptocurrency have also drawn some criticism, including from supporters within the industry who have balked at his growing financial interests in digital assets. Once a vocal opponent of Bitcoin, Trump\u2019s change in tune last year came as his family launched a crypto venture spearheaded by his sons. Days before his inauguration, Trump also announced a new meme coin capitalizing on his name, presenting new conflicts for a president who already has more than any modern predecessor.\n\nWhen Trump unveiled his family\u2019s new digital asset business, Nic Carter, a crypto investor who supported the Republican, said, \u201cAt best it\u2019s an unnecessary distraction, at worst it\u2019s a huge embarrassment and source of (additional) legal trouble.\u201d\n\nBailey, speaking to CNN en route to a dinner at the White House for donors, dismissed the conflicts as examples of Trump\u2019s \u201centrepreneurial spirit.\u201d Regardless, Bailey believes the former president has forced the political class to take the cryptocurrency community seriously.\n\n\u201cOur voter bloc is big and growing quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it will be up to the parties to speak with us.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s early actions have earned plaudits from the groups his campaign targeted, their leaders also suggest there\u2019s more to be done to fully satisfy his commitments to them. Trump has yet to say, for example, how much Bitcoin the Federal Reserve should stockpile. The Teamsters is closely watching how labor fares in early decisions under Trump by the National Labor Relations Board and whether his administration stands by union provisions in existing federal contracts.\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe still needs an act of Congress to access the federal benefits granted to other federally recognized American Natives. Lowery said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d Trump can champion a legislative push, but if Republicans with full control of government can\u2019t get it to his desk, Lumbee voters may swing back toward Democrats.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember us,\u201d Lowery said, \u201cand you can\u2019t take us for granted.\u201d"

Their suicide rates are rising, leading some observers to attribute their struggles in part to a lack of purpose or meaning. \u201cYoung Hispanic men, and really young men in general, they want to feel valued,\u201d Rafael Struve of the conservative Bienvenido group told the Associated Press not long after Donald Trump won reelection. A few weeks later, Richard V. Reeves of the nonpartisan American Institute for Boys and Men told the Journal, \u201cThe sense a lot of young men have is not being sure that they are needed or that they are going to be needed by their families, by their communities, by society.\u201d\n\nMale loneliness is an opportunity for misogynist influencers like Andrew Tate. He tells millions of followers that masculinity is theirs to reclaim through the brutal oppression of women. Donald Trump offers a less explicit version of the same argument, telling young men that their prospects are threatened by \u201cDEI,\u201d which he defines as the advancement of women, LGBTQ+ people, and racial minorities. In 2024, young men again drifted right and toward Trump, a trend that helped put the would-be strongman back in the White House. Democrats know they have a problem. During the first episode of California governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s podcast, the California Democrat told MAGA star Charlie Kirk that his son is a fan. Others are recalibrating their rhetoric and policies to better address the male plight. Maryland governor Wes Moore has announced a new initiative to help men and boys. \u201cOn every single indicator we care about, young men and boys are falling off,\u201d he told Washingtonian. Last month, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan appealed directly to men and boys in a speech, saying, \u201cThe last thing any of us wants is a generation of young men falling behind their fathers and grandfathers.\u201d\n\nThe crisis is real, to an extent. Men are in trouble, and that means everyone else is in trouble too. The return of Trump and the growth of misogyny are real political problems for women, for the economy, and for democracy itself. Alas for all of us, the debate over men has become detached from material reality. Men may lack purpose, but that dilemma is not unique to them, as women also struggle for meaning and value. The real culprit is a political economy that renders everyone powerless and insecure. As long as it endures, purpose remains a loose concept, and that allows snake oil to flourish. Sometimes this is literally true: The Black Forest supplement company promises men more than berberine and something called \u201cturkesterone.\u201d It also advertises community. \u201cTogether, we can continue to defy the forces that seek to suppress our true nature and empower one another to embrace our inherent masculinity,\u201d the website says. Whether a man imbibes Tate or turkesterone, he is taking poison. He needs an antidote, and fast, but he finds it in short supply.\n\nThe answer to male pain isn\u2019t masculinity, but a new political order, where no man or woman is an automaton or object. As analysts like Reeves have argued, it is possible to champion men and boys without sacrificing women and girls to the right-wing. Yet some liberals would rather appease violent masculinity than defeat it. Newsom didn\u2019t just interview Kirk; he praised the far-right activist, and attacked trans athletes and \u201cwoke culture\u201d in the same episode. Democrats like him agree that wokeness has gone too far, that trans rights and immigration are destabilizing the country and alienating male voters. In searching for common ground with Trump, they align themselves with the same reactionary forces that sell men hierarchy and call it freedom. Join us, the right-wing says, and you can use slurs. But the liberty to insult others is an ersatz version of the real thing.\n\nNowhere is this clearer than in the Trump administration. On Monday, the Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor railed against immigration during an appearance at the White House, a few months after an Irish court ordered him to pay almost \u20ac250,000 to a woman who says he beat and raped her in 2018. At the same time, the administration defended the deportation of more than 200 Venezuelan men on the basis that they were all gang members and abusers of women. Trump\u2019s masculinity is bound up with white nationalism, which has long promised white men and white women a measure of power in exchange for their obedience. A man can serve in the military, but if he is Black, he can also expect to see his contributions erased. After the Pentagon temporarily removed a story about Jackie Robinson and his military service from its website, press secretary John Ullyot said in a written statement that so-called DEI programming \u201cDivides the force, Erodes unit cohesion, and Interferes with the services\u2019 core warfighting mission.\u201d Some masculinities matter more than others, while imaginary threats hide real predators from scrutiny. There is no freedom here, only levels of tyranny.\n\nThe right-wing offers men a purpose of a sort but asks him to derive his meaning from the subjugation of others. It\u2019s an old bargain. When I was an Evangelical girl in the \u201990s, thousands of men flocked to the Promise Keepers movement, which offered them camaraderie and fellowship while promoting male authority over women and denouncing homosexuality. When I later entered an Evangelical college, many classmates fawned over John and Stasi Eldredge, a pair of Christian authors who taught \u201ccomplementarian\u201d theology, or the idea that men should lead their homes and churches while women lovingly submit to them. In Wild at Heart, his 2001 best-seller, John claimed that men are innately aggressive, and that they all long for \u201ca battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to love.\u201d The Christian church had failed men by asking them to deny their true nature, he argued. \u201cEvery man wants to play the hero,\u201d he added.\n\nEldredge did not invent complementarian theology but popularized ideas that I and millions of others had already heard in our church sanctuaries and our living rooms. Now reactionaries of all stripes make similar arguments. In a February piece for The Free Press, the writer Chris Arnade claimed that \u201call men need to feel like the hero\u2014if not over the course of their lifetime, then at least every now and then.\u201d Most men \u201cget their sense of worth from rescuing, protecting, building, solving \u2014 and for being appreciated for doing so,\u201d he added. When society fails to grant them that opportunity, \u201ca black market in unapproved, antisocial ones will pop up; these usually involve proving your worth through crime or violence.\u201d Arnade blamed liberalism, which, he said, \u201cfavors the individual over the community\u201d and tells men and women that they \u201ccan create a bespoke identity, like a tailor-made suit,\u201d again at the expense of their true natures.\n\nAbsent from so much contemporary discourse about the crisis of men, and from centuries-old defenses of traditional masculinity, is the labor and purpose of women. Wild at Heart made the incredible claim that slavery was ended through the strength of men. (Who needed Harriet Tubman?) \u201cApartheid wasn\u2019t defeated by women,\u201d Eldredge added. Arnade\u2019s notion of heroism is about doing, making, protecting, all of which he associates with masculinity. In real life, women find meaning in the same ways. The work of caregiving is typically carried out by women: by unpaid daughters and granddaughters and by underpaid domestic workers, who are mostly women of color. Changing a diaper is a form of protection and as necessary to society as firefighting, but a woman is rarely called heroic for doing it. Her loneliness and her need to feel valued go mostly unacknowledged. \u201cWanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that\u2019s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all,\u201d the late Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in her 1988 essay \u201cThe Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\u201d\n\nPerhaps heroism itself is part of the problem. \u201cI am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off,\u201d Le Guin wrote. \u201cHowever I don\u2019t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so.\u201d It is, she added, \u201cone of those damned things you have to do\u201d in order for society to go on. Our customary definitions of heroism, and with it, our concepts of purpose and meaning, often urge men to commit acts of socially permissible violence or subject themselves to exploitation at work. But many dislike their options. At Liberal Currents, Toby Buckle wrote in response to Arnade that \u201cheroic\u201d professions are still available to men, if they\u2019re interested. \u201cThe Army aggressively recruits; really any young man at any point can join. The vast majority don\u2019t,\u201d Buckle pointed out. \u201cMen fantasise about being in combat scenarios but, by and large, don\u2019t seek them out.\u201d Liberalism never shut men out of these roles, he added, or prohibited them from the stereotypically male pleasures of grilling meat or fathering children with a stay-at-home wife. Society has not feminized nearly as much as the reactionaries claim.\n\nNevertheless, Arnade is right about one thing, if not for the reasons he thinks. Liberalism has failed men as much as it has failed women, though \u201cbespoke identity\u201d has nothing to do with it. By leaving intact the very political economy that breaks men down, liberals undermine the best and most egalitarian aspects of their political project. \u201cLiberal freedom isn\u2019t just about finding the life that best suits you, it\u2019s a grand experiment in us all finding the best ways we can care for one another,\u201d Buckle wrote. That admirable vision can\u2019t survive in a country in thrall to the almighty free market. Our economic system depends on violence, even celebrates it, a reality that liberalism tries to dodge by inventing friendlier versions of capitalism while society fractures around them. They tell voters they will make it easier to climb the ladder when the problem is the ladder itself. Well-off men like Trump and his allies cling to the highest rungs and beat back every perceived threat with violent force. Men who are not well-off may look up at men who are and think prosperity is only possible through brutality, and they aren\u2019t entirely wrong. Though men do bear moral responsibility for the way they vote and behave, they are operating within a system that ultimately restricts them.\n\nMen can still join the Army, but the pursuit of meaning through violence is a dead end \u2014 both for men, who risk death, maiming, and moral injury, and for the victims they injure and kill. A man can still go to work and provide for his family, but unless he has a union job, he has few rights and little freedom. Even if he sends emails for a living and makes a comfortable salary, he is at the mercy of an employer who can probably fire him at any time for any reason. Even Eldredge complained in Wild at Heart that \u201ccorporate policies and procedures are designed with one aim: to harness a man to the plow and make him produce.\u201d The male soul, he added, \u201clongs for passion, for freedom, for life.\u201d If his wage can\u2019t pay the rent, or cover a child\u2019s medical bill, he might well get angry. Reactionaries will tell him to blame the advancement of women and immigrants, not his boss or the hand of the market. Too often, liberals agree, opening the door for someone like Eldredge or worse. Tate tells men they deserve not just sex but wealth, as if the hustle could save them.\n\nFeminists have always argued that patriarchy damages men in addition to women, though it is more reliably fatal for the latter. Tate once said that if a woman accuses him of cheating, \u201cIt\u2019s bang out the machete, boom in her face and grip her by the neck. Shut up bitch.\u201d At the softer end of the scale, writers like Eldredge say they reject abuse but add that women prefer the domestic sphere because of God or their biological essence. They are all pushing a trap that will not cure loneliness but increase it. Their advice, if taken, dooms women to male domination and men to lives without friendship and love. As far as Tate is concerned, \u201cwomen and property are viewed simply as financial assets,\u201d Zoe Hu wrote in Dissent. \u201cThere is no marriage or romance, however false and abusive, in Tate\u2019s world \u2014 just girlfriends who are allowed to stay with him for \u2018extended periods of time.\u2019\u201d There are no easy solutions to the reactionary\u2019s appeal or to liberalism\u2019s failures. Misogyny is older than capitalism, and if we burned it all down tomorrow, some men would still beat their wives. Yet no one benefits from the gender debate we\u2019re having now. When housing and health care are unaffordable for so many, and most workers lack the protection of a union, people will look for security wherever they believe they can find it. Even the wealthy suspect their power is fragile, and the accumulation of riches will never guarantee anyone the meaning we all seek. Salvation does not lie in the hustle or in heroism, but in the hard and unglamorous work of keeping society together.\n\nSIGN UP TO GET THIS COLUMN IN YOUR INBOX Sarah Jones covers politics and labor.

            "full_content": "After his election, Donald Trump told NBC News that \u201cwe\u2019re not touching Social Security,\u201d other than to make it more efficient. But Elon Musk, who now wields enormous power in his role cutting government spending, has recently made comments critical of the program that are coming into conflict with Trump\u2019s promise and worrying members of the president\u2019s own party.\n\nThose concerns have prompted some Trump allies to question whether the billionaire should continue to do so many media interviews, four people familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nA particularly problematic remark came during Musk\u2019s conversation with media personality Joe Rogan in late February, in which he described Social Security as \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d A couple of weeks later, the billionaire once again went after Social Security, this time in an interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. Musk, when discussing entitlement spending he deemed wasteful or fraudulent, said the program was \u201cthe big one to eliminate.\u201d\n\nMusk pointed to a 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office that estimated the entire federal government could lose between \u201c$233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements, so that\u2019s the big one to eliminate,\u201d he said.\n\nA Trump adviser acknowledged that they were aware of \u201coutside concern\u201d around Musk\u2019s comments. Trump allies \u2014 including some on Wall Street, in corporate America and Congress \u2014 have conveyed to the White House and even the president directly that Musk either has to be taken off air or needs to be more scripted.\n\nA White House official who, like others in this article, requested anonymity to speak candidly, said they were sympathetic to the views of some Republicans who see Musk\u2019s comments on Social Security as potentially problematic and worrying to some senior citizens.\n\n\u201cOf course they don\u2019t want their Social Security cut,\u201d the person said. \u201cSo if they hear something on the news that Elon Musk is saying that we should do something with Social Security \u2014 of course there might be some concerns. But the only concern they have to worry about is what the president of the United States is saying and what he\u2019s doing. We haven\u2019t touched Social Security. We\u2019re not going to touch Social Security.\u201d\n\nThe White House official said Musk\u2019s personal opinions about Social Security have no impact on Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, President Trump has full trust in Elon Musk\u2019s decisions,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe reality is everything that Elon is doing when it comes to Social Security is just to improve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cThe sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only. \u2026 DOGE has already identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers, and President Trump will continue to direct this effort until our government is truly for the people, and by the people.\u201d\n\nA Republican lawmaker who was not familiar with the calls to the White House said Musk\u2019s disparagement of Social Security has unnerved people nevertheless.\n\n\u201cIt does need to be reformed,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cWithout reforming Social Security and Medicare, both programs will collapse and take the government down with it. But the last thing we need to talk about is disparaging the system. It\u2019s not a Ponzi scheme; it\u2019s just an entitlement program that needs to be reformed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more of these Musk interviews, the more discussion we\u2019ll have. I think the entire 2026 campaign will be a referendum on Musk\u201d if the billionaire\u2019s poll numbers continue to drop, this person added. \u201cYou will see ad after ad with the chainsaw.\u201d\n\nMusk and his U.S. DOGE Service have taken a chain saw to plenty in the federal government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Education. But Social Security is a tougher target.\n\nLong known as the \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics, the popular retirement and disability program has now been hit by Musk\u2019s downsizing effort as DOGE closes some Social Security offices and curtails telephone services \u2014 moves that even Republicans are beginning to push back on. Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating as Musk opens a new political front that pops in their own polling.\n\n\u201cSocial Security is the most successful government program in American history,\u201d said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s an earned benefit that people paid into over their entire lives. If Elon and Trump go after it, I promise you this will be their undoing.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic firm Blueprint tested 20 different political messages about Musk, and the four that were most \u201cconcerning\u201d to registered voters were all about Social Security. The top two were about Musk\u2019s proposals to fire Social Security Administration employees and dismantle phone services. By contrast, voters said the messages least concerning to them were about his personal life, such as Musk fathering children with five different women. The survey was conducted last week and released Thursday.\n\nPolicy experts close to the White House said despite Musk\u2019s rhetoric and proximity to the president, Trump remains sensitive to the political risk of touching Social Security. He\u2019s been so unequivocal about maintaining benefits that even administration officials who would like to retool or cut the program are not challenging his edict.\n\n\u201cEven beyond the president, the White House itself has made crystal clear that they\u2019re not touching Social Security,\u201d one former Trump White House official said.\n\nAnother former top Trump aide also said given Musk\u2019s prominent role in the administration, the administration needs to consistently remind voters of Trump\u2019s own promise not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits and that Musk\u2019s opinions are not the official policies of the Trump administration.\n\nBut the former official said Trump may be more amenable to tweaks that can be sold as eliminating waste, fraud and abuse \u2014 a sentiment the president hinted at in falsely asserting to a joint session of Congress that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security checks. That assertion came after Musk promoted similar misinformation online. The billionaire White House adviser has also claimed hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security payments are being funneled to undocumented immigrants \u2014 framing that could appeal to Trump.\n\nMusk\u2019s promise to cut $1 trillion to $2 trillion in federal spending is virtually impossible without touching entitlement spending. And while Trump insists he wants to root out fraud, that\u2019s unlikely to dent the program\u2019s spending. The Social Security inspector general found that improper payments from fiscal year 2015 to 2022 totaled less than 1% of benefits paid over that time \u2014 and most of those were overpayments.\n\nThe rhetoric has been matched with policy shifts at the agency \u2014 even though Trump\u2019s pick to serve as commissioner has yet to be confirmed. Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner, recently outlined his vision in a lengthy memo to staff members, talking up exploratory efforts to incorporate artificial intelligence into its phone services and enhance its anti-fraud efforts.\n\nThe agency is also moving forward with a plan to no longer allow beneficiaries to change their bank information over the phone, necessitating a visit to the office or the creation of an online account \u2014 which Social Security employees told NBC News would make it more difficult for some elderly recipients to maintain their benefits.\n\nAlready, Dudek and the Social Security Administration have had to backtrack on a couple of unpopular decisions after public outcry.\n\nThe agency scrapped plans to end phone service for filing disability and retirement claims entirely, The Washington Post reported. Dudek also rescinded and apologized for an order that would have no longer allowed parents in Maine to sign up for their newborns\u2019 Social Security numbers at hospitals, instead having them register at federal offices.\n\nThe one-two punch of office closures and new limits on phone service have drawn concerns across the political spectrum. On Thursday, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., described the choice to close a Social Security hearing office in his district as \u201ca slap in the face to thousands of my constituents who rely on these services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis office handles over 2,000 backlogged cases and conducts hundreds of in-person hearings every year,\u201d Lawler, who represents a swing district, added in a statement. He said it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d to tell his constituents that they need to travel farther to receive the same service.\n\nOther Republicans are publicly warning Musk and DOGE to tread lightly when slashing Social Security employees, as that carries negative impacts for seniors.\n\n\u201cFirst, we are not going to cut Social Security benefits. Secondly, we need to be so cautious [about] how we cut the workforce because customer service is inadequate now as it is,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents an Omaha-based swing district and is a perennial Democratic target, told NBC News. \u201cOur goal needs to be improving the customer service. I know this firsthand. We had a death on our family and it has been hard to get someone to stop the payments.\u201d\n\nYet amid those concerns, Republicans said they did not remember Social Security being a subject of conversation in private meetings with Musk. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he did not recall Musk bringing up Social Security with senators during the billionaire\u2019s closed-door meeting with them last month. A senior Senate GOP aide echoed Cramer, saying he did not think Musk \u201chas really addressed Social Security much with senators at all.\u201d\n\nSocial Security employees who spoke with NBC News, meanwhile, said Musk\u2019s entitlement rhetoric and the administration\u2019s recent moves have them increasingly concerned the administration will move to privatize Social Security.\n\n\u201cThe stuff that [Musk is] saying is untrue, and he must know that what he\u2019s saying is untrue, but he\u2019s saying it to move the needle and turn public sentiment against Social Security so that privatization or vastly downsizing the workforce will seem like a good idea,\u201d said one employee at the agency, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal.\n\nA second Social Security employee said wait times are increasing for services, and employees are telling people to try and get any bank information changes in as soon as possible.\n\nThis person noted that elderly Social Security recipients who might not be tech-savvy and live far from a Social Security office are going to be most affected by the changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to prevent people from getting their benefits,\u201d this person said, adding that the effort amounts to \u201ca very stealthy, very covert hostile takeover.\u201d\n\nNancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, argued that the Trump-Musk moves to slash and overhaul the Social Security Administration can do grave harm to benefits \u2014 even if Congress doesn\u2019t act to change the program.\n\n\u201cWhat I see happening is that Donald Trump gets the politics, which is why he flooded the swing states with flyers saying he wouldn\u2019t cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Altman said. \u201cSo what is happening is an effort to undermine Social Security from within \u2014 with the idea that the benefits could be disrupted. It\u2019s with the endgame, certainly, of outsourcing and privatizing the administration of it.\u201d\n\nAltman said giving Musk\u2019s \u201cDOGE teenagers and 20-year-olds in control of the Social Security Administration\u201d access to seniors\u2019 personal data creates data safety concerns that leave the program vulnerable to hackers and scammers \u2014 \u201ca con artist\u2019s dream,\u201d she said. She argued that new rules requiring in-person office visits to register could mean that seniors who are disabled or immobile don\u2019t end up getting benefits. And she warned that the removal of Social Security Administration workers will lead to weaker customer service and longer wait times for benefits.\n\nAt a time of division for Democrats, the battle to prevent Trump and Musk from shrinking the Social Security Administration is a unifying force.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday in Brooklyn, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., faced questions about his disagreements with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the GOP funding bill, but he said they\u2019re united on protecting Social Security.\n\n\u201cWe all align on the fights that are in front of us on behalf of the people that we represent here in Brooklyn and New York City and across the country,\u201d Jeffries told reporters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s saving Medicaid, saving Social Security, saving Medicare \u2014 all of which Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the Republicans, they want to take a chain saw to Medicaid. They want to take a chain saw to Social Security.\u201d\n\nFirst-term Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., who flipped a competitive district last fall, said she\u2019s hearing from constituents who are anxious about Social Security changes, office closures and potential impacts to their benefits due to Musk\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s good for billionaires like him, but it isn\u2019t good for my constituents,\u201d Bynum said. \u201cAnd we have an unelected billionaire trying to cut what we know is an essential program for millions of Americans.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Officers with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Photo: Patrick Fallon/Reuters\n\nAmerican tourists planning trips overseas are probably familiar with U.S. State Department \u201ctravel advisories,\u201d which warn about the risks of visits to war-torn or totalitarian countries as well as those experiencing high crime or suffering from poor infrastructure. These up-to-date looks at local conditions abroad are meant to help Americans avoid not only bodily harm but also extreme unpleasantness or drastic interruptions in derailed vacations or business trips. Here\u2019s a current example, for Israel:\n\nDo Not Travel To: \u2022 Gaza due to terrorism and armed conflict \u2022 Northern Israel within 4 kilometers/2.4 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders due to Israel\u2019s continued military presence and activity\n\nReconsider Travel To: \u2022 Israel due to terrorism and civil unrest \u2022 West Bank due to terrorism and civil unrest\n\nThat\u2019s all entirely understandable considering the ongoing crisis in that country. It\u2019s also understandable that European countries have now begun warning their citizens about the risks of travel to the United States of America. That\u2019s because they have determined that under the new regime of Donald Trump, the U.S. has become the kind of country where every foreigner better have their papers in order unless they want to risk extreme consequences. Forbes reports:\n\nThe United Kingdom updated its foreign travel advice for the U.S. on Mar. 15, recommending visitors comply with U.S. authorities, which \u201cset and enforce entry rules strictly\u201d and warning, \u201cYou may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d An archived version of the webpage from Feb. 1 shows the guidance had previously said: \u201cThe authorities in the U.S. set and enforce entry rules\u201d with no mention of arrest or detention.\n\nGermany\u2019s Federal Foreign Office updated its website Tuesday, advising travelers that even having a valid authorization permit or U.S. visa doesn\u2019t guarantee the right to enter the country and, if refused, \u201cthere is no legal recourse against this decision.\u201d A new paragraph warns: \u201cCriminal records in the United States, false information about the purpose of their stay, or even a slight overstay of their visa upon entry or exit can lead to arrest, detention, and deportation.\u201d\n\nTourists who run afoul of the Trump administration\u2019s cultural conservatism could have additional problems. Germany, Denmark, and Finland have warned their citizens that the U.S. may deny entry to transgender and nonbinary tourists since the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization used by Europeans for visa-free travel doesn\u2019t allow foreign visitors to select anything other than \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale.\u201d Germany and Denmark both allow their citizens to designate \u201cX\u201d as their gender on passports.\n\nAs NPR notes, a handful of countries have previously warned their citizens about the risk of gun violence when traveling in the U.S., but not about the risks of dealing with the U.S. government.\n\nAside from the intense scrutiny tourists trying to visit this country may encounter, the Trump administration\u2019s overall attitude toward select foreign countries is having a dampening effect on tourism. That\u2019s particularly true of the single largest source of U.S. tourism, our neighbors to the north. Canada has updated its travel advisory for the U.S., urging extra caution in dealing with U.S. authorities. And as the New York Times reports, Canadians unhappy with Trump\u2019s claims that their country will be America\u2019s 51st state have lost interest in visiting the other 50, including New York:\n\nMore than one million Canadians visited New York City last year, injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy. Now, they are canceling trips in droves. School groups have called off end-of-semester trips. So have busloads of retirees, as well as newlyweds planning honeymoons, friends celebrating birthdays and a family from Quebec that had planned to visit twice this year. Often, the reason cited is President Trump\u2019s escalating hostility toward Canada and repeated threats to make it the 51st state, which has stirred sweeping pledges to boycott American goods and abandon over-the-border vacations to the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to the rest of the world is now creating real costs for Americans. We\u2019re paying in dollars and cents, and in the long-revered reputation of this country as a marvelous place to visit where freedom is revered.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Friday! In today\u2019s newsletter, we\u2019re diving into the Trump administration\u2019s various legal cases, including several where judges are starting to get annoyed. We\u2019re also taking a look at how the White House is handling potential conflicts of interest for Elon Musk, given his business interests, and how Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is handling a swell of Democratic anger at him. And last but not least, we answer another reader question using data from the latest NBC News poll. Enjoy the newsletter, and enjoy your weekend.\n\n\u2014 Scott Bland\n\nThe Trump administration's many court cases heat up\n\nSeveral federal judges expressed frustration this week with how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is pushing forward his sweeping agenda, as Trump and his allies got even more aggressive in their criticism of the judiciary, Dareh Gregorian, Gary Grumbach and Chloe Atkins report.\n\nTrump called for the impeachment of a judge who temporarily halted deportations being carried out under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act, while also blasting the jurist on his Truth Social platform as a \u201cgrandstander\u201d whose rulings are \u201cinept.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration currently has over 15 appeals pending, including from rulings this week reining in the power of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Governmental Efficiency.\n\nYou can read more about those appeals and other cases here. But first \u2014 more on Musk, and how the White House is handling potential conflicts of interest for the world\u2019s richest man-turned-\u201cspecial government employee.\u201d\n\nAs the public face of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has an expansive portfolio that spans across the many levers of government \u2014 and that could intersect with his wide range of business interests, Ben Kamisar reports.\n\nBut unlike another high-profile \u201cspecial government employee\u201d working in Trump\u2019s White House, AI and crypto czar David Sacks, there\u2019s no evidence that Musk has obtained a conflict-of-interest waiver. Such a waiver would outline the steps he\u2019s taken to avoid overlaps between his business interests and his government work, include an explanation from the White House counsel about why it feels comfortable with Musk\u2019s arrangement, and identify areas where Musk has the green light to weigh in despite his business holdings.\n\nInstead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Musk has already pledged he\u2019d avoid potential conflicts of interest, and like all Trump-appointed \u201cspecial government employees,\u201d he\u2019s \u201cabiding by all applicable laws.\u201d\n\nIn response to an NBC News inquiry about a potential waiver for Musk, the White House counsel\u2019s office replied that \u201cthe White House has no disclosures responsive to your request.\u201d And while some ethics documents are not immediately available for release, instead becoming public weeks after submission, the White House press office did not directly address whether Musk has sought or received a conflict-of-interest waiver that has not yet been released publicly.\n\nAnother special government employee, Sacks, did receive a conflict-of-interest waiver, which has been posted publicly on the White House\u2019s public disclosure portal (releasing these documents publicly upon request is mandated by federal law). That 11-page memo, written by White House Counsel David Warrington, provides a road map to the kinds of conflict-of-interest rules that govern special government employees. The memo shows how Sacks has sought to divest his assets to satisfy the White House\u2019s lawyers, and it demonstrates why he is receiving a conflict-of-interest waiver in the first place that allows him to participate in \u201ccertain particular matters regarding regulation and policy related to the digital asset industry.\u201d\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nMusk visited the Pentagon on Friday for a briefing that Trump insists was focused on the tech mogul\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts, disputing a New York Times report that the meeting would include a discussion of plans for any potential war with China.\n\nTrump said that the Small Business Administration, instead of the Department of Education, would handle the country\u2019s federal student loan portfolio.\n\nThe Trump administration is launching an AI tool for government use.\n\nTrump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared together in the Oval Office to announce a Boeing contract to build the new F-47 fighter.\n\nAngry Democrats are taking aim at Schumer. But is this his \u2018Biden moment?\u2019\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is facing ongoing calls to step down from left-leaning activist groups and even some members of Congress upset with his decision to advance a Republican spending bill and avert a government shutdown. But Schumer remains defiant and has continued to insist he is the best leader for the party in the Senate at this moment.\n\nI pressed Schumer on his future in leadership when I spoke with him this week in an interview airing on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday.\n\nStill, it doesn\u2019t seem like Schumer is facing the same level of opposition that confronted President Joe Biden when he stepped down as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee last summer. In that moment, scores of elected Democrats from both chambers of Congress came forward to call on Biden to end his campaign. (Schumer himself reportedly pushed Biden to drop out of the race, according to The New York Times.)\n\nIn this moment, most of the pushback so far is coming from Democrats in the House. And some Senate Democrats who were outspoken about Biden are holding their fire on Schumer.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., one of the first Democratic members of Congress who called on Biden to step aside last year, sidestepped a question at a recent town hall about whether Schumer should remain in his leadership post, notably stopping short of calling on Schumer to pass the torch. Bennet said, \u201cIn dodging your question, let me just say it\u2019s important for people to know, you know, when it\u2019s time to go. And I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we\u2019re going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who has emerged as a leading voice urging Democrats to more aggressively take on Trump, also told me on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last week that he still supports the minority leader.\n\n\u201cLeader Schumer has a very difficult job. I don\u2019t envy the job that he has,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd the question is really for the members of his Democratic caucus: Are we willing to fight?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic angst has continued to simmer, boiling over at recent town hall meetings. And Democratic voters want their party to put up a fight, according to the latest NBC News poll.\n\nSo is Schumer making the same mistake as Biden and overstaying his welcome as a leader of the Democratic Party? I asked him that question directly, so tune in on Sunday to hear his response. Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, will also be joining \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this week.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2600\ufe0f Sunshine State showdown: The Democrats running in a pair of April 1 special elections for deeply Republican House districts in Florida have raised a whopping $15.7 million combined in two months, but they still face steep uphill climbs in the upcoming campaigns.

One reader asked how voters in red states are viewing President Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders and Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to slash the federal government via the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTo answer that, we turned to one of our resident polling experts, Ben Kamisar. Here\u2019s his response:\n\nIt\u2019s a great question \u2014 obviously not everyone in a red state voted for Trump or is on board with everything he\u2019s doing. But voters in these states do give Trump more leeway given his increased level of popularity there.\n\nOne way to answer this question is to dig into our polling data and split out respondents from states that voted for Trump. Then, we can compare their ratings of the president to the overall numbers.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating in states that voted for him in 2024 is 57%, compared to 47% among registered voters nationally. Trump-state voters are also more likely to approve of his handling of key issues. But they\u2019re effectively split on whether they approve or disapprove of his handling of the economy and the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAs for DOGE, Trump-state voters are more likely to have a positive view of Musk and the department than registered voters at large (49% of these voters viewed Musk positively, compared to 39% of registered voters nationwide, while 49% of Trump-state voters viewed DOGE positively compared to 41% of registered voters nationwide). And a majority of Trump-state voters, 53%, say DOGE is a good idea.\n\nThat\u2019s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today\u2019s newsletter was compiled by Scott Bland and Faith Wardwell.\n\nIf you have feedback \u2014 likes or dislikes \u2014 email us at politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a fan, please share with everyone and anyone.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNow, if you were in that crowd and weren\u2019t intubated and drip-fed, you understood that it was the fat-cat Democrats who got the most money and spent the most money in the last presidential election.\n\nBy far.\n\nI would have called their event the \u201cHow Stupid are You?\u201d Tour, but I understand why they didn\u2019t. That could have alerted any sentient beings at Arizona State University\u2019s Mullett Arena that they were being conned.\n\nThey enjoyed so much largesse from billionaire and millionaire backers that they doubled Republican spending.\n\nIn fact, so much money poured into Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign coffers that even the Democrat-friendly New York Times couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cHow Kamala Harris Burned Through $1.5 Billion in 15 Weeks,\u201d The Times\u2019 headline intoned.\n\nJust how hard were the money clouds raining down on Harris?\n\nSo hard that even her closest campaign ally, Bakari Sellers, told The Times. \u201cWe had so much money it was hard to get it out the door.\u201d\n\nDemocrats: Do as we say, not as we do\n\nSo, here\u2019s what the \u201cFight Oligarchy\u201d tour is really about.\n\nOligarchy is great when they\u2019re our oligarchs. Oligarchy is evil when they\u2019re not.\n\nFor decades now, the Democrats have hobnobbed with the rich and famous, and they've dutifully served their masters. Then some of the rich and famous \u2012 the moneybags in Silicon Valley \u2012 switched sides in 2024 and America\u2019s liberal party suddenly lost its taste for caviar and champagne.\n\nThey won't tolerate it anymore.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept a society today in which we have massive income and wealth inequalities where the very rich have never done better and working families are struggling to put food on the table,\" said the multimillionaire Bernie Sanders to the Tempe crowd.\n\nAnd little point of clarity here. Understand that Sen. Sanders is rich. So forgive him his little faux pas on Thursday night.\n\nWhen you\u2019re part of the American aristocracy, you take your latte in bone china in leather chairs.\n\nYou don\u2019t buy Joe in paper cups from Circle K.\n\n\u201cYou got 9/11s here?\u201d Sanders asked the crowd, as 20,000 eyebrows furrowed at once.\n\nSilly him.\n\nHe meant 7-Elevens.

This is where the man who started it all for the Democratic Party now lives in luxurious, sunlit splendor.\n\nBarack Obama.\n\nIn 2013, the nonprofit student political organization Democracy Matters \u2013 an organization once endorsed by Sen. Sanders \u2013 published a piece by one of its founding members that noticed how the Democratic Party had transformed in the age of Obama.\n\nThe essay titled \u201cThe New Oligarchy\u201d noted, \u201cThe rise of a political oligarchy has changed the funding base of the Democratic Party more than the Republican.\"\n\nEnough that by 2012, \u201caffluent donors contributed four times more money to Democrats than did unions. ... In short, the Democrats cannot any longer be considered a bulwark against the power of wealth.\u201d\n\nDavid Samuels, who made his name writing commentary for The New Republic, The Atlantic and New Yorker, noted last year: \"The policy of aligning the Democrats with the wealthiest Americans, while taking from the middle class and rewarding the poor with symbolic identity politics victories, was Obama\u2019s creation \u2013 hardly a surprising coinage from a BLM-promoting Harvard Law School graduate who once told an intimate that the two things he wanted, as he left the White House, were a private jet and a valet.\u201d\n\nAdded Samuels, \"Obama\u2019s central position in the Democratic Party is both practical and symbolic: in his person, he represents both the elite institutions such as Harvard Law School and the large American foundations and billionaire funders who backed his political rise in Chicago.\u201d\n\nNassau, The Bahamas. This capital city was the headquarters of FTX cryptocurrency exchange, where billionaire Democratic Party benefactor and conman Sam Bankman-Fried \u201corchestrated one of the largest financial frauds in history, stealing over $8 billion of his customers\u2019 money,\u201d according to federal prosecutor Damian Williams in sentencing him to 25 years in prison last year.\n\n\u201cThe scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight,\u201d wrote the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nBankman-Fried stole the nest eggs of Americans to build a fortune of $26 billion. To keep the regulators off his back, he contributed more than $100 million in political campaign contributions before the 2022 U.S. midterm elections \"to mostly Democratic candidates and causes,\" according to NBC News.\n\nThis is the party Bernie Sanders has served for decades. He is an independent, but he caucuses with the Democrats and has run twice for president in Democratic primaries.\n\nFor decades he has railed against oligarchy. He was, in fact, shocked, shocked, that the party he served had become the servants of oligarchs, marinating in their billions of largesse.\n\nWhich begs the question ...\n\nIf you couldn\u2019t crush the oligarchy in your own party, what makes you qualified to crush it in the other?\n\nPhil Boas is an editorial columnist with The Arizona Republic, where this column originally published.

You know you\u2019re talking about a potential war with China,\u201d Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a potential war with China, but I can tell you, if we did, we\u2019re very well equipped to handle it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came amid speculation over why Musk was at the Pentagon on Friday morning, where he met with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth for over an hour. The New York Times reported Thursday that Musk was receiving a briefing on the US military\u2019s plan for potential conflict with China. Pentagon officials resoundingly dismissed the reporting on social media on Thursday.\n\nTrump acknowledged Friday that Musk also has his own business interests in China, which could pose a conflict of interest if he was briefed on a potential war plan with the nation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to show that to anybody \u2013 but certainly, you wouldn\u2019t show it to a businessman who is helping us so much,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that \u2013 but it was such a fake story.\u201d\n\nCNN has reported that Musk \u2014 who is serving as a special government employee under Trump \u2014 has a top-secret security clearance. The meeting also comes as the Pentagon is weighing significant cuts to the top of the military amid efforts across the Trump administration to shrink the government.\n\nHegseth has said the Defense Department would be working with Musk\u2019s DOGE to find fraud and waste within the department.\n\nThis photo released by the Department of Defense shows Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth welcoming Elon Musk to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on March 21, 2025. Senior Airman Spencer Perkins/Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs\n\nMusk maintains lucrative contracts with the Defense Department. In October 2024, the US Space Force awarded $733 million in launch contracts to Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nMusk arrived at the Pentagon just before 9 a.m. for his meeting with Hegseth and other senior Pentagon leaders. Upon arrival he went upstairs towards Hegseth\u2019s office, and did not emerge from the office for roughly an hour and 20 minutes. Photos of the meeting shared by the Pentagon showed Musk and Hegseth sitting at a table with six other individuals, including Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff Joe Kasper.\n\nAsked by CNN about the meeting as Musk and Hegseth exited Hegseth\u2019s office, Musk responded, \u201cIt\u2019s always a great meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here before, you know,\u201d Musk quipped, as he and Hegseth laughed and began walking down the stairs. Neither Hegseth nor Musk answered shouted questions about whether they discussed China in their meeting or if it was a classified briefing.\n\nAsked by the New York Times after Musk\u2019s departure what the two discussed, Hegseth said, \u201cWhy would I tell you?\u201d\n\nHegseth later characterized the meeting as \u201cfantastic\u201d while at the White House for the announcement of a new fighter aircraft.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is a patriotic American and I appreciate him,\u201d Hegseth said, without elaborating on what the two discussed."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the Pentagon\u2019s decision to move forward with a next-generation fighter jet titled F-47 on Friday in joint remarks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth from the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cAt my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world\u2019s first sixth-generation fighter jet, number six, sixth generation, nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it\u2019ll be known as the F-47,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump announced that Boeing had been awarded the contract for the newest US fighter aircraft.\n\nThe president went on to say an experimental version of the F-47 has been flying for almost five years. At the end of the first Trump administration, the Air Force acknowledged that it had flown a full-scale prototype of the jet.\n\n\u201cAfter a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America\u2019s top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the next generation air dominance platform to Boeing,\u201d Trump announced.\n\nUntil now, the program had been known as Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD). But in an apparent reference to his own presidency, Trump said the aircraft would be known as the F-47. Aircraft designations are normally announced by the Air Force.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something the likes of which nobody has seen before,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand this has been in the works for a long period of time.\u201d\n\nTrump also promised the F-47 would be able to cooperate with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are a major focus of the military, especially as the US has watched Ukraine and Russia effectively use drones in relatively inexpensive long-range attacks and employed drone swarms to overwhelm aerial defenses.\n\n\u201cThis plane flies with drones. It flies with many, many drones, as many as you want,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a technology that\u2019s new, but it doesn\u2019t fly by itself. It flies with many drones, as many as you want, and that\u2019s something that no other plane can do.\u201d\n\nIt was the Air Force\u2019s decision to award the F-47 program to Boeing, but Trump\u2019s celebration of the announcement was somewhat of a surprise, since he has repeatedly criticized the company.\n\nTrump has railed against Boeing for the cost overruns and delays with the next Air Force One. \u201cWe are getting a new Air Force One, if Boeing could ever finish the damn thing,\u201d Trump said in February. Boeing\u2019s leadership said they would try to move the delivery schedule up, but there\u2019s \u201cno silver bullet\u201d for the program.\n\nAnother major Boeing program for the Air Force - the KC-46 tanker - is projected to be more than seven years behind its original timeline for reaching full-rate production, according to the Government Accountability Office, a far cry from the Trump administration\u2019s goal of producing systems faster and more efficiently.\n\nFor decades, Boeing produced the backbone of the US bomber fleet, from B-17s and B-29s in World War II to B-52s that rolled off the assembly line in the 1960s and are still flying today. Boeing now produces the F-15EX Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet, two major platforms for the Air Force and the Navy, respectively. These fighter aircraft are derivatives of designs initially developed by McDonnell Douglas, an aircraft manufacturer that merged with Boeing in 1997.\n\nThe last production fighter designed and built exclusively by Boeing is the P-26 Peashooter, which first flew in 1932. Boeing also designed and built the X-32 Joint Strike Fighter, which ultimately lost out to the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.\n\nLate-last year, the Air Force paused the decision on how to proceed with the sixth-generation fighter. The Air Force said in December that then-Secretary Frank Kendall would defer the decision to the Trump administration.\n\nThe Next Generation Air Dominance program is intended to produce the US military\u2019s sixth-generation fighter jet, newer and more advanced than the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, which has suffered from major cost overruns and delays.\n\nElon Musk has railed against the F-35, instead advocating for unmanned drone swarms as a cheaper, more effective weapon. On social media in November, Musk said \u201cMeanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.\u201d\n\nWhen Lockheed Martin was awarded the F-35 in October 2001, the weapons maker said the program would cost approximately $200 billion. The company\u2019s CEO promised the F-35 would be \u201ccapable and affordable\u201d and be produced \u201con schedule and cost.\u201d More than two decades later, the total cost of the program has exceeded $2 trillion, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), as the military services \u201cplan to use it less.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Angry Democrats explode at Chuck Schumer. Photo: Leonardo Munoz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWithout any question, rank-and-file Democrats are furious right now. They are angry at the Trump administration, of course, for the multi-pronged attack underway on the public sector; on judges; on immigrants; on universities; on our allies; and on the U.S. Constitution. They are angry at a Republican Party that is egging on Trump, Elon Musk, Russell Vought, and the unruly gang of social-media trolls, Christian nationalists, and tech bros who have been empowered by the new administration, at the expense of congressional Republican authority. But most of all, they\u2019re angry at their own party\u2019s leaders for losing a winnable 2024 election and then retreating into confusion and fecklessness in dealing with emergency conditions that look a lot like every authoritarian takeover in modern world history.\n\nDemocrats are losing confidence in their party at historic rates, with Chuck Schumer\u2019s abrupt decision to abandon a filibuster against a GOP/Trump spending bill becoming a real flash point. A recent Quinnipiac survey showed 49 percent of self-identified Democrats disapproving the job performance of the congressional party. The palpable unhappiness at the grassroots has led multiple observers to suggest that we may be on the brink of an intraparty revolt similar in intensity and significance to the tea-party movement that convulsed Republicans during the Obama administration, and which (many believe) paved the way for the equally angry MAGA movement that is now in charge of the country.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the tea party of the right began with angry grassroots Republicans infuriated by Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 election victory, the 44th president\u2019s bold legislative agenda, and the GOP Establishment\u2019s difficulties in countering it. And it did most strikingly manifest itself in a midterm primary upset of a congressional Republican leader, when a nobody named Dave Brat defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his Virginia stomping grounds. We are now being told that Democrats in Congress who aren\u2019t sufficiently \u201cfighting\u201d Trump could meet the same fate.\n\nBut the differences between the current moment and the one that sparked the tea-party movement are at least as striking as the similarities. The most important difference is that the uprising on the right was sharply ideological, and went far beyond demands for greater partisan combativeness. Its impetus was pretty clearly the bipartisan actions taken to mitigate the financial collapse that occurred late in the Bush administration, including the TARP bailout of investment institutions, but more importantly, the relief provided to regular folks who defaulted on mortgages.\n\nThe tea-party movement\u2019s moment of birth was famously \u201cSantelli\u2019s Rant,\u201d an on-air tirade by business telejournalist Rick Santelli aimed at the deadbeats turned freeloaders who took on unsustainable debt and expected their more responsible fellow citizens to rescue them with taxpayer dollars. This very pointed complaint metastasized into broad-based resentment of income redistribution and a near-libertarian belief that much of the modern welfare state violated the U.S. Constitution. While tea-party protests may have been aimed at TARP and then Obamacare, they really represented a revolt against the New Deal and Great Society legacy of beneficent government and a clear and powerful right turn for the Republican Party. Much of what the hard-core conservative House Freedom Caucus stands for came right out of the tea-party movement, along with some significant MAGA flourishes added by Donald Trump.\n\nWhile progressives certainly believe the unprincipled character of party centrists has contributed materially to Trump\u2019s return to power and the paralysis of congressional Democrats, it\u2019s not accurate to say that the current wave of anger is ideological or the product of an aroused Left. As Politico notes, Democrats unhappy with their party are not at all united in any ideological diagnosis or prescription:\n\nDespite the restive energy in the party\u2019s progressive wing, the Democratic discontent does not seem to be centered around a desire to pull the party to the left or the right. Democrats cannot seem to agree on which direction the party should move in \u2014 recent Gallup polling found that 45 percent wanted the party to become more moderate, while 29 percent felt it should become more liberal, and 22 percent wanted it to stay the same.\n\nI\u2019m reasonably sure very few of the original tea-party activists wanted the GOP to become \u201cmore moderate.\u201d\n\nSo if an ideological uprising is not in store for Democrats, how is the current wave of anguish likely to manifest itself, or to be resolved?\n\nCongressional leadership, rather than garden-variety Democratic incumbents, seem the most likely target of grassroots rage going forward, which would mean a shakeup within the Senate and possibly the House leadership to show a willingness to deploy more aggressive tactics. But before that sort of revolt can take shape, the underlying conditions in the country could change the intraparty dynamics. If, for example, federal courts indeed slow down or stop the most outrageous actions of Team Trump, and particularly if the Supreme Court reestablishes constitutional \u201cguardrails,\u201d then perhaps Democrats will become less insistent that their elected leaders throw themselves upon the MAGA ramparts. And inversely, if Trump, Musk, and company intensify their authoritarian efforts and are not restrained by the courts (either because the judiciary surrenders or is simply ignored), the anger, fear, and panic among the Democratic grassroots could move onto the streets in open resistance instead of being focused on Democratic members of Congress who obviously can\u2019t be expected to stop an extraconstitutional coup.\n\nIn a less apocalyptic scenario, the closer we get to the 2026 midterms the more likely it is that Democratic activists will be focused on winning general elections and flipping Congress rather than on purging Democratic incumbents who have failed to turn the tide. Already, small-dollar donors are pouring money into long-shot Democratic candidacies in two Florida special elections to fill House seats. The categorical imperative of busting up the Republican trifecta in Washington seems sure to deter Democrats from the sort of suicidal conduct that led tea-party bravos to back doomed Republican primary candidates like 2010 Delaware Senate nominee Christine O\u2019Donnell or 2012 Missouri Senate nominee Todd Akin.\n\nIn general, we\u2019re not likely to see left-of-center activists don tri-corner hats and scream about DINOs out of anguish at what Trump\u2019s doing to their country and its institutions. As longtime tea-party observer (and sometimes supporter) David French noted, it\u2019s not a good temperamental fit anyway:\n\n[T]he Democratic Party is more of a party of institutions \u2014 including government institutions \u2014 than the Republican Party is now. This means they\u2019re less likely to want a demolition than to urge a renovation. If the Tea Party revels in being the bull in the china shop and glories in the wreckage, the Democratic Party might want better inventory or new management, but it doesn\u2019t want to trash the place.\n\nDespite the alleged proclivity of Democrats to form \u201ccircular firing squads\u201d and fall into \u201cdisarray,\u201d the odds are good that they will focus more on the common enemy."

The head of that office, James Dennehy, who had angered the Trump administration for non-Epstein-related reasons, said he was forced to submit his resignation a day later.\n\nSo now, the Trump administration is trying to move on from this debacle by swinging far in the opposite direction: Rather than throwing together a binder that contains too little information, the FBI has a jaw-dropping number of agents focused on the Epstein files instead of their regular, extremely important work.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re picturing 50 or even 100 agents sifting through Epstein documents. But ABC News reports you need to think a lot bigger:\n\nAs many as a thousand FBI agents, many of whom are usually focusing on national-security matters, have been enlisted to help with the effort, sources said.\n\nSources told ABC News that Bondi pressured FBI Director Kash Patel in \u201ctense private exchanges\u201d to prioritize the release of more Epstein files, so now agents are working around the clock to make it happen:\n\nJustice Department officials have made it clear to others throughout the Trump administration that it is now a top priority of the attorney general to sort through the materials related to Epstein and decide what can be publicly disclosed in the days ahead, sources said, and FBI agents have been told to expect to work on this into the early morning hours.\n\nThe DOJ and FBI both released statements downplaying reports of tension between the agencies, saying they are working together to deliver \u201ctransparency\u201d for the American people.\n\nBut Vanity Fair reported that the FBI\u2019s New York office is bearing a lot of the pressure from the Justice Department, with dozens of agents focused on reviewing and redacting sensitive information from Epstein-related documents rather than doing less important tasks, like, say, fighting terrorism and drug trafficking:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally all hands on deck,\u201d one source familiar with the matter tells me, adding that dozens and dozens of agents are working around the clock on the case, instead of on their regular duties. \u201cI even saw an agent walking in with a pillow,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe New York field office is an epicenter for FBI counterintelligence, counterterrorism, public corruption, international drug trafficking, and financial crime investigations. The redeployment of agents to comb over the file of the notorious sex trafficker Epstein, who died nearly six years ago, is an indication of the Justice Department priorities in this second Trump administration. One FBI veteran calls it a \u201cludicrous\u201d situation.\n\nBut at least this \u201cludicrous\u201d scramble will pay off when we all get our hands on the fabled \u201cEpstein client list\u201d? Don\u2019t bet on it, reports ABC News:\n\nSources tell ABC News that the Justice Department\u2019s national security division is devoting many of their resources to the effort, despite some top law enforcement officials believing that the information Bondi is demanding be reviewed contains no new revelations.\n\nIn fact, though Bondi has claimed that as a result of her efforts the FBI turned over a \u201ctruckload\u201d of evidence on the Epstein case, some doubt that actually happened. Per Vanity Fair:\n\nThe FBI veteran noted that this was an odd way for Bondi to describe the matter. \u201cThere\u2019s no master file in the New York office. That doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d the veteran added. \u201cThere\u2019s not some crusty agent with his feet on bankers\u2019 boxes.\u201d\n\nObviously, the public has a right to know the full extent of Epstein\u2019s horrific crimes. But perhaps Pam Bondi making huge promises live on Fox News, then having FBI agents scramble to turn her claims into reality, isn\u2019t the best way to go about this."

            "full_content": "One of a kind who can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be replicated. Photo: Jim Vondruska/Reuters\n\nAt a time when plenty of people have advice for unhappy progressive Democrats, one of their heroes, Bernie Sanders, had a succinct message: Don\u2019t love the party, leave it. In an interview with the New York Times, he previewed a barnstorming tour he has undertaken with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but made it clear he wouldn\u2019t be asking audiences to rally \u2019round the Democratic Party. \u201cOne of the aspects of this tour is to try to rally people to get engaged in the political process and run as independents outside of the Democratic Party,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nIn one respect, that isn\u2019t surprising. Though he has long aligned with the Democratic Party in Congress and has regularly backed its candidates, Sanders has always self-identified as an independent, even when he filed to run for president as a Democrat in 2020. Now, as before, he seems to regard the Democratic Party as inherently corrupted by its wealthy donor base, per the Times:\n\nDuring the interview on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders repeatedly criticized the influence of wealthy donors and Washington consultants on the party. He said that while Democrats had been a force for good on social issues like civil rights, women\u2019s rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, they had failed on the economic concerns he has dedicated his political career to addressing.\n\nStill, when Democrats are now already perceived as losing adherents, and as many progressives believe their time to take over the party has arrived, Sanders\u2019s counsel is both oddly timed and pernicious. Yes, those on the left who choose independent status may still work with Democrats on both legislative and electoral projects, much as Sanders does. And they may run in and win Democratic primaries on occasion without putting on the party yoke. But inevitably, refusing to stay formally within the Democratic tent will cede influence to centrists and alienate loyalist voters as well. And in 18 states, voters who don\u2019t register as Democrats may be barred from voting in Democratic primaries, which proved a problem for Sanders during his two presidential runs.\n\nMore fundamentally, Democrats need both solidarity and stable membership at this moment with the MAGA wolf at the door and crucial off-year and midterm elections coming up. Staying in the Democratic ranks doesn\u2019t mean giving up progressive principles or failing to challenge timid or ineffective leadership. To borrow an ancient cigarette-ad slogan, it\u2019s a time when it\u2019s better to \u201cfight than switch.\u201d\n\nThat said, there may be certain deep-red parts of the country where the Democratic brand is so toxic that an independent candidacy could make some sense for progressives. The example of 2024 independent Senate candidate Dan Osborn of Nebraska, who ran a shockingly competitive (if ultimately unsuccessful) race against Republican incumbent Deb Fischer, turned a lot of heads. But while Osborn might have been a \u201cpopulist\u201d by most standards, he wasn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call a progressive, and in fact, centrist and progressive Nebraska Democrats went along with Osborn as a very long shot. They didn\u2019t abandon their party; they just got out of the way.\n\nPerhaps someday, the popularity of electoral systems without party primaries or with ranked-choice voting will spread to the point where candidates and voters alike will gradually shed or at least weaken party labels. Then self-identifying as an independent could be both principled and politically pragmatic.\n\nBut until then, it\u2019s important to understand why American politics have regularly defaulted to a two-party system dating all the way back to those days when the Founders tried strenuously to avoid parties altogether. In a first-past-the-post system where winners take all, there\u2019s just too much at stake to allow those with whom you are in agreement on the basics to splinter. That\u2019s particularly true when, as is the case right now, the other party is rigidly united in subservience to an authoritarian leader. Sanders is one of a kind in his ability to keep his feet both within and outside the Democratic Party. His example isn\u2019t replicable without making a bad situation for progressives a whole lot worse."

Trump\u2019s Executive Order,\u201d USDA said in a press release.\n\nThe USDA temporarily paused funding for UMS, which is comprised of eight public universities in the state, last week over the issue and reinstated funds just days later. The department said the university system is now in compliance with Trump\u2019s order. Still, it warned that \u201c[a]ny false claim by the UMaine can, and will, result in onerous and even potentially criminal financial liability.\u201d\n\nBy Feb. 26, 2025, UMaine responded to USDA\u2019s questions, confirming that it does not have males participating in women\u2019s sports and complies with NCAA regulations. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) notably banned males from competing in women\u2019s sports less than 24 hours after Trump\u2019s order rewriting Title IX. USDA said UMaine has had access to federal funds since it confirmed its compliance.\n\n\u201cThe choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding,\u201d USDA added.\n\nUMS Chancellor Dannel Malloy told Fox News Digital that UMaine is \u201crelieved\u201d to \u201cput the Department\u2019s Title IX compliance review behind us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe University of Maine System has always maintained its compliance with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture also affirmed in a press release today,\u201d Malloy said.\n\n\u201cWe are relieved to put the Department\u2019s Title IX compliance review behind us so the land-grant University of Maine and our statewide partners can continue to leverage USDA and other essential federal funds to strengthen and grow our natural resource economy and dependent rural communities through world-class education, research, and extension,\u201d he continued.\n\nAccording to the report, USDA awarded at least $29.78 million to UMS for research in the 2024 fiscal year alone. In a letter to the system, the USDA said it has awarded over $100 million to UMS in recent years.\n\nRELATED: Boy Wins High School Girls\u2019 Pole Vault Competition in Maine After State Pledged to Flout Trump Order\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order on \u201cKeeping Men out of Women\u2019s Sports\u201d was created to protect female student athletes from having \u201cto compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.\u201d The order also mandates each federal department to \u201creview grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,\u201d which protects women \u201cas a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\u201d\n\nFollowing his order, several Democrat-run states said they planned to flout to order, including California, Minnesota, and Maine. Then, in February, a transgender-identifying boy claimed the victory in the Maine Class B championship for the Greely High School girls\u2019 track and field team.\n\nTrump subsequently vowed on Feb. 20 during a GOP governors\u2019 meeting at the White House to cut funding to Maine if it continues to allow males in female sports. Maine Gov. Janet Mills\u2019 office threatened legal action against the Trump administration the following day.\n\nTrump then had a spat with Mills at the White House during a bipartisan meeting of governors.\n\n\u201cAre you not going to comply with [the order]?\u201d Trump asked Mills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m complying with state and federal laws,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED: Maine Democrats Punish GOP Rep. for Opposing Transgenderism\n\n\u201cWell, we are the federal law,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cWell, you better do it. You better do it because you\u2019re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, your population, even though it\u2019s somewhat liberal \u2014 although I did very well there \u2014 your population doesn\u2019t want men playing in women\u2019s sports,\u201d he added.\n\nMills said she would see Trump in court, and he declared he looked forward to it.\n\n\u201cThat should be a really easy one, and enjoy your life after governor because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be in elected politics,\u201d he said to conclude the back-and-forth.\n\nHours later, the U.S. Department of Education announced an investigation into the state for potential IX violations. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities receiving federal funding.\n\nThe Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ultimately concluded that the state and the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) violated Title IX.\n\nHHS warned MDOE, the Maine Principals\u2019 Association, and Greely High School that it will refer the state to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) if it does not agree to comply with Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cWhat HHS is asking of the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals\u2019 Association (MPA), and Greely High School is simple \u2014 protect female athletes\u2019 rights. Girls deserve girls-only sports without male competitors. And if Maine won\u2019t come to the table to voluntarily comply with Title IX, HHS will enforce Title IX to the fullest extent permitted by the law,\u201d HHS OCR acting Director Anthony Archeval told Fox News Digital.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Witkoff went back to Moscow for a face-to-face with Russian president Vladimir Putin last week to try to advance the administration\u2019s ceasefire proposal.\n\nWitkoff is \u201cflying all over the world playing secretary of state,\u201d said a person familiar with the dynamic. \u201cHe has one thing that no one else has \u2014 he has Trump\u2019s 100% confidence.\u201d\n\nRubio, meanwhile, has dived into his role with trips to Central America to discuss immigration, to the Middle East, Europe and Canada for discussions on the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and to meet with G7 partners.\n\nAt times, he has appeared uncomfortable with some of the administration\u2019s moves: he reportedly feuded with Elon Musk in a Trump Cabinet meeting earlier this month, and was notably photographed in what one Rubio ally called a \u201ccouch slouch\u201d in the Oval Office as Trump and Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe optics have raised questions about Rubio\u2019s influence with Trump, according to people familiar with the State Department. Though Rubio was the first cabinet member confirmed\u2014 unanimously at that \u2014 his role has lacked some of the profile and portfolio traditionally enjoyed by previous secretaries of state. And there\u2019s a contingent of MAGA faithful still skeptical of his hawkish foreign policy views.\n\n\u201cI think he is frustrated,\u201d a senator still in touch with Rubio told CNN.\n\nWhile foreign diplomats have praised Rubio for his engagement, multiple sources familiar with Rubio and the job say he appears ill at ease by how the White House has minimized his role.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what he expected,\u201d said one person. \u201cWitkoff came out of the blue,\u201d they added. \u201cTrump loves him.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, only Rubio carries the full trappings of the secretary\u2019s office. While Witkoff often flies on his own Gulfstream private jet, Rubio is welcomed with pomp upon arrival in foreign countries, traveling with a large security detail and on the government\u2019s C-32 jumbo jet emblazoned with \u201cUnited States of America.\u201d\n\nAfter the story published on Friday, Rubio posted on X attacking CNN and saying Witkoff is \u201cone of the people I work with the CLOSEST on our team.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Witkoff said he had a \u201cwonderful working relationship\u201d with Rubio.\n\n\u201cHe is already a great Secretary of State and in my view will go down as one of the greatest,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cWhere the media gets these nonsense stories I will never know so I have now learned to dismiss them. Every single issue I am working on comes with the collaboration of Marco Rubio.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s allies in the administration argue he and Witkoff are complementing each other rather than dueling, and both the State Department and the White House pushed back on the notion that he is in any way being overshadowed by Witkoff.\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN. \u201cSecretary Rubio is a pivotal leader on President Trump\u2019s national security team having spearheaded a number of foreign policy initiatives, especially as it relates to negotiating a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine and driving policy in the Western Hemisphere. President Trump has amassed a talented team who are working around the clock to deliver results for Americans.\u201d\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement, \u201cYour premise is false. Secretary Rubio and Special Envoy Witkoff have a fantastic relationship, and are working together to advance President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, the president praised Rubio\u2019s work ethic, telling reporters unprompted in the Oval Office, \u201cHe\u2019s worked so hard. He\u2019s gone to so many different countries already.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic person \u2013 a great man,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think he has a chance to be our best secretary of state.\u201d\n\n\u2018Witkoff is a golf buddy\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s public reliance on Witkoff has already led to speculation in Washington about how long Rubio will want to stay in the job.\n\nOne longtime friend of Rubio\u2019s said he approached the job mindful of the revolving door of the first Trump administration, notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who lasted 13 months. Another person familiar with Rubio\u2019s thinking said he took the job to \u201cburnish his credentials\u201d and still has presidential ambitions that were not reached after his 2016 bid fell short to Trump.\n\nHe will view his role as a success if he serves for 18 months to two years, the friend added, which would allow him time to plan for a potential presidential run in 2028, should that opportunity present itself.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio listens as President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet Meeting at the White House on February 26, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nSources familiar with Rubio also point out there is a potential upside for him keeping some of the biggest foreign policy crises at arms\u2019 length, with major questions still looming about how Trump will navigate an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the broken ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\u201cI think Marco will find his groove and his niche,\u201d said a former Republican senator who worked with Rubio. \u201cIt probably won\u2019t be with the hot-button areas of the world \u2014 and he\u2019d probably be wise to leave that with the White House to deal with.\u201d\n\nRubio built a lengthy foreign policy resume in the Senate, serving as the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a long-term member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That experience helped him land on Trump\u2019s VP shortlist, even though he was ultimately passed over for Vance.\n\nRubio has already played a key role in several diplomatic efforts. He led a US delegation to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, where Ukraine accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposal, easing tensions with Kyiv after the Zelensky Oval Office blowup.\n\nFor some veteran diplomats back in Washington, it\u2019s been tough watching Rubio\u2019s first two months on the job \u2014 fighting cuts from Musk\u2019s DOGE and ceding some of the traditional diplomatic role of the secretary of state to one of Trump\u2019s New York real estate friends.\n\nWhile Rubio was tasked with soothing and reassuring America\u2019s closest allies during last week\u2019s formal G7 meeting in Quebec, Canada, Witkoff was headed to Moscow, for a one-on-one meeting with Putin.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio is a real foreign policy guy,\u201d said one former senior State Department official familiar with both Rubio and Witkoff. \u201cThe idea that Steve Witkoff is going to sit around with Putin in the Kremlin, I mean really. Come on, Witkoff is a golf buddy\u2026 it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u2018Rough times are for politicians\u2019\n\nThe G7 meeting last week in Canada was the first real chance for Rubio to explain directly to counterparts the vision of the Trump agenda, a senior US official close to Rubio told CNN, emphasizing that it \u201cisn\u2019t a passing fad\u201d but something that will \u201crequire everybody to adjust.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t make it easy for him.\n\nJust as Rubio was sitting down for a long day of meetings with frustrated allies, Trump sent out a caps-filled social media post announcing a new 200% tariff on European alcohol, targeting some of the countries whose ministers were with Rubio at the G7 meeting.\n\nAs the assembled diplomats shared Trump\u2019s message with each other, they recognized the difficult position Rubio was in.\n\nHours later, Trump struck again, declaring from the Oval Office, \u201cCanada only works as a state.\u201d\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio, second from right, attends the G7 foreign ministers meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, on March 13. S\u00e9bastien St-Jean/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 51st state question dogged Rubio throughout his trip to Canada. He answered like a diplomat: \u201cThere\u2019s a disagreement between the president\u2019s position and the position of the Canadian government,\u201d Rubio told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a mystery coming in and it wasn\u2019t a topic of conversation, because that\u2019s not what the summit was about.\u201d\n\nBoth in public and private, Rubio and other G7 officials emphasized a need to ignore the Trump-fueled chaos and focus on what they could try to move forward, like a ceasefire in Ukraine, according to sources who requested anonymity.\n\nTo some foreign diplomats at the G7, the ease of working with Rubio behind closed doors contrasted with the difficulties of dealing with the temperamental Trump White House.\n\nHe\u2019s \u201ca very valuable interlocutor,\u201d one senior European official told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t feel this hostility\u201d that Trump expresses, the official added.\n\nIn the resort hotel that hosted the three-day G7 event, foreign officials privately expressed surprise and anger over Trump\u2019s actions, though they roundly praised Rubio for his professional diplomacy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a pure politician with a very good pedigree,\u201d said another senior European official who attended several of the G7 meetings with Rubio. \u201cRough times are for politicians.\u201d\n\nInternational officials said that behind closed doors, Rubio did not stray from his public praise of Trump and desire to enact Trump\u2019s agenda, however controversial.\n\n\u201cHe is a truly experienced diplomatic hand,\u201d said a third foreign official.\n\nSeveral officials did however raise the question of how much influence Rubio has on Trump.\n\nFollowing the G7, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy flew to Washington where he met with Vance on Sunday, despite having just seen Rubio, his counterpart, in Canada.\n\nThe view from Foggy Bottom\n\nInside the State Department, Rubio is getting mixed reviews.\n\nThere have been scores of retirements of diplomats, sources told CNN, far more than in previous years. And because of the government-wide hiring freeze, the Department has stopped offering the foreign service exam and rescinded offers for an April entry-level class of foreign service officers.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio shakes hands with Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez during a tour at the Miraflores locks of the Panama Canal in Panama City on February 2. March Schiefelbein/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time, it seems that Rubio has been able to push back against some of DOGE\u2019s biggest cuts, two foreign service officers said, noting that there has not yet been a widespread firing of State Department personnel.\n\nAlthough they do expect potentially \u201cmassive\u201d reductions, \u201cthe effort to protect us from the most immediate and most sort of extreme cuts were good,\u201d one of the foreign service officers said.\n\nStill, this person said they were disappointed Rubio hadn\u2019t been more of a moderating influence.\n\n\u201cThe earliest signals were that there was going to be kind of a fight between the Rubio people and the Trump people. Rubio does not seem like he is interested or capable in fighting back on policy issues,\u201d the officer said, pointing to \u201cthe utter abandonment of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable what he has done to Ukraine,\u201d the person added.\n\n\u2018Up until 3am\u2019\n\nAnother challenge Rubio has faced is Trump\u2019s sweeping suspension of foreign aid. He is now in charge of a dismantled USAID, whose mission he long supported as a senator.\n\nRubio has spent long hours trying to work through lists of waiver requests for critical programs, according to the senator who\u2019s stayed in touch with Rubio.\n\n\u201cI talked to him a couple weeks in, when all the first USAID things were happening, and he said he\u2019d been up until 3 am trying to go through waivers,\u201d the senator said.\n\n\u201cHe expressed concern about waivers for programs that are important for humanitarian reasons in terms of our national security, but that has not translated into having those programs turned back on by a large degree,\u201d the senator added.\n\nIn the end, however, it was Rubio himself who sent the memo putting in place the foreign aid freeze with waivers only for life-saving programs.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThey quit the United States for Spain in 2022, and Laura Hamlin and her husband Allan Amer describe the experience as like leaving a \u201cbad relationship.\u201d\n\nAccording to Laura, originally from New York, struggled to feel at home after moving from New Jersey to Florida in 2012, and the \u201cdivisive\u201d political environment was wearing her down.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for America to feel like it used to feel,\u201d Laura, who previously worked in real estate, tells CNN Travel, adding that it felt like \u201cleaving a relationship that you knew was a bad one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want what you had in the beginning. And it\u2019s just not there.\u201d\n\nPolitical tensions\n\nThe couple say they didn't feel comfortable living in Florida due to the \"divisive\" political environment. Laura Hamlin\n\nLaura and Allan, who\u2019ve been together for 27 years, eventually decided to spend a few years traveling around in a campervan before moving to Spain.\n\nHowever, things have been far from smooth sailing since then. In fact, the couple were forced to return to the US just six months in, after an unfortunate accident.\n\n\u201cLife has been a roller coaster in pain and pleasure,\u201d says Laura.\n\nReflecting on their decision to leave Florida, Laura explains that they felt uneasy in the Sunshine State due to the political climate.\n\n\u201cPeople were very opinionated and political and holding nasty signs\u2026\u201d she says, before explaining that they moved around, but didn\u2019t feel welcome anywhere.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like we couldn\u2019t find a place that felt like home\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel comfortable there anymore.\u201d\n\nAccording to Laura and Allan, they chose Spain because it was a country that they\u2019d visited on several occasions and \u201cstayed longer each time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the Spanish politics is crazy because we don\u2019t speak the language well enough,\u201d jokes Allan. \u201cBut we do know that the US is crazy. Laura wanted to escape more. I just wanted to travel.\u201d\n\nBut before embarking on a new life in Spain, the couple decided to go on a road trip together.\n\n\u201cI looked at Laura and said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to live anywhere for 12 months,\u2019\u201d says Allan.\n\nLaura adds that she\u2019d spent a lot of time traveling while working in the military during her younger years, and never lost the \u201cwandering bug.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am married to Laura the Explorer,\u201d adds Allan.\n\nAfter selling their three properties, which included two rentals, they set off on a road trip to Idaho, traveling through Minneapolis and Colorado.\n\n\u201cSome definitely looked at us as if we had lost our minds,\u201d Laura recounts.\n\nBefore leaving Florida, they began the process of applying for a non-lucrative visa, which allows non-EU nationals to live in Spain without working as long as they can prove that they have enough money to support themselves.\n\n\u201cIt was tedious,\u201d Laura says. \u201cIt did take three months. We had to hang around in the United States waiting for it (the visa) to come through.\u201d\n\nWhen their visas were finally approved in December 2022, the couple, who were in Germany at the time, flew home on the \u201cmost expensive flight ever on Aer Lingus to Florida\u201d to deal with the paperwork before heading to Spain to begin their new lives.\n\n\u201cWe arrived on December 22,\u201d says Laura. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t spend Christmas with our families.\n\n\u201cBut by that point, after hopping around waiting for our visa approval, they were ready for us to go.\u201d\n\nNew beginning\n\nLaura and Allan suffered a major setback six months into their time in Spain, when Allan was injured during a fall at a grocery store. Laura Hamlin\n\nThe couple took to life in Spain quickly, and were thrilled to finally be living out their dream.\n\n\u201cOur first few months were exciting,\u201d says Laura. \u201cI had to pinch myself. I couldn\u2019t believe we really did it.\u201d\n\nOnce they\u2019d gotten settled, Laura and Allan made a point of traveling to as many parts of the country as they could.\n\n\u201cWe would do day trips, and we would do weekend trips,\u201d says Allan. \u201cWe went to Granada, we went to Cordoba. We went to Toledo\u2026 We stormed a lot of castles.\u201d\n\nLaura points out that she\u2019s fascinated by Spanish history and loves being able to explore the country\u2019s many historical monuments.\n\n\u201cBeing an American, we\u2019re kind of babies at that,\u201d she adds.\n\nLaura and Allan were having the time of their lives until things took a disastrous turn when Allan tripped in a grocery store, suffering kidney damage and six broken ribs, around four months after they arrived.\n\nAlthough they\u2019d paid for private Spanish medical insurance for a year in advance in accordance with the requirements of their visa, they learned that they weren\u2019t actually covered yet.\n\n\u201cThere is a stipulation that you cannot use it within six or eight months of being in the country,\u201d explains Laura. \u201cThey dropped us and refused to pay for Allan.\u201d\n\nAs a result, they ended spending a chunk of their savings on Allan\u2019s four-week stint in a Spanish hospital.\n\n\u201cI regret that we didn\u2019t read the small print,\u201d Laura adds.\n\nDuring this time, Allan lost a huge amount of weight and was unable to walk.\n\n\u201cAfter enjoying the Spanish hospitals, and no insurance, I decided I better get back to the US,\u201d he adds.\n\nSo just six months after moving to Spain, Laura and Allan were on their way back to the US \u2014 Laura hired a private nurse to help take care of her ailing husband during the journey.\n\n\u201cWe rented a house near my daughter in Spring Hill (north central Florida) and he recuperated there,\u201d she says.\n\nOnce Allan was back on his feet, they hit the road in their campervan once again, traveling to Montana and Glacier National Park.\n\nWhile Laura and Allan intended to go back to Spain as soon as possible, their return was delayed due to various health setbacks.\n\n\u201cSince 2019, I\u2019ve had problems \u2014 feet, neck,\u201d says Allan. \u201cAnd my back, my accidents. So it\u2019s been hard for her (Laura). She\u2019s my angel.\u201d\n\nAlthough they almost gave up on the idea, the couple ultimately decided to try again.\n\n\u201cWe were in assisted living for two months, having moved our stored furniture in, thinking we would stay there,\u201d says Laura. \u201cBut Allan bounced back remarkably.\u201d\n\nLaura and Allan returned to Spain in November 2023, arriving in just enough time to fulfill the amount of time allowed out of the country as part of their visa requirements.\n\n\u201cWe just made it,\u201d says Laura. \u201cThis time around is much better.\u201d\n\nLaura and Allan have been happily living near Cartagena, located in the Murcia region of southeast Spain, since then and plan to remain there for the foreseeable future.\n\nThey say they love the Spanish way of life, as well as the \u201ctravel and the cheap wine.\u201d\n\nAlthough Laura and Allan admit that the Spanish schedule, which sees some businesses close for siesta in the afternoons, was \u201cfrustrating in the beginning,\u201d they stress that they\u2019re \u201cnot bothered by it\u201d now.\n\n\u201cEven in the US, around three o\u2019clock, I would be taking my nap after exercising,\u201d says Allan, before explaining that he\u2019d often go for a morning swim while living in a condo association with a pool in Florida.\n\n\u201cBy three o\u2019clock, I\u2019d be exhausted and I\u2019d be sleeping. So siesting here fits my lifestyle perfectly.\u201d\n\nLaura notes that they sometimes find themselves looking at the clock in the afternoon and realizing that the banks are about to close.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Forget it. We\u2019ll do it tomorrow,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one aspect of life in Spain that they\u2019ve always struggled with \u2014 learning the language.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe couple returned to Spain in 2023 and say that things are going very well so far. Laura Hamlin\n\nLaura and Allan are taking online Spanish classes and using apps \u2014 \u201cthe one with the owl.\u201d\n\nHowever, they confess that their Spanish still leaves much to be desired, and their attempts at attending in person classes haven\u2019t gone so well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s free Spanglish classes at the library every Friday,\u201d says Laura. \u201cWe went to three, but we\u2019re Googling because we don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, the woman that leads the class said, \u2018You don\u2019t know enough Spanish to be here. Just come back when you know more Spanish.\u2019\u201d\n\nMedical insurance was also an issue for the pair in the beginning, particularly due to Allan\u2019s health issues.\n\n\u201cWe overpaid for private insurance because we had to have it, and there\u2019s so many limitations for me,\u201d says Allan.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the coverage, there were four paragraphs of what they cover and four pages of what I\u2019m excluded from.\n\n\u201cNow luckily, I qualify for the Spanish system.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s universal healthcare system, known as the SNS or Sistema Nacional de Salud, is available to residents of the country.\n\n\u201cWhen I go to my local doctor here, he takes his computer, puts his Google Translate up, and we have a fine conversation,\u201d adds Allan.\n\nLaura and Allan have made numerous friends, mainly from the United Kingdom, during their time in the country and say that their social life is actually better now than it was in Florida.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a social butterfly. I hate people,\u201d jokes Allan.\n\nFor the couple, one of the biggest differences they\u2019ve noticed about Spain is that \u201ceverything is smaller, including grocery stores.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also healthier,\u201d says Laura. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have so many processed things to choose from.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a whole aisle of sugar cereals\u2026 There\u2019s certain things that I can\u2019t find, but it\u2019s not a big deal.

Laura Hamlin\n\nLaura and Allan find Spain to be far more affordable than the US, pointing out that they always notice the increase when they return for visits to see their families \u2013 both have children from previous marriages.\n\n\u201cI know that it\u2019s sticker shock when we go home to visit and go in the grocery store\u2026\u201d says Laura.\n\n\u201cI know my family back there, my friends are all worried about it and complaining about the cost of living right now.\n\n\u201cThe cost of housing has escalated tremendously there. So we\u2019re glad to have a more affordable, simple life here.\u201d\n\nThey pay 550 euros a month for their three-bedroom apartment, which has a view of the mountains.\n\n\u201cWe love our landlady,\u201d adds Laura.\n\nWhile things certainly haven\u2019t always gone to plan since their big move, Laura and Allan try to have a relaxed approach, taking any setbacks in their stride for the most part.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there\u2019ll be learning curves and there\u2019ll be problems,\u201d says Allan. \u201cAnd when we take trips, it\u2019s never uneventful.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something that comes up that we have to figure out and deal with, whether it be the SIM card or phone.\u201d\n\nLaura admits that they struggle with the \u201cbureaucracy of things\u201d at times, but notes that she tends to get more nervous \u201cbecause I don\u2019t speak the language.\u201d\n\nThe couple are currently in the process of renewing their non-lucrative visa, which will allow them to remain in Spain for a further two years.\n\nWhen asked if they\u2019d ever return to the US, Laura stresses that she doesn\u2019t envision herself returning to Florida, as she was never happy there.\n\n\u201cIt might have been different if we would have lived in a different area or state,\u201d she concedes, explaining that she enjoyed living in Buffalo, New York. \u201cMy family is still in that area, and I still have friends there.\u201d\n\nHowever, they\u2019ve discussed potentially heading back to Buffalo if Allan\u2019s health were to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cIf it got to the point where he needed to be taken care of \u2013 which I don\u2019t see happening at all, because he\u2019s exercising now and getting much better,\u201d says Laura.\n\n\u201cBut he does sometimes have difficulty walking long distances and stuff like that\u2026 So if he needed care, we\u2019d probably go back.\u201d\n\nWhile she\u2019s hopeful that this won\u2019t be necessary, Laura is keeping an open mind.\n\n\u201cIf someone would have told me I\u2019d be living in Spain six years ago, I would have said they were crazy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you never know what life has in store\u2026 I never say never anymore.\u201d\n\nAs for Allan, he\u2019s happy living anywhere provided his beloved wife is by his side.\n\n\u201cWhile we love the country, I\u2019m very fortunate to have an angel,\u201d says Allan. \u201cI tell people that Laura is the key to my enjoying life no matter where we are.\u201d"

            "full_content": "A Salvadoran government photo of inmates allegedly linked to criminal organizations at CECOT on March 16. Photo: Salvadoran Government/Getty Images/Salvadoran Government via Getty\n\nWhen President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador eagerly volunteered to receive 261 deportees the Trump administration had possibly illegally airlifted from the U.S. in mid-March, he instantly became one of the biggest stars in American conservative politics. After the planes landed, disgorging alleged members of Venezuelan and Salvadoran gangs, Bukele wallpapered his X profile with shout-outs from from Elon Musk, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, Jr., Matt Gaetz, U.S. Senators Mike Lee and Eric Schmitt, and Libs of TikTok, among others. \u201cThank you to El Salvador and, in particular, President Bukele,\u201d President Trump wrote on Truth Social. When Judge James Boasberg ordered the flights carrying the deportees to return home, Bukele posted, \u201cOopsie \u2026 Too late,\u201d followed by the \u201ctears of joy\u201d emoji.\n\nBukele\u2019s social-media blitz was arranged around a slickly produced three-minute video \u2014 basically an extended commercial for his regime. Over pulsing music straight out of a Sicario-style organized-crime thriller, the footage captures the dramatic nighttime arrival of the deportees at a Salvadoran airport. With guards gripping their hair and the backs of their necks, the men are perp-walked down a jetway amid a small army of security personnel in helmets and body armor, then escorted as part of a militarized convoy along jungle-lined highways and through the Olympian front gates of CECOT, the largest maximum-security prison in the world.\n\nOnce they are inside, it becomes apparent how brutal the conditions will be. The new prisoners are forced to kneel inside a massive processing hangar, then ordered to shout their names for the camera before guards shave their heads. They are changed into white uniforms and herded toward a series of 80-person cells, where they will be locked for 23 hours a day, with overhead lights that are never turned off. \u201cThe only furniture is tiered metal bunks with no sheets, pillows, or mattresses,\u201d CNN reported after a visit in February. The response from American conservatives to this Leni Riefenstahl\u2013style display of authoritarian theater was sheer delight. \u201cThis is exactly what I voted for!\u201d wrote Libs of TikTok. Schmitt described the prison as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\nIt was easy to mistake this episode for an example of a Central American leader expediting the inevitable, offering up his country as a dump site for Trump\u2019s deportees before the administration could resort to threats, as it has against Panama and Costa Rica. But that would underestimate how much of an aspirational figure Bukele is for American conservatives, many of whom yearn to implement his authoritarian transformation of El Salvador at home. In fact, in many ways, Bukele\u2019s El Salvador is already here.\n\nFor more than a week, Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder, has been held without charges for participating in pro-Palestine protests while he was a student at Columbia University and, in his only public statement, has described the Louisiana detention center where he was being held as a place where prisoners are \u201cprecluded from the protections of the law.\u201d Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen, was spirited to a series of ICE detention centers where the filthy cells were ice cold and the \u201cfluorescent lights shined on us 24/7,\u201d all because of an apparent visa mix-up. On March 17, masked ICE agents abducted a Georgetown University researcher named Badar Khan Suri, whom the Trump administration claims, without offering evidence, was \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda.\u201d All while the administration openly flouts orders from the judiciary, determining by fiat who is a terrorist or gang member and can therefore be deported and left to rot in a Central American prison. Legal scholars tell the New York Times that it is no longer a question of whether the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis \u2014 rather, whether Trump\u2019s contortion of the constitutional system will be permanent.\n\nIt is worth stressing that none of the hundreds of deportees now in Bukele\u2019s prisons appear to have undergone due process or been charged with any crime. One of them, Jerce Reyes Barrios, is a Venezuelan professional soccer player who was tortured by the Maduro regime in Venezuela, applied for asylum to the U.S., and has no criminal record in either country. This indiscriminate persecution is of a piece with Bukele\u2019s general approach to law and order that has endeared him to the global right. Since he took office in 2019, he has received credit for dramatically curbing his country\u2019s gang problem, especially homicides. Combined with his edgy appeal to young voters \u2014 he has called himself \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d \u2014 he has become the most popular leader in the Americas with a January approval rating of 83 percent, according to a Gallup poll. Bukele\u2019s methods include the mass suspension of civil liberties and the arrest of more than a full percent of El Salvador\u2019s population of 6.8 million \u2014 or more than 80,000 people, including children.\n\nWhen, in 2022, El Salvador\u2019s National Assembly declared a \u201cstate of exception\u201d that allows cops to arrest anyone they deem suspicious and imprison them without due process, it presaged Trump\u2019s invocation of obscure legal codes, like the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to grant himself sweeping powers to jail and deport any non-citizen he wants \u2014 even people who have not been convicted of crimes, from pro-Palestine protesters on college campuses to anyone he claims is a member of Tren de Aragua or MS-13. When Bukele replaced key Supreme Court magistrates with loyalists who would allow him to run for a second term as president, which was not allowed under El Salvador\u2019s Constitution, it anticipated Trump\u2019s defiance of the judiciary, his disregard for democratic processes, and his own musings about running for a third term.\n\nBut it was Bukele\u2019s 2023 opening of CECOT that truly captured the scale of his ambition and cemented his relationship with the American far right. In February, CNN reported that the 40,000-capacity facility, intended as a regional lockup, was open to receiving prisoners from as far away as the U.S. \u2014 a topic that Rubio had met with Bukele to discuss earlier that month. It took almost no time for that concept to reach fruition. \u201cThey were immediately transferred to CECOT,\u201d Bukele wrote on X on March 16 about the Trump deportees. \u201cThe United States will pay a very low fee for them.\u201d He explained that the financial sustainability of the prison, which reportedly costs $200 million a year to operate, will depend in part on payments like the $6 million that Trump is sending, thereby layering an economic incentive for Bukele to fill its beds.\n\nHe also has a political incentive: Once he ran out of gang members to jail, he started rounding up people with only tenuous connections to gang activity to keep his campaign going \u2014 which has ominous implications for Trump\u2019s tough-on-crime-and-immigration agenda back home.\n\nSome of these implications are evident in the work of Bukele\u2019s most ardent acolytes, the right-wing intellectual muses, like Richard Hanania and Christopher Rufo, who lay the conceptual groundwork for what often becomes Republican policy. In a 2023 Substack post, Hanania, a onetime regular on white-supremacist websites like VDare, argued that Bukele\u2019s draconian policies must be imposed on high-crime Black neighborhoods in the U.S. \u201cAs I argue in my articles on El Salvador, any polity that has a high enough murder rate needs to make solving crime its number one priority,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis was true for that nation before Bukele came along, as it is for major American cities today. It\u2019s not a big mystery how to do this, it\u2019s just politically difficult, because literally everything that works is considered racist.\u201d One of the data points he embedded was a screenshot of Elon Musk remarking on the mortal danger that Black people supposedly pose to white people.\n\nIn an X post promoting the article, Hanania stated plainly, \u201cWe need more policing, incarceration, and surveillance of black people. Blacks won\u2019t appreciate it, whites don\u2019t have the stomach for it.\u201d One of the lessons of Trump\u2019s infatuation with Bukele-ism is that, increasingly, they do.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

The wide-ranging legal action covers prize money, the rankings system and schedule, the investigative processes of the ITIA, and name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation, among other areas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some changes, but there are some fundamental changes that are still yet to be made and I really hope that all the governing bodies, including PTPA, will come together and solve these issues,\u201d 24-time grand slam singles champion Djokovic told reporters at the Miami Open on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is a classic lawsuit, so lawyers to lawyers type of situation. So to be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit, and then there are also things that I don\u2019t agree with.\u201d\n\nTwelve players \u2013 including PTPA co-founder Vasek Pospisil and 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios \u2013 are named as plaintiffs in the complaint filed in the US.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s name is not included on the complaint, and he said on Thursday that he has previously been \u201cvery active in tennis politics\u201d but didn\u2019t sign because he \u201cwant(s) other players to step up.\u201d\n\nThe world No. 5 added: \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan and supporter of division in our sport, but I\u2019ve always fought for better representation and influence of and positioning of the players globally in our sport, which I think is still not where it should be and where most of the players think it should be.\n\n\u201c(That\u2019s) not just in terms of prize money, but in terms of many other points that have been also stated in that document.\u201d\n\nIn a news release, the PTPA claimed that the sport\u2019s governing bodies exhibit a \u201cdisregard for players,\u201d which includes forcing them to compete in 100-degree Fahrenheit heat, in matches that finish at 3 a.m., and with different \u201cinjury-inducing\u201d tennis balls. It added that the 11-month-long season allows players little time to recover.\n\nThe PTPA also alleges that the tours \u201ccollude\u201d to cap prize money, prevent new competitors and tournaments from entering the market, impose a \u201cdraconian\u201d ranking points system, and award players no compensation from NIL rights.\n\nThe ATP and WTA both expressed their dissatisfaction with the lawsuits and said that they would defend their positions \u201cvigorously.\u201d The ITIA said that it is aware of the filings, while the ITF said that it would take time to consider an appropriate response.\n\nOn Wednesday, four-time grand slam champion Carlos Alcaraz said that he doesn\u2019t support the PTPA\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn\u2019t aware of it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t support that letter because I wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u201d\n\nDjokovic, winless in his past three singles matches, faces Australian Rinky Hijikata at the Miami Open on Friday, while Alcaraz plays Belgium\u2019s David Goffin."

            "full_content": "Photo: Bonnie Cash/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEvery single time the Trump administration loses a court ruling, count on this: It\u2019ll rail against the evils of a single, unelected district-court judge upending the president\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nThis week, a district judge in D.C. temporarily blocked President Trump\u2019s ban on transgender military troops. \u201cIndefensible judicial tyranny,\u201d White House adviser Stephen Miller responded on social media.\n\nAnother judge put a hold on the deportation of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act (or tried to; the Trump administration was less than fastidious in implementing his order). Trump called for the impeachment of this \u201cRadical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator,\u201d prompting a rare public rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nA string of federal judges paused the efforts of Elon Musk and DOGE to fire federal employees and dismantle government agencies. \u201cWhat is the point of having democratic elections if unelected activist \u2018judges\u2019 can override the clear will of the people? Well, that\u2019s no democracy at all!\u201d Musk asked himself and answered, recirculating a post invoking a \u201cJUDICIAL COUP.\u201d\n\nThe public rhetoric from Trump and his brass has become overwrought, and they seem to be dueling to out-emote one another. But when you strip away the histrionics, they\u2019re not wrong.\n\nThe argument against these \u201cnationwide injunctions\u201d has plenty of commonsense appeal. We have 700 or so presidentially nominated, Senate-confirmed (but unelected) federal district-court (trial-level) judges in all, divided among 94 geographic districts. Why should any one of those judges in, say, the Northern District of California or the Western District of Texas have the power to dictate policy across the entire country, contrary to the priorities of the duly elected president?\n\nTrump is hardly the first president to see his policy agenda stifled by nationwide injunctions \u2014 though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, and he\u2019s gotten it the worst. An April 2024 Harvard Law Review article calculated that federal judges issued six nationwide injunctions against the George W. Bush administration, 12 against the Obama administration (including its signature immigration programs), 14 against the Biden administration (including the student-loan-debt-forgiveness program), and \u2026 64 against the first Trump administration.\n\nOf those 64 original Trump-era injunctions, 59 came from judges appointed by Democrats. Before you start howling (or cheering), consider that all 14 Biden-era injunctions were issued by Republican-appointed judges. Indeed, one criticism of nationwide injunctions is that they encourage and reward judge-shopping. There\u2019s a reason why so many of the anti-Obama and anti-Biden injunctions came from the Northern and Western Districts of Texas, while liberal anti-Trump plaintiffs flock to the federal district courts in D.C., New York, and California.\n\nNow, during Trump\u2019s first two months back in office, district-court judges have already issued more than a dozen nationwide injunctions blocking his policy initiatives. He\u2019s on pace to shatter his own record.\n\nWe can read these stats either way. From one perspective, it looks like judges (almost all of them nominated by Democratic presidents) have engineered a successful judicial Trump resistance where actual elected Democrats have failed. Or the stats could simply reflect that Trump has tried to enact more unlawful policies than his contemporaries did. Could be both.\n\nThe conundrum is that nationwide injunctions are easy to criticize but hard to fix. What\u2019s the alternative? Impressive think pieces abound, often voicing the valid complaint that judges who issue nationwide injunctions effectively bind not only the actual parties to the lawsuit but also many outside non-parties, contrary to core tenets of judicial moderation and fairness.\n\nBut solutions are elusive. If each district court can reach its own independent ruling, binding only on the participants in that case, we would land in chaos.\n\nWhat if, for example, one district judge ordered a pause on the military transgender policy but another allowed the policy to be implemented? What if 11 judges across the country purported to block Trump\u2019s effort to withhold federal funding from USAID but nine others ruled to the contrary? It\u2019s unworkable.\n\nThere might be some way to get these cases up the appellate chain more quickly. That could help expedite resolution of interdistrict conflicts, but it doesn\u2019t fully solve the underlying problem of inconsistent application of law based on geography (and it would require a complicated fix that is plainly not imminent).\n\nThe good news is that we might soon get some guidance from the Supreme Court itself. The dispute over Trump\u2019s effort to end birthright citizenship has now reached the Court, at least in a procedural posture. The Trump administration has asked the Court to narrow a series of three district-court rulings that rejected his position and to hold that those decisions apply only within the geographic districts in which they were rendered (and do not, therefore, bind the entire country). \u201cUniversal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team argues.\n\nWe know how at least one of the nine justices feels. When Samuel Alito found himself on the short end of a recent ruling that effectively blocked the Trump administration\u2019s effort to withhold foreign-aid funding, he fumed in dissent: \u201cDoes a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? \u2026 I am stunned.\u201d\n\nThe birthright-citizenship case may provide us with meaningful answers, but it also neatly underscores the practical problems. Even if one agrees with the Trump administration\u2019s position, how exactly would this work? Children born to noncitizen parents in the Western District of Washington (where a Reagan-appointed judge temporarily halted Trump\u2019s birthright-citizenship initiative) are citizens \u2014 while those born in, say, the Eastern District of Louisiana are not?\n\nIt\u2019s become a default diversionary tactic to rail against nationwide injunctions. Don\u2019t like a ruling? Point to the dictatorial, unelected judge usurping the president\u2019s power. Tiptoe up to the line of open defiance of a court order? Blame some unelected, self-aggrandizing political wannabe in a black robe.\n\nBut when we cut through the hyperbole and the transparent scapegoating, Trump and his supporters are on to a legitimate complaint that has dogged presidents of both parties for decades."

            "full_content": "I grew up in middle-class America as the daughter of a teacher and a school psychologist, that is to parents who were lucky to receive a reasonable salary and excellent insurance and retirement benefits throughout their careers. They saved their money and helped put my sister and me through college and provided some support for me through medical school.\n\nThat\u2019s why I never knew that my parents weren\u2019t ready for retirement until it was obvious they weren\u2019t. The cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid. Even though my family\u2019s story is extremely common, the inability to pay mounting medical bills comes as a surprise to nearly all families, because few of us face the facts of aging until we have to.\n\nThe cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid.\n\nMy mom was the glue that held our family together and kept the household running. But when she started losing her memory around 60, running everything became Dad\u2019s responsibility, and he already had a myriad of his own health problems: diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure. My sister and I were fairly oblivious then to what was happening. I was busy working full time and raising children, and she lived halfway around the world. Like many aging parents, ours insisted that everything was OK, and they did a pretty good job covering up that it wasn\u2019t. But given the speed of Mom\u2019s memory decline and the severity of Dad\u2019s chronic illnesses, they couldn\u2019t cover things up long.\n\nThe author poses with her parents at her 2007 medical school graduation. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nThey needed more care than they could provide each other and more than home health care visits could provide. They began by transitioning to what\u2019s called \u201cindependent living\u201d for my dad and assisted living for my mom. Even though my parents enjoyed comfortable retirement pensions, Social Security and private insurance, their new living arrangement was barely financially feasible, and I was constantly worried about what would happen when they needed a higher level of care.\n\nThis all came to a head about two years later when exacerbations of chronic health problems landed my father in the ICU. His health deteriorated so much with this hospitalization that it became obvious that he could no longer live independently. In fact, he needed so much help that he needed full-time skilled nursing \u2014 a nursing home. And I soon realized that despite my being a physician, there was so much that I didn\u2019t know about nursing homes. I didn\u2019t realize, for example, that my parents\u2019 \u201cgood\u201d private insurance didn\u2019t cover nursing home care. But that\u2019s fine, I thought; Dad\u2019s old enough for Medicare. That\u2019s when I learned Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for nursing homes, either.\n\nThe private pay rate for the nursing home in his \u201clife community,\u201d I learned when I started investigating it, was $13,000 per month! I thought that surely was a mistake or that we had somehow chosen a particularly expensive place. But, no, in 2019 in greater Milwaukee, which has a relatively low cost of living, that price was about average. Some places cost slightly less, and some cost much more, but I, a physician, didn\u2019t find a single place we could afford. We were already paying almost $6,000 per month for my mom\u2019s assisted living. To pay for Dad\u2019s nursing home care on top of that would have cost $200,000 per year, more than my parents ever made when they worked full time. They certainly didn\u2019t have that kind of money saved.\n\nMy sister and I discussed one of us quitting our jobs but realized that even if one of us did, we couldn\u2019t provide Dad the skilled care he needed at home. And neither of us could quit our jobs and still pay all our bills. I, specifically, was in the middle of the classic sandwich generation dilemma. I had a toddler and a child in elementary school. I was trying to pay off medical school loans, pay for child care, pay the mortgage, save for my kids\u2019 college and my own retirement. Everything was untenable. We didn\u2019t understand how people managed these situations.\n\nThe author with her sister and her parents for Christmas 2013. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nAn amazing social worker helped me understand that most non-wealthy Americans spend down their savings and apply for Medicaid. I was floored. My parents were average Americans with decent pensions and modest savings. What need did they have for Medicaid when they had private insurance? How could skilled nursing care cost so much that most people who need it are priced out of it?! That\u2019s when I learned that Medicaid is how the majority of America receives skilled nursing care. At the time, 2019, Medicaid was the primary payer for 59% of nursing home care. As of July 2024, that proportion had risen to 63%.\n\nWhile enrolling my father was extremely complicated, I believe the process ensures that those who apply are truly eligible. What we learned is that almost all of my father\u2019s pension and Social Security benefits went to pay his nursing home. He got to keep $30 per month for personal items. Also, the Medicaid negotiated rate for the nursing home was much lower than the $13,000 a month I\u2019d been quoted. This arrangement was lifesaving for my father and will be lifesaving for my mother if she ever requires this level of care. The families of many elderly Americans may never imagine they\u2019ll need Medicaid \u2014 until they need it.\n\nRepublicans are proposing $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts in programs that fall under the purview of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A cut of that magnitude would almost certainly slash Medicaid. That would be disastrous for the hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans who live in nursing facilities. The Republicans supporting this bill most likely have or will have family members who depend on Medicaid.\n\nIt\u2019s wrong of Congress to take an ax to the floor of the boat keeping so many Americans afloat. Slashing Medicaid would be that kind of heartless move."

            "full_content": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 loss in the presidential race has given rise, again, to whispered worries in the Democratic Party about female candidates and electability \u2014 resurrecting a fraught conversation that bubbled for years after President Donald Trump\u2019s first victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe whisper campaign has started to some extent in New Jersey, where this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race will be one of Democrats\u2019 first big electoral tests since Trump won his second term.\n\nIn the Trump years, some Democratic voters and strategists have worried aloud about whether it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to back female candidates if there are male voters who wouldn\u2019t support them in general elections. It was a theme for parts of the Democratic presidential primaries in 2020, when the party was choosing a candidate to take on Trump.\n\nEven as some are once again questioning women's electability, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the only woman in the crowded New Jersey Democratic primary for governor, has been racking up support in large part because her backers believe she is best positioned to win in November. But Sherrill did acknowledge that broader questions about women\u2019s ability to win persist.\n\n\u201cI hear that from insiders,\u201d Sherrill said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd it\u2019s funny, that\u2019s always been kind of the case,\u201d she added, saying someone at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told her during her first run for the House in 2018 that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t think a woman could win in New Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018What? Watch me,\u2019\u201d Sherrill said. She flipped the longtime Republican seat, winning it by 15 percentage points.\n\nSherrill has touted her electoral wins, along with her background as a Navy helicopter pilot and a prosecutor, as she looks to succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who can\u2019t run for re-election because of term limits.\n\nSome Democrats in New Jersey are anxious about the race after the state shifted 10 points toward Trump in November, compared with 2020, and after Murphy won re-election four years ago by just 3 points. It has also been more than 60 years since the same party has won three consecutive terms for governor.\n\nAlthough Harris still carried New Jersey, her loss nationally has prompted some party officials and voters to raise questions about whether a woman can win this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race, according to four sources connected to New Jersey Democratic politics who described hearing those thoughts in conversations. (Several of Sherrill\u2019s supporters said they haven\u2019t heard those electability questions.)\n\n\u201cHonestly, I have heard: \u2018Ah, I don\u2019t know, maybe women aren\u2019t electable. Maybe there\u2019s an issue here,\u2019\u201d said an official who was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations, noting that the questions began after November and have persisted in the primary for governor.\n\nDemocratic strategist Julie Roginsky said, \"It\u2019s part of the same chatter that has always kept women from ascending in the Democratic Party in New Jersey.\u201d Roginsky, who isn\u2019t involved in the governor\u2019s race, said she has also heard party officials raise the electability questions.\n\n\"This is not a particularly feminist Democratic Party in New Jersey,\u201d Roginsky added later.\n\nMaking her case\n\nSherrill faces five other major candidates in the Democratic primary: Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, former state Senate President Steve Sweeney and former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller, who leads the state\u2019s teachers union.\n\nSherrill has already racked up endorsements from party leaders, and she has won several county party conventions, earning the backing of the local parties\u2019 rank-and-file members. (Fulop has declined to participate in conventions as he runs an anti-establishment campaign, while Gottheimer is skipping conventions where he believes \u201cthe fix is in,\u201d according to the New Jersey Globe.)\n\nSeveral supporters of Sherrill, a veteran of battleground House campaigns, said they are backing her because they view her as the strongest general election candidate.\n\nElectability was \u201cthe most important factor\u201d for Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo Jr.\n\n\u201cI think she is our strongest candidate to win the primary and also the general, which I\u2019m very much concerned about,\u201d DiVincenzo said, noting that former state Assemblyman Jack Ciatarelli is running for governor again after having almost defeated Murphy in 2021.\n\nDiVincenzo and other Sherrill allies pointed to her win in the 11th District in northern New Jersey in 2018 as proof that she can win tough races. GOP Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a scion of a political family who chaired the powerful House Appropriations Committee, had represented the seat for more than two decades before Sherrill launched her campaign. Frelinghuysen announced his retirement several months later.\n\nSherrill went on to defeat GOP Assemblyman Jay Weber, flipping a district Trump had narrowly won in 2016. Sherrill said that in that race and subsequent campaigns she has won over Republicans and independents and built broad coalitions of progressives, union members and disillusioned voters.\n\n\u201cThrough building that huge coalition, I was able to win with the largest red-to-blue swing in the entire nation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that speaks to what I\u2019ve been able to do, who I\u2019ve been able to turn out, the coalitions I\u2019ve been building. I think that is something that people are taking into account as they think about this primary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf this field has never even run against a real Republican challenger,\u201d Sherrill also said, appearing to refer to Fulop\u2019s, Baraka\u2019s and Spiller\u2019s mayoral races.\n\nSweeney defeated a Democrat-turned-Republican incumbent for the state Senate in 2001, but he lost re-election 20 years later to underfunded Republican truck driver Ed Durr, who is also running for governor this year.\n\nGottheimer does have experience winning in Republican territory, having defeated GOP Rep. Scott Garrett in 2016 in his 5th District even as Trump narrowly carried the seat.\n\nBut Sherrill\u2019s allies believe her victories stand out.\n\nEMILY\u2019s List, which backs female candidates who support abortion rights and has endorsed Sherrill, detailed in a memo this month how Sherrill has earned more votes than her New Jersey Democratic colleagues and run ahead of candidates for higher office.\n\n\u201cIn any crowded primary, it\u2019s really important to show that strength,\u201d said EMILY\u2019s List President Jessica Mackler, who said questions about electability typically come from \u201cpundits and the media.\u201d\n\nSherrill believes her record in office will also win over primary voters, even as \u201cinsiders\u201d question female candidates\u2019 electability.\n\n\u201cI certainly think that insiders are always making these calculations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I think what people on the ground, what voters, care about is: Are you somebody that they trust? Are you somebody that can really deliver for them?\u201d Sherrill said before she referred to a designation she received from the Center for Effective Lawmaking. \u201cAnd after being named the most effective lawmaker in the New Jersey House delegation after only my second term in Congress, I think people see that I deliver.\u201d\n\nStill an \u2018all-boys club\u2019?\n\nSome New Jersey Democrats say the electability doubts following Harris\u2019 loss underscore a broader challenge for female candidates in the state.\n\nDemocrats have nominated a woman for governor only once, backing then-state Senate Sen. Barbara Buono to take on GOP Gov. Chris Christie in 2013. (New Jersey has had one female governor, Republican Christie Whitman, who served from 1994 to 2001.)\n\n\u201cWe knew they weren\u2019t going to let us into the all-boys club, so we just decided we\u2019ve got to kick in the door,\u201d Buono said after her bruising loss to Christie.\n\nLeslie Huhn, a former Sussex County Democratic Committee chairwoman, said that there has been more support for women in the years since then but that \u201cthere\u2019s still more work to be done in this area, no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nHuhn, who runs the grassroots group Door to Door Democracy, which is backing Sherrill, has also heard electability questions from party insiders, but not from the grassroots. But Huhn isn\u2019t concerned that the \u201call-boys club\u201d will be an obstacle for Sherrill, saying plenty of men are also drawn to Sherrill\u2019s military background.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not worried that she\u2019s not tough, because they know she\u2019s tough. They know she\u2019s strong,\u201d said Huhn, who also said Sherrill has a unique ability to also be \u201cwarm and relatable.\u201d\n\nSherrill is ready for a fight.\n\n\u201cWorking in the military or working in New Jersey politics, these are some intense people, and they\u2019re not afraid to throw punches here,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cThe lessons you learn are just taking it on. Don\u2019t shrink from it; don\u2019t back away. If somebody wants to test you, meet the test and engage.\u201d\n\nBut does Sherrill still see the state as the \u201call-boys club\u201d that Buono described?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing. ... It is really rough and tumble. But I guess, I\u2019ve been through a POW training camp in the Navy. I\u2019m used to rough and tumble,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Downers Grove, Illinois CNN \u2014\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have faced eruptions of anger at town hall meetings across the country this week, as constituents have coupled their fury over President Donald Trump\u2019s actions with deep frustration over what they see as a feckless Democratic response.\n\nArizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego were told to \u201cfight dirtier\u201d and \u201cget in the mud\u201d with Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority,\u201d a man told Maryland Rep. Glenn Ivey.\n\n\u201cThey should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party,\u201d an attendee groused to CNN at a town hall held by Illinois Rep. Sean Casten.\n\nThe sharp criticism from voters comes as Democrats are out of power across all levels of the federal government and lacking a clear leader, exposing deep divisions along ideological and tactical lines over the party\u2019s direction. The schism emerging within the party on the heels of a contentious government funding fight has prevented the caucus from uniting behind a single strategy to counter Trump and attempt to make political inroads ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThe tension between Democratic lawmakers and their voters spilled into public view days after the Republican-led House and Senate narrowly averted a shutdown by approving a short-term government spending measure \u2014 with the help of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others in his caucus who cleared a pathway for the bill.\n\nEager to avoid embarrassment as Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk slash federal spending and remake the federal government, Republican leaders told the party\u2019s House members not to hold town hall meetings during this week\u2019s congressional recess.\n\nMost Republicans heeded those calls. Those who didn\u2019t \u2014 Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood and Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman, among them \u2014 faced heckling and pointed questions, including some from Republican voters, at their events.\n\nFlood was asked how he \u201cpersonally stomachs\u201d limiting funding for medical research after his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nCarol Moseman, a Republican who voted for Flood, told CNN she doesn\u2019t want Congress to give up its role as a check on the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI want to hear that he and other Republicans are going to stand up for democracy that they\u2019re not going to let Mr. Trump take over using executive powers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe voted for Congress to enact laws, and that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nHageman faced concerns in her deep-red district over federal spending cuts and frozen grants. Kindergarten teacher Tomi Sue Wille said she supports Trump\u2019s push to dismantle the Department of Education but worries that crucial federal funding for special needs children won\u2019t reach her students.\n\n\u201cI do believe that Congress needs to take some control in making sure how that funding is still distributed to the states,\u201d Wille told CNN.\n\nAt another town hall, a voter who identified herself as a retired military officer and Republican, pressed Hageman on allegations of fraud in the government in a tense exchange.\n\n\u201cYou are a lawyer, where is this fraud?\u201d the voter asked Hageman, according to CSPAN video of the town hall. The voter added: \u201cWhat company, what organization, what personnel are we going after?\u201d\n\nHageman pointed to spending by the US Agency for International Development \u2013 which the Trump administration and DOGE are attempting to dismantle \u2013 as the fraud. \u201cThis is what it is. This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud, spending is the fraud,\u201d Hageman asserted, to the dissatisfaction of the constituent and other attendees, who repeatedly interrupted her as she attempted to cite numbers.\n\nA federal worker and Republican in Wyoming, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, said GOP rhetoric about federal employees has been a let-down \u2014 including Musk\u2019s \u201cfork in the road\u201d email offering months of severance pay, which the worker described as \u201ca little off-putting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re all parasites\u201d the federal worker told CNN. \u201cI try not to take it too personally. I know what I do. I know how committed I am.\u201d\n\nGoing into the week, Democrats took most Republicans retreating from public view as an invitation to meet with their constituents and drive a forceful argument about how Republicans\u2019 government funding plan would slash spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nBut the anger that greeted Democrats at their own town halls left them returning to Washington next week without appearing to have gained great political momentum during their time at home \u2013 instead offering a vivid window into the party\u2019s struggles during the first two months of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low of just 29%, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month found \u2014 an outcome fueled in part by dimming views from its own frustrated supporters.\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-aligned independents say, 57% to 42%, that the party should mainly work to stop the Republican agenda, rather than working with the GOP majority to get some Democratic ideas into legislation.\n\nBranding it a \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has aimed to galvanize those looking for some form of political action with rallies across the country. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow progressive, joined the swing through competitive Western states Thursday \u2013 but, underscoring the party\u2019s divide, that answer to Democratic voters\u2019 demands for action drew public criticism from some corners of the party.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, at an event in Las Vegas, Nevada, said Trump has \u201chanded the keys to Elon Musk and is selling this country for parts to the richest people on the planet for a kickback.\u201d But she also had sharp words for her own party.\n\n\u201cWe need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cBut what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\u201d\n\n\u2018What is the plan?\u2019\n\nAt the town hall meetings, attendees who voted for Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election, said they felt let down by the party\u2019s failure to show it\u2019s up to the task of matching their furor and responding with force.\n\nIn Scottsdale, Arizona, when Kelly and Gallego argued at a joint event Monday that there was a path to convince Republicans to preserve Medicaid, Jacie Czerwinski had heard enough.\n\n\u201cWhen are they going to take the gloves off and actually do something,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cThey\u2019re preaching to the choir.\u201d\n\nCzerwinski, a Democrat who owns a rock-climbing gym in the area, had called Kelly\u2019s office multiple times since the start of the Trump administration. And when Kelly told the audience to leave voicemails to senators as a way to make their voices heard, she shouted: \u201cYours is full!\u201d\n\nThe swing state\u2019s two Democratic senators ducked an attendee\u2019s shouted question about whether they support removing Schumer from his leadership post after his public support for the spending measure last week. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on this right now,\u201d Gallego said, noting the town hall was billed as one focused on what Democrats characterize as a Republican push to cut Medicaid spending.\n\nQuianna Brown, who said her 10-year-old daughter\u2019s Medicaid coverage is at risk now that she is no longer in the foster system, pushed back on the senators who described cuts to Medicaid as yet to be determined.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do? We feel incredibly powerless trying to plan for our family. We can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s done. We need to know how to prepare what may come down the hatch. We are trying to shield ourselves before we\u2019re wounded, and we don\u2019t know how,\u201d Brown said.\n\nKelly described Brown\u2019s story as \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d and asked for her name in order to share it with Republicans in Washington. Gallego said Democrats \u201cwould all love to be able to snap our fingers right now and have that solution, but it\u2019s not going to happen that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to fight them down. We have to grind them to the point where they give up on this fight. Because if you give an inch, they will take it all,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the event, Brown told CNN she appreciated the senators hearing her out but wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cI wanted more. I think as a parent at any time when you feel that you can\u2019t protect your kid, you want a game plan. Like what is the plan?\u201d she said.\n\nThe senators, she told CNN following the event, were being \u201ctoo business as usual.\u201d\n\nJefri Knazan, who had taught in Canada but returned to the United States for family reasons and is currently on Medicaid, was so frustrated by how the senators answered Brown that she changed her question to push them to \u201cbe straight with us\u201d on how to take the fight \u201cto the next level.\u201d\n\nMultiple attendees took their blunt assessments even further in conversations with CNN, saying the party lacks a clear leader and an effective message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think showing up with hand fans at a speech does much,\u201d said retired Navy veteran Tom Dyson, referring to signs Democratic lawmakers held up during Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month. \u201cI think you have to take action. I think you have to speak out.\u201d\n\nFor retiree Donald Bandy, frustration with the Democratic Party is an \u201cunderstatement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t seem to be organized. We don\u2019t have a coalition. We don\u2019t have any power. Republicans control everything and everyone\u2019s afraid of Trump. It\u2019s what he says goes,\u201d Bandy said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'You are not fighting!': Voters demand answers at Democratic lawmaker town hall 01:11 - Source: CNN 'You are not fighting!': Voters demand answers at Democratic lawmaker town hall 01:11\n\n\u2018We need you to be less polite\u2019\n\nAt a town hall for Ivey, the second-term Democratic congressman, held in Forestville, Maryland, attendees lambasted the role Democrats, particularly Schumer, played in helping congressional Republicans approve the continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThe message that was sent by Democrats in Congress with the CR catastrophe was clear,\u201d a man who identified himself as John told Ivey. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you are in the minority, it\u2019s that you aren\u2019t even working together on a shared strategy. And that is failure.\u201d\n\nIvey listened as the man continued, raising his voice.\n\n\u201cWe are not interested in hearing that you are in the minority \u2013 we know that!\u201d John yelled into the mic. \u201cWe want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority. We want you to show fight and you are not fighting!\u201d\n\nAnother constituent, Donya Williams, complained Ivey didn\u2019t know the people in his district well enough \u2014 because he admitted earlier that he didn\u2019t know who popular podcaster Joe Rogan was until the middle of the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about a podcast, and as a Democratic (lawmaker) who\u2019s representing all of these people, you don\u2019t know how to reach them,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo therefore, you don\u2019t know us.\u201d\n\nIvey countered that he and other members of Congress are trying to do more to connect with younger voters on social media. \u201cThe key is to make sure that we turn to each other and not on each other in doing the outreach,\u201d he said.\n\nIvey kept his composure throughout the evening, drawing a compliment from one woman. But then she, too, turned critical: \u201cWe need you to be less polite.\u201d\n\n\u2018Be the opposition party\u2019\n\nIn the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove, attendees at Casten\u2019s town hall Wednesday night were largely complimentary of the congressman\u2019s opposition to Trump. But, they told CNN before the town hall got underway, they were furious with Sen. Dick Durbin\u2019s vote to advance the spending measure last week.\n\n\u201cDick Durbin needs to be primaried in two years,\u201d said Ben Holinga, a 43-year-old salesman and Democratic voter from nearby Willowbrook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very upset with how Democrats in the Senate handled the continuing resolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party.\u201d\n\nRick Lunt, a 68-year-old retiree and Democratic voter from Palos Hills, said he is happy with Casten and \u201cwanted to be here to show him support.\u201d But he said he\u2019d like to see Democrats take more measures to show their opposition to Trump, even if they are purely symbolic.\n\nDemocrats could, he said, \u201cpropose a resolution of impeachment or something\u201d to remove Trump from office \u2013 acknowledging that \u201csometimes just a symbolic effort, movement on that part, is enough to inspire the rest of us.\u201d\n\nCasten\u2019s town hall was repeatedly interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters \u2014 with one protester who declined to share his name with CNN climbing on stage and refusing to leave.\n\nChants of \u201cCasten\u201d and \u201cleave, leave, leave\u201d rang through the room as some sought to drown out the protests, but after more than 45 minutes of interruptions, local police asked the congressman to end his event.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of what you\u2019re doing is that the good people in this room are going to decide not to come to town halls anymore,\u201d Casten told protesters, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not productive.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy and Danny Freeman contributed to this report."

But they also had some strong words for their own party.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told the fired-up crowd gathered at the Craig Ranch Amphitheater to see her and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \u201cBut what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\u201d\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez did not mention any Democratic leaders by name, the crowd broke out into multiple \u201cPrimary Chuck\u201d chants \u2014 a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who backed down from a funding fight with Trump last week. The move enraged the base and prompted some of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s House colleagues to encourage her to mount a primary challenge to Schumer, her fellow New Yorker, in 2028.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., greet the crowd during a rally at Craig Ranch Regional Park in North Las Vegas on Thursday. K.M. Cannon / Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNS via Getty Images\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Sanders \u2014 stars on the left who are channeling a fighting spirit at a time when Democrats say that\u2019s what they want to see more of \u2014 are looking to turn the party\u2019s anger into action and mobilize voters in the fight against Trump and his MAGA movement.\n\n\u201cI think unfortunately, the conservatives are playing a really good game of chess, and now it\u2019s time for the Dems to go ahead and step up to the plate and figure out how we\u2019re going to go ahead and take our democracy back,\u201d said Samantha Petras, a resident of Phoenix who attended the pair's second event of the day, in Tempe, Ariz.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez made a direct appeal Thursday to working-class voters \u2014 a populist message they hope will particularly resonate in a battleground state like Nevada, which is home to one of the largest hospitality workers unions in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have two very different Americas. In one of those Americas, the wealthiest people have never, ever, in the history of our country, had it so good. People on top are doing extraordinarily well today,\u201d Sanders said, prompting boos from the crowd. \u201cWe have more income and wealth inequality in our country than we have ever had.\u201d\n\nDemocrats plan to hold nearly 30 town hall events this week, while Republican lawmakers continue to largely stay away from in-person constituent events because of voter backlash over Trump and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s sweeping cuts to the federal government. Democratic lawmakers, though, are also hearing an earful from constituents who want their elected officials to stand up to Trump more aggressively.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez expect more than 51,000 people to turn out for their events this week, which will also include stops in Denver and Greeley, Colo., and Tucson, according to Sanders\u2019 office. Sanders, 83, launched his \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour last month with a pair of events in Iowa and Nebraska in a bid to target Republican voters dissatisfied with Trump and Musk.\n\nSanders planned the events in districts narrowly won by Republicans in 2024 to pressure lawmakers to vote against any cuts to entitlement programs, housing, nutrition or education, his office said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez acknowledged that not everyone in the crowd may agree with all of her politics or may not have even voted in the last election, but she encouraged the crowd to unite around an agenda that puts working-class voters first.\n\n\u201cWe might all come from different places, but we share a lot of the same experiences. So to all those who came here today unsure of whether or not this is where you belong, I want to say that you do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do, no matter who you voted for, no matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender, identity or status, no matter, even, if you disagree with me on a bunch of things. But if you are willing to fight for someone you don\u2019t know, you are welcome here, regardless of who they are, how they identify or where they come from \u2014 you are welcome here.\u201d\n\nEven as Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders tried to broaden their appeal beyond the typical base, plenty of criticism was aimed squarely at Trump.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept an authoritarian form of society with a president who undermines the Constitution every day and is working aggressively to take away our freedom of speech and freedom of assembly,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNo, we will not accept the society of massive economic inequalities where the very rich are becoming much richer while working families across the country struggle to put food on the table.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Party is struggling to find its footing amid historically low approval numbers and a voter base that wants its leaders to put up a fight against Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Democrats say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if it risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, compared with 32% who want them to make legislative compromises with Trump, according to NBC News\u2019 most recent poll.\n\nThe polling mirrors backlash Democratic lawmakers have received at their own town hall events, where voters this week complained about the party\u2019s \u201cpassive\u201d response to Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, empowerment of Musk and cuts to the federal workforce.\n\nThe frustration among Democratic voters and lawmakers alike intensified last week after Schumer led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, even as House Democrats warned the measure would codify spending cuts Trump pushed for.\n\nOcasio-Cortez skewered Schumer last week for his support of the Republican-led funding measure, calling it a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and suggesting it could weaken the \u201ctrust\u201d between House and Senate Democrats.\n\nDemocratic voters, too, said they were dismayed by Schumer's approach.\n\n\u201cWe should have shut the government down,\u201d 55-year-old Marc Borzcon of Chandler, Ariz. said on Thursday at the event in Tempe. \u201cI have no doubt in my mind that that was the proper thing to do under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speak, Borzcon encouraged Democrats to \"fight a little lower.\"\n\n\"I think we've seen the other side continuously break the rules and thumb their nose at the rules. So at some point you got to say, 'Hey, we don't play by the rules either,'\" he said.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nThere is also speculation she could mount a run for president, though her team insists she isn\u2019t thinking about her own political future at the moment.\n\nBut the crowd in Las Vegas certainly is: \u201cAOC 2028\u201d pins were being sold at a merchandise stand outside the venue.\n\nMelanie Zanona reported from Las Vegas, Nnamdi Egwuonwu from Tempe, Ariz., and Brennan Leach from Washington, D.C."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, Shannon Pettypiece breaks down another roller-coaster day for President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans. Plus, Jonathan Allen explains that speed has proven to be Trump\u2019s ally in his efforts to slash the government.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nTrump's on-again, off-again tariffs are partly off again\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday issued exemptions on tariffs for some goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, two days after putting in place sweeping 25% tariffs that rattled stock markets, as businesses warned the move would increase prices for consumers, NBC News\u2019 Shannon Pettypiece reports.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in less than two months that Trump has announced and then backtracked on tariffs on the United States\u2019 neighbors. But the exemption comes with an expiration date, just like Wednesday\u2019s exemption for automakers, continuing to rattle the stock market and a wide range of industries.\n\n\u201cThe can keeps getting pushed, kicked down the road, and we don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d said Chuck Dardas, president of AlphaUSA, an auto parts manufacturer in Livonia, Michigan.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News\u2019 Christine Romans, he later added: \u201cTo make investments and to do things we need to do, we need some certainty. Not that we can have perfect certainty \u2014 but not be on a constant diet of, well, we\u2019ll wait till next month to see if the ax is going to fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing, I guess, to be certain is that we\u2019ve got 30 more days to worry about it,\u201d Dardas said.\n\nThe new exemption Trump signed on Thursday would apply to goods compliant with the North American free trade agreement reached during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and will last until April 2, when Trump plans another round of retaliatory tariffs on goods from a range of countries.\n\nAbout half of goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico would fall under the exemption, and around 38% of goods from Canada would qualify, said a senior administration official. That includes potash, which is used in fertilizers.\n\nBut some Canadian energy products won\u2019t qualify and will be subject to a 10% tariff. And all other goods, including computers from Mexico, will be subject to the 25% tariff, the senior administration official said.\n\nRead more: Stocks fall as markets grapple with Trump\u2019s rapid shifts in tariff policy, by Rob Wile\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump\u2019s biggest advantage in his bid to slash the government: Speed\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nSpeed kills. Especially when it comes to slashing government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has run into a few snags in his rush to slay the bureaucracy, including having to reverse some of his own decisions to summarily fire federal workers and watching courts intervene.\n\nBut Trump learned a valuable strategic lesson from his first term: The executive can move faster than the other branches of government. In less than seven weeks, Congress has become a bystander branch as Trump hacks up departments, agencies, programs and workforces that lawmakers created and funded.\n\nFederal judges have noted that the Trump administration is ignoring orders to stop various aspects of its downsizing campaign. It remains to be seen whether he will listen to the Supreme Court. Some of his supporters are arguing that he should tell the justices to pound sand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why President Trump can\u2019t defy the Supreme Court & refuse to send the money,\u201d Amy Kremer, an activist who helped organize Trump\u2019s Jan. 6, 2021, rally, wrote on X Wednesday after the high court ruled against the president\u2019s freeze of $2 billion in foreign aid. \u201cHe is doing the work of the American people & trying to save our tax dollars from being abused & wasted. He has presidential immunity.\u201d\n\nBut for the intended recipients, the money dried up weeks ago. It\u2019s hard to imagine that even if the spigot is turned back on, there will have been no harm to the beneficiaries. Likewise, whether Trump can legally fire hundreds of thousands of federal workers \u2014 as he has done \u2014 there is zero chance that any court order will restore them all. The same goes for domestic-program grants halted by the Trump White House.\n\nJudges and lawmakers spend a lot of their time theorizing about the balance of power. Trump is wasting no time in turning it toward him.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udde3 Address aftermath: The Republican-controlled House voted to censure Rep.

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nAbout a year ago, the whole political world was focused on polls to determine whether Joe Biden\u2019s feisty March 7 State of the Union Address would improve his fragile public standing. As it turns out, it didn\u2019t, since he got virtually no \u201cbounce\u201d in the polls despite a performance that got rave reviews from Democrats and grudging appreciation from others.\n\nNow, to be clear, Donald Trump isn\u2019t in the same position today, since he has (unless there is a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat) run his last race. But given the recklessness of his early second-term steps and the less-than-secure hold his party has on the U.S. House of Representatives, public support for his agenda still matters. (It seems to even matter to Trump himself, given how often he cites made-up or outlier polling data in his speeches.) So how is the public reacting to his big speech to Congress Tuesday night?\n\nWe don\u2019t have much post-speech polling to look at just yet, but what we do have doesn\u2019t indicate much of an impact. The one post-speech approval-rating poll, from Rasmussen Reports, showed his ratio moving from 50 percent positive and 48 percent negative on March 4 to 51-49 percent on March 5, but then back down to 50-48 percent on March 6 for no net gain.\n\nTrump fans were very enthused by two \u201csnap\u201d polls conducted immediately after the speech showing 69 percent (CNN) and 76 percent (CBS) of those who watched the address approving as opposed to 31 percent (CNN) and 23 percent (CBS) disapproving. But the usual \u201cskew\u201d of presidential speech viewers toward the chief executive\u2019s fans was pretty extreme in this case: 44 percent of CNN\u2019s poll respondents were Republicans and only 21 percent were Democrats, and 51 percent of CBS\u2019 speech-watchers were Republicans as opposed to 20 percent who were Democrats. It\u2019s very likely that the self-identified independents responding to these polls were heavily Republican-leaning.\n\nIn other words, and unsurprisingly, the polarization of presidential speech-watchers has intensified this year, with Democrats largely tuning out and Trump mostly preaching to the choir. Since Trump pretty much recapitulated the tone and substance of his 2024 campaign speeches, and offered almost nothing in the way of new policy proposals, it stands to reason that the event won\u2019t change much of anything politically. Nor will anyone long remember the scattered Democratic protests on which Republicans shed so many crocodile tears in the immediate wake of the speech, as though Trump himself exhibited \u201cdecorum\u201d and \u201ccivility\u201d which protesters spoiled. That joint session of Congress he addressed is probably best understood as the last MAGA rally of the 2024 campaign cycle, unless he chooses to keep holding them until the day he leaves office, which is entirely possible."

            "full_content": "Photo: The Tucker Carlson Show\n\nIn the days following FTX\u2019s dramatic exposure as a billion-dollar fraud in 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, considered a pivot away from the Democratic Party, to which he gave so much money. During his trial, prosecutors revealed a note in which Bankman-Fried reminded himself to \u201cgo on Tucker Carlsen [sic], come out as a republican.\u201d\n\nIn his PR disaster for the ages, the linkup with Tucker Carlson never happened. But more than two years later, sitting in the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the convicted fraudster serving 25 years finally had the time to give that interview \u2014 in which the ex\u2013Fox News host mostly wanted to gossip about the more famous detainee on Bankman-Fried\u2019s unit.\n\n\u201cAre you hanging with Diddy? I think he\u2019s in there with you,\u201d Carlson asked of the rapper charged with sex trafficking. \u201cHe\u2019s been kind to me,\u201d Bankman-Fried said of his new friend.\n\n\u201cIf someone told me three years ago that, Oh, you\u2019d be hanging out with Diddy every day, I\u2019d be like, That\u2019s interesting; I wonder how that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Bankman-Fried mused. \u201cI guess he gets into crypto or something.\u201d\n\nJUST IN: Sam Bankman-Fried says he shares a prison unit with Diddy.\n\n\n\n\"He's been kind to me.\" pic.twitter.com/OxiLZRriqn \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 6, 2025\n\nCarlson, who hasn\u2019t always been so nice to Bankman-Fried, then asked why none of the Democrats who received FTX donations came to his aid during his legal ordeal. Bankman-Fried said that around the time his company was exposed, he was starting to flirt more with the Republican Party \u2014 which he asserted \u201cprobably played a role\u201d in the government\u2019s prosecution of him.\n\nPerhaps Bankman-Fried had forgotten how he was convicted for a smorgasbord of fraud, including using customer deposits to cover his massive trading losses at his investment firm. But his comments suggest he is bummed to be locked up during a golden age of regulators not giving a hoot about crypto anymore. He criticized former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, calling him a \u201cpolitically ambitious\u201d partisan who \u201cwanted his agency to get more power even if he didn\u2019t want to do anything with it except block industries.\u201d With Gensler out at the SEC and regulators dropping high-profile cases against Bankman-Fried\u2019s un-incarcerated peers, he said that \u201cthere are a lot of good things\u201d that President Donald Trump is doing to end the government\u2019s \u201cobstructive role for a decade\u201d on crypto. Alas, he is missing out on the unregulated fun.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that we may be hearing more from Bankeman-Fried. The New York Times reports that his parents \u2014 who once called themselves his \u201cpartner in crime of the non-criminal sort\u201d \u2014 are leading a push to get Trump to pardon their son. His parents, who made millions off FTX, have reached out to a lawyer on Trump\u2019s 2016 and 2020 campaigns and have placed opinion pieces in the Washington Post suggesting Trump\u2019s ideas aren\u2019t all that bad. So far though, the plan has resulted in restrictions on his freedom. The Bureau of Prisons has clear rules about how prisoners can communicate with the outside world \u2014 rules that do not include going on video podcasts with influential hosts. After the interview with Carlson went online, Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement."

            "full_content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 When Andrew and Tristan Tate touched down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last week, the two social media figures \u2014 who had been charged with human trafficking in Romania \u2014 found some support in right-wing circles for their return home.\n\nBut one of their most prominent critics has been a conservative: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who immediately said the brothers were not welcome in the state. State Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is the governor\u2019s former chief of staff and close political adviser, said the state would open a criminal investigation into the men, although he did not outline specific allegations.\n\nAndrew Tate announced Thursday that he was leaving Florida \u2014 saying he\u2019d be back \u201cin a few years\u201d \u2014 which likely ends any potential investigation. (His brother also posted a picture from a plane.) But the political impact on DeSantis\u2019 future might last longer.\n\nDeSantis\u2019 decision to antagonize some on the right by going hard after the Tate brothers puts him at odds with elements of the MAGA movement \u2014 including some allies of the president \u2014 who are still upset with him for challenging Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nDeSantis said he didn't want the Tate brothers in Florida. Rebecca Blackwell / AP file\n\nTrump himself has avoided talking about the return of the Tate brothers or the Florida investigation into them, but the issue has put DeSantis and Uthmeier at the center of a fight on the political right over whether the men, who hold dual U.S.-British citizenship, were being unfairly targeted since there have not been any criminal allegations against them in Florida, or if the Florida effort was squarely in line with conservative values to investigate two men accused of abusing women and girls.\n\nThe White House did not return a request seeking comment, but a Trump adviser brushed off the Tate issue, suggesting the investigation was just DeSantis\u2019 attempt to remain politically \u201crelevant\u201d after his failed presidential run against Trump.\n\nThe Trump orbit in the past has expressed support for the Tate brothers.\n\nAndrew Tate and Donald Trump Jr. appeared in a discussion on X last summer focused on Hunter Biden\u2019s legal problems.\n\nTrump Jr. called Tate \u201cbuddy,\u201d and Tate called him \u201cfriend.\u201d During the event, Trump Jr. said that Tate was being unfairly attacked.\n\n\u201cYou have people attacking you as far as I\u2019m concerned. \u2026 They just want to silence you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have entered the arena by speaking out.\u201d\n\nAlina Habba, a counselor to the president, said in January during an interview with Andrew Tate that she was a \u201cbig fan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think your anger is the same that President Trump has for our country. And the time is now for us to stop being wimps,\u201d she said to Tate. \u201cI also have to say that I sympathize with you because I think you go through a lot of the same \u2018show me the person, I\u2019ll find the crime\u2019 that President Trump has gone through.\u201d\n\nBeyond the legal fight, the issue brought on renewed layers of political intrigue since the Tates arrived in Florida.\n\nRic Grenell, the Trump administration\u2019s presidential envoy for special missions, reposted an X post from Andrew Tate that accused DeSantis of attacking him because he \u201cwas worried\u201d that Tate would support Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., in the Florida 2026 gubernatorial race. DeSantis has a notoriously icy relationship with Donalds, who has been endorsed by Trump, while his wife, Casey DeSantis, is considering her own run for governor against Donalds.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, I had no interest in Florida politics until I learnt how communist the DeSantis admin is,\u201d Tate said in the post elevated by Grenell. \u201cThe game is on.\u201d\n\nOver the past week, DeSantis supporters have pressured Donalds to comment on the Tate issue. On Wednesday, he did, siding with DeSantis\u2019 position and against the Tates.\n\n\u201cI think those allegations have to be fully investigated, and that we go from there,\u201d Donalds told CBC News. \u201cThe key thing is, we don\u2019t tolerate the trafficking of women, or frankly, the abuse of women. We do not tolerate that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the attorney general finds cause under Florida law to investigate that, then I wish him the best, and I support whatever he\u2019s going to do on the matter,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Tate brothers, both former kickboxers, rose to fame as leaders of the \u201cmanosphere\u201d movement, a misogynistic culture that elevates men and works to push back against feminism. They have built significant wealth and an intense international following advocating for those positions.\n\nIn 2017, Andrew Tate tweeted that women should \u201cbare some responsibility\u201d for being sexually assaulted.\n\nThe office of Uthmeier, the DeSantis-appointed state attorney general, said it has executed search warrants against the brothers and was pushing forward with its investigation.\n\n\u201cThese guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying on women around the world, many of these victims coming forward, some of them minors,\u201d Uthmeier said Wednesday. \u201cPeople can spin or defend however they want, but in Florida this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious.\u201d\n\nUthmeier\u2019s office did not return a request for comment on the status of the investigation now that Andrew Tate has said he left the state.\n\nAndrew and Tristan Tate arrive at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Feb. 27. Alon Skuy / Getty Images\n\nAndrew Tate, the more prominent of the brothers, used his X account, which has 10.7 million followers, and friendly podcasts to aggressively push back against the Florida investigation, framing himself as being unfairly targeted.\n\nIn one post, Tate likened DeSantis and Uthmeier to Lavrentiy Beria, one of the secret police chiefs of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with right-wing podcaster Candace Owens, Andrew Tate said that he has had \u201call his phones and laptops seized,\u201d an assertion that the Florida attorney general\u2019s office has not confirmed.\n\nLast week, Joseph McBride, the brothers\u2019 U.S.-based attorney, said the two men planned to return to Romania at the end of March to meet with prosecutors, with plans to eventually come back to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the President,\u201d McBride said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, they are excited to call America their home again.\u201d\n\nAndrew Tate did not say where they were heading in his X post, and McBride did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nIt remains unclear how or why Romania relaxed travel restrictions imposed on the Tate brothers after their arrests in 2022. Romania officials have denied any outside influence, including from the Trump administration, even as they have offered no explanation.\n\n\u201cI have no knowledge of any pressure,\u201d Justice Minister Radu Marinescu told Public Record. \u201cAuthorities from other states have made no official request.\u201d"

Frank is widely believed to have been falsely accused and unjustly convicted. His case led to the formation of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nLeo Frank raped & murdered a 13-year-old girl.\n\n\n\nHe also tried to frame a black man for his crime.\n\n\n\nThe ADL is despicable. https://t.co/BGfjjxxAUh \u2014 Kingsley Wilson (@KingsleyCortes) March 11, 2023\n\n\u201cWhite supremacists and other antisemites have long used conspiracy theories about the Leo Frank case to cast doubt on the circumstances of the antisemitic lynching of Leo Frank,\u201d the ADL wrote in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply disturbed that any public official would parrot these hateful and false conspiracy theories, and we hope Kingsley Wilson will immediately retract her remarks.\u201d\n\nWilson also has expressed opposition to U.S. military intervention abroad, posting days after the war in Gaza started, \u201cMy future children will not die in foreign ethnic conflicts a world away.\u201d In July, she called NATO \u201cnothing more than an international HR department.\u201d\n\nShe specifically opposed American military support for Israel. At the end of 2024, Wilson wrote, \"Why is the U.S. military defending Israel & Ukraine\u2019s border but not our own?\", and in 2023, replied to an X post by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett: \u201cFight your own wars. America First.\u201d\n\nWilson and the Defense Department did not immediately reply to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment on Wilson\u2019s past posts, or whether they represent the views of the Pentagon.\n\nWilson has also railed against U.S. funding for Ukraine, describing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an \u201centitled midget,\u201d and asking, \u201cWhy should American taxpayers help defend Ukraine?\u201d She has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling his \u201cencyclopedic knowledge of his people\u2019s history beyond impressive.\u201d\n\nOn her X account, Wilson has shown support for Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, mentioning it multiple times along with a German phrase that translates to \u201cforeigners out.\u201d\n\nShe has previously declared \u201cMake Kosovo Serbia again,\u201d despite Kosovo being officially recognized as an independent state by the U.S. in the years after the two Balkan countries fought a war in the 1990s. Russia does not recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ritchie Torres from New York responded to Wilson\u2019s post last week, writing on X that she\u2019s \u201cshamefully attempting to delegitimize Kosovo.\u201d\n\nA significant number of Wilson\u2019s past posts on X peddle discredited conspiracy theories, including that Haitians living in the U.S. are \u201ceating cats\u201d and \u201cdirt,\u201d as well as the \"great replacement theory,\" the racist belief that ethnic white groups and their culture are being \u201creplaced\u201d by nonwhite immigrant groups in Western countries.\n\nOn Thanksgiving in 2022, she wrote, \u201cREMINDER: the Native Americans were anything but peaceful before the arrival of white Europeans.\u201d\n\nWilson has also repeatedly tweeted variations of the sentiment that \u201cWhite, Christian males are the most demonized group in modern America,\u201d and argued that women should not be allowed to work as police officers or Secret Service agents. She has also called transgender people \u201ccorrupted souls,\u201d and responded \u201cnot all heroes wear capes\u201d to a man being arrested for vandalizing a LGBTQ pride mural.\n\nThe 26-year-old Wilson is the daughter of right-wing commentator and former Trump adviser Steve Cortes. Since graduating high school, she has mixed with conservative politicians and media personalities, snapping photos with Sen. Ted Cruz and appearing on episodes of right-wing commentator Tim Pool\u2019s podcast. She worked for the conservative think tank Center for Renewing America and Gettr, the social media platform founded by former Trump aide Jason Miller.\n\nWilson backed former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s nomination for attorney general and traveled with him and his wife Ginger to El Salvador in November. Ginger Gaetz called her \u201cone of the most articulate voices in politics.\u201d\n\nSome of her past posts have slammed Republicans, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. In February of last year, Wilson posted on X: \u201cRepublicans are a joke. Only the Executive can save us. Trump 2024.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump has for years wildly exaggerated the size of US trade deficits with various other countries. Now, as Trump cites those trade deficits as a key justification for his tariff policies, newly released federal statistics show just how wrong Trump\u2019s numbers are.\n\nPreviously released federal figures for 2023 and part of 2024 had already shown that Trump\u2019s claims about the US deficits with Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union were way off. Now, the Department of Commerce has published full-year 2024 figures that allow us to say precisely how far off.\n\nThe figures were released Thursday, hours before Trump announced a pause, until April 2, on his tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement he signed in his first term.\n\nBefore we get into the data, a quick reminder: Having a trade deficit with another country means the US imports more goods and services from the country than the US exports. Though Trump often describes trade deficits as subsidies or losses, having a deficit does not mean the US is giving away money for nothing.\n\nFor example, the US trade deficit with Canada exists largely because the US imports a large quantity of cheap Canadian heavy crude oil that helps keep gas prices down for American drivers.\n\nCanada\n\nTrump, who on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on almost all imports from Canada (10% on energy), has repeatedly said this year that the US has a \u201c$200 billion\u201d trade deficit with Canada \u2013 sometimes making the claim explicitly and sometimes using vaguer language about a supposed $200 billion subsidy or loss to Canada.\n\nTrump\u2019s number is not even close to correct. The new federal statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion, down from $40.6 billion in 2023.\n\nEven if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the 2024 deficit with Canada was $70.6 billion. It was $72.3 billion in 2023.\n\nMexico\n\nTrump also imposed 25% tariffs on products imported from Mexico. He said in a Fox News interview in February, \u201cWe have a deficit with Mexico of $350 billion.\u201d\n\nAgain, that\u2019s distant from reality. The new federal figures show the 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods and services trade was $179 billion, up from $162.1 billion in 2023.\n\nThe 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods trade alone was $181.5 billion, up from $161.4 billion in 2023.\n\nChina\n\nTrump, who has imposed a series of tariffs in his first and second presidential terms on products imported from China, said in a Fox News Radio interview in February that \u201cwe have a deficit with China of over $1 trillion.\u201d He repeated the \u201c$1 trillion\u201d number in a February speech.\n\nThat, too, is a massive exaggeration. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was $263.3 billion. That\u2019s up from $252.1 billion in 2023 \u2013 but lower than in every year of Trump\u2019s first presidency.\n\nTrade deficits rise and fall for numerous reasons other than presidential policy. We mention the fact that Biden-era deficits were lower than Trump-era deficits, though, because Trump has claimed that Biden let the deficit with China \u201cget out of hand.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 deficit with China in goods trade alone was $295.2 billion, up from $278.7 billion in 2023.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nTrump has regularly, and incorrectly, castigated the European Union over its trade practices. He told reporters in February that \u201cwith the European Union, it\u2019s, you know, $350 billion deficit.\u201d He said at a subsequent February event that it\u2019s \u201cabout a $300 billion deficit with the European Union.\u201d\n\nWrong once more. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods and services trade was $161.1 billion, up from $125.1 billion in 2023.\n\nThe 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods trade alone was $236.7 billion, up from $201.6 billion in 2023. So, counting only goods trade, Trump\u2019s claims about the deficit with the European Union are a bit closer to the truth than his claims about the deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China \u2013 but they\u2019re still not actually close to the truth.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nWhen the Department of Government Efficiency swings an axe, it\u2019s bound to hit a veteran who voted for President Donald Trump.\n\nVeterans make up thirty percent of the federal workforce and more than sixty percent of veterans said Trump was their candidate, according to a Pew Research survey conducted two months before the 2024 election.\n\nOne veteran in Kansas who voted for Trump describes terminations that have upended the lives of many employees in his agency as a sudden military drawdown, poorly executed:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to put it like this: it was like the pull out of Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want me to identify him by name. He\u2019s concerned it will negatively impact him.\n\nHe still supports Trump and shrinking the federal government, but not how the administration is going about it.\n\n\u201cThey got in there, they thought \u2018we need to shake things up.\u2019 The system is rigged,\u201d he insisted, \u201cbut with that being said, nobody stopped to take a minute, sit back. It was a rash decision.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has based firings mostly on whether an employee is probationary, a status conferred on new federal employees but also on some who have been recently promoted or those who have moved between jobs even within the same agency.\n\nThere has been little accounting for military service and, in at least one case, whether they\u2019re actively deployed as a member of the National Guard or Reserve.\n\nAt one agency - not the Department of Defense, to be clear - I learned officials fired a probationary employee on leave from his civilian federal job for a military deployment, according to a source familiar with the circumstances of the employee.\n\nAgency officials took the action despite a longstanding federal law that specifically prohibits employers from terminating members of the Guard and Reserve from their civilian day jobs while their units are activated.\n\n\u2018At this position \u2026 I have found my peace\u2019\n\nThe Kansas veteran, like so many other vets, was sold on working for the federal government by none other than the federal government.\n\nAdministration after administration - including Trump in his first term - have championed veteran hiring, not just at the Pentagon, but at agencies across the government, in positions around the country, doing work that affects Americans in flyover states.\n\n\u201cI realize a lot of people from the east coast and Washington DC and from the west coast don\u2019t get out here much,\u201d the veteran says, \u201cbut when you\u2019re driving through Missouri, Kansas \u2026 Illinois, sometimes Kentucky, Tennessee, you see fields on both sides of the road and there\u2019s terraces out there, there\u2019s waterways out there: those are infrastructure to help keep eroding soils from turning into essentially dirt farms \u2026 that blow \u2026 whatever direction the wind is blowing.\u201d\n\nHe found a job - a job he loved - at the Natural Resources Conservation Services, an agency within the Department of Agriculture that was created as a direct result of the Dust Bowl in 1935, back when it was known as the Soil Conservation Service.\n\nThe agency protects farmlands and grasslands, manages watersheds, smaller dams and assists areas recovering from natural disasters.\n\nAfter fighting in the war in Afghanistan, helping rural communities, farmers and ranchers allowed the Kansas veteran to serve in a different way.\n\nIt also provided him something unexpected and priceless: a way to process his experience in the military. (a way to calm what his military service had stirred up - a way to quiet what his military service had made so loud).\n\n\u201cAt this position for the NRCS I have found my peace,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou go from one extreme to another. You go from war and terror to barbecuing with your family in the backyard. It\u2019s hard to do that,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThis job was a way\u2026\u201d\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cYou know, in the military, being combat arms, you see death, destruction and dismay. This was life, rejuvenation and construction. It was the complete opposite of what us combat arms guys come from.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that has the power to review and reverse federal employee firings, ordered the nearly 6,000 probationary workers fired by USDA reinstated for 45 days pending an investigation of the legality of their firings.\n\nPresumably the order covers this veteran, but as of the publishing of this story he hadn\u2019t heard from his former employer that he had his job back.\n\nAnd the move provides little certainty to these workers. The standing of the chair of the Merit Board, Cathy Harris, is tenuous. Trump recently fired her. A judge quickly stayed her firing, but the administration is expected to appeal the decision all the way to the Supreme Court, which has favored expanding presidential power.\n\n\u2018We love our veterans\u2019\n\nLast Friday in the Oval Office, a pool reporter asked Trump if he was tracking how many veterans have been fired so far.\n\n\u201cYes we are, and we take good care of our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re watching that very carefully. And we hope it\u2019s going to be as small a number as possible. But we are having great success in slimming down our government \u2026 We love our veterans. We\u2019re going to take good care of them.\u201d\n\nIf the Trump administration is tracking the number of veterans it has fired, they have not disclosed it, and a number of sources familiar with the information used in the initial firings say veteran status was not considered.\n\nVeterans have been left to plead their cases on an ad hoc basis, without much success.\n\nThe Kansas veteran called the state offices of his member of congress.\n\nHe also called the office of Jerry Moran, Kansas\u2019s senior senator, a Republican who has served almost three decades in congress and chairs the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\n\u201cThey were like \u2018we\u2019ll let him know and if he gets back to you he gets back to you. We\u2019re sorry, he\u2019s a busy man,\u2019\u201d the veteran recalled a young staff member telling him.\n\nThe Kansas veteran was hoping for a chance to ask his congressman for help in person, but recent confrontations at town halls have gone viral on social media, prompting many GOP lawmakers to abandon talking to their constituents in person.\n\n\u201cThese skype calls: there\u2019s a lot of these senators and congressmen holding these town halls through conference calls,\u201d lamented the veteran. \u201cYou have constituents who voted for you, and you can\u2019t look them in the eye? Why not?\u201d\n\nDemocrats have loudly criticized the administration for firing veterans, introduced a bill to reinstate their jobs and invited axed vets as guests at Trump\u2019s address to the joint session of congress.\n\nBut they\u2019re in the minority. They don\u2019t have the votes to pass legislation and they don\u2019t have the ear of the president.\n\nWhile some Republican lawmakers hide from the problems the government overhaul is causing the military and veteran communities, others are working to quietly address the issues.\n\nIn February, several successfully lobbied the White House behind the scenes to carve out an exemption for military spouses in Trump\u2019s executive order requiring all federal employees to return to work in person, though agencies are still not uniformly honoring those exemptions.\n\nSome GOP lawmakers have quietly lobbied the administration to rehire sacked veterans on a case-by-case basis, but many veterans worry about raising their hands to make their identity known.\n\n\u2018These firings - that\u2019s the erosion\u2019\n\nIn ranching, there are consequences if you let cattle graze a pasture all the way down to the roots, or \u201cgrease it down to dirt,\u201d as the veteran explained it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common rule for grass,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Take half, leave half.\u2019 If you take more than half of that grass off that pasture \u2026 that kills the grass. If you don\u2019t have those root fibers in that soil to hold that soil together, you\u2019re going to start eroding.\u201d\n\nAnd in farming, there\u2019s also a right way and a wrong way to avoid erosion. Drop the tine of the plow too deep, past the fertile topsoil, past the subsoil beneath that, into the compacted hardpan earth below, and you can turn a field into moondust that washes away with the rain or blows away with the wind.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever taken a blow-dryer to baby powder on the counter, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s doing,\u201d the veteran said. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of erosion that we\u2019re trying to prevent.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s talking about sustainable farming practices but it\u2019s also his metaphor for what\u2019s happening to jobs like his.\n\n\u201cThese firings - that\u2019s the erosion,\u201d he said, describing the job cuts in terms of soil conservation.\n\n\u201cThey built this big trench and there\u2019s nothing to slow down the water, to slow down their reactions to what they\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no infrastructure there \u2026 to hold that water back, to hold it down to a trickle and not a flood.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas veteran doesn\u2019t regret voting for Trump, but he is unhappy with the people Trump has chosen to execute his vision for a smaller government.\n\nHe thinks they\u2019re disconnected from how their decisions are affecting veterans and people in rural communities like his, taking jobs from veterans and the services they provide farmers and ranchers as well as freezing USDA funding for much needed and already approved projects, including those that address active soil erosion.\n\n\u201cMy message to the president is I\u2019ve got faith in you and I understand what you\u2019re doing but I need you to step back from the situation for a minute and look at the \u2026repercussions,\u201d the veteran says.\n\n\u201cYou can have all these yes men around you but you also need some nos.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Elon Musk alongside MAGA senator Rick Scott. Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nYou\u2019d think the man that Donald Trump empowered to tear the federal bureaucracy limb from limb would have taken the trouble to familiarize himself with the procedures available for cutting federal spending in a more orthodox manner. But it seems Elon Musk did not know there was a way to cut current-year spending without unleashing kiddie coders to commandeer federal-agency data and boss around (or fire) personnel, as Axios reports after Musk\u2019s March 5 meeting with congressional Republicans:\n\nElon Musk and Republican senators are eyeing a package to claw back tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending after meeting in a closed-door lunch on Wednesday. \u2026\n\nMusk has been leading the charge on spending cuts from the White House. Some lawmakers want to make his actions more permanent by making them law.\n\nNo decisions have been made, but there was some early, general support for the idea being pushed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) after the lunch. An infamous deficit hawk, Paul pitched Elon Musk on a massive rescission package during a lunch on Wednesday, he told reporters. Such a package would undo federal funding already approved by Congress.\n\nThe bill would also only require 51 votes to pass the Senate \u2014 no Democrats needed. Paul said specific numbers weren\u2019t discussed, but he\u2019d like to see $500 billion. \u2026\n\nMusk \u201cwas elated\u201d at the idea, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told reporters. \u201cI think he didn\u2019t realize it could be done at 51.\u201d\n\nWhat they were talking about is an arcane procedure, called rescissions, established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 wherein the president can propose clawbacks of unspent current-year appropriations and Congress can approve them on a fast-track vote that cannot be filibustered. It\u2019s a counterpart to the future-year cuts obtainable through budget-reconciliation bills, which the Republican-controlled Congress is slowly moving toward enacting later this year. Rescissions should be familiar to Team Trump, since the 45th president proposed a $15 billion package of such cuts in 2018; they passed the House but were rejected by the Senate, as it happens.\n\nThis time around, rescissions could be immense, as Rand Paul\u2019s half-trillion-dollar suggestion indicates. But the real idea is to reassert some sort of congressional involvement in spending decisions currently being made in the executive branch by Musk\u2019s DOGE, Russ Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, and in some cases by agency leaders following directions from Musk and Vought. Congressional authorization of current-year cuts might also help insulate them from judicial cancellation on grounds that Trump\u2019s agents are usurping powers constitutionally assigned to the legislative branch, as CNN explains:\n\n\u201cWhat we got to do as Republicans is capture their work product, put it in a bill and vote on it,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and chair of the Senate Budget Committee, said, describing how Congress can play a bigger role in implementing DOGE cuts. \u201cWe need to capture this in the legislative process to make it real.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s as far as it goes, that might indeed \u201celate\u201d Musk, since it means Congress rubber-stamping his work and reducing the amount of time his minions spend being deposed for lawsuits over the legality of DOGE\u2019s raids on \u201cthe deep state.\u201d Presumably, congressional Republicans might want some input into the previously chaotic DOGE processes and the chaos and fear they have engendered, not just with respect to federal employees and contractors but among the constituents who depend on the services they provide. But on the other hand, by pursuing rescissions Trump\u2019s faithful congressional allies will own DOGE\u2019s chainsaw approach to federal spending. An additional problem is the risk of losing a rescission vote, as happened to Republicans in 2018 when two GOP senators voted with Democrats to kill the action. Mike Johnson\u2019s entire strategy for surviving 2025 without losing his gavel is to minimize the number of major House floor votes that stress-test his fragile majority. A big rescission package could produce another dangerous moment for House Republicans.\n\nPresumably, Russ Vought and the White House will make the real decision about the advisability of a rescissions package. It\u2019s possible that they are so very deeply invested in consolidating a vast expansion of executive power that they don\u2019t actually want even a rubber-stamp from Congress. But there are some advantages this approach will give them: Once rescissions are proposed, affected spending items are frozen for 45 days until Congress acts upon them, buying time and preventing judicial interventions.\n\nGoing forward, shifting power from DOGE to agency leadership on the one hand and Congress on the other would free up Elon Musk for whatever task he chooses next. It\u2019s sobering to realize that the whole immensely consequential DOGE project was apparently dreamed up by Musk after the November elections and probably took powerful Republicans at both ends of Pennsylvania \u2014 very much including the president of the United States \u2014 by surprise. A lot may depend on whether the financial savior of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign keeps at his current self-appointed task or moves on to something equally destructive."

According to Quinnipiac, this is the lowest mayoral approval rating since the university began polling city voters close to 30 years ago. The poll surveyed 1,260 New York City self-identified registered voters from February 27 to March 3.\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there. On the subject of Adams\u2019s corruption case, 40 percent of voters said they believed the mayor did something illegal, while 31 percent said they thought Adams did something unethical but not illegal. Only 13 percent of voters said they think the mayor did nothing wrong. And 56 percent of respondents said they believed Adams should resign from office entirely, while only 35 percent said that he shouldn\u2019t. When it came to whether Adams\u2019s case should be dismissed as the Justice Department has argued, 63 percent of respondents said the charges shouldn\u2019t be dropped, while 25 percent disagreed.\n\nThe new polling comes as another prominent politician has decided to toss her hat into the ring. Politico reports that City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is joining the mayoral race with plans to officially debut her campaign at a rally in Queens, her home district. \u201cI never planned to run for mayor, but I\u2019m not giving up on New York City,\u201d she said in a statement to the outlet. \u201cOur city deserves a leader that serves its people first and always, not someone focused on themselves and their own political interests.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker and the mayor, who aren\u2019t related, both entered their positions of leadership together in 2022, highlighting a long-standing relationship that goes back to their high-school days. But that dynamic has strained in recent years as the two Adamses have clashed as City Hall and the City Council have found themselves increasingly at odds.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll shows neither Adams at the head of the crowded field at this juncture. When asked who they would support if the Democratic primary was held today, 31 percent of voters said they would back former governor Andrew Cuomo, followed by Mayor Adams with 11 percent, Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani with 8 percent, former comptroller Scott Stringer with 6 percent, and current comptroller Brad Lander with 5 percent.\n\nQueens state senator Jessica Ramos and Speaker Adams both received 4 percent, while Brooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie, former hedge-fund manager Whitney Tilson, and former Bronx assemblymember Michael Black were tied with one percent. The survey also included public advocate Jumaane Williams, who is not currently running but would succeed Mayor Adams in the event of a resignation, and he received 7 percent."

The show hasn't shied away from politics in the past, and in 2016 the musical's then-star Brandon Victor Dixon closed one \"Hamilton\" performance, attended by then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence, with a statement that implored the upcoming administration to \"uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.\"\n\n\"Hamilton\" had two previous runs at the Kennedy Center, in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term and in 2022 during the Biden administration. It was set for a third session at the performing arts house from March 3 to April 26 next year.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda appears at the curtain call for the opening night performance of \"Hamilton\" on Broadway in 2015. Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP, File\n\nIn his announcement, Seller said part of the decision to call off that scheduled run was business-related, as \"it would simply be financially and personally devastating to the hundreds of employees of 'Hamilton' if the new leadership of the Kennedy Center suddenly cancelled or re-negotiated our engagement.\"\n\nThe Kennedy Center's governing board voted unanimously last month to elect Mr. Trump as its new chair, soon after the president unveiled plans to replace the center's previous chairman and fill the role himself, while also removing the board of trustees. Sources told CBS News at the time that the White House quickly began filling open spots with administration officials as well as their donors and members of their families, and the Kennedy Center's website ultimately went on to reflect those changes.\n\nMr. Trump has also made clear his intention to reshape the center's productions and performances, which he views as examples of \"woke culture.\"\n\nIn a post on social media, Kennedy Center interim President Richard Grenell called the decision by Seller and Miranda \"a publicity stunt that will backfire.\" He accused Miranda of being \"intolerant of people who don't agree with him politically.\"\n\nThe New York Times was first to report the cancellation.\n\nLaunched in 1971, the Kennedy Center describes itself as \"the nation's cultural center.\" A \"social credo\" featured on its website says the center's \"objective is to invite art into the lives of all Americans and ensure it represents the cultural diversity of America.\""

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nGovernment by chaos is back.\n\nOne day, President Donald Trump imposed a punishing tariff regime against Canada and Mexico. The next, he froze auto duties for a month after suddenly realizing that \u2013 as everyone had predicted \u2013 they could wreck a quintessential American industry.\n\nLast week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to the Oval Office to sign a rare-earth minerals deal that Trump billed as a triumph for the US. But Zelensky was provoked by Vice President JD Vance and kicked out of the White House. European leaders have spent days trying to fix the debacle.\n\nElon Musk, meanwhile, is taking his chainsaw to the bureaucracy, indiscriminately firing workers and feeding agencies into the wood chipper \u2013 pitching citizens and industries who rely on government payments into uncertainty just as the economy softens and is more vulnerable to such shocks.\n\nAt first, Trump\u2019s early-term energy on multiple fronts was a bolt of energy as he scratched his Sharpie across executive orders and chased away the lethargy that marked President Joe Biden\u2019s waning months in office.\n\nSix weeks in, however, as Trump makes gut-check calls to dismantle post-Cold War national security arrangements, the global free trade system, and the federal machine \u2013 all of which helped make the US a superpower \u2013 a new realization is dawning.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s haphazard efforts to make peace in Ukraine, revive Rust Belt-heavy industry with 19th century-style tariffs and slash government are as improvisational as the \u201cweave\u201d \u2013 his name for his stream-of-consciousness campaign screeds.\n\nAnd the world is once again left hanging on the \u201cAmerica first\u201d president\u2019s whims and obsessions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much unpredictability and chaos coming out of the White House right now,\u201d Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said Wednesday, describing US trade policy as a \u201cpsychodrama\u201d her country can\u2019t go through every 30 days.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, February 28, 2025. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump\u2019s gut-check leadership can get results, but just as often backfires\n\nAmerica\u2019s friends are often left to puzzle over what exactly Trump is trying to do.\n\nThe president, for instance, said Wednesday that Canada hadn\u2019t done enough to stem the flow of fentanyl over the border \u2013 but only minuscule amounts of the drug are involved. Sometimes the White House complains about the flow south of undocumented migrants \u2013 but these numbers are also small. Trump also wants manufacturing to leave Canada and move south. No wonder some officials in Ottawa have concluded he\u2019s trying to weaken their country to make it easier to annex.\n\nStill, the president can point to some successes with his threat-based foreign policy. For instance, his fury that a Hong Kong-based firm owned two ports at either end of the Panama Canal is precipitating a purchase by US investment giant BlackRock. The president had falsely claimed these ports meant China controlled the vital waterway built by the US, but the change of ownership may still improve the US strategic position.\n\nAnd Trump might be downgrading the transatlantic alliance that has kept world peace for 80 years \u2013 but he\u2019s set off an unprecedented rearmament program among NATO allies that other presidents have demanded for years.\n\nBut just as often, it\u2019s as if Trump is more interested in brute force personal power than working off any long-term playbook.\n\nMichael Froman, a former US trade representative who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations, told Jim Sciutto on CNN International Wednesday that while the cost of imposing tariffs often outweighs the benefits, they can be a tool that gets other nations to the negotiating table. This is true in the case of Mexico with which the US has far wider border issues than Canada. But, Froman added, \u201cyou have to know what it is you want them to do for that leverage to be useful.\u201d\n\nThe essence of Trumpism\n\nTo some extent, the chaos is the point. And the theatrics of a president addicted to stunt politics are key to his political appeal.\n\nBut allied governments have their own politics to worry about \u2013 a factor the Trump administration often seems to ignore.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \u2013 who is, like Trump, new in office and keen to make a mark \u2013 said Wednesday that her country could consider alternative trade partners to the United States \u201cif necessary.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointedly paid tribute in the House of Commons to British soldiers who were killed fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. This followed a comment by Vance on Fox News that Ukraine needed better security guarantees than undertakings from \u201csome random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d The vice president\u2019s remark caused great offensive in Britain. He said on X that claims he\u2019d been talking about Britain and France were \u201cabsurdly dishonest,\u201d but those are the only allies who have so far publicly volunteered to take part in a post-peace deal reassurance force in Ukraine.\n\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron warned his compatriots Wednesday evening the world had changed utterly since Trump returned to the White House, adding that he was considering extending the protection of France\u2019s nuclear arsenal to European allies.\n\nFor some MAGA supporters, Trump\u2019s genius for enraging Democrats, the media and foreign governments is an end in itself. And for ideologues on the populist nationalist right, sparking pandemonium in Washington and destroying governing agencies is a way of deconstructing the administrative state.\n\nTrump\u2019s method was honed in his office high up in the skyscraper that bears his name in Manhattan.\n\nThe future president learned through his real estate career how to push opponents off balance with outlandish demands, verbal confrontations and sudden switches of position. In government, he does the same thing to disorientate adversaries and seeks to impose power amid the mayhem.\n\nBut while unpredictability is a real estate superpower, it\u2019s a liability when running a country, an economy and a planet \u2013 where continuity and predictability are preferred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just constant, and it\u2019s exhausting,\u201d said Julian Vikan Karaguesian, a former Canadian Ministry of Finance official, referring to Trump\u2019s scorched-earth tariff offensive. \u201cIt\u2019s almost surreal. Is it real? Is it going to be real this time?\u201d Karaguesian, who now lectures at McGill University in Montreal, added: \u201cMaybe the modus operandi here is uncertainty. It\u2019s not tariffs, it\u2019s not anything else, but intentionally creating a sense of chaos and a sense of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nA drone view of Stellantis's Chrysler Windsor Assembly facility in Windsor, Ontario, on February 4, 2025. Carlos Osorio/Reuters\n\nThe auto tariffs that the president froze for a month on Wednesday, a day after imposing blanket 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, shows how he sometimes has second thoughts about his own aggression.\n\nPerhaps his favorite barometer, the stock market, forced his hand. His concession reversed two days of steep losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a handy near-500-point rebound.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that Trump relented after conversations with the CEOs of the Big Three automakers. And his press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he was open to \u201chearing about additional exemptions.\u201d\n\nThe idea that well-placed CEOs can use their access to the powerful to acquire exemptions and special favors not available to ordinary Americans is the antithesis of an equitable economy. But then Trump has shown little respect for rules-based systems that eliminate the kind of patronage and potential for corruption that thrives in autocratic societies.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach may also mean he likes threatening tariffs more than imposing them. But by constantly threatening tariffs and then creating doubt about whether or when they will be maintained, the president is causing huge uncertainty for businesses that need to establish certainty of costs and supply and consumers who could damage an already-softening economy if they rein in spending.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty about what the administration is doing that the mere prospect of tariffs is creating a big anchor on the economy,\u201d Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, told reporters on a conference call Monday. \u201cThe prospect of significant tariffs on our allies has resulted in withholding investments and preemptive price increases that are going to be borne by small businesses and, ultimately, by consumers.\u201d\n\nHow Trump\u2019s unpredictability could backfire\n\nTrump\u2019s relentless bullying of America\u2019s friends \u2013 while seemingly doing everything he can to advance its traditional adversary Russia in Ukraine \u2013 may also drain US power in the long run.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen this week is that the dollar has suffered a very sharp decline,\u201d Ruchir Sharma, founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, told Richard Quest on CNN International. \u201cIt\u2019s revealing that the rest of the world is getting its act together \u2026 and I think investors are beginning to notice there are other countries worth investing in, given all this policy volatility that is emerging in the US,\u201d he said.\n\nThe danger for the US therefore is that four more years of Trump\u2019s antics could reshape the globe \u2013 in a way that does not comply with his vision of US dominance but leaves Americans looking in from the outside. Mexico and Canada, for instance, can\u2019t change the geography that makes it a no-brainer to trade with the mighty US. But both also may see advantages in expanding trade and investment with America\u2019s rising rival China. And the European Union, which is expecting its own barrage of Trump tariffs soon, may examine similar horizons.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Western allies have too much invested in generations with ties with Washington to want it to fail. But they have their own national interests too. Canada can\u2019t win a trade war against its more powerful neighbor. But its patience is thin over Trump\u2019s brinkmanship and bullying.\n\nDoug Ford, the premier of Ontario, home to Canada\u2019s largest provincial economy, says the only way forward is for Trump to eradicate all tariffs rather than an a la carte easing of duties industry by industry, as with autos.\n\n\u201cAll this gives us is uncertainty again,\u201d Ford told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly on Wednesday. \u201cThere is one person that\u2019s causing that problem today: that\u2019s President Trump.\u201d"

It takes one agent to arrest the bad guy in the county jail. It takes a whole team to find somebody that doesn't want to be found in the neighborhoods, but we're going to keep doing this.\"\n\nThat effort is being boosted by Trump\u2019s GOP allies in Congress, who on Wednesday sought to highlight the dangers posed by sanctuary policies.\n\n\"Every crime committed by someone in the United States illegally is a crime that would not have been committed.

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nLiberals and government employees aren\u2019t the only people angry with Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s plunging share price means many investors are angry, too.\n\nShares of Tesla shot up 91% after election day, peaking just before Christmas, as investors anticipated Musk and his car company would be big winners as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s second term as president. Musk was Trump\u2019s largest financial supporter during the campaign, and has since become the highest-profile member of his administration, by far. In his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE), he has been trying to impose deep cuts in spending that had been previously approved by Congress, laying off thousands of federal workers.\n\nBut shares tumbled 5.6% in trading Thursday and are now down 45% from their December peak, giving up 96% of that post-election bump. Just since Trump took office and Musk began wielding power they have lost 38% of their overall value.\n\nThe drop in share price probably reflects the concern that Musk has been much a more visible \u2013 and polarizing \u2013 figure in the Trump administration than he was expected to be immediately after the election. Many investors likely figured Musk would be a more traditional \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d kind of adviser, not necessarily taking an active role in enacting controversial policies. Musk had enough other business interests, running companies ranging from Tesla to SpaceX to Neuralink to X, to keep him occupied.\n\nBut the drop in Tesla\u2019s value is also a sign of the headwinds the company is facing, in addition to increased competition from other automakers, especially those from China, who have made significant gains in their home market and in Europe as well.\n\nWhether it\u2019s one problem or a myriad of problems causing the slump, however, it is clear now that Tesla\u2019s sales woes are dragging the stock price down, too. And it\u2019s not clear what, if anything, could lift Tesla sales going forward.\n\nGlobal sales are \u2018imploding\u2019\n\nWhile electric vehicle sales in Europe shot up 34% overall in January, sales of Teslas plummeted 50%. Tesla\u2019s sales fell 29% in China, the company\u2019s second largest market after the United States, over the course of the first two months of the year, according to Reuters.\n\nAnd Tesla\u2019s US sales suffered a 16% drop in US sales between December and January, according to an estimate from Cox Automotive. It\u2019s difficult to directly attribute the drops to any one cause, however, as a drop in that period is typical for the company, which usually makes a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales.\n\nTesla cars at a charging station in Germany. Federico Gambarini/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\n\u201cGlobally his sales are imploding,\u201d said Gordon Johnson, an analyst who is mostly critical of Tesla and its shares. \u201cThe sales drop in China is about competition but in western nations, people are pissed at him. Whether that\u2019s driving down the sales in western countries, or it\u2019s competition doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s little he can do reverse it. And we know he\u2019s not going to have full self-driving. I think this could be the year the Tesla\u2019s shares finally collapse.\u201d\n\nEven even some bullish investors already think Musk is going to wildly miss the mark when it comes to Tesla\u2019s growth this year.\n\n\u201cI think investors are coming to a new expectation around what deliveries are going to look like for the year,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cThree or four months ago, Musk guided to 20% to 30% delivery growth in 2025. And then a month ago he didn\u2019t make any mention of the previous target, which analysts and investors correctly assumed that that meant that target is no longer on the table.\u201d\n\nA polarizing figure\n\nThe question is how much of the plunge is a reaction to Musk\u2019s political profile. Munster, who still considers himself a Tesla bull, said he believes about three-quarters is blowback.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the election, it was unclear how visible Musk would be (in the Trump administration),\u201d Munster said. \u201cSome believed the whole DOGE thing wouldn\u2019t get off the ground. At this point Tesla investors are seeing Musk as having more authority than Trump. There\u2019s some brand damage that comes from that.\u201d\n\nThere were protests outside Tesla stores throughout the country Saturday, with scattered reports of vandalized Teslas. One person was arrested in Loveland, Colorado and faces federal criminal charges after prior acts of vandalism against a Tesla store, and possession of \u201cincendiary devices.\u201d\n\nPeople participate in a \"TeslaTakedown\" protest against Elon Musk outside of a Tesla dealership in New York, March 1, 2025. Leonardo Munoz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps the biggest sign of shift in how badly people want to own a Telsa comes from S&P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data down into \u201cblue states,\u201d meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and \u201cred states,\u201d where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the loyalty rate, meaning the percentage of households that have bought more than one Tesla.\n\nIn the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% during the last three months of last year.\n\nThe drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about a percentage point of market share in those states, which includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest car markets, such as California.\n\nA poll last month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers \u201cwould not consider\u201d buying a Tesla. That\u2019s up from 27% in a Morning Consult survey a year ago, and only 17% when it asked the question in in February 2021.\n\nBy comparison, only 16% of potential buyers were almost certain or very likely to look at a Tesla before buying in the most recent survey, a figure that hasn\u2019t changed much over the last four years.\n\nThere\u2019s also been anecdotal backlash against Musk on social media, including videos of people booing Cybertrucks which then needed a police escort out during the Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, as well as people voicing approval for acts of vandalism against Teslas and accidents involving Tesla stores or vehicles.\n\nOther problems from Musk\u2019s DOGE role\n\nBeyond any concerns about liberals who might now avoid buying Teslas in reaction to Musk\u2019s politics, Munster said there\u2019s a concern that Musk is distracted from running Tesla, the company on which the majority of his fortune is based on.\n\n\u201cMusk really rewrote the book in terms of leaders\u2019 capacity to do different things. That used to be frowned upon,\u201d Munster said, referring to Musk\u2019s job not only as CEO of Tesla but also SpaceX, the primary owner of social media platform X, as well as the founder of artificial intelligence company xAI and Neuralink, which aims to implant computer chips into people\u2019s brain to control computers. \u201cI think there are natural limitations to what he can do. He has a lot going on.\u201d\n\nElon Musk leaves after meeting with Senate Republicans, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Ben Curtis/AP\n\nIn addition there could be growing concerns that as trade tensions rise between China and the United States that the Chinese could target Tesla for action because of his role in the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cBeijing grants favors and withholds favors,\u201d according to Isaac Stone Fish, the CEO of Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm. \u201cThey have many levers over Elon Musk and Tesla.\u201d\n\nTesla bulls still pleased with Trump alliance\n\nBut Tesla bulls say there is still an argument for how Musk\u2019s ties to the Trump administration could benefit the automaker, such as easier approval for its plans for self-driving \u201crobotaxis.\u201d\n\nWhile many Teslas now have a \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d feature that can handle some driving maneuvers, drivers are required to be behind the steering wheel ready to take control of the car. And there are still accidents involving FSD, prompting a number of investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nBut Musk has promised that by June he\u2019ll have vehicles ready to provide autonomous operations without drivers transporting passengers in a ride hailing service in Austin, Texas, Tesla\u2019s home base, although Uber and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo unit have already beaten Tesla with a driverless service in that city. And he expects that service to spread quickly and for a Cybercab vehicle to be on the roads by next year without steering wheels, brake or accelerator pedals.\n\nThose promises have bulls still excited about Tesla\u2019s prospects, no matter the current sales problems. They believe the current decline in share price is a buying opportunity for those who believe in that future.\n\n\u201cThe real unlock of Tesla value is on autonomy,\u201d said Munster. \u201cTrump loves Musk, and Musk is going to get some of the things he wants, and the big thing is more opportunity to prove the safety of robotaxis. I think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nOthers have severe doubts about that.\n\nJohnson, the Tesla bear analyst, says that Musk has been promising that truly autonomous vehicles have been just a year or so way for the last decade, and that any problems living up to his latest promises will cause a sharp drop in the stock price, as will the first quarter sales figures due out in early April.\n\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu contributed to this report\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story understated the gain in Tesla shares after the election through a December peak. The story has been updated to reflect the correct gain and the decline since that peak through Thursday\u2019s close."

Angela Ochoa, commander of the 89th Airlift Wing, to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025. Trump was traveling to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. Photo: Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn filmmaker Paul Verhoeven\u2019s adaptation of Starship Troopers, military service guarantees citizenship in a futuristic \u2014 and fascist \u2014 regime. The policy is simple: Join the war on the alien bugs or suffer a second-class life. Verhoeven\u2019s satire worked in part because it echoed real-world politics. Although the American government is a mite less radical than the fanatical world government of Verhoeven\u2019s film, our politicians have long promised a form of enhanced citizenship to those who fight. The military welfare state supports active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, and once a person separates, they\u2019re eligible for benefits that aren\u2019t available to anyone else. They can receive affordable health care through the VA or go to college on the GI Bill or apply for a reasonable home loan. If they\u2019re able to work, they might look to the federal government, which offers preferential hiring to veterans.\n\nVeterans\u2019 benefits once seemed like the third rail of American politics, but perhaps no longer. As Elon Musk and his DOGE goons slash away at federal jobs, they\u2019ve laid off thousands of veterans with few repercussions to date. Alina Habba, Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney and a White House adviser, told reporters on Tuesday that the veterans they\u2019ve fired might not be \u201cfit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd we can\u2019t, you know, I wouldn\u2019t take money from you and pay somebody and say, \u2018Sorry, you know, they\u2019re not going to come to work.\u2019 It\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d A day later, the Associated Press reported that the VA plans to fire about 80,000 workers, a clear threat to veterans\u2019 care. The news hit home: My husband, a Marine veteran, relies on the VA for his health care.\n\nTrump\u2019s patriotism has always been bluster, a way to mobilize his base without much of a material commitment to veterans or servicemembers. That\u2019s not so unusual for an American politician, even if most are not as blunt as Trump\u2019s adviser, Habba. Anyone can campaign on so-called veterans\u2019 issues; it\u2019s much more difficult to reckon with the human cost of our bloody foreign policies. In the absence of moral accountability, the American government offers its youth a fragile bargain instead: Kill the bugs, and we\u2019ll take care of you later.\n\nBut there\u2019s no way to trust a promise that recognizes the humanity of some while denying it to others. What we do on the battlefield and in prisons like Guant\u00e1namo Bay reflects the domestic values and priorities of the American government. We have always reserved humane treatment for a select few while we force everyone else to struggle for scraps, though we insist the system is based on merit. Dignity is a luxury, meted out on the basis of race and gender and disability status. In such a country, the benefits we offer veterans rest on a shaky foundation. If health care and housing and education are unique privileges, not universal rights, the government can easily go back on its word. Veterans are only special as long as they\u2019re convenient.\n\nIn betraying veterans now, the Trump administration merely hastens the inevitable. It has been popular to think of veterans as an exception to centuries of rhetoric and policy that cast people in need as takers and moochers; the uniform has, in theory, distinguished those who bore it from those who belong to a parasitical class. We see now that the uniform never meant all that much and that what\u2019s given can be taken away in a flash. But policy does not exist in a void. In this case it depends on a Praetorian culture that achieved new strength in the post-9/11 era. We honor the troops with parades and flags and discounts at Applebee\u2019s, as if no form of citizenship is entirely separate from consumer identity. Members of both parties brandish the uniform to win office and curry favor not just with veterans themselves but with moderate and conservative voters who say they respect the military.\n\nBy definition, American Praetorianism singles out military service for special treatment, almost sanctification. That can be powerful, but for whom? Although millions of people have achieved middle class stability thanks to the military welfare state and veterans\u2019 benefits, their rise always depended on the whims of the government. An administration that is poised to damage Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid is an administration that can strip veterans of everything we said they had earned. Habba\u2019s comments are remarkable because she is telling us the truth about the order of things. Veterans remain subject to political forces that prioritize profit margins over human life and dignity. With each week that passes, it becomes harder to deny that Elon Musk\u2019s billions carry more weight than the uniform ever could. It is similarly no coincidence that the administration is purging veterans from the federal workforce while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks of lethality and warfighting. This is a cruel ideology, which treats humanity as a trait it can bestow or rescind. No one is safe, not even the troops."

            "full_content": "Shortly after the video of George Floyd\u2019s death went viral in May 2020, a popular conservative pundit released an online video in which he decried Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for kneeling on Floyd for \u201cfour straight minutes,\u201d even though Floyd, bystanders and even other police officers told Chauvin that Floyd couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nThis pundit pointed to video of the incident to dismiss the argument that Floyd was resisting arrest. It\u2019s \u201creally ugly and really bad,\u201d he said, adding that Chauvin should be prosecuted \u201cto the fullest extent of the law\u201d and should \u201cgo to jail\u201d and that \u201ceveryone should be on the same side of this.\u201d Several days later, the same pundit wrote in his syndicated column that Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of Chauvin and other Minneapolis police officers should inspire Americans to \u201crally\u201d against such \u201cobvious evil.\u201d\n\nThat pundit was the Daily Wire\u2019s Ben Shapiro. This week, Shapiro called on Donald Trump to pardon Chauvin on the federal charges he faced for causing Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nEven as he condemned Chauvin\u2019s brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters.\n\nAs you might have guessed, I\u2019ve left out some important context to Shapiro\u2019s 2020 condemnation of Chauvin\u2019s brutality. The problem is that the context doesn\u2019t help \u2014 it makes it all a lot worse. Even as he condemned Chauvin\u2019s brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters for claiming that what Chauvin did was commonplace or racially motivated. He chastised critics who argued that police brutality is systemic. George Floyd\u2019s killer would be prosecuted, Shapiro promised, and that would prove the system works.\n\nShapiro seemed particularly offended at the very idea that other police officers or conservatives like him would defend Chauvin. Everyone condemned Chauvin\u2019s actions, he assured us \u2014 from him to police groups around the country to President Donald Trump. The mere fact that so many people on the right had condemned a white cop for killing a Black man was, he argued, in and of itself proof that systemic racism is a myth.\n\nWhat a difference five years makes. Now Shapiro claims that Chauvin\u2019s trial was a farce and that his \u201cconviction represents the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics. The country cannot turn the page on that dark, divisive, and racist era without righting this terrible wrong.\u201d Other conservative commentators and politicians have also come to Chauvin\u2019s defense, but Shapiro\u2019s plea achieved particular significance after it was amplified by Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s unofficial co-president and his largest campaign donor.\n\nThat conservative pundits like Shapiro now defend Chauvin isn\u2019t surprising. It follows a familiar pattern after high-profile incidents of police brutality spark large protests. Those protests are rarely only about the precipitating incident itself. They tend to happen in places with long-established police abuse and racism. And as the 2023 Justice Department report documented, there was plenty of both at the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nThe campaign to retroactively exonerate Chauvin and reverse the progress made by George Floyd protests began with a video produced and co-written by a former TV host who is married to the former head of the Minneapolis police union. It was then distributed by a far-right advocacy group that poses as a news organization. Among other risible claims, the documentary accuses the FBI of pressuring Minneapolis officials to manufacture evidence to implicate Chauvin. You know the FBI. Always looking for reasons to smear cops.\n\nNevertheless, the documentary slowly gained purchase in online right-wing culture, first with MAGA influencers on social media, then with far-right personalities like Megan Kelly and Tucker Carlson and finally with more mainstream, \u201cheterodox\u201d and right-of-center podcasts and publications.\n\nAs with most lies perpetuated by the far right, the truth is there for those who want it. In a long three-part series, I documented in detail how its producers duped gullible pundits and columnists into amplifying claims that were false, misleading or wholly made-up. But as is also the case with far-right mythology, the true believers aren\u2019t interested in reality. They want validation. So the \u201cdocumentary\u201d is now MAGA canon.\n\nShapiro\u2019s demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It\u2019s purely symbolic.\n\nThe video depicting George Floyd\u2019s murder hasn\u2019t changed in five years. It\u2019s as harrowing as ever. Bystanders, other police officers and Floyd himself plead with Chauvin. They tell him Floyd isn\u2019t breathing. They cry out to Chauvin that Floyd doesn\u2019t have a pulse. Chauvin callously ignores them. And George Floyd dies.\n\nWhat has changed is the right\u2019s posture toward racism and political violence. The gutter politics of people like Laura Loomer, Marjorie Taylor-Greene and Nick Fuentes is now part of the Republican Party\u2019s core. People who were too racist for the first Trump administration have been rehired or promoted in the second. It\u2019s now acceptable to tell vicious lies about immigrant groups like the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, to Venezuelans in Aurora, Colorado. Pizzagate propagator Jack Posobiec now advises Trump Cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and accompanies them on official trips. The sitting vice president wrote the foreword to Posobiec\u2019s book \u2014 a book in which, right in the title, Posobiec declares his political enemies to be \u201cunhuman.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has always valorized political violence. He has spent the last decade dehumanizing immigrants, defending police brutality, celebrating the violent suppression of dissent and boasting about the bikers, soldiers and cops waiting to spill blood on his behalf should he ever need them (as they already have).\n\nThe political right has now fully embraced that ethos. When Kyle Rittenhouse lugged his guns into a volatile protest zone and killed two people, those deaths were treated not as tragic but as legally justified. They were celebrated. A year after Daniel Perry was convicted of murdering a Black Lives Matter protester, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pardoned him at the urging of right-wing voices like Tucker Carlson. And when, in one of Trump\u2019s first acts after his inauguration, he granted clemency to the Jan. 6 rioters, including those who violently attacked Capitol Police officers, those on the right praised the pardons and commutations.\n\nShapiro himself acknowledges that Trump can pardon Chauvin only on the federal charges of violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights. The more serious charges came in state court, where Trump has no clemency power.\n\nThis means Shapiro\u2019s demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It\u2019s purely symbolic: Shapiro wants validation for his argument that Chauvin was wrongly convicted. He wants the president to refute the notion that Shapiro himself advanced in 2020: that Chauvin\u2019s treatment of George Floyd was \u201creally ugly and really bad\u201d and \u201cobviously evil.\u201d\n\nWhen we contrast the two Ben Shapiros, five years apart, the right\u2019s grim trajectory over that time comes into focus. The 2020 Ben Shapiro argued that the right\u2019s near-universal condemnation of Chauvin was proof that his side takes police brutality seriously, that its support for the prosecution of a white cop for killing an unarmed Black man was proof that it isn\u2019t racist and that Chauvin\u2019s inevitable prosecution was proof of its belief that the criminal justice system is fair and just. The 2025 Ben Shapiro \u2014 along with much of the right \u2014 now says that Chauvin\u2019s killing of Floyd was justified, that his prosecution should never have happened and that his conviction was political and vindictive.\n\nHowever flawed his arguments, the 2020 Ben Shapiro was at least eager to defend the right from claims that it is racist, oblivious to injustice or eager to embrace violence. The 2025 Ben Shapiro seems hell-bent on proving him wrong."

            "full_content": "Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nLast week, the White House invited a handful of giddy conservative influencers to \u201cpolicy briefings\u201d with top administration officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel. The influencers, who included OANN anchor and Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, Rogan O\u2019Handley (a.k.a. DC Draino), and Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, happily walked away with binders adorned with the Justice Department seal and branded \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase 1.\u201d\n\nIt turns out there wasn\u2019t any new grist in them for the conspiracy-theory mill. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting for juicy stuff, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s in this binder at all,\u201d podcaster Liz Wheeler wrote on X. \u201cWhat we were looking for was hidden from us.\u201d Still, the Roosevelt Room gathering was indicative of the Trump administration\u2019s evolving relationship with the press. \u201cThese folks have larger followings than most mainstream-media \u2018reporters,\u2019\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X. \u201cThe media landscape has changed, and we are fully embracing it here at the Trump White House!\u201d\n\nThe influencer briefing came in the midst of one of the most tumultuous periods in recent memory for the Washington press corps, which is not only coping with a nonstop news cycle but battling a White House that has blocked mainstream outlets like the Associated Press from events and, for the first time in a century, said it would determine which news outlets are part of the press pool, long the purview of the independent White House Correspondents\u2019 Association. And while Trump has always made life difficult for journalists, this time they find themselves divided, squabbling, and unsure whether they even want to present a united front. Said Peter Baker, the New York Times reporter who has been covering the White House for three decades, \u201cIt\u2019s as volatile a moment for the White House press corps as I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe troubles began on February 11, when the White House blocked the Associated Press from an event in the Oval Office; on February 14, the White House made the ban official, saying the AP would be barred from entering the Oval Office and traveling on Air Force One over the news outlet\u2019s decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico for the body of water Trump had recently renamed the Gulf of America. Other news outlets signaled their support for the AP, with dozens, from CNN to the Washington Post to Fox News, signing a letter urging the White House to reverse its decision. But notably, they continued to show up to press events even as their colleagues at the AP could not. After all, they still had a job to do.\n\nA few days later, the AP sued Trump officials over the ban, a move that greatly pissed off the White House because it had let an AP photographer (but not a reporter) into an event earlier that week as an olive branch. A few days after that, the White House announced it would also determine the participants in the daily presidential press pool, the small group of reporters allowed to observe the president\u2019s actions and record his remarks in small spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, then communicate their reporting to the rest of the corps. The makeup of the pool \u2014 a rotating cast of print and/or online reporters, TV cameramen, and photographers \u2014 has long been decided by the WHCA, which represents hundreds of correspondents, in part to ensure that friendly outlets are not the only ones to get access to the president. The move was intended to allow \u201cnew media\u201d outlets \u201cto share in this awesome responsibility,\u201d said Leavitt, who introduced a \u201cnew media\u201d seat in the briefing room during her first presser that so far has been occupied by various journalists, including Axios\u2019 Mike Allen, Breitbart\u2019s Matt Boyle, and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski.\n\nThe two actions by the White House made it clear that if journalists do anything Trump doesn\u2019t like, they could be kicked out. The implications for the fate of the free press were also clear. \u201cThere will be a chilling effect. People will be much more careful about what questions they shout,\u201d one political reporter said. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a big deal because they don\u2019t understand how Washington works, and they think we\u2019re privileged anyways. And White House reporters are annoying, but it matters who is, on a day-to-day basis, around Trump to ask questions that the administration hasn\u2019t screened or planted.\u201d Especially, they noted, because Trump, unlike many other politicians, will actually give you an answer: \u201cHis advisers will spin you or ignore your calls, but he\u2019ll just say it.\u201d\n\nYet even while reporters agree the White House is way out of line, they don\u2019t agree on how to respond. Initially, WHCA president Eugene Daniels said the association would no longer be facilitating the pool now that it is under White House control and that it would be up to each news organization to decide whether it wanted to participate. Daniels explained that, with the White House controlling the process, the WHCA couldn\u2019t ensure the veracity of the pool reports.\n\nThat decision frustrated some reporters, who felt the WHCA was just picking up its ball and going home. What was the association for \u2014 other than the big fundraising party it throws in April \u2014 if not for a moment like this? \u201cI don\u2019t think the solution is to have the White House control complete access, but the WHCA has shit the bed on this,\u201d one White House reporter said. \u201cWe got an email from Eugene basically being like, \u2018You\u2019re on your own, here\u2019s the questions you should ask the White House,\u2019 and a lot of reporters were like, \u2018You\u2019re the one who is supposed to be asking these questions.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the same time, many also recognize that the association was in a difficult spot, torn between asserting its independence and keeping some semblance of control over the pool. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tough moment, and there are no easy answers for the WHCA and its leaders,\u201d another White House reporter said, while acknowledging that \u201ca lot of us wanted a more vocal, robust response to meet the moment.\u201d Daniels personally is a vulnerable target for right-wing figures in and around the White House as an openly gay Black correspondent for Politico (and soon MSNBC) who was seen as the Kamala Harris whisperer during her presidential run \u2014 the embodiment, in other words, of a woke press corps the White House is keen to push around.\n\nThis week, Daniels seemed to revise his initial guidance and announced a new system would be put in place. Basically, the pool reports will resume (though they won\u2019t be called pool reports) as long as the White House continues to use poolers who are part of the WHCA. But it remains to be seen what the WHCA will do if the White House picks, say, Posobiec to write the pool report. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the WH intends to operate, but on the day that they select someone who is not a part of our rotations, we will need to lean on another constituency such as radio, wires, or TV to assist getting that information out,\u201d Daniels wrote.\n\nSo far, the White House has largely kept things running as it did under the WHCA. But it has added some more friendly faces: right-wing broadcaster Brian Glenn, who dates Marjorie Taylor Greene, was picked to be in the Oval Office during Trump\u2019s disastrous meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Glenn asked the Ukrainian president why he wasn\u2019t wearing a suit. And the other day, the administration kicked a HuffPost reporter out of the pool. The White House then asked The Wall Street Journal if it wanted to take HuffPost\u2019s spot and it said no; later, the White House called Axios, which jumped at the opportunity. \u201cIt really just feels like they\u2019re trying to pit organizations against each other and make people pick sides, and they know that,\u201d one White House reporter said.\n\nThese are among the calculations news outlets are being forced to make internally: Do they take another outlet\u2019s spot if the White House offers it? What happens if they are the ones who get kicked out? Conversations ultimately come back to the bigger question for the press with this administration: How far will they go to preserve their independence? \u201cThat is our larger debate \u2014 do we continue to participate in this pool or not?\u201d said Baker, noting that in doing so, they\u2019re \u201cseemingly giving credibility to a government-run press pool, which is an anathema to us.\u201d He added, however, \u201cIf you back out, it means the only questions being asked of the president end up being of the \u2018Why are you so great?\u2019 variety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the line, and who do you trust? You can be a conservative or liberal organization and still be a trustworthy pooler and journalist,\u201d Baker said. But increasingly, he noted, \u201cyou\u2019re seeing basically inherently political organizations masquerading as news organizations, calling themselves news organizations, and injecting themselves into our pool. And for the viewer at home watching this, it\u2019s confusing. They don\u2019t know the difference between Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s boyfriend and the Washington Post.\u201d Earlier this week, Jessica Reed Kraus, one of the influencers invited to the \u201cEpstein Files\u201d briefing, celebrated her \u201cofficial induction into the White House press pool\u201d as she joined CBS and Bloomberg to observe Melania Trump at the Capitol.\n\nLike members of other groups, journalists are facing a problem of collective action. \u201cIf not all of us do it collectively, does it have an impact? The truth is, getting all the White House reporters to agree is like herding cats,\u201d said Baker. \u201cWe\u2019re competitive; each has our own interests, our own judgments.\u201d And a boycott would just give the White House what it wants.\n\nFor now, reporters appear to be keeping their heads down and hoping the situation won\u2019t get worse. \u201cWe still have access,\u201d one White House reporter said. \u201cIf it turns to a point where the White House is saying CNN can\u2019t come in because they didn\u2019t like what it said, that\u2019s an issue, and the problem is it could turn into that. I don\u2019t know if it has.\u201d After thinking about it for a moment, the reporter added, \u201cWith the exception, obviously, of the AP.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The popular musical Hamilton will be canceling its show at the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center following the Trump administration\u2019s shakeup of the current staff.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last month, President Trump was made chairman of the center following the firing of President Deborah Rutter. In turn, Trump aide and former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell was named interim president while Trump replaced outgoing chair David Rubenstein. As a result of the shakeup, several stars, including superstar soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming, announced they would be cutting ties with the Kennedy Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve treasured the bipartisan support for this institution as a beacon of America at our best,\u201d Fleming said in a statement at the time. \u201cI hope the Kennedy Center continues to flourish and serve the passionate and diverse audience in our nation\u2019s capital and across the country.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, a proponent of left-wing causes, and lead producer Jeffrey Seller said in a joint interview with the New York Times that they believe the Trump administration has moved the Kennedy Center away from its bipartisan routes. The musical had been scheduled to take part in the Kennedy Center\u2019s celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\u201cThis latest action by Trump means it\u2019s not the Kennedy Center as we knew it,\u201d Lin-Manuel Miranda said. \u201cThe Kennedy Center was not created in this spirit, and we\u2019re not going to be a part of it while it is the Trump Kennedy Center. We\u2019re just not going to be part of it.\u201d\n\nSeller added that the creative team behind Hamilton felt that Trump \u201ctook away our national arts center for all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt became untenable for us to participate in an organization that had become so deeply politicized,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kennedy Center is for all of us, and it pains me deeply that they took it over and changed that. They said it\u2019s not for all of us. It\u2019s just for Donald Trump and his crowd. So we made a decision we can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that the Hamilton show on Broadway previously engaged in divisive politics by having its cast members lecture former Vice President Mike Pence when he attended in 2016 after he and Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College.\n\n\u201cWe, sir \u2014 we \u2014 are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\u201d actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who played Aaron Burr, said from the stage at the time. \u201cWe truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf all of us.\u201d\n\nIn response to the cancelation, interim Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell accused Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jeffrey Seller of engaging in a \u201cpublicity stunt that will backfire,\u201d adding that they simply \u201ccan\u2019t be in the same room with Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear on the facts. Seller and [Lin-Manuel] first went to the New York Times before they came to the Kennedy Center with their announcement that they can\u2019t be in the same room with Republicans. This is a publicity stunt that will backfire. The Arts are for everyone \u2013 not just for the people who Lin likes and agrees with. The American people need to know that [Miranda] is intolerant of people who don\u2019t agree with him politically. It\u2019s clear he and Sellers don\u2019t want Republicans going to their shows. Americans see you, Lin,\u201d said Grenell.\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. \u201cBetter than Killers of the Flower Moon,\u201d wrote Mark Judge. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen a story like this before,\u201d wrote Christian Toto.

            "full_content": "A federal appeals court Wednesday said President Donald Trump can fire a top government watchdog in the latest round of a legal fight over the authority to dismiss federal officials.\n\nThe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., put on hold on a lower court\u2019s ruling that found Hampton Dellinger\u2019s termination at the Office of Special Counsel was \u201cunlawful.\u201d The court said it would expedite its review of the ruling, but in the meantime Dellinger can be removed from his post.\n\nThe White House and Dellinger did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.\n\nThe ruling is a temporary win for Trump as his administration seeks to carry out mass firings of federal workers, including nearly two dozen government watchdog officials.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nDellinger, who was special counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, filed a lawsuit against several Trump administration officials last month challenging his dismissal. He argued it violated a federal law that says the president can remove special counsels only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d\n\nThe email outlining his termination did not cite any of the those as the reason for his firing, Dellinger said in his lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThat email made no attempt to comply with the Special Counsel\u2019s for-cause removal protection,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cIt stated simply: \u2018On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately.\u2019\u201d\n\nDellinger began his post in March 2024 after he was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term.\n\nHampton Dellinger, special counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. U.S. Office of Special Counsel via Reuters\n\nAs head of the Office of Special Counsel, Dellinger was tasked with shielding federal employees from prohibited personnel practices, including retaliation for whistleblowing. His office\u2019s work was unrelated to the investigations into Trump led by Jack Smith, whom then-Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed as a special counsel in 2022.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson halted Trump's effort to remove Dellinger and ordered that he be allowed to serve until the end of his term barring inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. She had allowed Dellinger to remain in his post while the case moved through the courts.\n\nJackson appeared to agree with Dellinger's argument that allowing his termination without cause would have a chilling effect among federal workers seeking to lodge complaints through the Office of Special Counsel.\n\n\u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\u201d Jackson wrote in her ruling Saturday. \u201cIt would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department had petitioned the Supreme Court to affirm what it called Trump's right to fire Dellinger, arguing that anything less would infringe on the president's power to manage the executive branch \"in the earliest days of his Administration.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nChaos within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has come to light in a recent court filing showing emails and documents from employees inside the agency amid efforts to dismantle it, illustrating a team scrambling to make do with recent firings and confusion on what work is allowed to be completed.\n\nEmployees were left puzzled following instructions from Russell Vought, the acting director of CFPB, last month explicitly ordering them to stop working altogether and saying that \u201cany urgent matters\u201d would require approval in writing from the bureau\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\nThose instructions kickstarted a flurry of uncertainty and hesitancy behind the scenes that has picked up this week. Mark Paoletta, CFPB chief legal officer, said in an email on Sunday that it had come to his attention that some employees had not been performing statutorily required work.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: Employees should be performing work that is required by law and do not need to seek prior approval to do so,\u201d Paoletta wrote, according to the court filing.\n\nCFPB\u2019s mission is to protect consumers from financial abuses and to serve as the central independent agency for consumer financial protection authorities. President Donald Trump fired the previous director of the CFPB, Rohit Chopra, last month before the agency\u2019s work had been halted. The effort to gut the agency was made apparent with an Elon Musk tweet last month that read: \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d with a tombstone emoji.\n\nAn ensuing court battle has produced the filing with revealing internal emails showing how the agency isn\u2019t meeting its obligations. A federal judge has put in place an order that blocks the agency from making any substantial changes, especially to its data, personnel and funding reserves, but even that is a challenge to comply with, the agency emails reveal.\n\nIn further emails, Cassandra Huggins, CFPB\u2019s principal deputy assistant director of supervision policy and operations, addressed there being \u201cquite a bit of confusion surrounding the message,\u201d while offering her own take on Paoletta\u2019s Sunday email.\n\n\u201cWe have requested and received clarification that their message was not intended to authorize the reinstatement of supervision/examination activity, even though the Bureau is required by law to carry out these activities,\u201d Huggins sent in an email.\n\nHuggins wrote that it was communicated to her that \u201csupervision staff should continue to operate on administrative leave as directed by the Acting Director unless you have received express permission to work on a task.\u201d\n\nHer email contradicted Paoletta\u2019s email request for employees to complete work required by law, leading to more confusion from staff.\n\nIn one instance, John Schroeder, regional director of the Midwest region, apologized for the mixed messaging. \u201cI apologize for the continued confusion being caused by multiple misleading and inconsistent email,\u201d he wrote in an email to staff on Monday.\n\nSince Vought took over as acting director last month, several changes have taken place at the agency, including Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency being granted administrative access to CFPB systems, the agency terminating contracts with multiple expert witnesses it had hired in cases against companies accused of hurting consumers and DOGE deleting the watchdog\u2019s X account.\n\nCNN has reached out to CFPB and DOGE for comment.\n\nA flurry of challenges\n\nThe recent filing showcases the problems CFPB employees have endured as the Trump administration has attempted to wind the agency down, including the inability to do certain basic tasks because of the number of employees that have been fired.\n\nJason Brown, an assistant research director, highlighted in a Monday email \u201ca few challenges\u201d they were facing while resuming their work, including a loss of personnel from firings that \u201cimpacts our ability to complete assignments as planned\u201d and a loss of research tools, such as their qualitative researcher contract and lab contracts.\n\nBrown also highlighted a loss of data, as several of their contracts were cancelled and questions surrounded the location of some data, as well as a loss of IT resources.\n\n\u201cSeveral contracts that have supported our work have been cancelled. We have seen some impairment in our ability to do our work, and in some cases we can\u2019t tell if the struggles we\u2019re facing are because of cancelled contracts or glitches, and the people who would ordinarily help us out have themselves been terminated,\u201d he wrote in the email.\n\nOne employee requested to fix the CFPB homepage, which had been showing a \u201c404: Page not found\u201d error. The CFPB employee claimed the error message had been showing since February 7.\n\n\u201cI believe this negatively impacts our statutorily mandated reporting requirements (eg for research) and subverts the statutorily mandated initiatives developed for consumer education and engagement,\u201d the employee wrote.\n\nChief Information Officer Christopher Chilbert acknowledged the issue wasn\u2019t authorized to be restored at the time, saying in an email response, \u201cI believe it is important to restore the homepage as soon as possible, but that is not currently authorized.\u201d\n\nIn another instance, Chilbert claimed the agency would \u201close all historical data on our Google Analytics platform if we don\u2019t pay the bill.\u201d This was typically done with a government card, but new restrictions had been placed on using it.\n\nAsked what needed to be done to pay the bill, Chief Financial Officer Jafnar Gueye said using the card would require an approved exception and sent a list of questions to justify the purchase.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Friday! Somehow it is already the last day of February. In today\u2019s edition, we break down the fallout at home and abroad from today\u2019s White House meeting between Donald Trump, JD Vance and Volodymyr Zelenskyy that devolved into a shouting match.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe Oval Office showdown heard round the world\n\nA White House meeting that was intended to kick off negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals devolved this afternoon into a remarkable confrontation, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn\u2019t grateful enough to the United States, Rebecca Shabad and Nnamdi Egwuonwu report.\n\nThe Oval Office shouting match has for now shattered hopes for the minerals deal, which Trump and his allies had presented as an important step forward for Ukraine on the road to peace with Russia more than three years after the war began.\n\nA White House official told NBC News that Trump and other U.S. officials felt disrespected and asked Zelenskyy to leave the White House, saying that he was not welcome back on Friday. Zelenskyy abruptly departed and a planned joint news conference between the two leaders was called off.\n\nThe exchange underscored the tension that has emerged between the United States and Ukraine \u2014 along with many of its European allies \u2014 over the tougher line that Trump has taken toward the country since coming into office. (More on what this all means for Zelenskyy below.)\n\nVance\u2019s role: As Henry J. Gomez notes, it was a comment from Vance that sparked the unexpected, full-blown, high-volume argument for the world to watch.\n\nIt was a sign of how Vance, who as a senator was known for his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine, is asserting himself on matters of foreign policy immediately as vice president. Earlier this month, Vance made waves at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that took sharp aim at other world leaders. And on Thursday, the day before tangling with Zelenskyy, Vance mixed it up in an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 albeit in a much lighter tone.\n\nA source familiar with the planning for the Trump meeting said there was no predetermined strategy for Vance to confront Zelenskyy the way he did. Vance, the source added, felt compelled to respond after finding Zelenskyy needlessly provocative in his demeanor.\n\n\u201cNo one expected Zelenskyy to come in there and act entitled,\u201d said this person, who added that the expectation was the Oval Office meeting would go off like a typical bilateral meeting.\n\nHow Republicans are responding: GOP lawmakers largely rallied around Trump and Vance. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been a staunch supporter of aiding Ukraine, said he doesn\u2019t know if Trump and Zelenskyy can \u201crepair the damage\u201d and resume peace talks.\n\n\u201cHe either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change,\u201d Graham said of Zelenskyy.\n\nA few more moderate House Republicans, though, struck a different tone. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told NBC News that the heated exchange was \u201ca bad day for America\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called the meeting a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for both countries and said \u201cthe only winner of today is Vladimir Putin.\u201d And Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., called the day\u2019s events \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and said both sides should return to the negotiating table.\n\nHow Democrats are responding: Democrats universally slammed Trump and Vance, accusing them of kowtowing to Putin. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said during an interview on MSNBC that \u201cthis is the beginning of the end. Putin starts not only walking all over Ukraine, but walking all over Europe.\u201d\n\nAn earlier meeting Friday between Zelenskyy and senators was \u201cvery bipartisan and very supportive,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. Asked about the more rancorous tone in the Oval Office, Whitehouse said: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for letting Vance in the room.\u201d\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s dilemma on display in Oval Office clash\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nThe heated clash between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office has raised new questions about the prospects for peace in Ukraine. And it underscored the dilemma facing Zelenskyy as he tries to end his country\u2019s three-year war with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy has tried to stress the need for American support, while also warning that Ukraine must be involved in any peace negotiations and that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted.\n\nWhen I sat down with Zelenskyy earlier this month, he made it clear that the stakes are high.\n\n\u201cIt will be very, very, very difficult,\u201d Zelenskyy said when asked if Ukraine could survive without U.S. military support. \u201cAnd, of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance, low chance to survive without support of the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd the Ukrainian president seemed to choose his words carefully during our interview when asked if Trump was negotiating in good faith, saying, \u201cI hope so. Yes, I count on it. I count on it very much.\u201d\n\nBut today, Zelenskyy was defiant, with tensions between him and Trump reaching a boiling point at the White House.\n\nThe confrontation left more questions than answers about the path forward for peace in Ukraine. Will the U.S. still be involved in any potential ceasefire negotiations? Can those talks succeed if the U.S. is not involved? And could Ukraine lose the U.S. as an ally?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think that we will not be strategic partners,\u201d Zelenskyy told me earlier this month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it because it will make a pressure on morale \u2014 morality of Ukrainians and it will be worst thing from the very beginning of the war.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Oval Office clash also raises questions about the future of U.S. alliances with its traditional European partners, many of whom rallied around Ukraine.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed solidarity with Ukraine in social media posts after the meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron said, \u201cI think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so. And when I say \u2018we,\u2019 I mean the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others.\u201d\n\nWe will explore all of this and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83d\udcdd Next up: Trump is expected to sign an executive order aimed at making English the official language of the U.S. It would be the first time in history the country would have an official language.

            "full_content": "European allies were quick to stand up for Ukraine after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance openly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a sharply contentious Oval Office meeting Friday.\n\nZelenskyy and his Ukrainian team were told to leave the White House earlier than planned Friday and an important minerals agreement went unsigned, a White House official said, after a heated exchange in which Mr. Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being insufficiently grateful for U.S. support. The president told Zelenskyy he's \"gambling with World War III\" and did not acknowledge Russia's role in its assault on Ukraine.\n\nRussia immediately praised the president and vice president's admonishments of Zelenskyy. After the televised showdown, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia's security council, backed Mr. Trump on X: \"The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,\" the Russian official said of Zelenskyy. \"And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'\"\n\nEuropean allies leapt to defend Ukraine, and Zelenskyy reshared on X over 20 of their social media posts and thanked them.\n\n\"Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\" wrote Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council. \"Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You will never be alone, dear President @ZelenskyyUa.\"\n\n\"There is an aggressor: Russia,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X, in a translated post. \"There is a people under attack: Ukraine. We were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago and to continue to do so.\"\n\n\"Luxembourg stands with Ukraine,\" wrote Luc Frieden, prime minister of Luxembourg.\n\nThank you for your support. https://t.co/8miNebF718 \u2014 Volodymyr Zelenskyy / \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (@ZelenskyyUa) February 28, 2025\n\nCongressional Republicans have mostly fallen in line behind Mr. Trump, denouncing Zelenskyy's demeanor in the Oval Office meeting, while others have remained silent.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has been supportive of Ukraine, condemned Zelenskyy. Graham said he spoke with the Ukrainian leader Friday morning and warned him \"don't take the bait.\"\n\n\"I don't know if we could ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham told reporters outside the White on Friday. \"He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Washington, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, echoed the call for Zelenskyy to resign \"for the good of his country.\"\n\n\"Whatever your view on what happened in today's bizarre televised WH diplomatic meeting, the West needs US and Ukrainian leadership trust on confronting Russia. After today, that likely requires a new Ukrainian leader,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nRepublican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, however, defended Ukraine.\n\n\"A bad day for America's foreign policy. Ukraine wants independence, free markets and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West,\" he told CBS News. \"Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, a staunch Ukraine ally who serves as co-chair of the House Ukraine Caucus, said the meeting was \"heartbreaking\" to watch.\n\n\"It is time to put understandable emotions aside and come back to the negotiation table. This can and will be fixed,\" he said in a statement. \"I am confident that the parties will reconvene in pursuit of a mutually agreeable solution that best serves the interests of the United States of America and Ukraine. This is the only acceptable outcome.\"\n\nRepublican senators who have been supportive of Ukraine and not shy against disagreeing with Mr. Trump have yet to share their opinions, including Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nThe House or Senate were not in session Friday, making it more likely that lawmakers will be asked about the meeting in their districts or states over the weekend or when they return to the Capitol on Monday.\n\nDemocrats in Congress widely criticized Mr. Trump, calling him \"a useful idiot for Putin\" and \"an embarrassment.\"\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was among the bipartisan group of senators who talked with Zelenskyy just before his White House visit and posted a hopeful picture before the fateful White House meeting.\n\nReally good bipartisan meeting before President Zelensky heads to the White House. We stand with Ukraine.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 pic.twitter.com/s5NJx0BcKZ \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) February 28, 2025\n\nAfterward, Klobuchar responded to Vance on X that \"Zelenskyy has thanked our country over and over again both privately and publicly.\"\n\n\"And our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of Europe,\" she added. \"Shame on you.\"\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had thrown \"a temper tantrum in the Oval Office.\"\n\n\"This is just the latest in a string of alarming gestures made by Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin \u2014 excluding Ukraine and our allies from negotiations, refusing to hold Russia accountable for its invasion, parroting Kremlin propaganda, attempting to extort Ukraine at gunpoint, and siding with Russia at the UN. It's a dangerous pattern of deference to a dictator who seeks to undermine democracy worldwide,\" Meeks said.\n\n\"It is not President Zelensky who disrespected the United States in the Oval Office,\" he continued. \"It was Donald Trump-behaving exactly like the two-bit mob boss we've known him to be.\"\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, characterized Mr. Trump's conduct as \"downright un-American.\""

You don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said, adding a bit later, \u201cYou gotta be more thankful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you said thank you once this entire meeting?\u201d Vance asked.\n\nTrump might have been referring to Zelensky\u2019s posture toward Trump in particular, as Vance appeared to be. But as their heated exchange with Zelensky reverberates around the world, it\u2019s worth noting that Zelensky has thanked the United States on numerous occasions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 \u2013 expressing gratitude to Trump and President Joe Biden, to members of Congress from both parties, to US defense companies and their employees, and to the American people.\n\nAfter Zelensky left the White House on Friday, he wrote on X: \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\u201d\n\nHere are 33 previous examples of Zelensky thanking or expressing gratitude toward the United States, its officials or its people for their support. This is not a comprehensive list. Notably, we did not review Zelensky\u2019s many domestic remarks in Ukrainian.\n\nJanuary 21, 2022, on X: \u201cThank you @POTUS for the unprecedented (American) diplomatic and military assistance for (Ukraine).\u201d\n\nJuly 1, 2022, on X: \u201cI commend US historic decision to provide UA with new security assistance package, including modern air defense systems.

            "full_content": "After watching the Oval Office exchange on Friday between President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and their invited guest, Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 I\u2019m feeling some unusually visceral thoughts about my country. Betrayal, anger, embarrassment. Shame.\n\nTrump and Vance\u2019s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light.\n\nWe already know the post-World War II order is over. The U.S. voted against its allies \u2014 and with the dictatorships of North Korea and Belarus \u2014 at the United Nations this week, opposing a resolution condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and occupying about 20% of its land. We\u2019ve already heard Trump praise Russian President Vladimir Putin (many times) and call Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator.\u201d At a Cabinet meeting this week, Trump dismissed pleas from our NATO allies, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to provide a \u201cbackstop\u201d security guarantee in Ukraine, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have Europe do that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and Vance\u2019s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light, making it plain that our government is no longer a worthy ally to liberal democracies around the world.\n\nZelenskyy expressed his appreciation to Trump for what he described as a \u201cfirst step toward real security guarantees\u201d for Ukraine, while also insisting there should be \u201cno compromises\u201d with the \u201ckiller\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d Putin. Shortly after, Trump said that Zelenskyy ought to be more \u201cgrateful\u201d and that his \u201chatred\u201d for Putin makes it \u201ctough to make a deal.\u201d\n\nDeclaring himself a peacenik, Trump wrongly claimed his position \u2014 which is essentially to pre-emptively hand over Ukraine\u2019s bargaining chips at the negotiating table, give Putin whatever he wants and take him at his word that he won\u2019t reinvade \u2014 is more in line with Europe and the world\u2019s sentiments than Zelenskyy\u2019s.\n\nTrump, typically incoherent, rambled and repeated himself, so his vice president helpfully stepped in, saying Putin invaded Ukraine because then-President Joe Biden was weak and \u201cthe path to peace and prosperity is diplomacy.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy, armed with facts to counter Vance\u2019s MAGA rhetoric, noted that Putin first invaded Ukraine in 2014 (Trump incorrectly tried to correct him, saying it was 2015), and that he occupied Crimea and had been aggressing on Ukrainian territory ever since, including the four years of Trump\u2019s first term. He also noted that Putin\u2019s brutal 2022 invasion was itself a violation of a previous ceasefire \u2014 bringing further absurdity to the idea that Putin\u2019s promises for \u201cpeace\u201d can be trusted.\n\nThat was when Vance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media. Vance barked that he should be thanking Trump and not attacking the administration that is \u201ctrying to prevent the destruction of your country.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy, remarkably, kept his cool, trying to get in a word over the shouts of Trump and Vance, warning them that even though the U.S. has an ocean between itself and Europe, that the country would \u201cfeel\u201d the consequences of capitulating to Russia \u201cin the future.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when it completely went off the rails.\n\nVance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as \u2018disrespectful\u2019 for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media.\n\nTrump bellowed, \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III\u201d and attempted to humiliate Zelenskyy by saying \u201cyou don\u2019t have the cards.\u201d (The Ukrainian president replied that he\u2019s not playing cards, he\u2019s fighting a war.) Trump did a mock impersonation of Zelenskyy saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want a ceasefire!\u201d Vance said Zelenskyy should have raised his objections in private and not in front of the media, adding, \u201cWe know that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump what would happen if Putin broke a future ceasefire, the leader of the free world replied, \u201cWhat if a bomb drops on your head right now?\u201d before going on another incoherent rant about how Putin himself had suffered through the \u201cphony witch hunt\u201d and blamed the \u201cRussia Russia Russia\u201d investigation on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and \u201cshifty Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nHe then turned to Zelenskyy and said, \u201cI\u2019ve empowered you to be a tough guy and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be a tough guy without the United States,\u201d adding that if he doesn\u2019t \u201cmake a deal\u201d with Putin \u2014 the U.S. is \u201cout.\u201d Then Trump abruptly ended the press conference, noting \u201cthis is going to be great television.\u201d As reporters were shunted out of the room, Vance reassuringly patted his boss on the arm.\n\nMinutes after the meeting ended, Trump posted to his social media site Truth Social: \u201cI have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\u201d Trump also reportedly kicked Zelenskyy out of the White House.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s nominal president during the four years from 2008-12 when Putin pretended he wasn\u2019t actually in power, posted to X: \u201cThe insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is \u2018gambling with WWIII.\u2019\u201d\n\nThose few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 who sat silently next to Vance during the Oval Office fiasco \u2014 in February 2022 tweeted: \u201cThe people of #Ukraine are tough people who will NEVER accept being ruled by #Putin \u2026 Men, women, children, the elderly, they are going to fight \u2026 And they are going to maim & kill alot [sic] of Russians.\u201d Now that he works for Trump, Rubio posted this on Friday: \u201cThank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not one for extensive self-flagellating over America\u2019s many flaws. There are sins committed by this country\u2019s government and its people, both recent and historic, that can never be fully atoned for \u2014 but which we should always be working to understand and strive to never repeat. Still, I don\u2019t walk around life thinking the United States is irredeemable. \u200b\u200bFar from it, actually. On the ledger of history and in broad terms, I believe we\u2019ve been more right than we\u2019ve been wrong.\n\nAnd yet, those few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nOur president, for almost a century known as the \u201cLeader of the Free World,\u201d has abandoned that post. We, as represented by our government, offer support only in mafia-esque transactional terms (\u201cYou give us your nation\u2019s natural resources, and we\u2019ll protect you, maybe\u201d). Our leaders parrot the propaganda of an imperialist dictator who has acted as one of America\u2019s primary adversaries over the past two and a half decades. And a democratic ally that has miraculously survived an existential attack by its nuclear-armed neighbor for three years was humiliated on the world stage and essentially blamed for fighting back against Putin\u2019s aggression.\n\nMost perversely, the president\u2019s admirers call this \u201cdiplomacy\u201d and acting toward \u201cpeace.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say \u201cwe\u2019re the bad guys,\u201d but it\u2019s not at all too soon to say \u201cwe\u2019re on the side of the bad guys\u201d \u2014 and historic alliances and mutual values mean nothing to us anymore. The \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d is a gangster\u2019s paradise. It\u2019s a shameful day for America."

I say this because every day, me and my children have said a prayer for the Holy Father. We pray for his health, and we pray for his comfort as he deals with what appears to be a pretty serious health crisis,\u201d he said, continuing to extend grace to the pope and expressing that he does not need to be brought into every \u201cculture war\u201d in American politics.\n\nPope Francis, 88, has been hospitalized for two weeks with pneumonia and is reportedly in critical condition. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni paid him a visit at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome last week, Breitbart News reported.\n\nExplaining how Trump\u2019s foreign policy is aligned with the Catholic faith, Vance highlighted the administration\u2019s striving for peace and religious freedom:\n\n\u201cOne of the most important parts of President Trump\u2019s policy, and where I think President Trump\u2019s policy is most in accord with Christian social teaching and with the Catholic faith, is that more than any president of my lifetime, President Trump has pursued a path of peace,\u201d Vance stated. \u201cAnd we very often, I think, ignore the way in which our foreign policy is either an instrument or impediment to people all over the world being able to practice their faith.\u201d\n\nBringing up how Christians all over the world are being persecuted, namely in Nigeria, Vance said, \u201cThe Trump administration promises you, whether it\u2019s here at home with our own citizens, or all over the world, we will be the biggest defenders of religious liberties and the rights of conscience.\u201d\n\nVance also highlighted the need to \u201cprotect the religious liberty of Christians\u201d when dealing with conflicts in Europe and the Middle East:\n\nWhen President Trump talks about the need to bring peace, whether it\u2019s in Russia and Ukraine, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East, we of course have to recognize that as a policy oriented toward saving lives and carrying out one of Christ\u2019s most important Commandments. But I think we also must recognize that as an effort to protect the religious liberty of Christians, because over the last 40 years, it has often been historical christian communities who bare the brunt of failed American foreign policy and that is in my view, perhaps the most important way in which Donald Trump has been a defender of Christian rights all over the world.\n\nSpeaking on the \u201camazing\u201d thing that happened to him in November 2024, Vance brought up his young son\u2019s baptism as the most exciting event he experienced \u2014 even more so than winning the election:\n\nAnd when I think about the deep things, the things that really matter, there was something really amazing that happened to me in November of 2024. All my friends were there, all my family was there, we were gathered together in a great moment of celebration. And of course, I\u2019m talking about when my seven-year-old chose to be baptized into the Christian faith. \u2026 As amazing as it was to win the election, of course, in November of 2024, and as amazing as it was to know that President Trump would become president again and would get to accomplish so many good things for the American people, the thing that I was most excited about in November of 2024, is that the week after we won the election, my son chose to be baptized in the Christian faith.\n\nEmphasizing his interfaith marriage with second lady Usha Vance, the vice president described how much it meant to him when his seven-year-old son, Ewan, chose to be baptized into the Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cAs many of you know, I am part of an interfaith marriage. My wife, though she comes to church with us almost every single Sunday, she is not Catholic herself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd so, the bargain that we have struck is that we will raise our kids Catholic, but we will let them choose the moment that they want to ultimately become baptized.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if that\u2019s terrible sacrilege, blame the Dominicans because they\u2019re the ones who came up with this scheme,\u201d he joked."

            "full_content": "Drama in the Oval Office. Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe may never know whether Friday\u2019s bizarre contretemps in the Oval Office involving Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy was totally planned, entirely spontaneous, or something in between. From a transactional point of view, it sure looked like Vice-President Vance was determined to pick a fight with the Ukrainian president, or at least underline the contention that Ukraine did not adequately understand its unique debt to Trump or the folly of other American presidents. But did the incident serve any useful purpose to anyone? Is Trump privately dressing down Vance for spoiling a nice mineral-deal signing, press conference, and photo op?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Whatever the moment meant in terms of the rapidly evolving strategic situation of Russia and Ukraine, and the prospects for some kind of sustainable peace, the brouhaha nicely served the Trump administration\u2019s domestic political needs. It helped dramatize the ongoing MAGA effort to get Americans to stop thinking of Ukraine and its leader as courageous victims of Russian aggression, and start thinking of Ukrainians as disrespectful ingrates. Vance repeatedly browbeat Zelenskyy for failing to adequately thank the American people for their past support of Ukraine (support that Trump angrily denounced as the work of a \u201cstupid president\u201d named Biden) even as the Ukrainian president tried to cite his many expressions of gratitude.\n\nThe Oval Office setting was perfect for this projection of Trump as the generous host whose uncouth guest had tracked mud onto the carpet and wiped his grubby paws on the ornate sofa. This impression was reinforced by a nasty question to Zelenskyy from Brian Glenn of the very Trump-y Real America\u2019s Voice network demanding to know why the leader of that war-torn country wasn\u2019t wearing a suit:\n\nUkraine\u2019s enemies, of course, piled on immediately:\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova: \"How did Trump and Vance hold back from smacking that bastard \u2013 it's a marvel of restraint\" \u2014 max seddon (@maxseddon) February 28, 2025\n\nBut Trump fans brayed about the president\u2019s courage in the face of such incredibly rude insolence:\n\nThank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America First. America is with you! \u2014 Secretary Marco Rubio (@SecRubio) February 28, 2025\n\nAnd even more telling, at least one prominent Republican backer of a U.S.-Ukraine alliance got the memo and back-peddled madly, as The Hill reported:\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, who has been one of the most outspoken advocates for supporting the Ukraine war effort, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the heated exchange between President Trump, Vice-President Vance, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Friday \u2026\n\nGraham said it\u2019s now a major question whether the United States can continue to support Ukraine if Zelenskyy remains president.\n\n\u201cThe question for me is, \u2018Is he redeemable in the eyes of Americans?\u2019 Most Americans witnessing what they saw today would not want Zelenskyy to be their business partner, including me, and I\u2019ve been to Ukraine nine times since the war started,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what happens now; Trump left the door open for a resumption of talks if Zelenskyy got his head screwed on straight:\n\nNew statement from Trump: \"...I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America\u2026 \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) February 28, 2025\n\nBut the incident and the Trumpworld spin on it are significant steps toward a revolution in perceptions wherein Ukraine is seen as the world\u2019s great trouble-maker even as the U.S. and Russia work toward peace. All those Americans with Ukrainian flags hanging from their porches can expect some fresh contempt from their MAGA neighbors."

            "full_content": "On a Monday in August 2013, I sat for coffee with a colleague from The Washington Post when suddenly my phone buzzed. Our paper had been sold to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. We were shocked \u2014 and uncertain. How would Bezos run a newspaper? How much control would he expect over our coverage? Would he replace us all with Amazon Echos?\n\nBezos, though, promised no upheaval. \u201cThe values of The Post do not need changing,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Post employees that same day. \u201cThe paper\u2019s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.\u201d And for years that proved true. Through the end of my time at the Post\u2019s Opinions section, in 2022, I cannot recall a single instance of interference in the section\u2019s product.\n\nBut more than a decade on, Bezos has decided that \u201cthe values of The Post\u201d do need changing. Its duty will no longer be to its readers, but to his private interests \u2014 and to propping up a myth about capitalism and freedom.\n\nIt is entirely fitting that Bezos would ignore the free market even as he praises it.\n\nThe last several months have been a turbulent time for the Post, and particularly its Opinions section, with several controversies concerning readers and staffers alike. Just days before the presidential election, Bezos blocked the editorial board\u2019s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. Last month, my colleague from that August 2013 coffee \u2014 cartoonist Ann Telnaes \u2014 resigned after Opinions editor David Shipley declined to run her cartoon of billionaires, including Bezos, bowing to Trump. Two weeks later, Bezos joined other tech oligarchs in prominent seating at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, he declared a new party line for the paper\u2019s Opinions section, prompting Shipley\u2019s resignation. \u201cWe are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,\u201d Bezos announced. \u201cWe\u2019ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\u201d\n\nThe focus on \u201cfree markets,\u201d however, is especially ironic. Washington Post customers already signaled they do not want what Bezos is selling. His hires for executive positions have been largely failures. NPR reports that despite \u201caggressively\u201d wooing new subscribers since the spiked endorsement, the Post has suffered \u201ca net loss of a couple hundred thousand subscribers\u201d \u2014 a larger number than all but a handful of American newspapers. And as Shipley reportedly reminded Bezos, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page already fills the \u201cliberty and free markets\u201d viewpoint that Bezos claims is \u201cunderserved.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ratings and traffic for liberal opinion media (including MSNBC) are rising. Wired magazine added more than 60,000 subscriptions in just the first two weeks of February thanks to its aggressive coverage of Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nYet it is entirely fitting that Bezos would ignore the free market even as he praises it, because he has risen and thrived under a capitalist system that pays lip service to free markets but is far from that in practice.\n\nBezos and his ilk want to cement the status quo that enrages so many Americans.\n\nAmazon and other technology titans, from Microsoft to Apple to Meta to Tesla, thrive not in the face of competition but because of the lack of it. None of these companies are complete monopolies, but they all dominate one or more sectors and can leverage their sheer scale against competitors and even customers. The very model of Silicon Valley venture capital firms \u2014 which have produced far more failed startups than successes \u2014 depends on the idea that when a venture does succeed, it doesn\u2019t just capture some good business; it captures all or nearly all of that market.\n\nAnd when that private sector power isn\u2019t enough, Bezos and other oligarchs leverage their influence to get your dollars \u2014 more specifically, your taxpayer dollars. Federal contracts provide billions of dollars to Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud computing division that generated more than half of Amazon\u2019s profits in 2023. Author Ed Niedermeyer points out that Elon Musk\u2019s companies have received more in government subsidies, loans and contracts than Tesla, his only profitable company, has created in income in its entire existence. As for government regulators, those weren\u2019t already captured are being torn down.\n\nIf not \u201cfree markets,\u201d then what is Bezos arguing for? As the Bulwark\u2019s Jonathan Last argued earlier this week, the tech oligarchs are trying to bring the \u201cwinner take all\u201d (or \u201cnearly all\u201d) mindset to politics. \u201cDemocracy represents competition,\u201d Last wrote, \u201cand they are \u2014 quite openly \u2014 anti-competitive.\u201d\n\nBezos and his ilk want to cement the status quo that enrages so many Americans: what Martin Luther King Jr. called \u201csocialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.\u201d An independent press, Bezos has decided, is an obstacle to that goal. And if that decision entails torching the credibility of a paper that once took down a president, he\u2019ll happily pay that price to hoard his wealth."

            "full_content": "Senators Ron Wyden and Mike Crapo don\u2019t see eye to eye about how to \u201cscore\u201d tax cuts. Photo: Shuran Huang/The New York Times/Redux\n\nAside from the ongoing smash-and-grab operations by which Elon Musk and DOGE are seeking by fiat to create a federal government to their liking, the main drama in Trump\u2019s Washington right now involves tortured efforts to make the fiscal arithmetic of his agenda add up to something other than a catastrophe. The single biggest problem facing congressional Republicans is how to find ways to pay for Trump\u2019s tax-cut promises, which could add as much as $10 trillion to a national-debt burden they already profess to be intolerable. Yes, they can and will cut federal spending as much as the political market can bear and will hope to pocket any savings wrung from federal programs and personnel by DOGE. But it won\u2019t be enough.\n\nSo Senate Republicans, who are particularly invested in Trump\u2019s tax-cut agenda, are eyeing one very big gimmick \u2014 perhaps more accurately called a lie \u2014 to hide the cost, as NBC News reports:\n\nRepublicans are considering a far-reaching change to the budget process that would obscure the deficit impact of extending President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar tax cuts in order to avoid paying for them.\n\nIt comes as part of a massive bill to advance Trump\u2019s agenda that Republicans are seeking to pass on a party-line basis. If the tactic is successful, it would upend long-standing precedent and change the accounting process for current and future lawmakers, with major policy stakes.\n\nExtending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in 2017, would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the official nonpartisan scorekeeper. That\u2019s under the \u201ccurrent law\u201d metric that has traditionally been used, as the tax cuts are slated to expire at the end of this year. But Senate Republicans want to use a different scoring method called the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline, which would assume that extending tax cuts costs $0 because they\u2019re already law.\n\nIn other words, close to half of the cost of Trump\u2019s tax agenda would magically become free.\n\nThe argument that the 2017 tax cuts are baked into the cake of the federal budget is seductive, but there\u2019s a big problem: When they were first enacted, they were made temporary in order to avoid busting the budget egregiously. They weren\u2019t \u201cfree\u201d then and thus cannot be \u201cfree\u201d now. Extending them will, in fact, cost trillions of dollars more than letting them expire, which is exactly what current law provides.\n\nThe fiscal watchdogs of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget call changing the treatment of the tax cuts scheduled to expire \u201cnihilistic, ahistorical, and inaccurate.\u201d But the switcheroo sounds good to Republicans struggling to make the math work. In particular, the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by Mike Crapo of Idaho, is promoting the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d scam because it makes his assigned task of bringing Trump\u2019s tax agenda to fruition immensely easier. And though Democrats are howling about the deception (the Finance Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Oregon\u2019s Ron Wyden, called it \u201ca phony, fake concept\u201d), they may in their heart of hearts hope it happens in order to reduce the pressure for spending cuts.\n\nPartisan opposition aside, there are multiple obstacles to the realization of this GOP scheme. Most important, the Senate parliamentarian could rule that it violates the \u201cscoring\u201d rules governing the congressional budget process. In theory, the Senate majority can overrule such decisions, but it rarely, if ever, happens and, in this case, stealth would likely be necessary to achieve a sudden multitrillion-dollar shift in the assumptions underlying the enactment of the Trump administration\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\nAnother possible problem is that deficit hawks within the GOP could object to a cost-free package of tax cuts. The NBC News story on the scam quoted the ever-irascible Texas representative Chip Roy as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like gimmicks, so I\u2019m trying to wrestle with that.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the biggest problem with wishing away the costs of Trump\u2019s tax cuts is that the real-world arbiters of fiscal matters and their impact, like the Federal Reserve Board and the financial markets, generally are not going to be fooled by it and could take countervailing actions to hedge against the presumably inflationary effect of more deficit and debt. Two plus two does not, in fact, equal nine, and pretending it does is a really bad idea, particularly when the goal is high-end tax cuts that aren\u2019t popular anyway."

Photo: Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAt congressional town halls across the country over the past few weeks, Republican members of Congress have been met with anger from voters over the hastily applied cuts to federal agencies and mass layoffs led by Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nThe scenes, which have taken place in ruby-red districts from Georgia to Missouri, quickly prompted comparisons to the tea-party movement of the late aughts or the early years of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, in which the opposition party rode waves of palpable voter discontent to improved margins in subsequent elections.\n\nBut those public displays could soon be coming to an end if Republican leaders have their say. The Wall Street Journal reports that Representative Richard Hudson, the head of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, warned members in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday that the protests will likely get worse and urged them to move away from in-person town hall events. Per Punchbowl News, the NRCC chair suggested utilizing tele-town halls, claiming that Democrats can use the in-person gatherings to stage a viral disruption.\n\nWhile counseling members to avoid such scenes, Republican leaders are also downplaying them \u2014 and getting conspiratorial. During a CNN interview last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that Democrats are actually to blame for the rancor.\n\n\u201cThe videos you saw of the town halls were for paid protesters in many of those places. These are Democrats who went to the events early and filled up the seats,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson continued, \u201cThis is an old playbook that they pulled out and ran, and it made it look like that what is happening in Washington is unpopular. But I\u2019m gonna tell you, Kaitlan, the American people are behind what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, Punchbowl News reported that some of the protests appear to have been organized by MoveOn.org and Indivisible, two progressive organizations that stand in clear opposition of Trump\u2019s and Musk\u2019s joint ambitions. But there\u2019s currently no evidence of paid attendees at these events.\n\nIt seems some Republicans have already had enough. On Saturday, Representative Roger Marshall of Kansas ended a town hall in his district early after being grilled on the recent federal cuts, calling the assembled crowd \u201cone of the rudest audiences I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) ends his constituent town hall early today after being pressed about DOGE firing veterans. pic.twitter.com/s8U0w7Gxgq \u2014 Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) March 1, 2025\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if congressional Republicans will heed their leaders\u2019s advice. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sunday that several Georgia members still planned to hold in-person town halls even after their colleague Rich McCormick\u2019s event went viral in late February due to anger from voters in attendance."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nA remarkable shouting match broke out in the Oval Office Friday as President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, an extraordinarily fractious display that only underscored the deeply uncertain future of American assistance to Kyiv.\n\nNever before has an American president verbally attacked his visitor like Trump did Zelensky, leading to an almost real-time breakdown in relations between Washington and Kyiv. Trump at one point threatened to give up on Ukraine entirely.\n\nCastigating Zelensky for not demonstrating enough gratitude for American support, Trump and Vice President JD Vance raised their voices, accusing the besieged leader of standing in the way of a peace agreement with Russia. Later, he was essentially kicked out of the White House and departed with a grim look on his face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right now, not really in a very good position. You\u2019ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,\u201d Trump told the Ukrainian president. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing cards,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What Kaitlan Collins saw during fiery Trump-Zelensky argument 01:55 - Source: CNN What Kaitlan Collins saw during fiery Trump-Zelensky argument 01:55\n\nRaising his voice, after more back-and-forth, Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Vance accused Zelensky of being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d toward his American hosts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not acting all that thankful,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\u201cHave you said \u2018thank you\u2019 once?\u201d Vance asked Zelensky.\n\nAfterward, Trump huddled with his key advisers inside the Oval Office to assess the situation, including Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThat was when Trump ultimately decided Zelensky was \u201cnot in a place to negotiate.\u201d He directed Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver the message: it was time for Zelensky to leave.\n\nThe Ukrainians were holding nearby in a separate room, which is standard when a foreign leader visits the White House. Typically, they go to other rooms, then reconvene for lunch.\n\nBut the Ukrainians wouldn\u2019t be dining at the White House Friday. Plates of spring green salad, rosemary roasted chicken and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e went untouched by the Ukrainian guests.\n\nAs the prepared food sat nearby on carts in a hallway outside the press secretary\u2019s office, the Ukrainians were instructed to leave.\n\nThe White House official said the Ukrainians protested and wanted to continue the talks. But they were told no.\n\nZelensky left shortly thereafter. He has canceled his planned afternoon speech at the Hudson Institute, an official with the think tank announced to attendees.\n\nA scheduled joint press conference was scrapped and Zelensky departed the White House in his black SUV without signing a planned agreement on providing US access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals. Trump posted online that his counterpart was not welcome back until he was \u201cready for peace.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration moved quickly on Friday to try to turn the diplomatic uproar into a sign of strength, dispatching allies like South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham to the cameras outside the West Wing to call on Zelensky to apologize. The White House issued a statement saying: \u201cPresident Trump and VP Vance are standing up for Americans.\u201d\n\nNow, Zelensky will leave Washington with the fate of his country, and his own future as its leader, in doubt.\n\nAhead of his arrival, Trump had already voiced open hostility toward Zelensky, whom he termed a dictator. Yet he seemed to moderate his tone a day earlier, declining to repeat the criticism.\n\nBut the tense 10-minute exchange in the Oval Office went well beyond any of the usual diplomatic rifts, allowing the gulf between the men to play out publicly in front of television cameras. It was about as angry as Trump has ever allowed himself to be seen in public.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either going to make a deal or we\u2019re out,\u201d the US president said, adding later: \u201cIf we\u2019re out, you\u2019ll fight it out. I don\u2019t think it will be pretty.\u201d\n\nVance, who has often sat silently in Oval Office meetings during the opening weeks of his vice presidency, sparked tension with the visiting Ukrainian leader. Before joining Trump on the ticket last year, the freshman Ohio senator was among the loudest GOP critics of assistance to Ukraine \u2013 skepticism that he has carried into the White House.\n\nThe fiery exchanges Friday served as a stark example of the dramatic whiplash in American foreign policy since Trump and Vance assumed office last month. The tensions escalated dramatically during a session that began with a series of pleasantries as Trump waxed aloud about his legacy.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'A coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet': Rep. Moulton on Trump's meeting with Zelensky 01:59 - Source: CNN 'A coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet': Rep. Moulton on Trump's meeting with Zelensky 01:59\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m going to be remembered as a peacemaker,\u201d Trump said as he looked ahead to the prospect of finalizing a broader peace deal with Russia and Ukraine.\n\nBut the acrimony that burst into full view raised questions about the prospects of reaching a peaceful solution, raising fresh alarm across Europe, where leaders have worked for weeks to warn Trump of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s past actions and potential future intentions with Ukraine.\n\nAgain and again, Trump has sided with Putin. But with voices raised in the Oval Office, Trump unleashed years of pent-up frustration toward Russia and Ukraine, which led to his first impeachment.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump said in a Truth Social post that Zelensky could come back to the White House \u201cwhen he is ready for peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\u201d\n\nFor the sake of diplomacy, it was a catastrophic end to a week that began on a hopeful note at the White House, where French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited in hopes of paving the way to a security agreement with Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s meetings with the pair of European leaders were awash in pleasantries to prepare him for his one-on-one session with Zelensky, which ended as no one could have imagined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve empowered you to be a tough guy,\u201d Trump said to the Ukrainian leader. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be a tough guy without the United States.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with reporters after a TV appearance at the White House, Graham said Zelensky \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again. I think most Americans saw a guy that they would not want to go into business with. The way he handled the meeting, the way he confronted the president was just over the top,\u201d Graham said.\n\nGraham said he had spoken to Zelensky Friday morning.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take the bait,\u201d Graham recalled saying. \u201cPresident Trump was in a very good mood last night.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats placed the blame on Trump and Vance.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the meeting \u201ca political ambush and a shameful failure of American leadership\u201d in a statement. The Rhode Island Democrat said the day\u2019s \u201ccruel and callous display does great harm to U.S. standing in the world. Trump and Vance are communicating to the world that the United States is not to be trusted. Adversaries and allies alike will take note.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler and Lauren Fox contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nFrom slaps to envelope mix-ups, it\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen at the Academy Awards. The most glamourous night in Hollywood unfolds during three-and-a-half hours of live television, nearly ensuring some sort of unexpected shocker.\n\nBut this year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 CEO Bill Kramer is really hoping the drama unfolds only in the Oscar race itself.\n\n\u201cMany of the races are wide open,\u201d Kramer told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cA lot of our possible winners are really up for grabs. It\u2019s going to be an exciting night.\u201d\n\nThis award season has embraced a flurry of sporadic winners, showcasing few consistent shoo-ins, particularly in the best picture category.\n\nThe campaign for the film \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which leads with 13 Oscar nominations, was upended by past offensive tweets from the film\u2019s star Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n. A source told CNN that Gasc\u00f3n is still expected to attend the ceremony on Sunday night, though it\u2019s unclear where she\u2019ll be seated and if she\u2019ll walk the red carpet.\n\nWhen asked if the Academy considered rescinding Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s individual nomination, Kramer deflected and instead highlighted the groundbreaking nature of Gasc\u00f3n being the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an acting Oscar.\n\n\u201cAll of our nominees are invited to attend the Oscars,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what\u2019s so important this year, we have over 200 nominees,\u201d Kramer continued, adding, \u201cWe need to celebrate all of (them).\u201d\n\nSo, what will happen on Oscar Sunday? Here, the Academy CEO previews what to expect:\n\nConan O\u2019Brien will bring the laughs, but won\u2019t make celebrities cry\n\nWhy was Conan O\u2019Brien the perfect choice to host the show this year?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lovely person, number one. He\u2019s a humanist. He\u2019s apolitical,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cHe invites everybody in to enjoy, and he\u2019s so smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, tonally, Conan strikes the perfect balance,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe never punch below the belt. That\u2019s key. This is not about making fun of people in a way that\u2019s cruel. It\u2019s not about making fun of our film industry. Conan stays above the fray.\u201d\n\nWill \u2018Wicked\u2019 open the show?\n\nThis week, major musical performers were announced for the Oscars, including Queen Latifah, Raye, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, plus Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\n\nFor the 2025 Oscars, these superstar artists will perform as yet unannounced songs, replacing the tradition of performing the nominated best original song onstage. Instead, the songwriters nominated in the category will be recognized in a pre-produced segment that shares more of their backstories and accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWicked\u201d stars Grande and Erivo are confirmed to perform, but Kramer didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries regarding what song or songs they will sing and whether they will open the show.\n\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande attend the \"Wicked\" New York Premiere in 2024. Theo Wargo/Getty Images/File\n\n\u201cYou will see. You have to tune in,\u201d he allowed.\n\n\u201c\u2019Wicked\u2019 is an undeniable smash,\u201d Kramer added. \u201cCynthia and Ariana are such incredible performers. We are so thrilled that they\u2019ll be on the show this year as performers, and I think all fans of \u2018Wicked\u2019 and beyond will love what they have planned.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect politics to take center stage\n\nHollywood celebrities are known to make political statements at award shows, but Kramer said he hopes the night will \u201cabsolutely\u201d steer clear of politics.\n\nOf course, no one can predict what a winner will stay when they get up to the podium, but Kramer shared that guidelines are suggested to anyone taking the stage, in an effort to avoid any controversial statements.\n\n\u201cWe do talk to them about keeping things focused on the work, but this is really a moment for the artist to have for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nGet ready for surprise A-list reunions\n\n\u201cFilmmaking is a collaborative art \u2013 more so than almost any other art form,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe Academy represents all components of filmmaking. We want to bring them into the show and celebrate the community of people who make movies \u2013 so reunions is one great way to do that.\u201d\n\nWhen prodded for any names, Kramer stayed mum, but ensured CNN that viewers will be surprised to see some famous familiar faces back together.\n\n\u201cWell, I obviously can\u2019t tell you any surprises today, but know that there are going to be incredible surprises on the show this year,\u201d he teased.\n\nThe Oscars will raise funds for LA wildfire rebuilding efforts\n\n\u201cWe will be celebrating Los Angeles\u2019 resilience,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be celebrating our community \u2013 not just our community of filmmakers, but the community of Los Angeles. LA has attracted filmmakers and creative visionaries for well over a century. This is a moment to really celebrate that.\u201d\n\nHe added that there will be an element to raise funds, just like the Grammy Awards did earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWe will be encouraging people to join us in supporting relief efforts throughout the night,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nRuntime\n\nEvery year, critics say that the Oscars telecast is too long. Kramer isn\u2019t blind to the criticism, but he explained that it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d to the Academy for \u201call disciplines to be celebrated on the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year we had all of the awards on the show and we came in under time. We were under 3 hours and 30 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to do this in a way that\u2019s entertaining, and we will continue to evolve the show and to think about that.\u201d\n\nThe Academy Awards will air live on ABC and stream live on Hulu on Sunday beginning at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nForeign adversaries including Russia and China have recently directed their intelligence services to ramp up recruiting of US federal employees working in national security, targeting those who have been fired or feel they could be soon, according to four people familiar with recent US intelligence on the issue and a document reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe intelligence indicates that foreign adversaries are eager to exploit the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to conduct mass layoffs across the federal workforce \u2013 a plan laid out by the Office of Personnel Management earlier this week.\n\nRussia and China are focusing their efforts on recently fired employees with security clearances and probationary employees at risk of being terminated, who may have valuable information about US critical infrastructure and vital government bureaucracy, two of the sources said. At least two countries have already set up recruitment websites and begun aggressively targeting federal employees on LinkedIn, two of the sources said.\n\nA document produced by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service said the intelligence community assessed with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that foreign adversaries were trying to recruit federal employees and \u201ccapitalize\u201d on the Trump administration\u2019s plans for mass layoffs, according to a partly redacted copy reviewed by CNN.\n\nIt added that foreign intelligence officers were being directed to look for potential sources on LinkedIn, TikTok, RedNote and Reddit.\n\nAt least one foreign intelligence officer directed an asset to create a company profile on Linkedin and post a job advertisement, and to actively pursue federal employees who indicate they are \u201copen to work,\u201d the NCIS document says.\n\nThe adversaries think the employees \u201care at their most vulnerable right now,\u201d another of the sources said. \u201cOut of a job, bitter about being fired, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of imagination to see that these cast aside federal workers with a wealth of institutional knowledge represent staggeringly attractive targets to the intelligence services of our competitors and adversaries,\u201d a third source familiar with the recent US assessments told CNN.\n\nThe intelligence seems to confirm what was previously a hypothetical fear for current and US officials: that the mass firings could offer a rich recruitment opportunity for foreign intelligence services that might seek to exploit financially vulnerable or resentful former employees. The Justice Department has charged multiple former military and intelligence officials for providing US intelligence to China in recent years.\n\n\u201cChina has always been committed to developing relations with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d said Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu. \u201cWe oppose groundless speculation on China without factual basis.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as well as the embassy of Russia in Washington for comment.\n\nOfficials have been discussing the risk\n\nCareer officials at the CIA have been quietly discussing that risk and how to mitigate it in the recent weeks, current and former intelligence officials previously told CNN. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard earlier this week suggested that those discussions represented a \u201cthreat\u201d made by disloyal government employees \u2014 rather than a clinical warning of the potential risks posed by President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting strategy \u2014 and that those involved should be penalized.\n\n\u201cI am curious about how they think this is a good tactic to keep their job,\u201d Gabbard told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re exposing themselves essentially by making this indirect threat using their propaganda arm through CNN that they\u2019ve used over and over and over again to reveal their hand, that their loyalty is not at all to America. It is not to the American people or the Constitution. It is to themselves.\n\n\u201cAnd these are exactly the kind of people that we need to root out, get rid of so that the patriots who do work in this area, who are committed to our core mission can actually focus on that,\u201d she said.\n\nMultiple current officials across national security agencies who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity expressed frustration at the administration\u2019s response to what they see as very real warnings \u2014 not partisan swiping.\n\n\u201cEmployees that feel they have been mistreated by an employer have historically been much more likely to disclose sensitive information,\u201d said Holden Triplett, who served as director of counterintelligence at the National Security Council in the first Trump administration and is a former FBI attach\u00e9 at the US embassies in Moscow and Beijing. \u201cWe may be creating, albeit somewhat unintentionally, the perfect recruitment environment.\u201d\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t reality TV\u2019\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t reality TV,\u201d said another former intelligence official. \u201cThere are consequences.\u201d\n\nThe CIA and Defense Department are weighing significant staff cuts. The Pentagon said in a memo last week that over 5,000 probationary employees, who in most cases have been in their job a year or less, could be fired in the short term. And the CIA has already fired more than 20 officers for their work on diversity issues, many of whom are now challenging their dismissal in court.\n\nThe CIA also aggressively seeks to recruit disaffected government employees in adversarial countries \u201call the time,\u201d noted a former intelligence official \u2014 using similar tactics. The agency has released a series of public recruitment videos aimed at persuading disgruntled Russian government employees to spy for the United States, videos that detailed ways to securely contact the agency.\n\n\u201c\u2019Domestic political turbulence in your country? Sign up with us to help us help your country!\u2019\u201d the former official paraphrased the US efforts, adding that those efforts deeply aggravate foreign governments.\n\nThe CIA may have already inadvertently put some American secrets within the grasp of foreign spies and hackers. In an effort to comply with the executive order to downsize the federal workforce, the CIA earlier this month sent the White House an extraordinarily unusual email listing all new hires that have been with the agency for two years or less \u2014 a list that included CIA officers who were preparing to operate under cover \u2014 over an unclassified email server.\n\nSome of those officers, who have had access to classified information about the agency\u2019s operations and tradecraft, may now be terminated as part of the layoffs.\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed reporting."

            "full_content": "Trump\u2019s good at ordering people around but not so good at arithmetic. Photo: rancis Chung/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s congressional allies have a very big fiscal arithmetic problem that has yet to become entirely visible to debt-and-deficit hawks, financial markets, and the public at large. He has promised, and his party\u2019s donor base really wants, an extension of the tax cuts he pushed through Congress during his first term. That will cost a minimum of $4.5 trillion over ten years, if they are made permanent, according to the center-right, business-friendly Tax Foundation, and with interest costs, would add $5.4 trillion to the national debt. Much as tax cuts often sound like dessert to voters, they seem to want Congress to eat broccoli first, according to a USA Today\u2013Suffolk poll taken just before Trump took office:\n\nTrump has said that one of his first legislative initiatives will be to extend and expand the tax cuts passed in his first term, now set to expire after this year.\n\nBut in the survey, a 53% majority of voters said Congress should focus on cutting the federal budget deficit, even if it meant not extending the tax cuts. Just 28% said Congress should extend the tax cuts even if it means increasing the deficit. \u2026\n\nEnthusiasm for tax cuts was relatively restrained even among Republicans: 46% put a higher priority on cutting taxes, and 38% on curbing the deficit.\n\nTo the extent that the 2017 tax cuts showered the most benefits on wealthy individuals and the corporations they run, it\u2019s worth noting that polls regularly show voters across party lines believe these beneficiaries of Trump 1.0 largesse are not bearing their fair share of the tax burden. Now it\u2019s true that on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump promised additional tax cuts that are popular among people who could not possibly get across the security barriers at Mar-a-Lago. He proposed eliminating federal income taxes on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits. Unfortunately, the deficit-focused Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates these swing-voter-pleasing tax cuts could cost as much as another $5 trillion. Trump is also backing, and key House Republicans are demanding, more federal income-tax deductions for state and local tax expenditures. These could cost as much as $1.2 trillion more, according to CRFB.\n\nKeeping all these promises without ballooning the federal budget deficit to unprecedented levels is made more complicated by the Trump-GOP drive to increase spending on national defense and border security, priorities reflected in both the House and Senate budget resolutions already passed.\n\nOf course, congressional Republicans and the administration agree on the desirability of domestic spending cuts that don\u2019t contradict Trump\u2019s pledges not to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, or perhaps even Medicaid benefits, depending on which promises you actually believe. Republicans even hope they can pocket some of the savings wrung out of the federal bureaucracy by Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE raids on agency programs and personnel, though these, too, are becoming more unpopular every day.\n\nSo Republicans in Congress are very interested in fresh ways to make it all add up. And Trump has a ready suggestion: tariffs! Despite considerable conservative and business-sector opposition to the 47th president\u2019s long-standing protectionist trade agenda, those worried about debt and deficits are listening, as Politico reports:\n\nGOP leaders and President Donald Trump are strategizing over how to incorporate revenue from new tariffs in their massive party-line domestic policy bill, with the goal of arguing the multitrillion-dollar legislation doesn\u2019t add to the national debt.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other senior Republicans discussed the topic during their White House meeting Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Republicans are still planning to keep the tariffs outside the final reconciliation package. But the group discussed how to score and eventually count the revenue as part of their plans for a deficit-neutral bill.\n\nIn other words, congressional Republicans won\u2019t take on a battle to enact new tariffs, but they\u2019ll be happy to claim the revenues from tariffs Trump imposes via presidential orders to help meet his tax-cut promises. And sure enough, as the same Politico story reports, Trump followed up his meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune by announcing that new 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico will go into effect on March 4.\n\nThis gambit may help with the GOP\u2019s fiscal arithmetic, but it doesn\u2019t help with the politics. Trump may believe that \u201ctariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d but aside from the deep hostility to tariff wars felt by free-market economists and multinational corporate interests, the public\u2019s not that jazzed. Polls show there is significant support for tariffs on China, but not so much on Canada, Mexico, or Europe. And despite Trump\u2019s claim that tariffs will be paid by foreigners, polls also show that solid majorities of Americans agree with economists that increased tariffs will boost consumer prices right here in the United States. Given the extreme sensitivity of Americans to the cost of living \u2014 arguably the preeminent issue that returned Trump to the presidency in 2024 \u2014 this is one Trump priority that is especially dangerous.\n\nBeyond the unpopularity of tariffs as a way to pay for relatively unpopular tax cuts, there\u2019s a logical problem as well: If tariffs work to win concessions from foreign countries or succeed in convincing companies to relocate operations to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, then they won\u2019t raise the revenues Republicans are already counting upon. If they do raise revenues, they will be paid not by foreign companies but by the American consumers who will pay increased prices for both foreign goods and for domestic goods that will be insulated from low-cost competition. If Trump tariffs work economically, they won\u2019t work fiscally. So as an answer to the Republican craving for offsets to tax cuts, they don\u2019t fill the bill. And in the longer run, tariffs will reinforce the extremely dangerous impression that Trump is bent on replacing progressive income taxes with highly regressive levies on everyone who goes to Walmart and expects lower prices for items America just doesn\u2019t produce efficiently anymore."

            "full_content": "The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued an impassioned condemnation of President Donald Trump on Friday after he announced a plan to impose an extra ten-percent tariff on Chinese goods in March in response to China\u2019s role in the American fentanyl crisis.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is a major global supplier of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, a deadly opioid fueling a dramatic rise in drug-related deaths in North America. The U.S. government estimates that 150 people die in the United States every day as result of fentanyl and other opioid overdoses, a problem worsened by drug dealers lacing other drugs, such as cocaine, with traces of fentanyl that users often do not know are present and are often enough to kill the user.\n\nAs a result of China\u2019s outsized role in producing fentanyl and helping its traffickers, President Trump announced shortly after taking office that he would impose tariffs on Chinese goods after being inaugurated, along with tariffs on Canada and Mexico in response to their failure to secure their U.S. borders. Trump has yet to impose the tariffs, extending the deadline in response to rapid action by the Canadian and Mexican governments, but he repeated the threat on Thursday, announcing a plan to impose the tariffs on March 4.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to the announcement with ire on Friday, insisting that the fentanyl crisis is not a Chinese problem and accusing Trump of \u201cblackmail.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina deplores and opposes this move, and will take what is necessary to firmly defend its legitimate interests,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters, without elaborating on those interests.\n\nLin went on to insist that fentanyl is not an issue for China but, out of the Communist Party\u2019s alleged generosity, it has agreed to help Washington with solving it.\n\n\u201cThe fentanyl issue is the U.S.\u2019s own problem. China has given support to the U.S.\u2019s response to the fentanyl issue in the spirit of humanity,\u201d Lin claimed. \u201cChina has conducted counternarcotics cooperation with the U.S. side in a broad-based and in-depth way. The remarkable progress is there for all to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fentanyl issue is just an excuse the U.S. uses to impose tariffs on, pressure and blackmail China, and they punish us for helping them,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis will not solve their concerns. It is only counterproductive and will deal a heavy blow to the dialogue and cooperation with China on counternarcotics.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese regime propaganda outlet, further accused America of \u201cingratitude\u201d on the fentanyl issue, demanding that Washington be grateful to China to its performative actions in response to concerns about China\u2019s role in the fentanyl trade.\n\n\u201cChina is one of the world\u2019s toughest countries on counternarcotics both in terms of policy and its implementation. The fentanyl crisis is primarily a US issue,\u201d the Times repeated, echoing the Foreign Ministry. \u201cIn the spirit of humanity and goodwill, China has given support to the US in its response to this issue.\u201d\n\nContrary to the Chinese government\u2019s insistences, ample evidence exists that China play a protagonist role in the development and trafficking of fentanyl. In his 2024 book Blood Money, investigative journalist Peter Schweizer revealed that China aids in the trafficking of fentanyl precursors to North America and helps Mexican drug cartels produce and distribute the drug.\n\n\u201cWhile we debate domestic politics to address the fentanyl crisis, the reality is that Beijing is deeply involved at every stage of the drug\u2019s production and distribution in the United States,\u201d Schweizer wrote in the book.\n\n\u201cBased on leaked US national security documents, Mexican government hacked emails or correspondence, and Chinese corporate records, we know that the fentanyl operation is under Chinese control from start to finish,\u201d he reported.\n\nIn response to China\u2019s role in the crisis, Trump has proposed imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump initially proposed a ten-percent tariff on China and 25-percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, which he postponed in response to conversations with those governments.\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump announced that the tariffs would go into effect on March 4 and that he would add an extra ten-percent tariff on China.\n\n\u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and supplied by, China,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. \u201cMore than 100,000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cAs scheduled. China will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date. The April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

            "full_content": "Ukrainian newspaper accuses U.S. of switching to Russia's side in the war\n\nThe signing of a key minerals agreement with Ukraine and a scheduled news conference Friday by President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were abruptly canceled and the Ukrainian leader's visit cut short after an Oval Office meeting that included Vice President JD Vance descended into insults and chaos.\n\nAfterward, the Ukrainians left the Oval Office to head to a \"separated room,\" while the U.S. team stayed in the Oval Office, a White House official said. While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.\n\nThe contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"\n\nLater in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy.\n\n\"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.\n\nZelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration Putin violated the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which had been signed by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\"\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance.\n\nVance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.\n\n\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.\n\nZelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.\n\nVance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.\n\n\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.\n\nZelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"\n\n\"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"\n\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.\n\nZelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.\n\n\"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\"\n\nMr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"\n\nZelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.\n\n\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\"\n\nMr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.\n\n\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.\n\nAmid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?\n\n\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"\n\nEarlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.\n\n\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.\n\n\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nA White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"\n\nThe meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"\n\n\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"\n\nZelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.\n\nAfter his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\n\nZelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.\n\nAs Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.\n\n\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"\n\nAdministration sources on next steps\n\nHigh-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.\n\nWhen Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.\n\nNo phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.\n\nZelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nRegarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.\n\nThe sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.\n\nWhat to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit\n\nMr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.\n\nPresident Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives at the White House on Feb. 28, 2025. Getty Images\n\nIn a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"\n\nMr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.\n\n\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.\n\n\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"\n\nMr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.\n\n\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.\n\nTop Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.\n\nReferring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"\n\nThe president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.\n\n\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"\n\nBut after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.\n\n\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.\n\n\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion."

            "full_content": "A worker at a granite mine in the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine, on Wednesday. Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images\n\nThe United States and Ukraine are trying to hammer out a natural resources agreement that would give Washington access to Kyiv\u2019s untapped mineral riches in exchange for investment and what Ukraine hopes would be concrete security guarantees.\n\nWhile US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a deal has been made and that he was \u201chappy\u201d about it, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been more cautious, saying the agreement could be a \u201cbig success\u201d \u2014 but that it depended on Trump.\n\nHere is what we know \u2014 and don\u2019t know \u2013\u2014about the agreement:\n\nWhat\u2019s in the deal? The draft agreement seeks the establishment of a \u201creconstruction investment fund\u201d that would be jointly managed by the US and Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stressed the deal would exclude existing \u201cdeposits, facilities, licenses and royalties\u201d tied to Ukraine\u2019s natural resources. The draft agreement goes beyond just minerals and rare earths. It spans Ukraine\u2019s other natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as any infrastructure connected to the sectors, such as ports or LNG terminals.\n\nWhat does Trump want from the deal? Trump said over the weekend that he\u2019s \u201ctrying to get the money back,\u201d referring to the aid provided to Ukraine under the previous administration.\n\nWhat does Ukraine want from the deal? Ukraine\u2019s mineral riches have long been eyed by its allies \u2014 and Kyiv has made them part of its appeal for support. Zelensky has made it clear he wants security guarantees to be part of the deal.\n\nWhy is Trump so keen on this deal? Materials such as graphite, lithium, uranium and the 17 chemical elements known as rare earths are critical for economic growth and national security. They are essential to the production of electronics, clean energy technology, including wind turbines, energy networks and electric vehicles, as well as some weapons systems. The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs, many of which come from China, which has long dominated the market. Experts have long warned that relying on China for strategic materials is risky, but the latest trade tensions between Washington and Beijing make it even more important for the US to look for alternative suppliers.\n\nHow large are Ukraine\u2019s resources? Ukraine doesn\u2019t have globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals, but it does have some of the world\u2019s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. But while Ukraine does have large reserves of these minerals, little has been done to develop the sector. It is unlikely that Kyiv would be able to extract these resources without foreign investment.\n\nCNN\u2019s Victoria Butenko, Nick Paton Walsh and Gul Tuysuz, Christian Edwards, Svitlana Vlasova, Dariya Tarasova-Markina, Lauren Kent, Betsy Klein, Michael Williams contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nLast week, Akamai, a cloud computing company with a popular content-delivery network product, reported solid earnings that beat expectations. Soon after, its stock plunged by more than 20 percent and stayed there. What were investors so worried about? They were concerned, it turns out, about Akamai\u2019s relationship with a much better-known company: TikTok. ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, is one of Akamai\u2019s biggest customers. One concern is that TikTok is working to become less reliant on contractors like Akamai. Another is weirder and bigger: TikTok is still sort of illegal, and working with TikTok is still sort of against the law.\n\nTo recap as quickly as possible: During his last term as president, Donald Trump helped lead a campaign to ban TikTok, starting with executive orders and ending during the Biden administration with a bipartisan law. Trump flipped on the issue during the 2024 campaign, but the law still stands. That is a problem for companies like Apple and Google, which host TikTok in their app stores and are directly implicated in the law as written. It\u2019s also a problem for firms like Akamai, which provide infrastructure services that keep TikTok working. Trump issued an executive order asserting, with unclear authority, that the ban was paused, and the Justice Department has been offering TikTok\u2019s partners assurances that they won\u2019t be prosecuted.\n\nThis was enough to convince Akamai \u2014 with Oracle, Apple, Google, and others \u2014 to help restore TikTok, but the app and its partners are now stuck in a sort of legalish limbo. Is the plan for Vice-President J.D. Vance to oversee a sale? To just leave things as is and muddle along? To contrive some other arrangement and simply insist that it meets the law\u2019s requirements? Apple and Google have stayed conspicuously quiet on the situation, successfully avoiding confrontation with the administration. Akamai, however, disclosed its risks \u2014 and to a great extent, theirs \u2014 in an annual report to the SEC. While \u201cthe Attorney General has since determined that our provision of services to this customer has not violated the law and that we can continue providing services,\u201d the company said, \u201c[i]t is difficult to predict whether the passed legislation will ultimately be enforced and whether any future judicial challenges brought against the executive order will be successful.\u201d The company goes on:\n\nEven though President Trump has extended the enforcement deadline for a ban on the Chinese application, there is no assurance that we will not be exposed to liability and we may be exposed to significant fines, litigation, indemnification claims, negative publicity, reputational harm, diversion of management attention, interruptions in our operations, financial loss and other similar harms by continuing to provide services to the Chinese application.\n\nSome of these risks are fairly straightforward. The fines attached to the law are catastrophically severe, and the reason they\u2019re not being levied is, basically, because Donald Trump and Pam Bondi say so. Business leaders frequently complain about regulatory uncertainty, arguing that it makes planning for the future and allocating resources more difficult. The TikTok situation both resembles and exceeds the sorts of things they\u2019re usually referring to. It\u2019s not just TikTok\u2019s legal status that\u2019s up in the air \u2014 it\u2019s the entire relationship between different parts of the government and companies that operate on its watch and under its jurisdiction. Akamai\u2019s \u201cother similar harms,\u201d in other words, involve questions like: Can the president unilaterally decide which laws are enforced? Can the president unilaterally write new laws? What is law, really, anyway?\n\nThis is a strange and miniaturizing lens for what appears to be a much broader potential constitutional crisis and isn\u2019t likely to be the matter that ultimately triggers it (all eyes are on DOGE for that). Most people don\u2019t know or care about Akamai, the TikTok ban was never especially popular, and the prospect of just sort of ignoring a strange and unprecedented law banning a popular app isn\u2019t the sort of thing that\u2019s likely to get too many people riled up. But as a matter of process, the situation is both surreal and potentially instructive. Among the risks implied but not elucidated in the filing is the possibility that as quickly and arbitrarily as the executive branch can choose not to enforce a law, it can choose to enforce it again. It\u2019s easy enough to imagine what a motivated government led by a man who negotiates with threats might do with such leverage over a basic internet infrastructure firm like Akamai \u2014 without it, for example, TikTok couldn\u2019t go back online. But it\u2019s even easier to imagine what use such leverage might be when applied to Apple and Google, two of the largest and most influential tech companies on earth."

            "full_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nA businessman who pumped $75 million into the Trump family-backed crypto token finds himself in a fortunate position this week as federal securities regulators are hitting pause on their civil fraud case against him.\n\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justin Sun, a 34-year-old Chinese crypto entrepreneur, asked a federal judge to put the agency\u2019s case on hold, citing the interests of both sides and \u201cthe public\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nThe pause is a 180 for the SEC, America\u2019s top financial regulator, which two years ago charged Sun and his companies \u2014 Tron, BitTorrent and Rainberry \u2014 with selling unregistered securities and fraudulently manipulating the price of digital token Tronix. Sun and his companies sought to have the case dismissed.\n\nSun is a polarizing figure within the world of crypto, in which he has become one of the most prominent investors in the World Liberty Financial crypto project, backed by the Trump family. Sun\u2019s $75 million purchase of World Liberty tokens, which he\u2019s touted in social media posts, could set the Trump family up to eventually collect tens of millions of dollars, as the family is entitled to 75% of the tokens\u2019 revenues, according to the company. Sun is also an official adviser to World Liberty, which lists President Donald Trump as its \u201cchief crypto advocate\u201d and his son Barron as its \u201cDeFi visionary.\u201d\n\nWorld Liberty is just one of several crypto projects the president and his family have set up in recent months, raising concerns about potential corruption. By its nature, crypto offers a particularly easy way to, anonymously or otherwise, funnel money into assets that directly benefit the president and his family.\n\n\u201cNow anyone in world can essentially deposit money into bank account of President of USA with a couple clicks,\u201d tweeted Anthony Scaramucci, former Trump White House communications director, after Trump launched a digital token known as a memecoin last month. \u201cEvery favor \u2014 geopolitical, corporate or personal \u2014 is now on sale, right out in the open.\u201d\n\nThe SEC declined to comment. Neither the White House nor Sun responded to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThis is, I guess, going to be the new approach \u2014 hands off crypto, not enforcing fraud \u2026 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to end well,\u201d Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and an ethics lawyer for the George W. Bush administration, told me. \u201cThe SEC is going to back off \u2014 because that\u2019s what the Trump administration wants \u2014 on whatever enforcement they are able to do. I think it\u2019s a very worrisome situation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a widely expected move, the SEC on Thursday officially dropped its enforcement action against US crypto exchange Coinbase, citing \u201cthe Commission\u2019s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry.\u201d\n\nCompounding conflicts of interest\n\nThe Sun case comes as the Trump administration appears to be opening the door to potential corruption beyond crypto. Critics across the political spectrum say it\u2019s a troubling trend for a president and a White House that is ditching guardrails at an alarming speed and gutting the government\u2019s ability to combat corruption.\n\nSince returning to office over a month ago, the president has paused all investigations into corporate foreign bribery and fired inspectors general from more than a dozen federal agencies. His Justice Department has moved to suspend its case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, whom prosecutors had accused of soliciting bribes from Turkish nationals (allegations Adams denies). Trump pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who spent eight years in prison on multiple corruption charges, including scheming to sell a vacant Senate seat. And earlier this month, Trump said that Elon Musk\u2019s financial disclosures would be kept confidential even as Musk wields power over federal agencies and contracts that directly impact his own business empire.\n\nThe president has also come full circle on crypto, which he once dismissed as a scam.\n\nThat\u2019s been a mixed blessing for the industry, which has been working to shed its well-earned reputation for illicit activities. On one hand, crypto advocates seeking to establish a legitimate regulatory framework have welcomed Trump\u2019s broadly positive rhetoric on digital assets. But Trump\u2019s memecoin ventures \u2014 along with his pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road criminal enterprise, and the SEC\u2019s heel-turn on its case against Sun \u2014 are the kind of fringe causes that reinforce the industry\u2019s association with bad actors.\n\nWithin crypto, Sun is a polarizing figure. While the Tron community sees him as a visionary, his detractors see him as an opportunist who thrives on hype, said Gareth Rhodes, managing director at advisory firm Pacific Street. \u201cBoth supporters and detractors can agree he wields substantial influence in crypto,\u201d he added.\n\nSun, who garnered headlines last year for his $6.2 million purchase of a banana duct-taped to a wall, is \u201camong the least sympathetic litigants in the industry,\u201d Eric Soufer, a political adviser to major crypto companies, told me Thursday.\n\nThe SEC and Sun\u2019s lawyers, in their letter to the judge, proposed submitting a status report 60 days after a stay, at which point there would likely be more details about the case\u2019s resolution, including any possible settlement.\n\n\u201cObviously his connections to Trump Coin are going to raise questions,\u201d Soufer added. \u201cBut we need to see what the actual settlement looks like before we can judge just how much politics may have played a role.\u201d"

Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux, New York Magazine\n\nNot since Woodrow Wilson screened The Birth of a Nation at the White House in 1915 has a president been the source of such openly racist propaganda as Donald Trump. Other presidents may have presided over worse racial inequality or used dog whistles to signal their sympathy with racists, but none have been so explicit in their demagogic appeals to white people\u2019s most chauvinistic impulses.\n\nWith the help of Elon Musk, Trump has conducted an all-out assault on the government in order to eradicate the supposedly pernicious influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which has led him to blame the deadly plane crash over the Potomac River in January on the presence of minorities in the aviation industry and to fire General Charles Q. Brown, the second Black person in history to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He has called for the \u201cresettlement\u201d of Afrikaners facing purported anti-white discrimination in South Africa while appointing speechwriter Darren J. Beattie, who tweeted that Black people are \u201cferal\u201d and need to be sterilized, to the State Department. In response to Trump\u2019s threats and directives, the Department of Defense has outlawed Black History Month for servicemembers, and the Maryland National Guard canceled a parade for Frederick Douglass\u2019s birthday. Following the White House\u2019s lead, Missouri is suing Starbucks for hiring too many minorities.\n\nAnd these are just some of the most palpable proofs of the Trump administration\u2019s bigotry. Political discourse is now saturated in racism in a way that would have been shocking not so long ago, with the vice-president of the United States, whose wife and children are of Indian descent, defending a 25-year-old DOGE staffer named Marko Elez who was revealed to have posted racist comments like \u201cNormalize Indian hate,\u201d \u201cYou could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity,\u201d and \u201cI was racist before it was cool.\u201d Musk\u2019s social-media platform, X, is rife with white-supremacist and Nazi content, some of which has been boosted by Musk himself who, in addition to claiming that his native South Africa is committing \u201cgenocide\u201d against whites, has also supported Germany\u2019s far-right AfD. This is a political moment in which blatant racism is tolerated, Nazi salutes are flung from public podiums by presidential surrogates, and the purported low IQs of minority populations is a subject of wide discussion \u2014 not to mention the rank racism that permeates the administration\u2019s posture toward foreign immigrants and the people in Gaza.\n\nPerhaps most striking of all is how muted the public response has been \u2014 no mass protests, half-hearted objections from the opposition party. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a massive shift toward racism as much as an expanded indifference toward it,\u201d the historian Robin D.G. Kelley told me. \u201cPeople are just kind of like, \u2018Well, what can we do?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe assumption of the generations that came after the civil-rights movement has been that the quest for racial equality would move \u2014 however fitfully, however slowly \u2014 in the direction of progress. There have been myriad setbacks, as well as longstanding wrongs that have never been corrected, but these were often accompanied by genuine accomplishments. Indeed one such setback was the election of Donald Trump in 2016, which was partly a backlash to the election of the first Black president \u2014 a setback that seemingly was halted by his ouster in 2020, which was partly propelled by the George Floyd uprising and the change it promised. But now Trump is back, and his brand of MAGA racism is more entrenched than ever before, raising the possibility that racial norms that have been painstakingly shaped and amended over decades are just as susceptible to being dismantled as government bureaucracy and the rule of law.\n\nThe current atmosphere of vitriol and chaos has made it hard to determine exactly how destructive the next four years could be. As usual with Trump, there is a fine line between menace and plain incompetence, the latter of which could turn out to be a saving grace. \u201cWe know they\u2019re not interested in merit,\u201d said Kelley of the sycophants the president has tasked with purging America\u2019s workforce of allegedly unqualified Black and brown hires. \u201cThey got the dumbest people in their cabinet.\u201d At the same time, the risks of complacency could not be higher, say organizers and others who\u2019ve spent the past decade leading the fight against racism even as complacency seems to be the tenor of the hour.\n\n\u201cI think it does matter that this time he won the popular vote,\u201d said the broadcaster Margaret Kimberley, who wrote the book Prejudential: Black America and the Presidents. \u201cI hate the term \u2018mandate,\u2019 but he realizes that with a weak opposition he can do what he wants.\u201d The scale of Trump\u2019s triumph in November has been overstated (he won the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points). But the inroads he made with young and male voters across racial groups are real enough that Democrats have been frightened into submission. \u201cWhat leverage do we have?\u201d complained House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in February when asked about voters calling on Democrats to do more to oppose Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s their government.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t have much support in the streets either. The party was in an equally weak governing position in 2017. But it was motivated by an outraged public and a sense that Trump\u2019s victory was an anomaly. \u201cYou had millions of people who mobilized outside the electoral system,\u201d said Kimberley. Between the Women\u2019s March, the Black Lives Matter movement, and scattered protests like those against the president\u2019s Muslim ban, popular dissent drove the party to electoral victories in 2018, 2020, and beyond.\n\nThat coalition fell apart in 2024 in the face of the threat of Trump\u2019s return. The supporters of criminal-justice reform were marginalized and scapegoated by the party. \u201cRather than see Palestine as a human-rights issue that people get behind, they did everything they could to suppress it,\u201d said Kelley. When Republicans smeared Kamala Harris as a feckless \u201cborder czar,\u201d Democrats retorted that it was in fact Trump, with his claims about \u201cillegal-alien gang members\u201d escaping the \u201cdungeons of the third world\u201d and invading America\u2019s suburbs, who was too soft on immigrants. The result has been a leadership vacuum felt from Capitol Hill to Main Street, and a post-election consensus that \u201cwokeness\u201d is what cost Democrats the election. The sense of political crisis engendered by past protest movements \u2014 and which is still America\u2019s most successful blueprint for fighting ethno-fascism \u2014 has been replaced by craven appeals to conservatism.\n\nActivists and organizers on the ground are struggling to regroup in their own ways. \u201cThere\u2019s been a divide,\u201d said Samuel Sinyangwe, whose data analysis on police violence underpinned much of the past decade\u2019s activism. \u201cI\u2019m sensing from a lot of people \u2014 some of whom had positions in the previous administration and some of whom were informing those people \u2014 an apathy, or almost like, \u2018We told you so.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s also a feeling that they couldn\u2019t get the message out even if they wanted to. Ten years ago, social platforms like Twitter were information-sharing and strategy hubs for Black activists; today, the newly renamed X is a Muskian echo chamber that many of the same activists have abandoned. \u201cFolks underestimated the level of disinformation and misinformation that has been proliferating over the last eight, nine years online and how much it\u2019s seeped into the collective consciousness of our friends, our family,\u201d said the Florida-based organizer Phillip Agnew. \u201cInstead of a stronger movement toward left politics, you\u2019ve got podcasts and streamers saying, \u2018Hey, the problem is that you need to double and triple down on capitalism. Get your crypto up. Get your money up.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe policy consequences of such apathy could be severe. Trump and Musk wish to gut entire knowledge reserves \u2014 literal terabytes of information that tracks how policies disparately impact minorities, for example, which line the hard drives of the agencies they\u2019re plotting to abolish. (\u201cI don\u2019t want to tip off the administration,\u201d Sinyangwe replied when I asked him what he\u2019s most afraid of losing in the DOGE purges.) And beyond that, who knows? Maybe Trump aims \u201cto reinstate second-class citizenship,\u201d as Kelley put it, or \u201cto disappear Black people from public life altogether,\u201d according to Kimberley.\n\nIn the meantime, we are left living in a country in which both official and casual racism are being re-normalized, where young and old will be exposed to more bigotry on social media and on their podcasts, and where it\u2019s more uncertain than ever that schoolchildren will learn the basic lessons of the civil-rights movement \u2014 lessons that have undergirded American civil society since the 1960s. The post-civil-rights period in the U.S. has failed to make good on the movement\u2019s promise in a number of ways, but at the very least, its statements of purpose and legal accomplishments have mapped a legible course toward equality, from the Oval Office down to the workplace. Even if Trump does not fully succeed in reestablishing legal second-class citizenship, he is spearheading a culture shift in which American history\u2019s horrors are widely dismissed or forgotten, and where racial inequality is no longer regarded as a leading cause of our country\u2019s problems but the answer."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nIn early February, John Schwarz, a self-described \u201cmindfulness and meditation facilitator,\u201d proposed a 24-hour nationwide \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d of major chains on the last day of the month.\n\nSchwarz urged people to forgo spending at Amazon, Walmart, and all other major retailers and fast-food companies for a day. He called on them to spend money only at small businesses and on essential needs.\n\n\u201cThe system has been designed to exploit us,\u201d said Schwarz, who goes by \u201cTheOneCalledJai\u201d on social media, in a video to his roughly 250,000 followers on Instagram and TikTok. \u201cOn February 28, we are going to remind them who really holds the power. For one day, we turn it off.\u201d\n\nSchwarz, 57, has no background in social or political organizing. Until early this year, he almost exclusively posted videos of himself offering inspirational messages and motivational tips sitting in his home, backyard and shopping mall parking lots.\n\nHe had low expectations for his boycott message gaining traction. \u201cI thought maybe a handful of my followers would do it,\u201d he told CNN in a phone interview this week.\n\nInstead, Schwarz\u2019s call rapidly spread online. His video has been shared more than 700,000 times on Instagram and viewed 8.5 million times. Celebrities such as Stephen King, Bette Midler and Mark Ruffalo have encouraged people to participate. Reporters wrote and aired TV pieces about the boycott, propelling it further.\n\nThe \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d effort is relatively uncoordinated and nebulous. Experts on consumer boycotts and corporate strategy are dubious that it will make a dent in the bottom lines of the massive companies it targets, let alone the vast US economy. Effective boycotts are typically well organized, make clear and specific demands and are focused on one company or issue.\n\nBut this boycott has gained strength online because it has captured visceral public anger with the American economy, corporations and politics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the sense that a lot of people want to do something. Doing something in the American context has often meant using pocketbook politics,\u201d said Lawrence Glickman, a historian at Cornell University and author of \u201cBuying Power: A History of Consumer Activism in America.\u201d \u201cThis a way of engaging in a form of collective action outside of the electoral arena that makes people feel some connection and sense of potential power.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon fulfillment center. The boycott Friday targets Amazon, Walmart and large chains. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nPeople online say they want to join the boycott for many different reasons. Some are commenting about high prices and the cost of living. Others are angry about the power of large corporations and billionaires such as Elon Musk. Some are pushing back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to gut federal programs and fears about an autocracy in America. Yet others want to boycott companies rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.\n\nSchwarz scrambled as a result of the response to create a group. He called it The People\u2019s Union and describes it on its new website (that is frequently down) as a \u201cmovement created by the people, for the people to \u201c(take) action against corporate control, political corruption, and the economic system.\u201d He has raised around $70,000 in donations on a GoFundMe page that solicits funds for social campaigns, legal advocacy and other efforts. He has also called for more targeted boycotts in the coming weeks against specific companies, including Amazon and Walmart. (Walmart declined to comment to CNN. Amazon did not respond to comment.)\n\nAlthough the response online appears to be strongest from the political left, Schwarz has no ideology that could be considered consistently progressive or conservative, at least along the traditional US political spectrum. He does not belong to either political party, but he supports Bernie Sanders. In recent posts, has advocated for the end of federal income tax, term limits in Congress, universal health care and price caps.\n\nThe boycott has \u201cspread so well because people have just had enough and they\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re tired,\u201d Schwarz said.\n\nBacklash against Target\n\nSchwarz\u2019s boycott call has coincided with a more organized effort to punish retailers that have retreated on DEI, particularly Target.\n\nDozens of Fortune 500 companies have backtracked on their diversity programs in response to pressure from activists and right-wing legal groups, and, more recently, the Trump administration\u2019s threats to investigate what it characterizes as \u201cillegal DEI,\u201d including potential criminal cases against companies.\n\nMuch of the anger has been directed toward Target. Target is under more heat than companies like Walmart, John Deere or Tractor Supply because it went further in its DEI efforts, and it has a more progressive base of customers.\n\nTarget was a leading advocate for DEI programs in the business world in the years after George Floyd was murdered by police in the company\u2019s home city of Minneapolis in 2020. Target also spent years building a public reputation as a progressive employer on LGBTQ issues.\n\nBut days into the Trump presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it remained committed to \u201ccreating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities\u201d and also stressed the need for \u201cstaying in step with the evolving external landscape.\u201d\n\nA protest outside of Target's headquarters in Minneapolis last month. Target has faced backlash for changes to its DEI policies. Ellen Schmidt/AP\n\nTarget\u2019s retreat sparked anger from customers and boycott calls, particularly Black consumers.\n\nRev. Jamal Bryant of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, has called for 100,000 people to begin a 40-day boycott of Target on March 5 to coincide with the start of Lent. Participants are encouraged to purchase products from Black-owned businesses during this period.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations,\u201d the petition says. \u201cThe greatest insult comes from Target.\u201d\n\nTarget did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThere are signs that the blowback from Target\u2019s move may be impacting the company.\n\nCustomer visits to Target, Walmart and Costco have slowed over the last four weeks, but they have dropped the most at Target, according to Placer.ai., which uses phone location data to track visits. The slowdown could also be attributed to weather, economic conditions and other variables, Placer.ai cautioned.\n\nDuring the week of February 10, the latest week available, foot traffic to Target dropped 7.9% and 4.8% to Walmart. Foot traffic to Costco, which has stood by its DEI policies, increased 4.8%.\n\nThe data \u201cshows a clear drop in traffic in late January into mid-February following the company\u2019s step back from DEI,\u201d Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a note to clients this week.\n\nBoycotts hard to sustain\n\nDespite the recent slowdown at Target, boycotts tend to be short-lived and rarely do financial damage to companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to sustain anything longer than a few weeks,\u201d said Young Hou, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business who has studied consumer boycotts. Consumers are typically fickle and don\u2019t want to disrupt their routines for extended stretches, he said. Boycotts can also spark a counterreaction, leading supporters of a company to mobilize and increase their spending, negating the impact.\n\nA boycott campaign against Target may be hard to sustain because other chains that consumers might switch to like Walmart or Amazon have also rolled back DEI programs.\n\nThe most successful example of a boycott in recent years has come on the right.\n\nIn 2023, Bud Light\u2019s parent company A-B InBev lost as much as $1.4 billion in sales because of right-wing backlash to Bud Light\u2019s brief partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n\nBoycotts and protests can force companies to make changes. In 1997, Stanford University students and faculty protested Nike CEO Phil Knight's visit to campus over Nike's labor practices. John Todd/AP\n\nEntertainer Kid Rock posted a video of himself shooting a stack of Bud Light cases. Other popular right-wing activists like Ben Shapiro and Candace Ownens and Republican politicans, including now-Vice President JD Vance and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, publicly supported the boycott. The brand also angered left-leaning customers because of its conciliatory response to right-wing attacks.\n\nOne of the key reasons the Bud Light boycott was successful was because it was very easy for customers to replace Bud Light with Coors Light or Miller Lite or another beer without much sacrifice.\n\nStill, consumer boycotts and protests can raise public awareness about an issue, pressure companies to make changes or hurt their public reputations.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, for example, protests on college campuses over Nike\u2019s use of sweatshop labor forced the company to raise the minimum age for hiring new workers at shoe factories to 18 and allow human rights groups to inspect factory conditions in Asia. After the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in 2018, consumers and activists successfully pressured Delta, Avis, MetLife and other companies to sever ties with the National Rifle Association and end discounts to NRA members.\n\n\u201cThe more specific the reason to boycott, usually the more effective those boycotts have a chance of being,\u201d said Cornell University\u2019s Glickman. \u201cBoycotts rarely cripple incredibly powerful companies, but they can put them on the defensive.\u201d"

            "full_content": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.\n\nThe measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d\n\nProtesters fill the Iowa state Capitol in Des Moines on Thursday to denounce a bill that would strip the state civil rights code of protections based on gender identity. Charlie Neibergall / AP\n\nThe measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.\n\nThe bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.\n\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.\n\nProtesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.\n\nSupporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.\n\n\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.\n\nThe Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nIowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.\n\nSexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.\n\nIowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \u201cI transitioned to save my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d\n\nAbout half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination, but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.\n\nIowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nSeveral Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court."

            "full_content": "Trump\u2019s Farm Belt supporters are in for a nasty shock as a trade war develops. Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA popular idea among Republican business types (and those from trade-sensitive farm states) has been that Donald Trump\u2019s oft-expressed love for tariffs is just part of his blustery approach to world affairs \u2014 a negotiating ploy rather than a genuine commitment to the 19th-century gospel of protectionism. For that reason, it was widely predicted that Trump would find a way to postpone or at least reduce the 25 percent tariffs he had been threatening to impose on Canada and Mexico on March 4 (delayed for 30 days after their initial announcement), along with another 10 percent tariff on China. The likelihood of retracting these threats was enhanced by the deadline\u2019s coinciding with the day of the 47th president\u2019s first big address to Congress. Surely, he wouldn\u2019t want the distractions of a falling stock market and renewed jitters about inflation while he tries to bask in congratulations over his second administration\u2019s breakneck pace of change. Or maybe not, since he is still insisting the tariffs will go into effect no matter what, as CNBC reports:\n\nTrump, speaking at the White House on Monday afternoon, said there was \u201cno room left\u201d to negotiate with the two U.S. allies. \u201cThey\u2019re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,\u201d he said. Stocks, already trading in the red, sank further following Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nTariffs, of course, raise prices on imported goods and on domestic goods that compete with them as the increased costs are passed on to consumers. Despite Trump\u2019s past claims that \u201cforeigners\u201d will pay the tariffs and/or that they will produce a rapid reinvestment in U.S. production in order to avoid them, he acknowledged in a social-media post last month that the short-term impact will hit already inflation-weary Americans:\n\nWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\n\nUnfortunately for the man who once called tariff the \u201cmost beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d the public, including many Americans who voted for him in November, believe fighting higher prices is job one. In a February 25 Economist-YouGov survey, 98 percent of Americans called inflation and prices an \u201cimportant\u201d issue, 78 percent called it \u201cvery important,\u201d and it ranked first on a list of \u201cissues important to you\u201d with \u201cjobs and economy\u201d ranking second. The sense that Trump has not adequately prioritized conquering inflation is already growing: 66 percent of respondents to a February 9 CBS News poll agreed that the administration\u2019s efforts to lower prices are \u201cnot enough.\u201d\n\nUp until now, Team Trump 2.0 has concentrated its fire not on inflation but on disrupting the federal bureaucracy. Even if you believe federal deficit spending is a principal cause of inflation, the wild cuts to federal personnel and programs being pursued by Trump and Elon Musk are completely outstripped by demands for tax cuts and more spending on defense and border security, so it\u2019s not as if the administration can credibly argue it is bringing down deficits or debts.\n\nIf Trump doesn\u2019t recalibrate his priorities pretty soon, he will be vulnerable to the charge that he\u2019s pursuing a course that will punish some of his most loyal supporters. Already his tariff agenda is becoming decidedly unpopular, as the Washington Post reports:\n\nWhile Americans seemed open to and even supportive of the broad concept of tariffs when Trump pitched them during the 2024 campaign, the momentum appears to have swung in the other direction. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll in mid-February showed Americans were about evenly split on Trump\u2019s more-limited tariffs on Chinese goods. But they opposed the tariffs on Mexico 59 percent to 34 percent, and they opposed the tariffs on Canada 64-31. Independents opposed both by around 40 points. The same poll showed 69 percent of Americans felt the tariffs would increase the prices they pay. That included 53 percent of Republicans.\n\nOne upcoming batch of threatened tariffs on agricultural goods may particularly hit working-class supermarket customers, as Bloomberg observed:\n\nTrump said the U.S. would impose tariffs on \u201cexternal\u201d agricultural products starting on April 2, his latest threat to impose trade barriers on imported goods \u2026 The president did not provide more detail on which products would be affected, or if there would be any exceptions. But the move comes just as U.S. food imports balloon, driving the country\u2019s agriculture trade deficit to a record $49 billion this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast last week.\n\nAside from immediately raising the price of imported foods, these tariffs will definitely produce retaliations, risking overseas markets for farmers in deep-red heartland areas. Trump\u2019s message for these farmers? It\u2019s pretty much the same thing free-trade fans used to say to manufacturing workers facing job losses \u2014 get ready to change your lives in a big hurry:\n\nTo the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!\n\nSomehow, it\u2019s unlikely that farmers who are being forced to completely abandon old markets and find new sources of income (and, in many cases, grow different crops) will find the process much \u201cfun.\u201d And like consumers paying more for groceries and other goods, they may not experience much compensatory joy in Trump\u2019s efforts to make himself a global bullyboy at their expense. Like letting Musk run wild, Trump\u2019s pursuit of his protectionist agenda is a self-indulgence that may cost him dearly."

In today\u2019s edition, we talk with Sen. Chris Murphy about how he\u2019s attempting to position himself as the tip of the spear of Democratic Party efforts to oppose President Donald Trump. Plus, Scott Bland notes there are lessons for the party from an election last month across the Atlantic. And we sort through the fallout from last week\u2019s Oval Office spat.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nHow one Democrat is placing himself at the center of the Trump resistance\n\nBy Ben Kamisar, Julie Tsirkin and Andrew Arenge\n\nWhat\u2019s Chris Murphy up to?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that prompted us to sit down with the Democratic senator from Connecticut last week. Since the start of the new Trump administration, Murphy has traded in a reputation as a behind-the-scenes, bipartisan dealmaker for a new posture as one his party\u2019s most vocal critics of the president.\n\nAnd he\u2019s spending big bucks to get his message out to the public. Murphy has put more money toward ads on Meta platforms in the last month than he has in the previous five years combined. In many of these ads, he\u2019s asking donors to help him fund a political movement.\n\nIt\u2019s a shift even Murphy admitted could \u201clook a little schizophrenic.\u201d But it\u2019s one he says is born from his belief that President Donald Trump represents a threat to democracy that forces people like him to shake free of their old ways of doing things.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody is trying to grab power, when somebody is trying to destroy democracy, they benefit from people who are static, who refuse to be nimble,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cThis moment is different, that this threat is unique \u2014 and to me, you know, we don\u2019t have another year to fight this attempt to destroy democracy. Our democracy might be gone in six months.\u201d\n\nMurphy is also focused on how he believes the Democratic Party should stand up to Trump while not defining itself exclusively through his lens. It\u2019s a trap he said the party fell into in 2020, when he believed a campaign centered on a message of \u201csaving democracy\u201d gave voters the wrong impression that Democrats approved of a broader system he says is slanted against everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cThat economic message, the message that speaks to a lot of things that Bernie Sanders talks about, is a unifying message in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people in the Democratic Party tried to make it sound like Bernie was divisive, when, in fact, Bernie\u2019s message, still to this day, speaks to a lot of folks that voted for Donald Trump, a lot of folks that we would love to have back in our camp.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats desperately searching for their next generation of leaders, Murphy, 51, shrugged off the idea he is setting himself up for a future White House bid.\n\nBeing president is \u201cjust not in my brain at all right now,\u201d he said, adding that \u201csounds like a pretty hard, miserable job.\u201d\n\nRead more from our interview \u2192\n\nMeanwhile, in Illinois: Natasha Korecki digs into how Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker is also attempting to carve out space for himself as an oppositional force to Trump.\n\nA lesson for Democrats from an election overseas\n\nBy Scott Bland\n\nAmong the many questions Democrats are trying to figure out after 2024: How did they lose the massive edge among young voters they had relied on in recent years, and what can they do to fix it?\n\nElection results from an ocean away serve as a reminder that the Democratic Party\u2019s problems aren\u2019t just its problems \u2014 that there are broader forces buffeting voters beyond the personalities that often seem to be driving U.S. politics.\n\nExit polls from Germany\u2019s parliamentary elections last month showed how the traditional political parties in the country\u2019s coalition government saw their support splinter \u2014 and, in particular, how young voters rushed to the far left (the Left party) and the far right (the AfD). The two parties combined for 30% of the vote overall but collected nearly half of their support from voters under 25, according to the public broadcasters\u2019 exit polls.\n\nJust as in the U.S., there was also a notable youth gender gap, with 35% of the youngest female voters backing the Left party (versus just 16% of young men), while 27% of young men backed AfD (versus just 15% of young women).\n\nThe trends speak to the same polarization by gender and general dissatisfaction with traditional politicians and institutions hitting young voters in the U.S.\n\nJohn Della Volpe, the polling director at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, noted some of the factors affecting young voters in the U.S. are true throughout other Western democracies.\n\n\u201cThe Covid pandemic, but also the global economy, inflation, cost of housing \u2014 these are issues that transcend national borders,\u201d said Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard Youth Poll. \u201cCertainly in this country, I don\u2019t feel like the young people I talk to on a weekly basis feel like their leaders understand the challenges a young person faces, or that they care about them. \u2026 So they\u2019re looking for other voices, independent voices often, who are able to connect with them.\u201d\n\nFallout from the Trump-Zelenskyy Oval Office clash\n\nThe ripple effects from last Friday\u2019s shouting match between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office are still ongoing. Here\u2019s the latest:\n\nZelenskyy said over the weekend that he believes his country\u2019s relationship with the U.S. \u201cwill continue\u201d and that he\u2019s still willing to sign a rare-earth minerals deal.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted Zelenskyy on Truth Social for suggesting that an end to his country\u2019s war with Russia is \u201cvery, very far way.\u201d Trump wrote: \u201cThis is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\u201d\n\nThe clash has raised new questions about the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, with Trump administration officials discussing whether to pause military aid to the country.\n\nIt has also led some Republican leaders in the U.S. to suggest Zelenskyy should resign. Critics say that would be a boost for Russia, which has tried to oust Zelenskyy for years.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udcb2Tariff watch: Trump said that U.S. tariffs are still expected to take effect tomorrow on Canada and Mexico.

            "full_content": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, with Rep. Maxine Waters, speaks during the We Choose to Fight: Nobody Elected Elon rally at the Treasury Department. Photo: Jemal Countess/MoveOn/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday night, President Trump will give the first joint address to Congress since his reelection. \u201cTOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BIG. I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS!,\u201d he said on Truth Social Monday morning.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech comes as his administration, in league with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, continues to make significant cuts to federal agencies in the name of eliminating excess spending, resulting in mass layoffs in various government sectors. With more Americans voicing their displeasure in town halls and polls, Democrats are looking to capitalize on the momentum and keep those reductions top of mind for voters.\n\nSeveral Democratic members of Congress revealed they have invited federal workers who recently lost their jobs to attend the president\u2019s address as their personal guests. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Monday that he would be joined by Alissa Ellman, a disabled Army veteran who was fired from her position at the Buffalo VA. \u201cFiring her, firing veterans, and slashing thousands from the VA workforce is outrageous and should be reversed. This is not how you treat our veterans \u2014 it\u2019s not just unacceptable, it\u2019s un-American,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAxios reported last week that Schumer was privately urging congressional Democrats to invite people who have been personally impacted by the administration\u2019s cuts. A similar request went out from the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, per CNN. Members in both chambers heeded the call. Representative Joe Courtney of Connecticut will be joined by Gabriel D\u2019Alatri, a Marine veteran who was laid off from the IRS. Representative Ritchie Torres of New York invited Nancy Bolan, a constituent who worked for USAID for six years. Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota invited Kate Severson, a former park ranger who worked at the state\u2019s Voyageurs National Park, writing on social media, \u201cMusk and Trump should have to face the hardworking Park Rangers they sacked.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats, however, are choosing to skip Tuesday\u2019s speech entirely, an action reminiscent of past boycotts of Trump\u2019s first-term congressional addresses. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said Sunday that he\u2019s opting out of Trump\u2019s speech and will be holding a virtual town hall on Facebook instead, urging his constituents to submit questions ahead of time.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut announced his intention to boycott in an CNN interview Sunday, saying he believes the president\u2019s speech will be a \u201cMAGA pep rally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Donald Trump is going to spew a series of lies about his alignment with Russia, about what he\u2019s trying to do to allow Elon Musk to essentially monetize the American government to enrich Musk and his billionaire crowd. And I\u2019m just not going to be a part of that,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nSince Trump has taken office, Musk\u2019s DOGE has touted billions of dollars in savings for the American taxpayer by eliminating grants, contracts, and even real-estate leases. A recent New York Times report, however, alleges its successes have been inflated with the organization removing some of its claimed savings from its own website. While the cuts\u2019 impacts are still being determined, recent polling suggests the American public is mixed on the changes. An NPR\u2013PBS News\u2013Marist poll released Monday found that 55 percent of U.S. residents believed the extensive cuts in federal staffing and funding would do more harm than good, while 45 percent said they thought the opposite."

The widespread presence of abusive behavior in the digital domain affects the daily lives of our children, families, and communities,\u201d Trump said at an event on Capitol Hill on Monday, which comes as she has so far spent limited time in Washington.\n\n\u201cIn an era where digital interactions are integral to daily life, it is imperative that we safeguard children from mean-spirited and hurtful online behavior,\u201d Trump added \u2013 expressing sentiments seemingly at odds with some of President Donald Trump\u2019s social media posts that often use personal attacks and name-calling for political opponents and perceived enemies.\n\nSpeaking at a roundtable with lawmakers and advocates against and survivors of revenge porn, the first lady reaffirmed the \u201cBe Best\u201d platform established during the first Trump administration, which included a focus on online safety, as she urged House lawmakers to pass the \u201cTAKE IT DOWN\u201d Act, which is aimed at protecting Americans from deepfake and revenge pornography.\n\nThe bill \u2014 first introduced by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and passed in the Senate last month with bipartisan support \u2014 \u201cwould criminalize the publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \u2018deepfake pornography\u2019), and require social media and similar websites to have in place procedures to remove such content upon notification from a victim,\u201d according to Cruz\u2019s office.\n\nTrump offered a dig at Democrats, who were largely absent from the roundtable discussion.\n\n\u201cI expected to see more Democrat leaders with us here today to address this serious issue. Surely as adults, we can prioritize America\u2019s children ahead of partisan politics,\u201d the first lady said at the event, which drew top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, as well as Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California.\n\nIn the past year, targets of AI-generated, non-consensual pornographic images have ranged from prominent women such as Taylor Swift and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to high school girls, including Elliston Berry, a 15-year-old from Texas who joined the first lady on Capitol Hill Monday.\n\n\u201cThey superimposed her (Berry\u2019s) face into pornographic content without her consent, solely to humiliate her. And although Elliston\u2019s family contacted the social media companies for help, their efforts fell upon deaf ears. Ultimately, the fake images circulated worldwide,\u201d the first lady said.\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content, like deepfakes. This toxic environment can be severely damaging. \u2026 Every young person deserves a safe online space to express themselves freely, without the looming threat of exploitation or harm.\u201d\n\nBerry, along with her mother and stepfather, Anna and Mark McAdams, will be guests of the first lady at the president\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, according to the office of the first lady.\n\nAfter attending the inauguration and joining her husband to tour natural disaster damage in North Carolina and California, Melania Trump was absent from the White House between January 24 and February 22, when she reemerged to host a dinner with the nation\u2019s governors.\n\nTrump was expected to spend a majority of her time between New York, where son Barron is attending college, and Florida, CNN reported during the presidential transition. Sources familiar with her thinking said at the time that she would still be present for major events and would have her own platform and priorities as first lady.\n\nEven as she\u2019s been open about traversing the East Coast, the first lady has previously emphasized that she\u2019d be in DC. Asked where she planned to spend her time in a January 13 interview with Fox News\u2019 Ainsley Earhardt, Trump said, \u201cI will be in the White House. And, you know, when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cBut my first priority is, you know, to be a mom, to be a first lady, to be a wife, and once we are in on January 20, you serve the country.\u201d\n\nThe president has also spent significant time in Florida since Inauguration Day, traveling to Miami or Palm Beach for five out of his first six weekends in office."

            "full_content": "Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry that sunk tens of millions into the Trump campaign and inauguration has so far gotten everything its investors have wanted from the new president. The Securities and Exchange Commission is abandoning or pausing its cases against some of the biggest players in the industry while agreeing not to police the Wild West shootout that is the meme-coin market these days. They\u2019ve got major influence in the Trump Cabinet, and the first-ever \u201ccrypto summit\u201d will be held on Friday. But despite all these warm signals coming from the White House, the crypto market was kind of sucking in February. There were massive sell-offs, tentpole tokens like bitcoin were taking a beating, and much of the news cycle in crypto was dominated by how much of a messy scam it could be for politicians who got too involved.\n\nBut on Sunday, Trump, or one of his crypto advisers, had an idea. For months now, the president has been promising a strategic national stockpile for cryptocurrency \u2014 an idea heavily promoted by the industry as a shortcut for the U.S. to assert some financial dominance in crypto. Rather than make the difficult (and potentially legislative) push to create the stockpile, Trump simply revealed the assets that would be inside it.\n\nIn the social-media announcement, Trump wrote that his stockpile would help ensure that the \u201cU.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\u201d But it was also a fairly obvious play to the crypto crowd, juicing prices without having to actually do anything. The value of bitcoin rallied by $9,000 over the afternoon while the other coins involved (ethereum, solana, XRP, and cardano) all saw significant gains. Cardano, the least valuable of the digital tokens, saw its price jump nearly 100 percent.\n\nBut the easy win could not reverse the larger forces (weakish demand for bitcoin, massive crypto hacks) that, in February, stymied the asset class that is supposed to be divorced from the larger economy. Today, bitcoin lost roughly half of yesterday\u2019s gains from the Trump bump. But more of a concern for Trump than the short-term value of these volatile tokens is the fact that many crypto bigwigs weren\u2019t thrilled by his announcement. Big investors, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, thought that including any coins other than bitcoin was an error. Others \u2014 like Palantir co-founder and libertarian billionaire Trump fan and Elon Musk friend Joe Lonsdale \u2014 called the president\u2019s stockpile dream a \u201ccrypto-bro scheme\u201d that he didn\u2019t want to realize with taxpayer money. Angel investor Jason Calacanis dismissed the idea as the latest \u201cTrump pump\u201d and \u201ccrypto grift.\u201d Considering Calacanis\u2019s close relationship to Trump\u2019s \u201ccrypto czar,\u201d David Sacks, this type of stuff may be a bad sign for the president on the crypto front:\n\nIf you tax Americans to buy crypto, don\u2019t be surprised if the people revolt. pic.twitter.com/OoatPdolOl \u2014 @jason (@Jason) March 2, 2025\n\nSacks, whose investment firm has massive investments in the five coins in the proposed stockpile, is hosting the White House\u2019s crypto summit on Friday. Perhaps everything will be hashed out among Trump, his advisers with massive crypto investments, and the industry leaders they are hoping to satisfy. But Trump is now entering the difficult part of his courtship of the crypto world. So far, he\u2019s lived up to the good will through simple actions under his office\u2019s control \u2014 like forcing out ex-SEC chair Gary Gensler, killing civil actions against major firms, or freeing the crypto-libertarian champion Ross Ulbricht. But now he might actually need to do something to move the market. As crypto skeptic Molly White wrote, we may finally be arriving at the point where \u201cwords alone seem to be running out.\u201d"

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump has said Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 started the war. He\u2019s called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 not Vladimir Putin \u2014 a dictator. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration is standing down on a suite of tough anti-Kremlin policies.\n\nIn just over a month, Trump has executed a startling realignment of American foreign policy, effectively throwing U.S. support behind Moscow and rejecting the tight alliance with Kyiv cultivated by former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe extraordinary pivot has upended decades of hawkish foreign policy toward Russia that provided a rare area of bipartisan consensus in an increasingly divided nation. Trump\u2019s recent moves have drawn international attention, unsettling U.S. allies in Europe and thrilling conservative populists who favor a turn away from Zelenskyy.\n\nThe new posture was put in stark relief on Friday during a tense Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. The leaders clashed in front of the press, raising questions about the future of American support for Kyiv, more than three years after Russia opened the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.\n\nU.S. officials have made a series of policy changes in recent weeks that seem to herald a more cooperative stance with Russia:\n\nThe White House ordered a pause on military aid to Ukraine as the administration carries out a review, a White House official and a U.S. official told NBC News on Monday.\n\nLate last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the U.S. Cyber Command to cease offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told NBC News. It\u2019s unclear how long the order will last.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, on her first day in office, disbanded efforts to seize the assets of Russian oligarchs, breaking up Biden-era programs known as Task Force Klepto Capture and the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.\n\nIn a separate directive, Bondi ordered a halt to a federal law enforcement initiative to combat secret influence campaigns by Russia, China and other traditional U.S. adversaries that attempt to sow division in U.S. politics.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and other top Trump administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to start peace negotiations with Russia \u2014 but Zelenskyy said Ukrainian officials hadn\u2019t been invited.\n\nTrump has long professed a desire to reset and improve relations with Russia. He has repeatedly said he believes it is in the national interest to \u201cget along\u201d with Moscow and cast doubt on the value of core parts of the post-World War II global security architecture, including NATO and the European Union. Trump\u2019s first term was shadowed by former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation \u2014 a probe that Trump has repeatedly dismissed as the \u201cRussia hoax.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in Helsinki in 2018. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP file\n\nTrump has pushed back on Democrats and other critics who have accused him of deferring to Russia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aligned with Putin. I\u2019m not aligned with anybody. I\u2019m aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I\u2019m aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with,\" Trump said Friday from the Oval Office, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nBut the U.S. government now appears to be pivoting away from Kyiv. In the weeks since his inauguration, Trump has suggested Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion and \u201cstarted\u201d the war, echoing familiar talking points from the Kremlin.\n\nThe president's relationship with Zelenskyy has long been fraught, partly owing to a July 2019 phone call in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the latter's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. After the call leaked, it helped touch off the first impeachment of Trump. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.)\n\nVice President JD Vance has likewise been consistently skeptical of continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThe bitter irony of America\u2019s present predicament is that the very people who cheer for permanent arms shipments to Ukraine also supported the de-industrialization of America,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Sunday. \u201cThe very things you want us to send are things we don\u2019t make enough of.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s approach is a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia, a period spanning the Cold War with the former Soviet Union as well as the rise of Putin. American presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, typically struck a more bellicose tone on the threat posed by an emboldened Russia.\n\nPutin\u2019s regime has welcomed the overtures from Trump. In statements reported by Russian state media agency TASS, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised Trump as a pragmatist who operates with \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see that the collective West has begun to partially lose its unity,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday.\n\nDemocrats and anti-Trump Republican commentators have sharply criticized the administration since the Oval Office meeting, accusing Trump of effectively selling out Ukraine. In a post on his Truth Social platform early Monday, Trump defended himself and insisted he had helped keep much of Ukraine intact.\n\n\u201cThe only President who gave none of Ukraine\u2019s land to Putin\u2019s Russia is President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cRemember that when the weak and ineffective Democrat\u2019s criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out anything they say!\u201d\n\nBut there is a partisan divide on Ukraine; Gallup recently found that 84% of Democrats have a favorable view of Ukraine, whereas only 54% of Republican poll respondents said the same.\n\nIn the wake of the Trump-Zelenskyy spat, a handful of Republican lawmakers defended Ukraine, while most \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 said Zelenskyy may have to resign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet Friday in the Oval Office. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nThe feud between continued Monday, with Trump disparaging his Ukrainian counterpart in a post on social media.\n\nTrump is by no means the first president to aim for a less hostile relationship with Moscow, however. Barack Obama and his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, embarked on a high-profile bid to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia. But those efforts largely fell apart after Putin invaded Crimea and seized it from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe relationship between Biden and Zelenskyy showed signs of strain, too. NBC News has reported that Biden lost his temper with Zelenskyy during a phone call in June 2022, according to four people familiar with the call. Biden raised his voice and said Zelenskyy could afford to show more gratitude for the billions in U.S. military assistance for Kyiv.\n\nBiden and his top diplomats nonetheless worked to rally international support for Kyiv\u2019s resistance to Moscow; the United Kingdom, France and other European allies joined the fight.\n\nThe disagreement between Biden and Zelenskyy came in a private phone call \u2014 not a public dressing down in the Oval Office. During their meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy he should be much more grateful as the conversation grew more tense, ending with the Ukraine leader leaving the U.S. without signing a minerals deal.\n\n\u201cYou got to be more thankful, because, let me tell you, you don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said."

            "full_content": "Details continue to emerge about the deaths of Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog after they were found dead in their home in New Mexico on Feb. 26.\n\nOver a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95, and they had different causes of death. Here's what we know from officials.\n\nWhat did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die from?\n\nHackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.\n\n\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.\n\nArakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.\n\nIt does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.\n\nBoth Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.\n\nHow long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?\n\n\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.\n\nBut with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.\n\nCellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.\n\nBased on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.\n\nA search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet. Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nIt is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.\n\nWhere were Hackman and Arakawa found?\n\nHackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.\n\nHackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.\n\nArakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.\n\nArakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.\n\nThe pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.\n\nHackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead\n\nOne of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.\n\nArakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nDogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.\n\nThere were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.\n\nHow did Arakawa get hantavirus?\n\nHantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.\n\nIt was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.\n\nHer and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.\n\nHantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.\n\nNo signs of a carbon monoxide leak\n\nThere were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.\n\nSanta Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.\n\nThe gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.\n\nNo signs of foul play\n\nDeputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.\n\nThere were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.\n\nWhat movies was Gene Hackman in?\n\nHackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.\n\nSome of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).\n\nHe won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"\n\nHackman retired from the screen in 2004.\n\nHe also wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels.\n\nGene Hackman tribute at the Oscars\n\nThe Oscars paid tribute to Hackman at the awards show on March 2.\n\n\"Our community lost a giant and I lost a dear friend,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman before an In Memoriam video recognized actors and others who had died in the past year.\n\nFreeman appeared in two films with Hackman, \"Unforgiven\" and \"Under Suspicion.\"\n\n\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said.\n\nWho was Betsy Arakawa?\n\nArakawa, who was raised in Honolulu, was a concert pianist and co-founder of a home furnishing business, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhen she was 11, she performed at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall and later in life, she played with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, the AP reported.\n\nArakawa and Hackman met while she was working part-time at a California fitness center in the 1980s, according to a New York Times article.\n\nArakawa helped found Pandora's, a home decor store in Santa Fe, in 2001, the AP reported.\n\nDoes Gene Hackman have any children?\n\nHackman had three children \u2014 two daughters and a son \u2014 with his first wife, Faye Maltese.\n\nHis daughters Elizabeth and Leslie and granddaughter Annie confirmed his death in a statement.\n\n\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,\" they wrote.\n\ncontributed to this report."

            "full_content": "The co-president struts his stuff. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOn the eve of Donald Trump\u2019s big speech to a joint session of Congress, the name on everyone\u2019s lips in Washington, D.C., isn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s, but the man so often described as co-president, Elon Musk. His firing and canceling rampage across the federal government at the helm of his strange and law-disdaining DOGE has both preempted and complicated Trump\u2019s agenda to an extent that is extraordinary in part because it was so unexpected (the whole scheme was apparently thought up well after Election Day) and remains unprecedented.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance the absolute and very intentional chaos of DOGE will soon give way to something slightly more orderly as Trump\u2019s appointees get settled in and take over the task of demolishing their own agencies. But that\u2019s as unclear as the fate of the vast litigation DOGE has generated by treating the U.S. government like a privately owned tech company being stripped down to the studs. In the meantime, Musk has become the central figure in the congressional drama that could very well lead to a government shutdown in less than two weeks.\n\nThe government is currently being funded by a stopgap bill enacted in December, which Musk very nearly blew up at the time with a tweetstorm demanding deeper cuts than congressional Republicans were in a position to obtain. It expires on March 14. First Trump and then Republican leaders Mike Johnson and John Thune agreed that rather than adding to the instability in Washington with an early government shutdown, they\u2019d just back another stopgap (know as a \u201cclean continuing resolution\u201d or \u201cclean CR\u201d) until the end of the fiscal year in September. It was presumed that Democrats \u2014 who absolutely have the power to block any CR with a Senate filibuster or by denying Johnson House votes that his fractious right wing might refuse to supply \u2014 would go along out of relief that Republicans weren\u2019t demanding big new spending cuts.\n\nBut Musk has screwed up this deal. Initially Johnson talked about including existing DOGE cuts in a not-so-clean CR, recognizing that the fiscal hawks of the House Freedom Caucus were a Musk fan club thrilled by the chainsaw he was wielding across federal agencies. But now Johnson has backed off that plan and gone \u201cclean\u201d with his CR plans. So now it\u2019s Democrats who have a big decision to make. Do they continue to insist that any deal on current spending include putting a leash on DOGE? Or do they take the deal on offer because they fear being blamed for a government shutdown and hope that either Trump gets sick of Musk upstaging him or the courts rein him in?\n\nSo as the blame game over a potential shutdown intensifies, privately Democrats and Republicans would probably agree it\u2019s Musk who is the chief obstacle to a rare bipartisan deal in 2025. And as the leering cartoon-villain face of the Trump administration, he is also a threat to Trump\u2019s standing in public opinion, as one Republican consultant admitted to Politico:\n\n\u201cThe bigger risk is people being like, \u2018[Elon\u2019s] a fucking asshole. Can you at least have some compassion about what these people are going through? Can you at least treat them with respect? They have mouths to feed, roofs to keep over their heads,\u2019\u201d the consultant added. \u201cYeah, it has to happen. But why does an extremely pale lion have to play with his food here?\u201d\n\nThe answer to that question may be that no one, not even Trump, can completely control Musk, and his freedom to be a jerk is considerably enhanced by his superstar status among the noisiest elements of Trump\u2019s MAGA base, where cruelty in dealing with \u201cthe enemy\u201d is valued above all. And there\u2019s another problem for Musk\u2019s ostensible boss just ahead: Even if Democrats surrender and agree to the \u201cclean CR\u201d Republicans want, is there any guarantee that Musk won\u2019t again rile up a vast troll army on X to defeat it unless it includes more destructive spending cuts? Having enjoyed himself so conspicuously in trying to gut the hated federal government, why not shut it down entirely for a while? Any deal in Congress had better include Musk or he could very well make life difficult for his co-president."

            "full_content": "A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson released a statement on the detainment of the owners of a popular New Jersey restaurant amid outrage from local community leaders and residents.\n\nLast Tuesday, ICE officers raided the Jersey Kebab restaurant in Haddon Township and arrested the owners, Emine Emanet and her husband, Celal Emanet.\n\nEmine Emanet and her husband, Celal. WCAU\n\n\u201cDuring the investigation, ICE administratively arrested two Turkish citizens, Emine and Celal Emanet, who are present in the United States illegally. ICE authority under Title 8 of the U.S. Code enables the agency to investigate and enforce immigration laws, particularly in cases where immigration violations intersect with national security, public safety and transnational crime,\u201d the ICE spokesperson wrote in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe Emanets were served a notice to appear before an immigration judge and place in removal proceedings.\u201d\n\nCelal Emanet was released from custody with an ankle monitor and spoke with NBC10 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and my heart was getting crushed,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so much nervous. But I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong in my life.\u201d\n\nHis wife remains in custody at an ICE detention center in North Jersey.\n\nJersey Kebab Mediterranean Grill restaurant in Haddon Township, N.J. WCAU\n\n\u201cEmine Emanet remains in ICE custody and Celal Emanet is on an Alternative to Detention (ATD), each pending removal proceedings. ICE\u2019s ATD program, which began in 2004, uses technology and case management to ensure alien compliance with release conditions, court hearings and final orders of removal,\u201d the ICE spokesperson wrote in part.\n\nImmigration attorney Joseph Best told NBC10 the couple moved to the United States from Turkey in 2008 on an R1 visa. According to Camden County officials, Celal Emanet applied for a green card before the visa expired. Emanet said his application was denied three times and the couple has been in limbo since 2016.\n\n\u201cThis incident is appalling and an unfortunate example of just how broken the immigration system is here in our country,\u201d Camden County commissioner director Louis Cappelli Jr. said in a statement on Feb. 27. \u201cThis couple works hard every single day to provide for their four children, grandchildren and to feed the community. They have been left without any options when it comes to their immigration status and to be arrested for something they have no control over, is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nCappelli, Haddon Township Mayor Randall Teague and other community leaders held a press conference in support of the Emanet family outside Jersey Kebab on Thursday.\n\nTeague described the couple\u2019s restaurant as a \u201cpillar\u201d in Haddon Township. He also said the family has participated in Toys for Tots drives and organized food drives that have \u201cleft a lasting impact\u201d on the community.\n\n\u201cWe consider this situation maybe somewhat different than some of the other ones that we hear on TV where there\u2019s criminals and rapists and so forth coming into our country, Teague said. \u201cThey came in here legally and they\u2019re trying to stay here legally.\u201d\n\nTeague said Haddon Township leaders reached out to Rep. Donald Norcross, D-N.J., for guidance on the ongoing case.\n\nThe local officials also had a broader message about the immigration system and delays within it.\n\n\u201cThis family is a family that embodies the very best of Camden County. And now they\u2019re torn apart by this broken immigration system,\u201d Cappelli said. \u201cIt is time to stand up for good people. It is time to stand up for humanity. These folks do not deserve this. These folks do not deserve this. Fix the immigration system and let\u2019s fix it now.\u201d\n\nCamden County Commissioner Virginia Betteridge, whose parents came to America from Cuba in the 1960s, also spoke about fixing the \u201cpathway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for people to be incarcerated when they\u2019re waiting to get their documents in order and to be sure that they can become a resident and then a citizen of this country,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to Camden County leaders, Haddon Township residents are also showing their support for the couple. A GoFundMe for the family has raised more than $310,000 as of Sunday.\n\nAlso on Sunday, community members gathered inside Anjali Power Yoga across the street from Jersey Kebab to write letters in support of Emine Emanet\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cThe goal is for the judges, the politicians and anyone locally with influence and power to know that the community stands by this resident,\u201d Isis Williams of the Haddon Township Equity Initiative told NBC10.\n\nThe couple\u2019s son, Muhammed Emanet, plans to take those letters to the immigration judge who ultimately presides over his mother\u2019s case. He said his family has been touched by the outpouring of support.\n\n\u201cI just cannot thank the community enough for the support they have given us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just wish that we were judged amongst our peers instead of being judged by other judges who do not personally know us at all.\u201d\n\nWhile Jersey Kebab remains closed until further notice, Muhammed Emanet still cooked free food for the community over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThey are a good family. They are not criminals. They entered the U.S. legally,\" Best, the immigration lawyer, wrote in a statement to NBC10 on Sunday. \u201cThe Federal immigration and nationality law provides for them the legal means to rectify their situation and seek relief from removal before the immigration court.\u201d\n\nBest told NBC10 he is waiting for the couple\u2019s case to be entered into the immigration court system, which will start the removal proceedings ICE is requesting but also allow the Emanets to ask for legal status. It\u2019s unclear how long that process would take. New Jersey\u2019s immigration court currently has more than 220,000 pending cases.\n\nThe couple\u2019s arrest occurred amid a nationwide push from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to detain immigrants who entered the United States without the proper documents.\n\nWhile the administration vowed to prioritize the \u201cworst first\u201d when it comes to arrests and deportations, the number of detainees in ICE custody without a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges increased by more than 1,800 in the first two weeks of February, representing 41% of the 4,422 total new detainees in that period, according to data obtained by NBC News.\n\nThis story was originally published in NBC 10 Philadelphia."

Kennedy Jr. on Sunday expressed his \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the Texas measles outbreak and cautioned that parents should consult with health-care providers \u201cto understand their options to get the MMR vaccine\u201d for their children.\n\nKennedy outlined in an opinion piece on Fox News the outbreak represents a \u201ccall to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.\u201d\n\nHe called for a considered response on vaccines and their availability from all concerned based solely on science:\n\nAs healthcare providers, community leaders, and policymakers, we have a shared responsibility to protect public health. This includes ensuring that accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy is disseminated. We must engage with communities to understand their concerns, provide culturally competent education, and make vaccines readily accessible for all those who want them. It is also our responsibility to provide up-to-date guidance on available therapeutic medications. While there is no approved antiviral for those who may be infected, CDC has recently updated their recommendation supporting administration of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate, and severe infection. Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality. Parents play a pivotal role in safeguarding their children\u2019s health. All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\n\nKennedy noted the Texas outbreak has escalated rapidly, with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reporting 146 confirmed cases since late January 2025, primarily in the South Plains region.\n\nThis outbreak has claimed the life of a school-aged child, the first measles-related fatality in the United States in over a decade.\n\nKennedy has previously addressed those who claim he is \u201canti-vaccine\u201d and more.\n\nWATCH \u2014 Protester Disrupts RFK Jr. Confirmation Hearing:\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Kennedy said in January that he is simply \u201cpro-safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked for years to raise awareness about the mercury and toxic chemicals in fish, and nobody called me anti-fish. And I believe that my that vaccines play a critical role in healthcare. All of my kids are vaccinated. I\u2019ve written many books on vaccines. My first book in 2014, a first line of it is, I am not anti-vaccine, and the last line is, I am not anti-vaccine,\u201d he said, explaining that he is not the \u201cenemy of food producers,\u201d either, placing an emphasis on the importance of American farms.\n\n\u201cAmerican farms are the bedrock of our culture, of our politics, of our national security. I was a kid, and I spent my summer working on ranches. I went to work with our farmers. I want to work with our farmers and food producers. Remove burdens regulations and unleash American ingenuity. MAHA simply cannot succeed without a partnership, a full partnership of American farmers,\u201d he continued.\n\nUltimately, Kennedy acknowledged he has \u201coften disturbed the status quo by asking uncomfortable questions.\u201d"

            "full_content": "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.\n\nEither Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d\n\nCritics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.\n\nAn Ukrainian serviceman carries an artillery shell to fire toward Russian positions near Donetsk on Sunday. Roman Chop / AP\n\nKremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d\n\nStill, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.\n\n\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d\n\nTrump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d\n\nMore and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.\n\nOther polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President JD Vance meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nZelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.\n\nOne man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.\n\nBut in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d\n\nStill, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.\n\nOne soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d\n\nYevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d\n\nTrump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d\n\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.\n\nAlexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

            "full_content": "Sunday, during his show\u2019s opening monologue, FNC\u2019s \u201cLife, Liberty & Levin\u201d host Mark Levin told his viewers there was nothing to be \u201cgiddy\u201d about regarding Friday\u2019s blowup between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nLevin, who maintains he supports Ukraine\u2019s cause, said Zelensky \u201cblew it\u201d during the meeting with Trump.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nSaturday, before \u2014 this past Saturday, I spent the monologue discussing the genius of the Trump plan with respect to rare earth minerals in Ukraine, the partnership with Ukraine, and what would it do? It would involve American private sector investments, hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars to extract rare earth minerals in Ukraine, which, for the most part, cannot do it, and certainly after the war, it can\u2019t do it, which would help Ukraine in numerous ways more than the Marshall Plan.\n\nImagine that capital flowing into Ukraine, rebuilding its infrastructure. Imagine the number of Ukrainians getting jobs, the buildings going up, the highways being built.\n\nImagine the benefit to the United States. We would not only be making money, but we would have access to rare earth minerals that we need. We need for our defense, we need for our space system. We need for our medical industries.\n\nRussia wants those minerals, in addition to geographic ideas and claims, all of which are ridiculous, Putin wants those minerals. China wants those minerals.\n\nAnd so the idea is we have a real business relationship with the people of Ukraine, Americans working next to each other with Ukrainians. We have a significant presence there, and that significant presence there serves as a National Security buffer, a commercial buffer, as I explained last week.\n\nSo really, Ukraine wouldn\u2019t even need to join NATO. We\u2019d have a special relationship with Ukraine, critical to the United States and critical to Ukraine. Brilliant.\n\nThe Biden administration didn\u2019t come up with that plan. The Democratic Party didn\u2019t come up with that plan. Trump came up with that plan. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, the blow up that took place in the Oval Office. In thinking about this, you know, people react immediately. I like to think about things a little bit. There\u2019s two camps that are giddy about this, absolutely giddy. And there\u2019s nothing to be giddy about.\n\nNumber one, the Democrats, they\u2019re all over TV with their Democrat media trashing Donald Trump, accusing him again of being in Putin\u2019s back pocket. That is a lie. He\u2019s not in Putin\u2019s back pocket, and he\u2019s never been in Putin\u2019s back pocket. He\u2019s dealing with reality, and he\u2019s trying to bring this thing to an end on terms that also improve the situation with the United States.\n\nNumber two, the pro-Putin forces on the right. I\u2019m not of the right. I\u2019m a constitutional conservative. We conservatives are not right wingers. That\u2019s what the Democrats call us. We\u2019re not right wing anything. We\u2019re square in the middle of the political spectrum. We are the center of the political spectrum, constitutional conservatism.\n\nThe radical left, the Marxists; the radical right, the fascists. We are in the center. We need to take that political spectrum back.\n\nThat said they\u2019re thrilled. They\u2019re giddy. They support Putin. They actually want Putin to win.\n\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line, Zelensky blew it and he blew it big, and I speak as somebody who supports Ukraine. Ukraine, which was invaded without provocation. Ukraine, the cities and the people are targeted. The infrastructure is targeted.\n\nUkraine, up to 700,000 of their children, children have been brought into Russia against their will, against the will of their parents, and adopted out to Russian families to become Russian citizens. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s grotesque.\n\nI see how little people talk about Putin, how little they talk about his role in this war, how little you read about it or hear about it, very little condemnation of Putin as he sits back and watches.\n\nZelensky, you handed Putin a victory and only you can fix it. Donald Trump has offered Ukraine and you a lifeline, a lifeline to build your ties with the United States, to build your economy, to build up your country, so that you can contribute to your own defenses as well. But you blew it, and you blew it, and you need to fix it.\n\nWhat was in this deal in part? It was a good deal.\n\nBBC: The preliminary agreement envisions that an investment fund will be set up for Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. The fund would be managed on equal terms.\n\nThere was no America coming in and raping the land and all the rest of it. According to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50 percent of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas, to the fund. The fund will then invest to provide the safety, security, and prosperity of Ukraine. That was the language in this deal.\n\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the U.S. while subject to U.S. law, maintain a long-term financial commitment, I quote, \u201cto the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.\u201d\n\nNobody else is going to do this. Nobody else can do this.\n\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC last week it was too early to talk about money. We\u2019re not talking about money. We\u2019re talking about building up your country.\n\nThe agreement states the U.S. will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under U.S. law. Ukrainian President rejected an initial request from the U.S. for half a trillion dollars in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has been dropped. Dropped.\n\nThere\u2019d be co-ownership, there\u2019d be no direct claims on anything.\n\nIn his wildest dreams, Zelensky should have grabbed this deal.\n\nBut before he met with Donald Trump, he met with a bunch of Democrats on Capitol Hill and others, and the story was broken by Michael Goodwin of \u201cThe New York Post.\u201d Before meeting Trump, Zelensky met with anti-Trump Democrats who advised him to reject the terms of the mineral deal the President was offering.\n\nAccording to Senator Chris Murphy \u2014 this guy is a loathsome reprobate from Connecticut. He is a cancer in the body politic. He\u2019s constantly on cable T.V. trashing Trump, trashing Elon Musk, just trashing every single time he possibly can \u2014 \u201cJust finished a meeting with President Zelensky here in Washington\u201d \u2014 this is what Murphy posted. \u201cHe confirmed that the Ukrainian people will not support a fake peace agreement where Putin gets everything he wants and there are no security arrangements for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s office posted that 11:15 AM on Friday, just an hour before Zelensky was meeting with President Trump, and then Murphy attached a picture of Zelensky at a conference table with Murphy seated on the opposite side. The purpose of the meeting was to sign the mineral agreement he and Trump represented had negotiated.\n\nSo this was supposed to be a formality, but he had twice refused to sign it after promising to, so he went back on the deal multiple times, and thanks to Murphy and his ilk, we now know he had no intention of signing it on Friday when he met with Trump.\n\nLike the original Russia hoax, Goodwin writes, that consumed much of Trump\u2019s first term. Russia 2.0 was born, a political desperation.\n\nSo the Democrats wanted this. The Democrats were trying to set up Trump, and Zelensky was foolish enough to go along with this and embrace it. Zelensky has to fix this for the sake of his own country.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry the Western Allies, they\u2019re rallying around Zelensky, you know, after the event with Donald Trump, says CNN, rallying around Zelensky.\n\nYou know what, America? It\u2019s about time somebody tell you how pathetic the Europeans have been in their support of Ukraine.\n\nPoland has stepped up. The Baltic States have stepped up. A few other countries. The four worst countries have the leaders with the biggest mouths \u2014 France, Britain, Germany, Italy, although I like their leader, but Italy, they have not stepped up to the plate like they could and should. Why? This is from the Center for Strategic and International Studies by Max Bergmann: Europe\u2019s approach to supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort is no longer fit for purpose. There\u2019s a desperate need for Europe to ramp up its defense industrial production.\n\nBut despite a clear consensus behind this urgent need, European production lines are not maxing out their capacity.\n\nThe root of the issue is not so much a lack of political will, but as is frequently the case with European defense, a failure to cooperate and a lack of funding.\n\nWhat the hell? They are all rallying around Zelensky, talk is cheap. Why don\u2019t they step up and do more?\n\nEurope has not yet shifted to the new reality that Ukraine faces a long war, he wrote, and this was several months ago.\n\nNow, Europe is contributing, as a collective 0.2 percent of their gross domestic product, 0.2 percent, not even one percent, not even a half percent.\n\nIf Europeans had to foot the entire bill, it would be 0.4 percent. In other words, if the United States withdrew altogether, they would have to double it to 0.4 percent still not even one percent of their GDP from countries that are telling us this is a vital defense issue, and I happen to think it is. I happen to think it is.\n\nHe says the new paradigm is urgently needed for Europe\u2019s military support for Ukraine. The challenge now is less about incentivizing countries to give weapons to Ukraine, but about getting European defense industries to ramp up production. This requires significant new funding and requires Europeans to do something they rarely do in defense \u2014 work together.\n\nThey\u2019ve been unloading their post-World War Two type weapons and some of their World War Two weapons to Ukraine, some new weapons, but mostly not. And now that those stockpiles have run out, and now that President Trump is the President and not Biden, Europe has an issue.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has awakened European governments to the need to invest in defense. European defense spending is up across the board with production increases as well. But it\u2019s not happening at the speed and scale it requires.\n\nIf this is the prelude to a potential World War Three, they need to step it up. They need to step it up. Donald Trump\u2019s idea of peace is a brilliant idea. We engage with Ukraine. We help build their economy while we\u2019re building ours. We help exploit their rare earth minerals that we don\u2019t have access to while we access them, which benefits them.\n\nIt keeps the Russians off their tail. It keeps the Chinese off their tail. Meanwhile, for us, China, Russia, India, are all competing throughout the third world, mostly for these minerals.\n\nRussia is taking over the Arctic Circle with 10 military bases, with the support of China. Donald Trump says, wait, that\u2019s a huge problem. Greenland, you\u2019ve got minerals. Greenland, you\u2019re there through their navigable waters to the Arctic Circle, we need to have a new relationship with Greenland. So the President sees this. He\u2019s not a Putinoid.\n\nNo, the Democrats did more to serve Putin by advising Zelensky to kill this deal than anything Donald Trump could possibly have done. And for the Putin supporters out there, you think you\u2019re giddy? You think you\u2019re funny? You\u2019re pathetic, as a matter of fact.\n\nBut let\u2019s go on. The biggest challenge to establishing what is the European Union fund will be getting approval within the European Union. Complacency and frugality are beginning to take over European politics, and European leaders, particularly Finance Ministers, they\u2019re used to claiming helplessness when it comes to funding defense.\n\nSo this is the realpolitik, America. This is the realpolitik. Ukraine is the victim. Russia is the aggressor.\n\nAsk the families in Syria, a half a million people Russia helped slaughter citizens. Ask them.\n\nRussia, under Putin. He\u2019s invaded Crimea, and he stole it from the Ukraine. Before that, he invaded the country of Georgia, and he stole 20 percent of that. He\u2019s got a thousand warheads aimed at us, a thousand.\n\nHe\u2019s got nuclear submarines off our shores. He keeps threatening our coasts. They keep buzzing our ships. They keep threatening the coast of Alaska.\n\nThey have a presence in Central and South America, hypersonic missiles. They have advanced hypersonic missiles aimed at us. They\u2019re not aimed at Ukraine or anybody else. They\u2019re aimed at us.\n\nThey now have a military relationship with China, and China\u2019s enemy is us. They have a military relationship with Iran. Iran\u2019s enemy is us. They have a military relationship with North Korea. North Korea\u2019s enemy is us.\n\nSo you Putanoids, you\u2019re pathetic. You\u2019re the 1930s isolationists. You Democrats, are a disgrace, a disgrace in trying to undermine this deal that Donald Trump is putting together.\n\nHonestly, the only one who has a sound policy, the only one who thought this through, the only one that actually has a plan that can work is Donald Trump."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nA top official at the US Agency for International Development was put on leave after issuing a scathing memo blaming Trump political appointees for the US government\u2019s inability to conduct lifesaving humanitarian work.\n\nThe official warned the Trump appointees\u2019 moves will \u201cno doubt result in preventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale.\u201d\n\nThe memo from Nicholas Enrich, the acting administrator for global heath at USAID, details \u201cobstacles\u201d put in place by \u201cpolitical leadership at USAID, the Department of State, and DOGE\u201d that have prevented the agency from implementing waivers for lifesaving assistance. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has repeatedly claimed he issued such waivers to exempt the assistance from a sweeping foreign aid freeze put in place in late January.\n\n\u201cThese actions individually and in combination have resulted in the U.S. Government\u2019s failure to implement critical lifesaving activities,\u201d Enrich wrote in the memo dated February 28 and seen by CNN.\n\nIn a separate memo obtained by CNN, Enrich warned a suspension of foreign aid and delays to lifesaving humanitarian assistance could cause surges in diseases like malaria, Ebola and avian flu, which he warned could have dire impacts on the US.\n\n\u201cA failure to contain infectious diseases at their source heightens the risk of transmission to the United States, posing a direct threat to public health and economic stability. The consequences extend beyond human health, impacting American businesses and families by increasing healthcare costs, disrupting international trade, and straining domestic resources,\u201d Enrich said in the 20-page memo, which was linked in the one dated February 28.\n\nHe projected there would be an additional 12.5 million to 17.9 million cases of malaria annually and an additional 71,000 to 166,000 deaths, with about 2,000 cases of malaria imported to the US per year.\n\nFor highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), Enrich said a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d could see 775 million cases globally, with 105 million in the US.\n\n\u201cBased on the known impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a HPAI pandemic is likely to cost the US at least $14 trillion,\u201d Enrich warned. \u201cThe economic impact of just animal losses from bird flu in 2022 cost the US economy up to $3 billion.\u201d\n\nEnrich also warned that suspending maternal and child health programs could cause tens of millions of pregnant women, newborns and children to lose access to lifesaving care. A suspension of nutrition services could result in 1 million children not being treated annually for severe acute malnutrition, Enrich said.\n\n\u201cMaternal and child health and nutrition foreign assistance makes America stronger by creating greater economic and political stability through improved family health, which increases the likelihood that children will attend school and grow into healthy, productive adults, thereby reducing conflicts, poverty, and radicalization of youth,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe separate memo, \u201crisks to U.S. National Security and Public Health,\u201d was dated March 4. Enrich had not filled out a recipient in the \u201cto\u201d field, but he had CC\u2019d four political appointees at USAID.\n\nEnrich recommended the US government \u201cresume all mechanisms with submitted life-saving waivers to avert crisis-level expenditures, prevent mortality and morbidity, and protect national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpholding these programs is not only a legal and humanitarian obligation but also a critical strategic investment to make America safer, more secure, and more prosperous,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his February 28 memo, Enrich detailed the types of activities impacted by the freeze, along with the actions taken by Trump administration appointees from January 29 through February 28 that blocked lifesaving work from moving forward.\n\nThese include \u201cemergency outbreak response activities needed to respond to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda \u2013 the first approved global health activities under the waiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite receiving approval to conduct these Ebola response activities approximately 1 month ago, the implementing partners were never able to draw down funds for these life-saving activities, and have not received any funds to date,\u201d Enrich wrote.\n\nThe statement directly rebuts a claim made by Elon Musk, who\u2019s leading the Trump administration\u2019s effort to downsize the federal government, that Ebola prevention was \u201caccidentally canceled\u201d but \u201cimmediately\u201d restored.\n\nEnrich was put on administrative leave after issuing the memo, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nCNN has reached out to the State Department and USAID for comment.\n\nAmong the actions that led to the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to implement the lifesaving assistance waivers were a refusal to pay for assistance that had been conducted, blocking access to USAID payment systems, \u201cthe ever-changing guidance as to what qualifies as \u2018lifesaving\u2019 and whose approval is needed in making that decision, and most recently, the sweeping terminations of the most critical implementing mechanisms necessary for providing lifesaving services,\u201d Enrich wrote.\n\nIn his February 28 memo, Enrich also noted that \u201csignificant staffing changes occurred within\u201d USAID\u2019s Bureau for Global Health \u201cthroughout the timeframe in question \u2013 including regularly affecting staff by terminating them without warning, turning on and off access to systems, placing and removing staff from administrative leave, etc. \u2013 severely limiting the ability to navigate and respond to the shifting guidance and bureaucratic hurdles outlined above.\u201d\n\nMore than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign assistance awards were suddenly terminated last week, including for work that had previously been issued waivers, nearly a dozen officials told CNN. The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit for failing to pay nearly $2 billion for work done before the foreign assistance freeze. That suit is now in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump arrives this week on Capitol Hill to deliver a speech to Congress, a coequal branch of government he has bulldozed past this first month in office, wielding unimaginable executive power to get what he wants, at home and abroad.\n\nThe Tuesday night address will unfold in the chamber where lawmakers crouched in fear four years ago while a mob of his supporters roamed the halls, and where Nancy Pelosi, Liz Cheney and others vowed to prevent him from ever holding office again. It\u2019s the same House chamber where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy received a hero\u2019s welcome for fighting off Russia\u2019s invasion, in the first year of that war.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has blazed across the federal government, dismantling not just norms and traditions but the very government itself. With billionaire aide Elon Musk by his side, he is firing thousands of federal workers, closing agencies established by law and publicly badgering Zelenskyy while positioning the U.S. closer to Russia.\n\nAs legal cases mount, more than 100 so far challenging the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s actions, the Republican president is daring the other branches of government \u2014 Congress and the courts \u2014 to try to stop him.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing about approaching a constitutional crisis is not quite true,\u201d said Rep. James Clyburn, of South Carolina, a senior Democrat in the House. \u201cWe\u2019re already there.\u201d\n\nTrump revels in going it alone, but there are limits\n\nReveling in the might of going it alone, Trump is about to test the limits of his executive branch authority as he turns to Congress to deliver tax cuts and other key aspects of his agenda. Only Congress, by law, can allocate funds \u2014 or pull them back \u2014 but the Trump administration\u2019s actions have been testing that foundational rule, enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nTrump also needs lawmakers to fund the government and ensure federal operations don\u2019t shut down when money runs out March 14. And he will need Congress to pass legislation to prevent an economically damaging debt default, something he has pushed lawmakers to resolve.\n\nWhile Trump enjoys the rare sweep of power in Washington, with the Republicans controlling the White House, the House and the Senate, he relies on political fear as well as favor to motivate lawmakers. With Musk having poured $200 million into electing Trump, the president has a ready patron whose vast political funds can influence any resisters.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who has positioned himself as a partner to the president, has said he\u2019s excited about what Trump is accomplishing in rooting out waste, fraud and abuse to downsize government.\n\n\u201cFireworks,\u201d is what Johnson, R-La., said he expects from Trump\u2019s speech, dismissing as \u201cnonsense\u201d concerns that Congress is ceding too much power to the White House.\n\n\u201cThe president is doing what he said on the campaign trail he would do,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on Fox News Channel\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures show.\n\nDemocrats, after their stunning rejection by voters, are slowly beginning to mount a resistance. They are fighting Trump in court, with amicus briefs to protect federal workers, and filing legislation to serve as a check on what House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York calls the \u201cparade of horribles.\u201d\n\nBut as the minority party, they are limited in their power. Jeffries brushed off calls for Democrats to boycott Trump\u2019s address. \u201cIt\u2019s the people\u2019s House. It\u2019s the House of Representatives,\u201d he said on CNN.\n\nInstead, Democrats are inviting fired federal workers as their guests.\n\nTax cuts and mass deportation funds all at stake\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s top campaign promises, extending the tax breaks approved during his first term in 2017, is posing one of his party\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nJohnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota are marshalling the GOP majority to deliver what Trump calls a \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d extending those tax breaks \u2014 and providing new ones. But Republicans also want some $2 trillion in budget cuts with changes to Medicaid and other services that millions of Americans count on, which Trump could decide is too much to bear.\n\nTrump\u2019s other big campaign promise \u2014 the biggest deportation operation in U.S. history \u2014 is running short of cash, and border czar Tom Homan has implored Republicans on Capitol Hill to loosen the purse strings to give the Homeland Security and Defense departments the money needed.\n\nThose budget debates all come as the Trump administration is ripping the federal government apart and freezing federal funds. It\u2019s challenging the Nixon-era Impoundment Control Act, which prevents the executive branch from halting allocations Congress has already approved, setting up a showdown that could wind up at the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cTesting the boundaries a little, I would expect that,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., who said he supports much of what the Trump administration is doing, to a point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got separate but equal branches of government,\u201d said Womack, whose committee controls vast funding. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is, we don\u2019t want a constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nLives, livelihoods and the echoes of Jan. 6\n\nIt\u2019s not just constitutional issues at stake but the lives and livelihoods of Americans. Communities depend on federal dollars \u2014 for health care clinics, school programs and countless contracts for companies large and small that provide goods and services to the federal government. Many are watching that money evaporate overnight.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, a former governor, said voters back home have concerns even as they support the idea of downsizing government.\n\n\u201cPeople are always afraid of the dark,\u201d he said, citing potential changes to Medicaid and preschool programs in particular. \u201cLet\u2019s give it time to see really what materializes before we run through the streets with our hair on fire.\u201d\n\nAnd the threat of Jan. 6, 2021, hangs over the building.\n\nTrump will stand on the dais where Pelosi, then the House speaker, was whisked to safety as the mob ransacked the Capitol. He will look out over the rows of lawmakers, some of whom blocked the back door to the chamber as Capitol Police were fending off rioters, steps away from where Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot and killed. Visitors will be watching from the galleries where representatives crouched on the floor in gas masks before being evacuated.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted Trump\u2019s presidential actions wide immunity from prosecution, and the four-count criminal indictment against him over Jan. 6 was withdrawn once he was reelected, in line with Justice Department policy.\n\nIn one of his first acts on Inauguration Day, Trump issued a sweeping pardon of all the rioters, including extremist leaders Stuart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, who were convicted of sedition. They have both returned to make appearances at the Capitol since their release from prison.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., was in the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cI acknowledge that he won and he\u2019s got the right to use all the executive authority to pursue his policies. He doesn\u2019t have a right to exceed constitutional authority,\u201d Welch said. \u201cSo how he does this should be of great concern to all of us.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Durham, North Carolina CNN \u2014\n\nAn out-of-work federal contractor with two master\u2019s degrees is applying for food stamps for the first time in her life. Others are considering selling their homes, or taking out loans and sinking deeper in debt. A furloughed single mother said that now that she has no income, she\u2019s gathering jewelry to sell at a pawnshop.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to drastically cut federal spending and slash the federal workforce are already having an impact in North Carolina \u2013 a key swing state that voted for Trump in November but is also among the top recipients of funding from some of the agencies his administration has targeted.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to evaluate the full extent of Trump\u2019s push to reduce the federal government. But in interviews with CNN, more than a dozen federal workers and contractors in North Carolina who have been furloughed or terminated described having to adjust their personal budgets in ways that will have ripple effects in their communities, such as filing for unemployment benefits, cutting personal spending and reducing childcare payments.\n\n\u201cThe only costs we\u2019re paying for right now are food and mortgage. Every other cost is heavily scrutinized,\u201d said Wayan Vota, an aid worker in Chapel Hill who was laid off at the end of January from a group that received funding from the US Agency for International Development. \u201cWe are actively not supporting the businesses in our community because we are hurting.\u201d\n\nBeyond the personal upheaval, the funding cuts could threaten North Carolina\u2019s economy, according to interviews with business leaders, economic experts and government officials. Universities and other organizations in the state, which is a center for biomedical research, were awarded about $2 billion last fiscal year from the National Institutes of Health, more than all but five other states. University officials say the administration\u2019s plans to cap some funding from NIH grants would likely lead to significant layoffs.\n\nBrianna Clarke-Schwelm, who leads a North Carolina public health alliance, says some aid and health workers in the state are struggling to get by. CNN\n\nSome of the top contractors for USAID, which has been subject to severe cuts in the Trump administration\u2019s first weeks, are also based in North Carolina. USAID agreed to pay more than $1 billion last year to organizations based in the state, more than to all but three other states and Washington, DC.\n\nWhile much of that money is spent on work abroad, it also supports jobs in the US. More than 300 staffers for groups that receive USAID funds have already been fired or furloughed in North Carolina alone, a CNN review found \u2013 likely just a fraction of the total impact in the state.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are applying for unemployment right now,\u201d said Brianna Clarke-Schwelm, who leads a North Carolina public health alliance. \u201cA lot of people are also pulling their kids out of child care. They\u2019re also thinking about their mortgages. They\u2019re thinking about if they\u2019re going to stay in North Carolina \u2013 if they can afford to stay living here.\u201d\n\nResearch Triangle feeling the fallout\n\nThe impact is concentrated in the Research Triangle region of the state, which spans Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill and is home to several major universities doing research funded by NIH grants, two of the top USAID contractors in the country, and other businesses that have received federal contracts and funds.\n\nLeonardo Williams, the mayor of Durham, said the Trump administration\u2019s cuts are taking a toll at home.\n\nWhile Trump allies have suggested that cuts are primarily aimed at waste and unnecessary spending abroad, the damage is actually \u201chappening right here in my city,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThose jobs are gone. That means I have one less resident that can\u2019t contribute to our economic vitality here. That means I have one less resident that could support the small businesses here locally. That\u2019s one less resident that can contribute to the tax base.\u201d\n\nMayor Leonardo Williams of Durham says the Trump administration cuts are already hurting his city. CNN\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s proposed cuts to NIH funding, which are currently blocked by a court, would cap the funding from research grants that can go to \u201cindirect costs\u201d at 15% \u2013about half of what such grants typically fund. Those costs include staff salaries, equipment and building upkeep, and other overhead that universities need to keep the lights on.\n\nThe change sounds technical, but it would actually be \u201cdevastating\u201d for research universities in North Carolina and around the country, said Colin Duckett, an executive vice dean at Duke University School of Medicine. Duke was awarded about $580 million in NIH grants last year.\n\nThinking about the thousands of people who could lose their jobs in North Carolina alone if the administration\u2019s proposal goes through \u201ckeeps me up at night,\u201d Duckett said. \u201cThe amount of downsizing we would have to do would really devastate the institution, but also the economy for the state.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, he argued, the change would lead to the US \u201cceding its position as the best place in the world to do scientific research.\u201d\n\nThe campus of Duke University, where officials say the Trump administration's planned NIH cuts could lead to major layoffs. Lance King/Getty Images\n\nSome local communities are fighting back against the proposed cuts. The town of Chapel Hill joined more than 40 other cities, counties and mayors across the country in filing an amicus brief in February to support a lawsuit challenging NIH funding changes.\n\nThe filing states some of those jurisdictions will lose income taxes and be forced to support people who have lost jobs, and that NIH grant recipients \u201cact as income and employment multipliers\u201d that subcontract with other businesses. The brief also referenced a report from the group United for Medical Research that found each dollar of NIH research funding in 2023 equated to $2.46 in new economic activity.\n\nNorth Carolina could be affected beyond the blue-leaning Research Triangle, too, because reduced federal funding could force state legislators to consider \u201ccuts to programs and services statewide,\u201d said Alexandra Sirota, the executive director of the NC Budget & Tax Center, a nonprofit group that analyzes economic conditions in the state.\n\nLaid off and harrassed\n\nSome USAID contractors in North Carolina have found themselves facing not just the devastation of losing their jobs, but also growing hostility and insults \u2013 both from strangers online and from political leaders who have pushed extreme views about the agency.\n\nThe research institute RTI International, a major USAID contractor, has been listed among the top corporate philanthropists in the Raleigh-Durham region and, in addition to its global initiatives, has worked on projects to improve health outcomes in the state. But when the nonprofit organization announced last month that it was temporarily laying off dozens of staffers in North Carolina due to the Trump administration\u2019s pause on foreign assistance, the news was met with glee from MAGA supporters online.\n\n\u201cThey have been stealing from the taxpayers for a very long time,\u201d one user wrote on X. Another declared that the \u201cgrift for NC is over. The majority of us are so here for it.\u201d\n\nDurham, North Carolina, part of the Research Triangle region, is home to major recipients of NIH and USAID funding. CNN\n\nSome zealous USAID critics have taken it upon themselves to snail mail their disdain. \u201cI hope [your company] goes bankrupt and you and everyone else get laid off and stay unemployed forever,\u201d stated a letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, that was sent to a foreign aid group that has also furloughed some workers in North Carolina. A staffer for another USAID contractor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about backlash, said her firm has received \u201cthreat letters mailed to our office,\u201d and that some employees had been directly targeted with harassment.\n\nThe anger at USAID, where most staff have been fired or placed on leave, has echoed vitriol expressed from the top of the Trump administration. Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has led efforts to slash USAID\u2019s budget in his role with the Department of Government Efficiency, declared the agency a \u201ccriminal organization,\u201d calling it \u201ca viper\u2019s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America.\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said USAID was \u201ca sinister propagator of totalitarianism and war across the globe.\u201d Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused the agency of \u201csowing bizarro destabilizing sexual politics into other people\u2019s cultures\u201d and \u201cpaying to wreck a lot of other places.\u201d\n\nBut staffers who have been laid off say that criticism radically distorted the work they were doing to try to save lives, promote the rule of law and boost America\u2019s image abroad.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric has felt like we are expendable, that foreign aid is not important, that, in fact, we\u2019re wasteful,\u201d said Ruth Garfinkel, a Durham mother of two who lost her job with a USAID contractor. \u201cThat\u2019s very hurtful when you\u2019ve spent 20 years doing this work and attempting to help people.\u201d\n\nRuth Garfinkel, a laid-off employee of a USAID contractor in Durham, has taken on debt since her position was terminated. CNN\n\nAt least some North Carolina-based organizations that have received USAID funds have seemingly welcomed the gutting of the agency. Franklin Graham, a Trump ally and the president of Boone-headquartered relief group Samaritan\u2019s Purse, which has received millions from USAID, said in a statement, \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing for the government to assess and reexamine the various programs that the U.S. is funding around the world. I encourage the State Department to continue providing life-saving aid such as food and medicine. We have a limited amount of money to spend, and I believe it should be spent wisely.\u201d Graham said less than 5% of his group\u2019s funding last year came from government grants.\n\nThe Trump administration has portrayed various USAID projects as examples of \u201cwaste\u201d and \u201cabuse.\u201d A White House webpage criticized specific initiatives, such as $1.5 million given to support opportunities for LGBTQ people in Serbia that according to contract data would increase employment potential and reduce workplace discrimination. Another project referenced is $6 million for development in Egypt that according to a linked USAID press release involved transportation access for rural communities and economic programs for families.\n\nFormer USAID staffers argue that in addition to causing job losses, the agency\u2019s undoing could more broadly undermine US security.\n\nForeign assistance \u201cprevents pandemics back home. \u2026 it prevents violent extremism from coming to our shores. It stems the tide of migration,\u201d retired USAID counselor Chris Milligan told CNN. \u201cWhen you turn that off and you fire the experts that are doing that, what\u2019s the plan for keeping America safe?\u201d\n\nGarfinkel, the laid-off development worker in Durham, said her job made up about three-quarters of her household\u2019s income, so now her family has had to find new ways to make ends meet. The day after she learned of her termination, she went to the bank to get a home equity line of credit. Her family had hoped to save money and invest in home renovations this year \u2013 but now they\u2019re going into debt, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like them to know that they are harming ordinary people, who are just trying to get by,\u201d Garfinkel said of those responsible for the funding cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s really shortsighted and, frankly, cruel.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Harvard professor Steven Levitsky co-authored How Democracies Die, a hit book that explored the way strongmen leaders, including Donald Trump, can erode once-stable political systems. How Democracies Die resonated in the middle of Trump\u2019s first term and made Levitsky a famous name among anxious liberals. Unfortunately, his work is even more relevant to American politics seven years later. Earlier this year, Levitsky and Lucan A. Way published an essay in Foreign Affairs titled \u201cThe Path to American Authoritarianism.\u201d (They wrote almost all of the article before January 20.) Levitsky and Way focus on \u201ccompetitive authoritarianism,\u201d a concept they have explored for more than two decades. Under competitive authoritarianism, aspiring autocrats acquire power through legitimate elections, then stack the deck in their favor by rewarding corrupt allies, seeking revenge on their enemies through lawsuits and harassment, and cowing mass media. (Sound familiar?) I spoke with Levitsky, who is also a senior fellow for democracy at the Council on Foreign Relations, about how the first few weeks of Trump 2.0 have gone, how Elon Musk has scrambled his thinking, and whether he ever thought competitive authoritarianism could actually come to the U.S.\n\nMany of the warnings in your essay have already turned into reality: deep politicization of the FBI and spurious investigations into Trump\u2019s political rivals, to name a couple. Have things accelerated more quickly than you were anticipating when you wrote it? In other words, how screwed are we right now?\n\n\ufeffWe\u2019re pretty screwed. A couple of things are a little worse than I anticipated. One is that while we knew the Republicans would not put up many obstacles, they have been even weaker than I thought. That the Congress is basically shutting itself down in the wake of the executive branch usurping its power is also really stunning. The Republican abdication has been worse than I expected, and I thought it would be bad.\n\nThe second thing I didn\u2019t anticipate was the role of Musk. I don\u2019t think anybody quite could have anticipated it. That article drew on 20 years of research on competitive authoritarian regimes elsewhere in the world. The kinds of stuff we predicted, a lot of which has come to pass, are strategies that have been carried out in literally dozens of other cases. But Musk is pretty new. This is something that I don\u2019t really have a model to understand. There\u2019s a sort of technological frontier element to this that\u2019s a little frightening. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do with data. And frankly, at least in democracies, I\u2019ve never seen a concentration of political, economic, and media power as vast as this.\n\nAnd in an unelected official.\n\n\ufeffIn an unelected official, right. With the exception of really old-fashioned dictatorships like Somoza and Trujillo, or Mobutu in Zaire \u2014 the concentration of political, economic, and media power here is just stunning. That\u2019s just never been seen in a democracy to my knowledge. So that\u2019s really new territory.\n\nYou wrote at the beginning of your article \u2014 again, before the events of the last few weeks \u2014 that it had become somewhat pass\u00e9 to worry about the fate of democracy, since America survived Trump\u2019s first term. What do you make of the strength of the opposition so far?\n\n\ufeffIf I could go back, I wouldn\u2019t need to write that paragraph. There has been a response to this authoritarian offensive, and it\u2019s not that surprising. I think Trump is probably hurting himself by making so many enemies so quickly. Every fired employee and their family is going to move into the opposition, and every group that is directly or indirectly affected by the cessation of payments. He\u2019s creating a certain amount of opposition at a pretty rapid clip.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s daring himself to do it, just running roughshod over people.\n\n\ufeffI never know what is driving him, what is motivating him. He\u2019s not a typical rational autocrat in a sense, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily going about this in the best way. I think he\u2019s probably not building a sustainable coalition the way Ch\u00e1vez and Orb\u00e1n and Erdo\u011fan did. That said, a lot of autocrats move very quickly early on. I\u2019m a sports fan, so I always find sports metaphors. This is the first round of a 15-round boxing match in which one fighter, maybe the underdog, comes out and decides to throw a thousand punches. And his rival is surprised, stunned, groggy, has maybe hit the mat. We don\u2019t know how long he can sustain it. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to transpire if we go 7, 8, 10, 15 rounds. But the first round has been kind of stunning, because Trump took everybody by surprise. In part because the Establishment was asleep.\n\nThat has to do with the nature of his victory, I think \u2014 Trump made inroads with unexpected populations, and Democrats don\u2019t know how to counter that exactly.\n\n\ufeffI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s true that I certainly did not expect him to win the popular vote, but we\u2019re talking about a 1.5 percentage-point victory, and we\u2019re talking about a 2, 2.5 percent difference from what was expected or what he\u2019s done in the past. The idea that this was some overwhelming shift or overwhelming victory is ludicrous.\n\nBut when Trump wins by one, it feels like he wins by 30 \u2014 because he\u2019s Trump.\n\n\ufeffWell, that\u2019s how everybody treated it. The New York Times talked about, literally, a sweeping election victory. It was not a sweeping victory. So this gave him a legitimacy that he didn\u2019t have before, that he probably didn\u2019t deserve, but I think it quieted a number of dissident voices for quite a while. And, certainly, it left the Democrats on the sidelines for a few weeks.\n\nTo go back to your boxing metaphor, perhaps Trump is George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle and he\u2019ll punch himself out?\n\n\ufeffJames Carville wrote that out a few days ago, right? He said explicitly, \u201cThe Democrats just need to roll over and play dead.\u201d\n\nThat they should take the rope-a-dope strategy, so to speak.\n\n\ufeffAbsolutely. I don\u2019t think he referred to Ali in \u201975, but that\u2019s exactly what he said. Which might, might be the right electoral strategy for the Democratic Party. But it is a horrible, horrible fact if you\u2019re thinking about defending democracy.\n\nThere\u2019s always this debate within the party about the extent to which politicians should be calling out every one of these anti-democracy infractions that Trump commits, and to what extent that they should just focus on the bread-and-butter issues, egg prices, and inflation, and all of that stuff that voters care most about. Is that a false binary to you?\n\n\ufeffYeah, I think it\u2019s false. It\u2019s mistaken on a couple of fronts. First of all, it confuses the division of labor between party strategists and everybody else in society. I know we\u2019re polarized \u2014 we divided the world into red and blue, and everybody\u2019s on team blue or team red. But when people are telling me not to talk about democracy so much because it\u2019s not the best strategy for the Democratic Party, I mean, give me a break. I\u2019m a political-science professor. I\u2019m supposed to talk. It\u2019s my job to talk about it.\n\nWell, not you. I meant more Chuck Schumer.\n\n\ufeffI know. But it\u2019s not my job to figure out the best way for the Democratic Party to win votes. The Democratic Party does have to think about winning votes. And in the campaign, it was a legitimate question as to whether they should have campaigned around democracy or not. But there aren\u2019t any elections for quite a while, and society \u2014 people who are not campaign gurus for the Democratic Party \u2014 has a responsibility to defend our democracy. And our politicians have a responsibility to defend our democracy. When democracy is under threat, you don\u2019t just say, \u201cWell, the polls say \u2026 My focus groups say bread-and-butter issues are better.\u201d You\u2019ve got to defend the Constitution, man.\n\nI was super critical of Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy for putting their own short-term political ambitions above the defense of democracy. That\u2019s in effect what they did. They knew better. They said as much in private, but in public, they decided that the best way to advance their careers was to enable Trump, to acquiesce to Trump, and the bulk of the party acted that way with huge consequences. But in a way, Schumer et al. are doing the same thing, right? If they decide that defending democracy is not in their best electoral interest, they\u2019re also abdicating the role of defending democracy. They\u2019re just not quite as culpable as the Republicans.\n\nYou\u2019ve written that approval ratings matter for would-be competitive authoritarians. Some of the people you\u2019ve covered have had 80 percent approval ratings; Ch\u00e1vez was very popular for a long time, for instance. Trump has never been that popular. He hit 50 percent recently, and it was a big deal because he\u2019s rarely been there before. Many of his policies are also underwater in polls. But as you said, it\u2019s a long time before any big elections, and he\u2019s not one to step away from doing unpopular things. So let\u2019s say he gets down to 35 percent or that area. What do you see as the effect of that on his power?\n\n\ufeffCertainly, that won\u2019t necessarily constrain his behavior. And unfortunately, I think he\u2019s unlikely to get down to the 35 percent.\n\nI think there would have to be a serious economic shock to get to that level.\n\n\ufeffYeah. More likely, around 40. But I think there\u2019s a good chance he gets down there relatively quickly. If he does decline from 50 to 40, it won\u2019t change his behavior. To be clear, he could still do a lot of damage, but it will send signals. It\u2019ll make Chuck Schumer a little more likely to speak out. It\u2019ll embolden Jeffries a little bit. You might see some more non-Trumpist Republicans taking a more independent position. The civil-society actors and CEOs may brownnose a little bit less. It\u2019s hard to say when this would happen, but once there\u2019s a little blood in the water, once that honeymoon\u2019s over, you often see kind of a pack effect in people jumping into opposition.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily block Trump from doing anything again. If the Republicans give him carte blanche, and certainly if the courts allow it, he can do a hell of a lot of damage. But there will be many, many more opposing voices in society, and that will slow him down a bit.\n\nI\u2019ve been struck by just how in lockstep big businesses have been in support of him over the last few months. That\u2019s one thing I could see changing, slowly, if he becomes truly unpopular.\n\n\ufeffLike you said, his 1.5 percent victory felt like a 30-point victory. And when he was up over 50 percent for the first time ever, that\u2019s a little bit like what it felt for years under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez when he was at 80 percent. When the president\u2019s at 80 percent, everybody knows he\u2019s untouchable. Nobody\u2019s going to criticize him. The media\u2019s quiet, the opposition shuts up because whatever it says is going to be unpopular. It has a really powerful, demobilizing effect on society and the opposition. That\u2019s going to dissipate as Trump declines, if he declines.\n\nAs you mentioned, the Republican Party has been almost totally docile. Is there an equivalent you can think of where somebody has been in charge of their party for this long, the way Trump is dominating them for this long, and then the party eventually does turn on them?\n\n\ufeffOh, that\u2019s a good question. This is a little less authoritarian and more on the side of corruption, but the ANC eventually turned on Jacob Zuma. For those who care, I think UMNO eventually turned on Mahathir Mohamad back in the early 2000s in Malaysia.\n\nThere are other cases. When a leader gets this level of personalized control of the party, very often, the party goes down with the leader. In this case, Trump has an astounding level of personal control of the party, more than any other leader in modern history in the United States. It\u2019s really possibly unprecedented.\n\nMaybe FDR.\n\n\ufeffI don\u2019t know. I think given the heterogeneity, FDR could not dominate the southern Democratic Party. FDR tried to intervene in primaries and failed miserably to get the southern conservatives onboard with the New Deal. FDR couldn\u2019t even think about promoting civil rights because of the southern Democrats. So, no, FDR didn\u2019t have anywhere near this.\n\nThat said, this is still a real party with many, many talented politicians emerging within it. If Trump does become quite unpopular, which is entirely possible, if he does fall into the 30s, the combination of his unpopularity and lame-duck status means that he\u2019s not going to be able to impose his son as a candidate or the guy he wants as a candidate. I think you will see Republicans begin to emerge and challenge him as DeSantis tried to do a couple of years ago.\n\nWhich I thought would work for a month or so. I was na\u00efve.\n\n\ufeffYeah. He turned out to be not a terribly talented politician. But I think there\u2019s a good chance that the party will find itself if Trump becomes sufficiently unpopular and it becomes politically useful to abandon him. Right now, it\u2019s just not politically useful.\n\nOr perhaps if he declines physically. Which I\u2019m sure has happened in comparable situations before.\n\n\ufeffOh, yeah. To give you one example, Juan Per\u00f3n returned to the presidency as an old man in 1973. He had been in exile for 18 years, so not just four years, but he came back and he died the next year, in 1974. And the party just went to war with itself. It ripped itself apart after he died.\n\nYou\u2019ve been writing about this for a long time, as we\u2019ve said. Did you ever think your theories would be so applicable in America?\n\n\ufeffNo. Lucan Way, who I co-authored the Foreign Affairs piece with \u2014 he and I published our first piece on competitive authoritarianism in 2002. We wrote it in 2000 and 2001, so we were finishing it up right around the time of 9/11. For a while after 9/11, a lot of liberals were concerned with the Patriot Act, that the Bush administration was going to be somewhat authoritarian. I was never as concerned as some of my friends. But people would ask us when we were first writing this up, \u201cIs competitive authoritarianism impossible in the United States?\u201d They had Bush and the Patriot Act and Cheney in mind.\n\nAnd we dismissed it. Lucan and I always had these dark fantasies: Would we ever have to write a piece saying that the United States is becoming competitive authoritarian? We\u2019d talked about it, but we always came to the conclusion that no, it would never really happen.\n\nMy political education was under Bush being pretty alarmed at the time. There was political corruption going on, but nothing compared to now.\n\n\ufeffThere was pushback. There are always going to be efforts to abuse power, and there are always going to be scandals. But the key is there has to be a reaction from society, from the media, ideally from the president\u2019s own party. There has to be a cost to it. The really scary thing right now is the lack of reaction, lack of pushback, especially among Republicans.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "Self-professed \u201cfree-speech absolutist\u201d Elon Musk. Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nIn the 2010s, a certain kind of social-justice activist took a hard turn against the mainstream media. The rancor was of a different flavor than the Chomskyan critiques of corporate media and the consent it allegedly manufactured. It wasn\u2019t so much that conventional journalists were too moderate for them and not sympathetic enough to their causes, though that explained some of their anger. It was more that the concept of journalism itself \u2014 independent reporters appearing at public events to gather facts, speak to individuals, and take photographs \u2014 was somehow a threat to these activists\u2019 well-being.\n\nThis sentiment might have been best encapsulated by Melissa Click, a University of Missouri communications professor who tried, a decade ago, to forcibly stop a student journalist from filming a racial-justice protest on campus. Caught on-camera asking for \u201cmuscle\u201d to block the student who was merely recording a public event, Click became emblematic of the \u201cwoke\u201d left run amok. She would apologize, but the controversy represented more than one hotheaded professor attempting to foolishly police the coverage of one campus protest.\n\nRather, it spoke to a growing consensus among a certain segment of the activist class that media coverage itself could be harmful or even destructive. First Amendment concerns and the concept of a public domain had to be, suddenly, subordinate to the feelings of individual activists. The left\u2019s growing skepticism of free speech as an inherent value \u2014 even the ACLU had evolved from an organization that defended the right of the Ku Klux Klan to march in public to one that, during Donald Trump\u2019s first term, began to reject the argument that the right wing needed civil-liberties protections \u2014 paved the way for conservatives to reinvent themselves as First Amendment warriors, or at least those more committed to free expression.\n\nNow, with Trump ascendant and Elon Musk dominating both the website formerly known as Twitter and the federal bureaucracy itself, conservatives have begun to adopt many of the same pathologies as the old social-justice class. Conventional journalism that identifies the members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) or exposed who might be the mother of Musk\u2019s latest child is reimagined as a grievous attack on a weaker, more vulnerable party that needs special protection \u2014 or what might have been called, not so long ago, a safe space.\n\nReporting on DOGE, for example, has been recast as \u201cdoxing,\u201d even though the young engineers and activists recruited to aid Musk\u2019s efforts are performing extraordinarily public work, implementing cuts and staffing changes that impact tens of thousands of federal employees and alter how most Americans interact with a government funded with their tax dollars. \u201cThe so-called New York Times outs 45 people working for DOGE,\u201d fumed Byron York, the chief political correspondent for the conservative Washington Examiner, in response to a Times report identifying by name numerous members of Musk\u2019s DOGE team.\n\nThe writer Geoff Shullenberger has referred to this trend as the \u201cbizarro awokening,\u201d with complaints of doxing replacing what was, on the old liberal Twitter of the 2010s, typically tagged as harassment. Before Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X, the platform was remarkably influential with activists, celebrities, politicians, pundits, and journalists, many of them on the left. There was an aristocracy of verified \u201cblue checks\u201d who could wield their clout to blast those who went against whatever popular consensus existed at the moment. That aristocracy, thanks to Musk, is largely dead, swapped for conservatives who have mostly paid for blue-check verification badges and parrot whatever Musk and Trump spew out. They are no more committed to free expression than the \u201cwoke\u201d left and furiously try to stamp out any criticism lodged at their dear leaders. Just as Twitter did eventually become real life, the manias of X now bleed out into the physical world: The president of NYU\u2019s chapter of the College Republicans was forced to resign earlier this month after she was quoted telling Vanity Fair that Barron Trump was \u201csort of like an oddity on campus.\u201d Cancel culture lives!\n\nAs Trump inevitably falters \u2014 his poll numbers are already slipping, and if Republicans enact devastating social-safety-net cuts, Democrats will have plenty to campaign on in the midterms \u2014 expect conservatives to further close ranks and panic, straining to stamp out whatever dissent they find in their midst. The witch hunts for anything resembling \u201cDEI\u201d are already more extreme than any of the liberal speech policing found at the height of the social-justice era. One college in Michigan has already preemptively banned readings from a variety of non-white writers (as well as George Orwell, ironically enough) out of fear that the Trump administration might pull their federal funding.\n\nThe dispiriting reality of our contemporary political discourse is that neither ideological faction cares much for free expression. The values inherent in the First Amendment are trampled on or outright discarded whenever it becomes convenient for one political party. Perhaps, in time, there will be a shift and these sort of destructive inanities will come to an end. It\u2019s all quite exhausting, at the very least."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US has suspended operations and planning for offensive cyber operations against Russia, a senior US official told CNN.\n\nThe suspension is \u201ca major blow,\u201d the official said, especially since planning for such operations takes time and research to carry out. The concern, the official said, is that the pause on offensive cyber operations against Russia will make the US more vulnerable to potential cyberattacks from Moscow, which has a formidable cadre of hackers capable of disrupting US critical infrastructure and collecting sensitive intelligence.\n\nThe pause in operations and planning from US Cyber Command, the military\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber unit, comes as the Trump administration has sought a broader d\u00e9tente with Russia three years into Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, throwing the US-Ukraine relationship into uncertainty.\n\n\u201cDue to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations. There is no greater priority to Secretary Hegseth than the safety of the warfighter in all operations, to include the cyber domain,\u201d a senior defense official told CNN, referring to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe Record first reported on Cyber Command\u2019s suspension of planning related to Russia.\n\n\u201cIt is not uncommon for the Pentagon to pause actions which are potentially destabilizing or provocative for negotiations, including cyber-effects operations,\u201d Jason Kikta, a former Cyber Command official, told CNN. \u201cBut if a planning pause was also directed, that could cause offensive options to become stale and therefore nonviable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny extended period without checking on access and updating planning, risks losing that access or missing a critical change,\u201d Kikta said, adding that he was not personally aware of any change in status of Cyber Command operations.\n\nRussia and the US are in a regular state of confrontation in cyberspace, current and former US official say. The Kremlin sees cyberspace as a source of asymmetric advantage with the US, as it can burrow into US critical infrastructure and try to influence US elections.\n\nFor their part, American military and intelligence hackers have in recent years increasingly gone after Russian cybercriminals and intelligence operatives.\n\nSince 2016, when Russia used bots, trolls and hackers to try to influence the election in favor of Trump, Moscow has repeated that playbook in some form in every US presidential election, according to US officials.\n\nCyber Command was established more than a decade ago, in part to respond to threats from Russia and other foreign powers. The command has matured considerably since its inception, growing into a several-thousand strong force of computer operatives who conduct offensive and defensive missions.\n\nFrom its base at Fort Meade, Maryland, alongside the National Security Agency, Cyber Command has also increasingly become a tool of US power projection. The command has sent specialists to allies around the world to try to help them defend against threats from cybercriminals and spies.\n\nThat includes a trip to Ukraine in December 2021, in anticipation of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, to help Kyiv prepare for an onslaught of Russian cyberattacks.\n\nMonths after Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion, Cyber Command confirmed that it was actively engaged in helping Ukraine defend itself through cyberattacks.\n\nCyber Command has also increasingly taken aim at ransomware gangs that extort US businesses for millions of dollars and threaten the safety of hospitals. Many of those gangs are based in Russia.\n\nCyber Command \u201cprovides people, resources and unique insights to support broader USG [US government] counter-ransomware operations,\u201d a former senior Department of Defense official told CNN. \u201cRussia is a permissive environment for some of the most prolific ransomware gangs and actors to operate. Does this operational planning hold apply to Russian ransomware actors that often target American companies?\u201d\n\nDespite the change in planning at Cyber Command, another major federal cybersecurity agency said it was not altering its posture.\n\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the lead civilian agency for defending federal networks from hacks, said Sunday night on X that its mission is to \u201cdefend against all cyber threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure, including from Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been no change in our posture,\u201d the agency said, in an apparent response to media reports that the agency was emphasizing non-Russia threats. \u201cAny reporting to the contrary is fake and undermines our national security.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand contributed reporting.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

            "full_content": "Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump has a giant bruise on his hand. People spotted it when Trump met with French president Emmanuel Macron on Monday, and it was still visible during when he hosted British prime minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office on Thursday.\n\nCould this be a sign that Trump is suffering from some serious, life-threatening illness? Sure. Search \u201cTrump hand bruise\u201d on X and you\u2019ll find that armchair physicians have provided a wide range of diagnoses, from \u201cTrump is getting regular IV infusions\u201d to \u201cthe president injured himself in a dementia-related fall.\u201d And did you know that \u201cthe queen had a similar bruise a week before she died?\u201d Suspicious!\n\nOr, not suspicious at all. Trump loved to bully Joe Biden for his decrepitude and pretend that he possessed almost superhuman health and mental acuity, though he is only three years younger. But in reality, President Trump is 78 years old, and sometimes old people get random bruises. As the Mayo Clinic explains, \u201cEasy bruising is common with age \u2026 as people get older, the skin becomes thinner. It also loses some of the protective fatty layer that helps cushion blood vessels from injury.\u201d\n\nIt would be great if the Trump administration provided detailed medical records that could put an end to all the speculation that he is suffering from some mysterious illness. But instead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt just keeps giving the same dubious explanation: It\u2019s one of those hand-shaking injuries you\u2019re always hearing about.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is a man of the people, and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history,\u201d Leavitt said in a somewhat garbled statement to Fox News Digital on Wednesday. She continued, \u201cHis commitment is unwavering, and he proves that every single day.\u201d\n\nLeavitt provided a similar statement to NBC News, adding, \u201cPresident Trump has bruises on his hand because he\u2019s constantly working and shaking hands all day, every day.\u201d\n\nIt appears Leavitt got this line from Trump himself. Here\u2019s what the president-elect said when he showed up to his Time \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d interview with a bruise on his hand three days before Thanksgiving:\n\nSitting under bright lights for a 30-minute photo session ahead of a 65-minute interview, he\u2019s asked to explain the bruising on his right hand. \u201cIt\u2019s from shaking hands with thousands of people,\u201d he says.\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump worked a rope line just before his Time interview, or that he \u201cmeets more Americans\u201d than \u201cany other president in history.\u201d And it\u2019s not like any other world leaders are constantly black and blue from greeting people (save for nonagenarian British monarchs). But sure, he does greet a lot of people, and he has a pretty aggressive handshake:\n\nPresident @realDonaldTrump greets @Keir_Starmer, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to the White House \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 pic.twitter.com/hClm0cRDGQ \u2014 Margo Martin (@MargoMartin47) February 27, 2025\n\nSo what\u2019s really going on with Trump\u2019s giant bruise? You\u2019ll have to decide for yourself. Either it\u2019s proof that he\u2019s the most rugged and hardworking man ever to sit in the Oval Office, or it\u2019s confirmation that he is, as Graydon Carter famously put it, a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d with \u201cskin of gossamer.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we explore how governors (and candidates for governor) around the country are navigating the recent federal layoffs. Plus, how a measles outbreak could prove politically perilous for President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nHow Trump and Musk\u2019s job cuts are reverberating in the states\n\nPresident Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s initiative to dramatically slash the federal workforce is increasingly having a political ripple effect at the state level.\n\nThe job market: For starters, states are putting up \u201cWe\u2019re hiring\u201d signs for fired federal workers, as Adam Edelman reports.\n\nGovernors around the country are attempting to recruit these employees for public and private sector jobs in their states, while providing them with other resources as they exit their current positions and search for their next.\n\nIt\u2019s primarily Democratic governors in blue states who are leading the charge. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul launched the \u201cYou\u2019re Hired\u201d initiative this week, specifically targeting federal workers for state government roles who have lost their jobs as a result of the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s cost-cutting efforts.\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green recently signed an executive order instituting an expedited hiring process for qualified federal employees who are on their way out and seeking employment in state government positions.\n\nOne Republican, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, is getting in on the effort too by advertising 250,000 open private sector positions in the state. Virginia, home to approximately 340,000 federal workers, could be one of the states most affected by DOGE\u2019s job cuts.\n\nThe campaign trail: That brings us to the race to replace Youngkin, one of two high-profile governor\u2019s races this year.\n\nEdelman and Bridget Bowman write that there are signs of how the disruption could shape Virginia\u2019s political climate. They spoke with more than a dozen voters around the state who participated in past NBC News polls and said they were not strongly aligned with either party. All were aware of the ongoing federal layoffs, with some expressing deep concern about the effect on Virginia workers and those receiving federal benefits, though most were not yet tuned into the governor\u2019s race.\n\nSeparately, one man named Matthew, who was not comfortable sharing his last name, told NBC News that he expects the recent layoffs of federal workers to factor into his 2025 vote for governor \u2014 as the self-described political independent attended his first Democratic Party event a week after losing his own federal government job. He was one of more than 300 Virginians who packed the Arlington library auditorium Tuesday night for a county party town hall on the recent federal layoffs.\n\nFormer Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the only Democrat in the race, has described the widespread layoffs as an attack on the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThis frankly isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d Spanberger said in a recent interview with NBC News, later adding, \u201cIt is a chaotic circumstance coming out of this White House and this administration, and it is deeply, deeply damaging to real people and real jobs and real families.\u201d\n\nLt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican front-runner, has praised the DOGE effort while also pointing to the Youngkin administration\u2019s investments in the private sector of the Virginia economy as a reason that fired workers shouldn\u2019t fret.\n\nAnother state-level effect: Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cmove education back to the states\u201d is causing concern among local officials and lawmakers, who say they are unprepared to take on the responsibilities of the Education Department if it\u2019s dismantled. Read more from Edelman and Tyler Kingkade \u2192\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump said that 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico would go into effect Tuesday, alongside yet another 10% layer of duties on China following one that came into effect earlier this month.\n\nTrump also said British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was \u201cworking hard\u201d to convince him not to impose tariffs on the U.K. at a joint news conference.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting, Starmer corrected Trump\u2019s claim that European countries who provided aid to Ukraine \u201cget their money back.\u201d\n\nAsked by a reporter if he stands by his earlier comments calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator,\u201d Trump responded: \u201cDid I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court last night temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to release frozen foreign aid funding by midnight.\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWith RFK Jr. at his side, a measles outbreak could prove \u2018politically perilous\u2019 for Trump\n\nBy Jonathan Allen, Julie Tsirkin and Laura Strickler\n\nSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been scarce at Health and Human Services headquarters and has not visited a number of agencies since he was sworn in to lead the department, according to one department official. Kennedy has not sent all-staff emails to the department\u2019s workforce and has not done anything to address the measles outbreak, the official also noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s still in campaign mode rather than realizing he\u2019s head of a large agency and workforce,\u201d the HHS official said.\n\nKennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said at President Donald Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting Wednesday that his department is tracking an outbreak of measles that has infected more than 100 people and killed an unvaccinated school-age child. But he played down the consequence of the resurgence \u2014 25 years after measles had been thought to be eradicated from the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to tap Kennedy to lead HHS reflected the president\u2019s own tortured relationship with Covid-19, mass immunization and a political base that has become increasingly critical of vaccines following the health and economic damage wrought by the pandemic.\n\nIt also poses a risk to Republican lawmakers in the midterm elections if measles, bird flu, ebola or another disease rips through the country following Kennedy\u2019s appointment and the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s cutbacks in foreign and domestic efforts to combat those viruses, according to some GOP strategists.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re cutting a program, that increases the potential for something to go wrong \u2014 you\u2019re going to own it,\u201d said one GOP strategist who has worked on presidential, Senate and House campaigns. \u201cMaybe the measles thing is the canary in the coal mine. ... This is a small example of a potential problem. This has real-life consequences, and that\u2019s the part that is politically perilous.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMore health news: A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains to be included in next season\u2019s flu shot has been canceled.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83c\udf0e \u2018A fundamental shift\u2019: Western officials say Trump\u2019s moves to embrace Russia and castigate Ukraine have rattled U.S. allies around the world \u2013 and could ultimately benefit China.

            "full_content": "Photo: Barry Williams/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Mayor Eric Adams was indicted by federal prosecutors on charges of bribery and corruption. Months later, the case became the center of both local and federal controversy as the Justice Department moved to dismiss it, prompting allegations of a corrupt deal between Adams and the Trump administration. The mayor has long professed his innocence and has denied claims of any deal-making between himself and the federal government. As we wait for the case\u2019s fate to get settled before a federal judge, here\u2019s a look back at where things stand.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening right now?\n\nOn February 14, the Justice Department officially moved to dismiss Adams\u2019s bribery case. But instead of approving that request, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho, who has presided over the matter, ordered Adams and Justice Department officials into court to discuss their reasoning for it.\n\nAt the hearing, Adams\u2019s attorney Alex Spiro and acting U.S. deputy attorney general Emil Bove rejected the notion of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between the mayor and the federal government, and Adams asserted under oath that he wasn\u2019t promised anything in exchange for agreeing to the motion. Ho then adjourned Adams\u2019s trial for the time being while appointing Paul Clement, a veteran conservative litigator and former U.S. solicitor general, to present arguments against dismissing the case. The judge set a deadline to receive briefs on March 7 with the possibility of an oral argument on March 14. In these situations, judges generally allow cases to be dismissed when both the prosecution and the defense are in agreement. But Ho\u2019s decision to have Clement argue against the motion is a signal that the judge could be open to bucking the trend.\n\nSince then, Adams\u2019s legal team has filed a new motion seeking the dismissal of the charges against him, alleging prosecutorial misconduct in connection to leaked letters from Justice Department officials, which they argue were prejudicial toward Adams. The mayor\u2019s lawyers requested the charges be dropped \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d meaning that they couldn\u2019t be brought against Adams in the future. In response, Ho ordered the Justice Department to file any potential opposition to that motion by March 7.\n\nWhat was the case about again?\n\nIn September, Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced an indictment against Adams, alleging a nearly decade-long scheme in which he knowingly solicited illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel benefits from foreign nationals beginning during his tenure as Brooklyn borough president. In exchange, the filing alleges that Adams facilitated the opening of the new Turkish Consulate in 2021 by pressuring the New York City Fire Department to allow the building to open without clearing a required fire inspection. Prosecutors also claim that Adams often failed to declare the costly international flights and hotels on his required disclosure forms and created fake invoices to hide the perks.\n\nAdams faces five charges: one count of conspiracy to receive campaign contributions from foreign nationals and commit wire fraud and bribery, one count of wire fraud, two counts of soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals, and one count of soliciting and accepting a bribe. His trial was initially slated to begin in April.\n\nSince the indictment was unsealed, Adams has faced a chorus of calls for his resignation. But the mayor has maintained his innocence in the matter, vowing to continue his work at City Hall with no intentions of resigning. \u201cI\u2019m not stepping down. I\u2019m stepping up,\u201d Adams said that month.\n\nWhat did the Justice Department do?\n\nIn February, the newly Trump-ified Justice Department asked Manhattan prosecutors to drop its own pending case against Adams. In a memo, Bove cited the possibility of political influence in the prosecution, specifically naming the now former U.S. Attorney Williams, whom Adams\u2019s lawyers have accused of bias. But he made clear that his request was really about something else: Adams\u2019s abilities to complete his duties as mayor, particularly in addressing immigration and crime, two of President Trump\u2019s top priorities.\n\nBove notably said the department reached this decision \u201cwithout assessing the strength of the evidence\u201d and asked that the case be dropped \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d meaning that the charges could potentially be brought up against Adams in the future.\n\nIn a brief address, Adams reiterated his innocence and signaled his eagerness to put this chapter of his life behind him. \u201cNow, we can put this cruel episode behind us and focus entirely on the future of our city. It\u2019s time to move forward,\u201d Adams said.\n\nWhat was the fallout?\n\nThe effects of the Justice Department\u2019s memo were immediate. Danielle Sassoon, the interim U.S. Attorney whose office undertook the case under her predecessor, rejected Bove\u2019s request and resigned from her post rather than fulfill it. It was later revealed that Sassoon had written a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and expressed her concerns about Bove\u2019s directive, alleging that the agreement discussed by Adams\u2019s attorneys and Justice Department officials amounted to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in exchange for the mayor\u2019s assistance with federal immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cRather than be rewarded, Adams\u2019s advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case,\u201d Sassoon wrote.\n\nSassoon was not alone. At least six Justice Department officials would go on to resign from their positions as Bove sought to reassign the case to the department\u2019s Public Integrity Section and have one of its prosecutors sign off on his directive.\n\nThe tumult extended beyond Washington, D.C., and the federal government. Four of Adams\u2019s deputy mayors \u2014 Maria Torres-Springer, Meera Joshi, Anne Williams-Isom, and Chauncey Parker \u2014 announced their intention to resign following the Justice Department\u2019s move to dismiss Adams\u2019s case.\n\nAdams himself has denied the existence of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between him and the Trump administration. \u201cI want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered \u2014 nor did anyone offer on my behalf \u2014 any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nCould Adams just get a pardon from President Trump?\n\nAs the spotlight on Adams has grown, so has his relationship with the president. The pair shared a dais at the annual Al Smith Memorial Dinner as then-candidate Trump publicly compared their legal plights during his remarks, suggesting Adams was targeted by the Biden administration for his criticism of its handling of the migrant crisis. \u201cWe were persecuted, Eric. I was persecuted, and so were you, Eric,\u201d Trump said in October.\n\nNotably, Adams did not denounce Trump\u2019s overtures toward him and made a pointed effort to meet with him following his win in the 2024 election. As the mayor traveled to Florida to meet with the incoming president and even traveled to attend his inauguration in D.C., speculation grew that Adams sought to be in Trump\u2019s good graces in the hopes of receiving some reprieve with his federal case under a new administration.\n\nFor his part, Adams rebuffed the rumors, saying that it\u2019s part of his job as mayor to work with whoever is in the White House for the betterment of New York City. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be warring with this administration,\u201d the mayor said in December. \u201cI\u2019m going to be working with this administration.\u201d\n\nDespite their friendlier interactions, Trump has yet to utilize his federal pardon power to assist Adams despite invoking it in other situations, such as with the January 6 rioters. With the Justice Department currently intervening on Adams\u2019s behalf, it\u2019s unclear if that will change.\n\nThough Adams\u2019s case is currently on hold, he is still contending with record unpopularity as well as a difficult path to reelection. Recent polls found the incumbent mayor trailing behind some of his Democratic challengers as well as former governor Andrew Cuomo, who has yet to officially join the race."

            "full_content": "Senator Peter Welch sounds the retreat. Photo: Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIt\u2019s a demoralizing time to be a congressional Democrat. As the Trump-Musk-Vought demolition team continues to dismantle federal government functions and fire personnel, the Republicans who control Congress are standing by passively despite the explicit and implicit threats to their own authority represented by DOGE raids, OMB-ordered freezes and layoffs, and presidential executive orders asserting total control over spending. They may whine about it (Senate Appropriations Committee chair Susan Collins has been complaining that thunderbolts from Musk aren\u2019t the right way to downsize government), but they aren\u2019t willing to buck Trump, who so far seems to be chuckling with pleasure at DOGE\u2019s excesses and even egging Musk on. Meanwhile, Democrats have been excluded categorically from the formal budget process whereby Congress makes long-term fiscal plans, which are designed to be enacted in a huge package (which cannot be filibustered) via a strict party-line vote.\n\nBut Democrats in Congress have one big leverage point: Annual appropriations bills, providing the money to keep the federal government going, have to pass both chambers of Congress and can indeed be filibustered in the Senate, which means 41 of the 47 Democratic senators have the absolute power to say no. Democrats have additional leverage in the House, where the tiny GOP majority, combined with an assortment of Republican fiscal hard-liners who never vote for spending bills, means appropriations bills can\u2019t pass without Democratic votes. As the assault on the federal government and on Congress developed in the first days of the second Trump administration, Democrats appeared to be aware of their leverage and ready to use it, as reflected in a comment by Senator Patty Murray to Punchbowl News earlier this month:\n\nDemocrats are, as always, committed to responsibly funding the government, but it is extremely difficult to reach an agreement on toplines \u2014 much less full-year spending bills \u2014 when the president is illegally blocking vast chunks of approved funding, when he is trying to unilaterally shutter critical agencies, and when an unelected billionaire is empowered to force his way into our government\u2019s central, highly-sensitive payments system [at the Treasury Department]. Democrats and Republicans alike must be able to trust that when a deal gets signed into law, it will be followed.\n\nWith the stopgap spending authority enacted in December due to expire on March 14, now is the time for Democrats to use their leverage to refuse any deal that doesn\u2019t include meaningful curbs on executive usurpation of congressional spending powers. Yes, if executed, this gambit could result in a government shutdown, and Republicans from Trump on down (including those who love all government shutdowns as a way to show how useless government actually is) would seek to blame it on the minority party, despite the GOP\u2019s comprehensive, swaggering control of Washington. But at a time when Democratic constituencies are screaming from every rooftop that they expect their representatives in Washington to do something, refusing to go along with spending bills that the administration will just brush aside seems like a no-brainer.\n\nBut now that the moment of truth is approaching, there are signs some congressional Democrats are inclined to flinch in the face of a GOP-engineered choice to shut it or gut it, as Politico explains:\n\nDemocrats are insisting on the guardrails for Trump and Musk amid deep anger on the left about the president\u2019s unilateral dismantling of the federal government. Following a meeting of top GOP appropriators and party leadership Wednesday morning, Republicans officially rejected the proposal.\n\nDemocratic leaders now face a dilemma: Do they hold firm, refrain from bailing Republicans out and allow an unpopular shutdown? Or do they fold and risk the ire of liberal voters eager to see the party stand their ground against Trump and Musk? So far, they are treading carefully.\n\nIn this case, carefully appears to be a synonym for fearfully. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries sure isn\u2019t drawing any lines in the sand:\n\n[Jeffries] deferred to House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut when asked Wednesday whether Democrats could support a funding deal that doesn\u2019t restrain Trump and Musk.\n\nThis is not exactly a \u201chell no.\u201d More explicitly, Vermont Senator Peter Welch spelled out how Democrats might rationalize a surrender of their leverage, per Punchbowl News:\n\nWhat makes us think if we put more language in there, [Musk is] gonna pay any attention to that? He\u2019s on a lawless rampage, and there\u2019s nothing stopping him,\u201d Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) told us. \u201cThe big question will be if he faces a judicial order and disregards it.\u201d\n\nThis is another way of just throwing up one\u2019s hands and hoping the courts rein in the stampeding chief executive and his turbulent agents. In the meantime, presumably, Democrats can cut their little deals on spending, keep the federal government open, and hope for the best.\n\nIf that\u2019s the way the wind is blowing among congressional Democrats, it may represent an extreme version of the belief that the voters don\u2019t care anything about the Constitution or lawful behavior and can be mobilized only to resist Trump by extremely specific cuts in services or programs they value. But if there\u2019s a silver lining to the vast power Elon Musk has been given by the 47th president, it\u2019s that his indifference and even hostility to the very concept of government having any value is so blatant as to shock even the most diffident or inattentive voter. Here\u2019s how my colleague the longtime Musk watcher John Hermann puts it:\n\n[H]e wants to fire as many people as possible. Punishing workers is a cause and a purpose unto itself, inseparable from a grandiose conflation of personal desires and successes with the fate of humanity. It\u2019s an ecstatic project with an accelerationist character. \u201cI am become meme,\u201d he declares, as his team of private-sector loyalists harasses federal employees with spiteful emails threatening to get rid of them. The message from the largest employer in the country to its disfavored employees could not be much clearer: You are waste, you are fraud. We want to make a spectacle of your misfortune. We cannot wait to fire you.\n\nMusk is already unpopular, and he doesn\u2019t really care if the pain suffered by government workers or the \u201cparasites\u201d who depend on the benefits or services they provide make his project a political handicap for Trump and the GOP. Shining as bright a light on what DOGE is doing as possible is really the only play for the opposition party right now. If that means daring Republicans to trigger a government shutdown that MAGA folk will not be able to stop themselves from conspicuously enjoying, so be it."

            "full_content": "We ain\u2019t seen nothing yet! Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nFederal employees and those who depend on the benefits and services they provide have been in shock from the moment the new Trump administration unleashed Elon Musk\u2019s shadowy DOGE operatives to conduct guerrilla warfare on the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Chaos and unpredictability have been the hallmarks of the DOGE reign of terror with Musk presuming enormous powers to judge and fire federal employees, deploying the high-speed destructive tactics he perfected in prior corporate takeovers, and with a vast troll army of X followers and MAGA activists hooting and cheering every move.\n\nNow it appears Team Trump is moving to a larger and more systematic \u2014 if no less legally and politically problematic \u2014 effort to decimate those elements of the federal government regarded as unfriendly or irrelevant to the president\u2019s radical plans, as Politico reports:\n\nFederal agencies are being ordered to submit plans by mid-March for laying off employees in \u201clarge-scale reductions in force\u201d \u2014 an escalation in President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal workforce.\n\n\u201cPursuant to the President\u2019s direction, agencies should focus on the maximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated while driving the highest-quality, most efficient delivery of their statutorily-required functions,\u201d according to the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management memo released on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the federal government has seen a host of layoffs since Trump took office, this move takes the president\u2019s agenda a step further. Most recent dismissals focused on probationary employees \u2014 generally federal workers in their jobs for one or two years \u2014 while reductions in force could target a wider range of workers. The memo directs agencies to submit these \u201cagency RIF and reorganization plans\u201d by March 13.\n\nThis latest offensive was set up by a February 11 Trump executive order that mainly drew attention as the first presidential authorization of DOGE\u2019s raids. But it also instructed federal agencies to get ready for large-scale RIFs (\u201creductions in force\u201d) unrelated to the administration\u2019s initial policies, taking a hammer to programs and personnel engaged on such prohibited topics as DEI and climate change. The new push is aimed simply at generating big numbers of firings and spending cuts. How big will it be? Lawfare\u2019s Nick Bednar suggests it could get rid of as many as 700,000 federal employees, which \u201cwould increase nationwide unemployment by about 0.5 percent\u201d totally aside from the damage wrought by important work left undone.\n\nThe other significant thing about this initiative is that it\u2019s being jointly supervised by Russ Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. The latter is DOGE\u2019s beachhead in the federal government and its first big landing sight. It\u2019s the entity that authorized the \u201cvoluntary retirement\u201d gambit that was Musk\u2019s first major action and sent out Musk\u2019s \u201cfive bullet points\u201d email ordering federal employers to justify their existence within 48 hours (subsequently countermanded by many agencies). Whatever happened earlier, Vought and Musk, arguably the two figures in the Trump administration most aggressively hostile to much of what the federal government currently does (other than \u201cwarfighting,\u201d jailing immigrants, and rewarding Trump\u2019s friends), are on the same page now and working closely together. That this latest push was discussed at a Trump Cabinet meeting attended by Musk is a signal that blowing up big parts of the federal workforce is indeed an administrationwide priority.\n\nThere are, as you can imagine, many legal, administrative, and political pitfalls surrounding these mass layoffs. The RIF process is invariably described as \u201carcane.\u201d Deployed so massively, it would probably violate both collective-bargaining agreements and congressional policy mandates. Lawsuits are inevitable, and confusion is absolutely certain, particularly since congressional action on Trump\u2019s budget proposals and on the spending authority due to expire on March 14 could change the facts on the ground enormously. Musk\u2019s ability to sit in a meeting with agency heads without pulling out a chain saw may suggest his conduct is being regularized, but it\u2019s entirely possible he will continue to freelance in order to please his many fans on X, most of whom would love to pillage the \u201cdeep state\u201d mindlessly for the sheer nihilistic hell of it.\n\nBut while it\u2019s not possible to fully contextualize the mass firings now underway in terms of their significance to Trump 2.0\u2019s overall scheme of counterrevolutionary extremism, they will represent a wakeup call to those who thought this man just wanted to bring back a stable economy and spread peace throughout a troubled world."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nMANA Nutrition makes a special kind of peanut butter paste that many humanitarian aid workers are familiar with. It is fortified with milk and essential vitamins, packed with calories and sent to severely malnourished children around the world, including some countries in Africa.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Mark Moore, the CEO and co-founder of the Fitzgerald, Georgia-based plant, got word from the US Agency for International Development: MANA\u2019s contracts with the agency were being canceled.\n\nCNN spoke with Moore just minutes after he said he received a series of contract termination letters from USAID. Still reeling, Moore described the furious scramble that the news had set off at his plant. One of his first orders of business: Asking his workers mid-production to immediately stop putting labels that say \u201cUSAID\u201d on the pouches that the peanut butter paste is squirted into.\n\n\u201cEvery one of those packets has printing on it that says, \u2018From the American people. USAID.\u2019 And if\u2026 I don\u2019t deliver it through USAID contracts, it\u2019s trash. I can\u2019t distribute it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can squeeze that peanut butter back out of that packet and put it in a new packet. So it\u2019s a problem. A huge problem.\u201d\n\nHis predicament is just one of the many aftershocks of the Trump administration\u2019s rapid decimation of USAID, which has suffered more severely than almost any other agency across the government. Thousands of positions at the federal agency have been eliminated and the vast majority of its officials have been placed on leave. Contracts are being canceled left and right, leaving many in the humanitarian aid world reeling.\n\nThis May 2024 photo from the US Agency for International Development shows a worker handling Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food at the MANA Nutrition Factory in Fitzgerald, Georgia. US Agency for International Development\n\nIn normal times, Moore\u2019s plant produces 10 pouches of the lifesaving paste every second. Each small bag contains 500 calories\u2019 worth of the special peanut butter \u2014 which does not require refrigeration or additional preparation \u2014 and is labeled \u201cRUTF\u201d for \u201cReady-to-Use Therapeutic Food.\u201d\n\nUSAID has been a major supporter and funder of RUTF products over the years.\n\nIn the middle of a phone call with a CNN reporter, Moore asked to switch to FaceTime to show rolls of USAID-emblazoned packaging film in his office that gets turned into the sealed pouches of peanut butter.\n\n\u201cSo this is 45 boxes. USAID-branded. This is our UNICEF stuff,\u201d he said, referring to the United Nations agency tasked with providing aid to children worldwide.\n\nIn their warehouse, Moore said, there are around 400,000 boxes of USAID-branded RUTF ready to be shipped out. He estimates that if USAID doesn\u2019t pay MANA for those boxes, he will have at least $10 million in wasted peanut butter pouches on his hands. And that doesn\u2019t include an additional $14 million in reimbursements from the federal government that he was already waiting for. He is unsure whether or when he will get paid.\n\nErin Boyd, a USAID nutrition adviser who was laid off from the agency in January, told CNN it is not an overstatement to say that children will die as a result of the decimation of USAID and funding for RUTF.\n\nAdelaida Marquez, 25, serves Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food to her 15-month-old son Javier, who has been diagnosed with malnutrition, in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, in August 2019. Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters/File\n\n\u201cEven before this happened, there wasn\u2019t enough funding to treat all the children who were presenting wasting.\u201d Boyd said. Wasting, according to UNICEF, refers to a life-threatening form of malnutrition: \u201cChildren with wasting are too thin and their immune systems are weak, leaving them vulnerable to developmental delays, disease and death,\u201d the group says.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the production of RUTF that Boyd is alarmed about. She worries that the overhaul of USAID will mean the elimination of countless humanitarian programs around the world designed to save impoverished children.\n\n\u201cIt will just mean that kids\u2019 programs don\u2019t exist; the children don\u2019t even get identified as malnourished, and they\u2019ll die at home and we won\u2019t know,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nCNN reached out to the State Department, which now oversees USAID, for comment.\n\nFor now, Moore is grasping for any clarity \u2014 but nobody seems to have any answers.\n\nMANA had received around a half-dozen contract termination letters by Wednesday evening. That accounts for \u201cmost of the contracts\u201d that MANA has with USAID, he said, but it was impossible to get anything resembling real guidance from anyone at USAID on how his company should proceed.\n\nThat\u2019s because Trump\u2019s assault on the agency has left thousands of positions eliminated and the majority of the agency\u2019s employees put on administrative leave.\n\nOne person placed on leave amid the Trump assault on the agency is the USAID contract officer that Moore has dealt with in the past on MANA\u2019s contracts.\n\nThis May 2024 photo from the US Agency for International Development shows boxes of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food at the MANA Nutrition Factory. US Agency for International Development\n\n\u201cHe called me from his personal cell,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe was just stunned.\u201d\n\nOne of the contract termination letters viewed by CNN is dated Wednesday, February 25, and signed by Nadeem Shah, a deputy director at USAID.\n\n\u201cThis award is being terminated for convenience and the interests of the U.S. Government pursuant to a directive from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in his capacity as the Acting Administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development [\u201cthe Agency\u201d or \u201cUSAID\u201d] and/or Peter W. Marocco,\u201d the letter says. \u201cImmediately cease all activities, terminate all subawards and contracts, and avoid incurring any additional obligations chargeable to the award beyond those unavoidable costs associated with this Termination Notice.\u201d\n\nThis comes as a Wednesday court filing showed the Trump administration saying it is terminating more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid awards.\n\n\u201cIn total, nearly 5,800 USAID awards were terminated, and more than 500 USAID awards were retained,\u201d the filing from the administration said. \u201cThe total ceiling value of the retained awards is approximately $57 billion.\u201d\n\nIn a new world where USAID is no longer a major funder of RUTF products, Moore wonders whether major nonprofit organizations will step in and help out.\n\n\u201cI can call World Vision, or Save the Children, or whoever, and say, \u2018Hey, guess what, none of us are going to get this medicine for malnourished kids from the US government anymore, because they\u2019re shut down,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Do you want to buy some?\u2019\u201d"

Liberals in America and Europe still can\u2019t accept this, in part because Trump is so incendiary and prone to falsehoods. Yes, it\u2019s absurd to brand Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a \u201cdictator\u201d for suspending elections during wartime but say nothing about Vladimir Putin, an autocrat who has presided over rigged elections in Russia for a quarter-century. Yes, it was Russia that invaded Ukraine, precipitating a war that has, collectively, killed hundreds of thousands of troops on both sides. Putin, if he had his druthers, would have subsumed all of Ukraine.\n\nBut peace must come, and it must come soon. The new minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine is a beginning. It is less exploitative than it seemed at first blush and includes a reconstruction fund and some kind of security guarantee. The American government should take the lead because it has heavily funded and effectively guided the Ukrainian military throughout the three horrific years of war, and it should play a direct role in reaching an accord that can guarantee an end to all hostilities, a preservation of Ukrainian civilian life, and the winding down of tensions between the U.S. and Russia, the two great nuclear powers on the planet. As early as 2022, the United States could have spearheaded a serious peace effort, but it never did; the Biden administration mistakenly believed, along with the Western European powers, that Ukraine could actually win the war against Russia, driving Putin\u2019s troops fully out of the territories they newly seized and even Crimea itself, which Russia occupied a decade ago.\n\nThe Realpolitik of all of this never made much sense, and it was why a few prominent dissenting voices, including the late Henry Kissinger and the leftist icon Noam Chomsky, reached a similar conclusion: Europe and the Biden administration were deluding themselves. It was a form of crackpot realism, an insistence on full-scale victory against all available evidence.\n\nEarly in the war, it became clear that Russia could not, in fact, conquer all of Ukraine and march onward into Poland and the rest of Europe, as Adolf Hitler did at the start of World War II. This was thanks, in part, to U.S. military aid but also to the realities of modern warfare. Today\u2019s military technology \u2014 including drones and surveillance \u2014 makes blitzkrieg-style land invasions exceedingly difficult. Just as Ukraine could not achieve any long promised \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d in the war \u2014 every ballyhooed counteroffensive failed \u2014 Russia could not penetrate very deeply beyond a few regions of Ukraine.\n\nBy the summer of 2022, it was growing obvious to anyone who wasn\u2019t blinkered by military propaganda that this clash would not at all resemble what took place in World War II. A much better analogy was the First World War, when rapid technological advances begat brutal trench warfare, the battle lines barely shifting over multiple years as millions were slaughtered. In three years of fighting, neither Ukraine nor Russia can claim huge progress. All the old Biden hands and Western European leaders managed to accomplish is buying a bit more time, through tremendous bloodshed, for a negotiated end to a war that could have ended sooner.\n\nIf the Trump administration was too fast to broadcast its bargaining aims to Russia before the sides formally entered into peace talks \u2014 Ukraine should be involved, but the U.S. needs to lead \u2014 the goals, despite the outrage of liberal internationalists, are sensible: no NATO membership for Ukraine, no American troops in Ukraine, and no American military guarantee for European Union troops in Ukraine. No American president is willing to deploy American troops into combat with Russia \u2014 and no Congress in the near term will support it \u2014 so NATO membership will be untenable. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s statement that Ukraine could not reconquer its lost territories recognized a reality that has been obvious to all cogent military analysts for more than a year, since the utter failure of the Ukrainian military offensive in 2023, as Anatole Lieven has argued.\n\nGreater security issues, as they were during the Cold War, can be hashed out only between Washington and Moscow. NATO membership for Ukraine is up to the existing members of NATO, not Ukraine, and each member has a veto. It will be extraordinarily challenging for Zelensky to accept a compromise agreement unless he tells the hard-liners in his own country he has no choice but to do what the Americans say. British and European suggestions of support for Ukraine\u2019s military sans the United States \u2014 with European troops guaranteeing a cease-fire \u2014 are nonsensical and potentially destructive, making it harder for Zelensky to sell a peace deal.\n\nNow the negotiations can commence. The United States made the first move, and it is up to Russia to reasonably counter. The contours of an agreement will rest on American willingness to accommodate Russian security concerns, like the deployment of U.S. troops on Russia\u2019s borders, in return for specific Ukrainian demands. Some are more viable than others, and this will be part of the negotiation. None of this is straightforward \u2014 there will be inevitable setbacks, and none of the negotiating parties is terribly reliable \u2014 but it is all better than endless warfare. Russia hawks describe an enemy as threatening as the old Soviet empire, but three years of de facto trench warfare have not validated their worldview. Putin has hesitated to launch a mass-conscription campaign within Russia that could, in theory, completely overwhelm the Ukrainian military, an indicator that he is wary of alienating Russian citizens (hence the North Korean soldiers dying for Russia).\n\nUkraine, of course, will have to accept that total victory is not possible and never really was. Zelensky will have to hold elections again. Democrats should pressure Trump to strike a better deal for Ukraine, but they shouldn\u2019t try to scuttle a peace agreement or rattle the sabers for a new war as they contest the 2028 nomination. This has been a terrible chapter of world history that needs to be closed as soon as possible. The most direct path to averting a new world war is represented in these negotiations. The guns, soon, must fall silent."

            "full_content": "The American coach of the Canadian men\u2019s national soccer team blasted President Donald Trump on Wednesday amid icy geopolitical tensions between the neighbors. The fiery rhetoric comes just as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico prepare to co-host the World Cup in 2026, with Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on both nations looming.\n\nSince winning the presidential election in November, Trump has repeatedly stated that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, a thought that doesn\u2019t sit well with Canada\u2019s Wisconsin-born soccer coach Jesse Marsch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to address the 51st state discourse, which I find unsettling and frankly insulting,\u201d said Marsch while speaking to the press in Los Angeles this week. \u201cIf I have one message to our president, it\u2019s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an American, I\u2019m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we\u2019ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies,\u201d said Marsch.\n\nThe Racine native and former U.S. men\u2019s national team player compared the politics of his home nation to that of the country he\u2019s now coaching.\n\n\u201cCanada is a strong, independent nation that\u2019s deep-rooted in decency,\u201d said Marsch, who at one time was touted to take over the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that values high ethics and respect, unlike the polarized, disrespectful and often now hate-fueled climate that\u2019s in the U.S.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his desire for the United States to absorb Canada at the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI say Canada should be our 51st state. It\u2019s not fair for us to be supporting Canada, and if we don\u2019t support them, they don\u2019t subsist as a nation,\u201d Trump said, flanked by his Cabinet appointees and special government employee Elon Musk.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump blasted Canada and Mexico, writing on his Truth Social social media platform: \u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.\"\n\nWhile U.S. Customs officials intercepted 20,000 pounds of fentanyl at the Mexican border in 2024, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were intercepted at the Canadian border last year, according to an NBC News analysis of U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nTrump also said in his post that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday \"as scheduled.\"\n\nDuring his Cabinet meeting, Trump outlined the crippling effects his tariffs will have on Canada. \u201cThe tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell cars into the United States. The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s pugilistic tone toward Canada has taken shape, the tension between the longtime allies has boiled over into the world of sports. Canadian fans have booed the American national anthem before NBA and NHL games, including on Feb. 15 when the U.S. and Canada\u2019s hockey teams faced off in Montreal, where three fights broke out in the first nine seconds.\n\n\u201cThese international tournaments for Canada means something different now,\u201d acknowledged Marsch.\n\nThe most highly watched international tournament in all of sports is just over a year and a half away. The World Cup could see the host nations play each other in the knockout rounds amid the backdrop of unprecedented geopolitical dynamics."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 Congress is barreling toward a deadline to avert a government shutdown in just over two weeks, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether there should be guardrails on President Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress.\n\nDemocrats want to insert language in the funding bill to ensure that the administration implements the spending directed by Congress, a reaction to Mr. Trump and top adviser Elon Musk's work to downsize large swaths of the executive branch. But Republicans have made it clear that they won't accept those terms.\n\nGovernment funding expires on March 14, and keeping the government open past the deadline will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, but a funding measure requires 60 votes for passage. In the House, Republicans are operating with a razor-thin majority and a divided conference in which conservatives regularly vote against government spending bills.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday that a continuing resolution that funds the government at the current levels is the \"most reasonable thing to do to ensure that the government is not shut down.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks at a press conference with other members of House Republican leadership in Washington D.C., on Feb. 25, 2025. Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nIt has yet to be determined whether disaster relief for the California wildfires would be included in the funding measure, but Johnson told reporters it likely would not include language to codify cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the Musk-led task force that is slashing programs across the executive branch.\n\n\"It probably is as close to a clean CR as possible,\" he said of the potential path forward.\n\nJohnson's comments came after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut in an interview with CNN later in the evening, Johnson noted that the CR might include some \"anomalies,\" opening the door to spending cuts that would alienate most Democrats.\n\n\"You can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending. You can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a clean CR, mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here.\"\n\nThursday evening, Mr. Trump announced his support for a \"a clean, temporary\" continuing resolution, telling Congress, \"Let's get it done!\"\n\nDemocratic leaders have said the blame for any shutdown would lie squarely with Republicans, who control the House, Senate and the White House. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that Democrats don't want a shutdown and are at the table negotiating in good faith to fund the government.\n\n\"But Republicans are the majority in the House and in the Senate. If they want our votes, they need to work with us,\" Murray said, noting that appropriators are \"close\" on topline spending.\n\n\"We need to know Republicans are willing to work with us to protect Congress' power of the purse,\" Murray said. \"That is the absolute bare minimum, and it's frankly not asking a whole lot.\"\n\nRepublicans \"should not follow Elon toward a shutdown,\" Murray said.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Senate's top Republican appropriator, and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, her counterpart in the House, met with Johnson and Thune on Wednesday morning to discuss government funding.\n\nCole said he and Collins are on the same page, but do have differences with Democrats on \"some of the restrictions that they're demanding on what we consider legitimate presidential authority.\" He added that Republicans are \"not moving on that.\"\n\n\"That's a no-go, that's a red line that we're not changing our position on and they know that \u2014 that's been communicated consistently,\" Cole said.\n\nJohnson said Democrats have \"had completely unreasonable conditions assigned to this.\"\n\n\"They want us to limit the power of the executive branch, they want us to stipulate in the appropriations bills for the first time in history that certain agencies in the executive branch would have to have a specific number of employees, all sorts of just unreasonable \u2014 what I think are unconstitutional \u2014 demands,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a violation of separation of powers. So we're pretty far apart right now, but it is not because of Republicans, it's because of the Democrats.\"\n\nThe funding fight comes as Republicans in Congress have also been moving ahead on a separate budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for approving Mr. Trump's agenda on issues ranging from border security to energy and taxes. Though the two issues are distinctly separate, the focus on the budget has taken center stage in recent weeks, appearing to sideline progress toward government funding.\n\ncontributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nLet\u2019s build from scratch our Nightmare Prosecutor, the way kids might build their ultimate villain in an interactive, comic-universe video game.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by sliding our subject\u2019s prosecutorial experience rating to zero. At the same time, let\u2019s max out his arrogance score \u2014 nothing quite like having no chops but thinking you\u2019re Archibald Cox. Then we\u2019ll give our creation full control of a crucial prosecutor\u2019s office that will handle sensitive political matters so he can inflict maximum damage. Now let\u2019s amp things up and make our Nightmare Prosecutor a political attack dog, frothing to use his shiny new badge to settle scores and please his master. As a closing touch, we\u2019ll drag the sycophancy score all the way up; his public slobbering will be so comically excessive you\u2019ll have to stifle a laugh \u2014 until you remember how much power he actually wields.\n\nWelcome to the Weapon X of the Trump Justice Department: Ed Martin.\n\nDon\u2019t let the forgettable name fool you. The acting U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., recently nominated by Trump to the full-time post, is going to do major damage \u2014 to his political opponents, to the Justice Department, and ultimately to the Trump administration itself. Putting Martin in charge of the D.C. U.S. Attorney\u2019s office is like giving a power tool to a 6-year-old in a crowded room. He has no idea how to use it and no sense of the damage he can do, but he\u2019s going to run wild with it and people are going to get hurt.\n\nMartin \u2014 who had represented January 6 defendants (which is fine, everyone\u2019s entitled to a defense) and was a vocal \u201cStop the Steal\u201d proponent (which is not) \u2014 came to the job with an agenda. He quickly dismissed dozens of pending January 6 cases as he\u2019d been instructed to do by Trump and the acting attorney general. In one of those cases, the defendant had been represented by \u2026 Ed Martin. This, folks, is what we call a conflict of interest.\n\nMartin also fired about 30 of his own prosecutors, who had worked on January 6 cases, apparently for their unforgivable decision to prosecute cases against people who had obviously violated the law. Because retribution must be served not only cold but in heaping portions, Martin ordered some of his remaining prosecutors to investigate their own colleagues for potentially committing some unspecified crime by prosecuting the January 6 defendants in the first place.\n\nStill not satisfied, Martin recently posted on X an article about how, toward the end of his time as special counsel, Jack Smith had received $140,000 in free legal services from a D.C. law firm (Covington & Burling, where I worked 20 years ago and have several friends). Martin snarled, \u201cSave your receipts, Smith and Covington. We\u2019ll be in touch soon.\u201d What\u2019s even the potential crime here? Smith lawyered up \u2014 wisely, given the obvious retribution headed his way \u2014 and a law firm represented him pro bono. Somebody call the cops! And if Martin had a clue, he\u2019d know that it\u2019s generally not a great idea to broadcast a new criminal investigation publicly. It tends to, you know, out your case and tip off the bad guys. Either Martin is a prosecutorial buffoon or he only cares about the aggro X post \u2014 could be both. (Not to be outdone, Trump himself promptly announced that he\u2019d be seeking vengeance on Covington for having the gall to do free legal work for Smith, stripping security clearances and government contracts from the firm.)\n\nSpeaking of social media, D.C.\u2019s top prosecutor simply can\u2019t stop fawning over Elon Musk and DOGE. That would be fine, if mildly embarrassing, for a normal person. But Martin has seemingly enlisted his office as Musk\u2019s personal police force. He wrote an obsequious letter to Musk, then \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 posted it on X, prefaced by a sweet personal note about how Martin would seek out those who might oppose Musk\u2019s DOGE and prosecute \u201claw-breaking by the disgruntled.\u201d Ah, yes: United States v. Disgruntled, on a charge of Law-Breaking.\n\nDays later, Martin posted on X a hysterically overwrought follow-up. \u201cIf people are discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically, we will investigate them,\u201d Martin frothed. Hey, rookie: prosecutors can\u2019t indict people for \u201cacting simply unethically.\u201d\n\nThen, just to show how much he meant it, Martin added, in extra-scary bold typeface: \u201cwe will chase them to the end of the Earth.\u201d Listen, Ed. Take a breath. I know you\u2019re brand new to this whole prosecutor thing. It\u2019s exciting, I get it. But you need to see what actual crime looks like before you rip your shirt off and promise to tear down heaven and earth to bring to justice those folks who might\u2019ve upset Elon Musk.\n\nAnd in his most recent tantrum, Martin publicly threatened to prosecute Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Robert Garcia for \u2026 saying things about politics. Schumer infamously proclaimed in March 2020 that certain conservative Supreme Court justices \u201chave released the whirlwind and you will pay the price\u201d while Garcia said this month that \u201cwhat the American public want is for us to bring actual weapons to this bar fight.\u201d\n\nBoth Schumer and Garcia made stupid, irresponsible statements. But their screeds are wholly protected by the First Amendment, which applies most powerfully to political speech \u2014 a good thing, as it turns out, for one Donald John Trump, who regularly pushes the outer boundaries and has (rightly) avoided prosecution even for his inflammatory January 6 Ellipse speech. (Smith charged Trump for his pre\u2013January 6 efforts to steal the election but not for his political speech that day.) If Martin is unhinged enough to actually seek an indictment of either Schumer or Garcia, the chances of an eventual conviction are precisely 0.0 percent.\n\nPrecious few people can rein in Martin. There\u2019s Trump, of course, but don\u2019t count on that. There\u2019s also the Senate, which can and should reject his nomination, but that\u2019s not happening either; everyone above the Gaetz line has made it through.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has chosen thus far to remain blissfully unaware of her own Justice Department\u2019s most consequential moves. She claimed, for example, to be unaware of exactly what was happening with the Eric Adams debacle, even as the crisis boiled over publicly. Bondi\u2019s acting deputy, Emil Bove, would technically be in position to check Martin, but Bove has embraced the same aggressively retributive tactics. Then there\u2019s Todd Blanche, who will become the deputy attorney general once confirmed by the Senate. He\u2019s a friend and former colleague of mine, and he has a sound prosecutorial ethic. But his loyalty to core prosecutorial principle has yet to be tested, and it won\u2019t be easy to restore order inside the dark cloud that has enveloped the Justice Department.\n\nPerhaps the only real check is that Martin might go so far that he inflicts genuine political damage on the Trump administration. We learned a lesson from the frenetic, runaway prosecutions of Trump himself: The American people know prosecutorial overkill when they see it, and they\u2019ll reject it. Just as prosecutors brought ill-conceived, ineptly executed cases against Trump that backfired and provided him with political fuel, the American public will eventually take notice of Martin\u2019s excesses, and the Trump administration will pay the political price.\n\nBut that\u2019s an indirect cost at most, and it will take months or years, and many more abuses, to fully take hold. The cold reality is that it\u2019s already ugly in D.C., and it\u2019s going to get worse.\n\nThis article will also appear in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson vowed Wednesday that Republicans will not make cuts to Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security as they work to pass \u2013 and pay for \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislative agenda.\n\n\u201cThe White House has made a commitment. The president said over and over and over, \u2018We\u2019re not going to touch Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.\u2019 We\u2019ve made the same commitment. Now that said, what we are going to do is go into those programs and carve out the fraud, waste and abuse, and find efficiencies,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly said he will not cut entitlement programs, including during his administration\u2019s first Cabinet meeting earlier Wednesday, Republicans have long sought to shrink Medicaid.\n\nPressed on how they would cut the amount laid out in the House\u2019s budget blueprint without touching Medicare and Medicaid, Johnson argued that it is possible through work requirements and other cuts. Johnson also said that per capita caps on federal funding for those programs are \u201coff the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s let this play out,\u201d he added.\n\nJohnson\u2019s promise came hours after House Republicans passed a budget blueprint to advance Trump\u2019s legislative priorities, but it awaits Senate approval. Not all GOP senators are in favor of the trillions of dollars in spending cuts included in the House-passed version that Johnson was forced to add by conservative hardliners, as CNN has reported.\n\nThe House GOP plan calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts \u2013 and if it doesn\u2019t hit $2 trillion, it forces tax-writers to downsize some of their plans. Almost $1 trillion of that will come from savings in the Energy and Commerce Committee, which even some Republicans fear could mean steep cuts to the popular health program Medicaid.\n\nThat\u2019s yet another nonstarter for some Senate Republicans, particularly those from states where Medicaid enrollment accelerated after local leaders accepted more federal cash under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs the March 14 government funding deadline looms, Johnson acknowledged that Congress may have to settle for a yearlong resolution maintaining spending at current levels \u2013 with carveouts and adjustments to align with the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s cuts, including to the US Agency for International Development. Those kinds of changes are likely to anger Democrats, whose support Johnson may need to pass the resolution.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I say you add anomalies to a (continuing resolution); you can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending,\u201d Johnson said, referring to a short-term stopgap spending bill. \u201cYou can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a clean CR mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here,\u201d the Louisiana Republican added. \u201cAnd the new reality is less government, more efficiency, better return for the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock\n\nOn December 3, 2024, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, hurling his country into an ongoing political crisis that has already resulted in his impeachment and arrest. In their effort to reconstruct the events of the day, investigators uncovered a strange detail: Hours before the declaration, the president\u2019s head of security was asking ChatGPT about coups. From Korean paper The Hankyoreh, in translation:\n\nAccording to the police and prosecution on the 18th, the police\u2019s application for an arrest warrant submitted to the Seoul Western District Prosecutors\u2019 Office reportedly included content showing that Chief Lee searched for \u201cmartial law,\u201d \u201cmartial law declaration,\u201d and \u201cdissolution of the National Assembly\u201d at around 8:20 p.m. on December 3rd of last year \u2026 [W]hen Chief Lee searched for the word, the State Council members had not yet arrived at the Presidential Office.\n\nThis is farcical, sure, and things didn\u2019t work out. It also doubles as a deranged ad for the service. Is your boss declaring martial law? Is he communicating poorly and failing to provide clear directions about what happens next? Need someone, or something, to talk to about a sensitive subject? Are you not getting what you need from a Google search for \u201cmartial law Korea?\u201d Try ChatGPT!\n\nMeanwhile, in the United Kingdom, a Freedom of Information request filed by a reporter for New Scientist produced a comparatively tame \u2014 but also sort of embarrassing \u2014 story:\n\nThe UK\u2019s technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has asked ChatGPT for advice on why the adoption of artificial intelligence is so slow in the UK business community \u2014 and which podcasts he should appear on \u2026 ChatGPT returned a 10-point list of problems hindering adoption, including sections on \u201cLimited Awareness and Understanding,\u201d \u201cRegulatory and Ethical Concerns\u201d and \u201cLack of Government or Institutional Support.\u201d The chatbot advised Kyle: \u201cWhile the UK government has launched initiatives to encourage AI adoption, many SMBs are unaware of these programs or find them difficult to navigate. Limited access to funding or incentives to de-risk AI investment can also deter adoption.\u201d\n\nHere we have a different sort of farce: A guy whose job involves ingesting and repeating a bunch of anodyne conventional wisdom getting what he needs from a sort of conventional-wisdom machine; as in the case of the martial-law chat, the use of AI here is mostly notable for its novelty. People in power with access to a wide range of rare resources also Google like the rest of us, and now some of them use chatbots, too.\n\nStill, these stories tell us things. One is about chatbot products themselves, which, however else their users understand them, are commercial web services that record what they\u2019re doing. No less than chats with a person, or search logs, they produce evidence. We can expect ChatGPT and similar products to make more cameos in world events, but also in criminal and civil court. They also suggest a particular sort of chatbot user who doesn\u2019t show up so often in conversations about AI adoption, which tend to focus on phenomena like homework help and/or cheating, office productivity and programming, and routine Google replacement.\n\nThe Kyle example, in particular, brings to mind a conversation I had early last year with a media executive \u2014 the sort of person who is used to asking things of people professionally gathered around him \u2014 who gushed about AI and how it had changed his life. Asked how, he said, with a hint of self-deprecation, that it was simple: He could ask it about anything, it would spit out a nice clean paragraph, and then he could walk into any room and pretend to know what he was talking about.\n\nFor most of us, having access to a chatbot that can effectively or at least plausibly answer a wide range of questions is strange and new. For a certain class of power people, chatbots don\u2019t provide something novel but rather a pocketable version of something familiar: a constantly available \u2014 and maybe flattering, and maybe obsequious \u2014 assistant. Like a human assistant, it can make you look good, or maybe get you out of a bind (but, so far, not through a coup). Also like a human assistant, it keeps notes. You know, just in case."

            "full_content": "Faceoffs and power plays aren\u2019t just hockey terms \u2014 they\u2019re the language of international diplomacy.\n\nThis week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.\n\nWhile the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an idea with deep roots in the Soviet era, when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d\n\nBut rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin during an ice hockey match in Sochi in 2020. Alexander Zemlianichenko / POOL / AFP via Getty Images file\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.\n\nAs a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.\n\n\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"\n\nThese overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nUntil now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.\n\nIn the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.\n\nU.S. and Russian officials meet at Riyadh\u2019s Diriyah Palace in February. Evelyn Hockstein / AFP - Getty Images\n\nAsked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d\n\nThroughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.\n\n\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d\n\nPutin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d\n\nIn response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.\n\nIt\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOne governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.\n\n\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d\n\nThat caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.\n\n\u201cLike most politics, this is mostly posturing.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Stella Ragas/Columbia Daily Spectator\n\nMary, a graduate student at Columbia University, was riding the subway home last Thursday night when she received a text message from a friend: \u201cICE raids allegedly.\u201d Only a few days earlier, agents from the Department of Homeland Security had arrested and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and a legal permanent resident of the U.S., and tried to arrest Ranjani Srinivasan, a 37-year-old Fulbright scholar from India, accusing them of supporting Hamas during demonstrations on campus. In both instances, DHS showed up at Columbia housing, apartment buildings similar to Mary\u2019s home.\n\nMary (whose name has been changed for privacy) is an international student attending Columbia on a student visa. In the past 16 months, she went to a few pro-Palestine rallies on campus. She never held a bullhorn or appeared in the news, but the mere fact that her opinions, as she puts it, \u201ccould be known\u201d by either the university or the U.S. government, was enough to paralyze her with worry. After receiving the text message, she got off the subway and waited while her partner circled the block, scouting the route between the station and their apartment for signs of DHS agents. \u201cI am double-, triple-thinking everything I do. The paranoia is justified in many ways, and it\u2019s been pretty debilitating,\u201d she says. \u201cColumbia\u2019s administration didn\u2019t care about Mahmoud or Ranjani, so why would I trust them to help me?\u201d\n\nKhalil\u2019s detention set off protests across the city, including rallies that drew hundreds around Columbia\u2019s campus. Yet those protests masked a quieter reality: International students have largely retreated from public life, fearing they may be next. Before this week\u2019s spring break, visa and green-card holders hunkered down in dorms or fled the Upper West Side altogether. (All the students interviewed for this story participated in pro-Palestinian actions.) \u201cPeople are just terrified,\u201d says Layla Saliba, a Palestinian American graduate student. \u201cInternational students are scared to come to campus, and people aren\u2019t getting guidance from their deans. They\u2019ve been left to deal with it by themselves. Students are the ones who are taking care of each other, organizing an \u2018ICE Watch\u2019 chat. The administration hasn\u2019t done anything.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Khalil\u2019s arrest, Columbia\u2019s communications with students have been steady but vague. Interim president Dr. Katrina Armstrong wrote a letter acknowledging the \u201cdistress\u201d students are feeling about having federal immigration agents around campus. In a follow-up email, Armstrong said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the presence of federal agents in university housing. \u201cThe university is obligated to comply with the law,\u201d she wrote, omitting any mention of Khalil or his case. One statement denied rumors circulating among students and faculty that Columbia\u2019s leadership had requested the immigration officers. \u201cThe school has sent out Orwellian emails about wellness resources; this doesn\u2019t feel like a problem that\u2019s going to be solved by expanding counseling and gym hours,\u201d says Nara Milanich, a professor of Latin American history at Columbia\u2019s affiliate school, Barnard College. \u201cThere is a desire from everyone for the administration to do something less anemic.\u201d Meanwhile, Jelani Cobb, dean of Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism, attempted to level with international students during a meeting. \u201cNobody can protect you,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cThese are dangerous times.\u201d\n\nArmstrong, who took office last summer, weighed concerns about academic freedom and safety against the $400 million in federal grants and contracts the Trump administration suspended earlier this month over what it said was the school\u2019s tolerance of antisemitism. On Friday, Armstrong and Columbia\u2019s board caved and agreed to meet a list of the government\u2019s demands, including a ban on nonmedical face coverings and appointing a senior vice-provost to oversee the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department. \u201cWe have worked hard to address the legitimate concerns raised both from within and without our Columbia community, including by our regulators, with respect to the discrimination, harassment, and antisemitic acts our Jewish community has faced in the wake of October 7, 2023,\u201d the university wrote in an unsigned memo, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf Columbia hadn\u2019t met the government\u2019s demands, some faculty worried Trump could have gone further, cutting off more than $400 million to make an already existential crisis exponentially worse. People familiar with Armstrong\u2019s thinking say she was trying to take a practical approach to secure funding while appeasing the Trump administration. The school\u2019s capitulation won\u2019t address activists\u2019 concerns, and it inflames those about academic freedom. \u201cThe university is bending over for the administration,\u201d says a Palestinian student who is worried about his immigration status. \u201cThere is a deep sense of betrayal students are feeling right now.\u201d Another international student wondered what would stop Trump from doing this again at Columbia next semester or at any other school the administration wants to target. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they putting up any fight?\u201d\n\nFearful as they may be, student activists are hardly shocked by Khalil\u2019s detention or the school\u2019s capitulation. Many are certain Khalil ended up on Trump\u2019s list because he was doxxed. Pro-Israel groups were naming pro-Palestinian students before October 7, 2023, but since then, groups like Betar, as well as Zionists with large social-media followings like Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School who was suspended for harassing and intimidating colleagues, have taken the practice to new heights. Student protesters made efforts to hide their identities, being careful not to draw undue attention to students who aren\u2019t U.S. citizens, and they were discreet with information. Ask a question like \u201cWho\u2019s in charge?\u201d at a demonstration, and campus activists tended to answer vaguely, recalling The Battle of Algiers. Many pro-Palestine protesters hid their faces behind masks or keffiyehs, a tactic that today would violate the terms of Columbia\u2019s bargain with Trump. \u201cOnce your face is all over one of these doxxing pages, the university gets external pressure to punish you, and they seem extremely willing to respond to that pressure,\u201d says Marie Adele Grosso, a Barnard junior who is currently on probation after participating in a sit-in.\n\nOver the past 16 months, Khalil didn\u2019t hide his own identity at rallies and protests. He was aware of the risk, acknowledging at a press conference last spring that he had avoided arrest, fearing it might jeopardize the student visa he had at the time. Still, he made efforts to protect himself and his fellow students. In January, he sent an email to Columbia administrators telling them students were \u201cfacing severe and pervasive doxxing, discriminatory harassment, and very possibly deportation in retaliation for the lawful exercising of their rights to freedom of speech, expression, and association.\u201d But things only got worse: A few weeks later, Davidai called Khalil a \u201cterror supporter\u201d on X, then tagged Secretary of State Marco Rubio in another post, which suggested Rubio should deport Khalil. It was all getting to Khalil, who shared his fears with a Palestinian American student who was also facing mounting threats; pro-Israel activists had recently tried to get her father fired from his job. The day before his arrest, Khalil followed up with a more personal appeal to the administration: \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home.\u201d\n\nKhalil\u2019s first public statement after his arrest echoed those of his friends and fellow activists in New York. \u201cColumbia targeted me for my activism,\u201d Khalil wrote in a letter from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana. \u201cWhile I await legal decisions that hold the futures of my wife and child in the balance, those who enabled my targeting remain comfortably at Columbia University.\u201d"

He has also used similar rescissions to crackdown on top law firms.\n\nFriday\u2019s memo formalized the revocation of Biden\u2019s security clearance, along with several others who the Trump administration has previously said it removed clearances from, and went on to block the former president\u2019s family\u2019s access to classified information \u2013 assuming they had any.\n\nIn addition to his Democratic rivals in the 2016 and 2024 election, Trump also revoked clearances from the two Republicans on the House committee that investigated his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.\n\nEarlier this month Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that in accordance with a directive from Trump, she had revoked the security clearances of a number of the people named in Friday\u2019s memo, including top Biden officials, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as two of the attorneys who brought legal cases against Trump: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nIn another late-night memo on Friday, Trump revisited past grudges against lawyers who have opposed him and vowed to punish lawyers and law firms by rescinding security clearances and canceling federal contracts they hold.\n\nHe directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the conduct of lawyers and law firms the administration considers to have filed frivolous lawsuits against the Trump administration or attempted to block immigration initiatives, broadening the president\u2019s crackdown on the US legal community in the United States.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Clay Voytek and Evan Perez contributed to this report."

Trump\u2019s Executive Order.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s transgender sports order, which he signed last month, prohibits trans women and girls from participating in female sports and states that the federal government will rescind funds from educational programs that don\u2019t comply. The order, which refers to trans women as men, says that having trans women in female sports \u201cis demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.\u201d\n\nThe USDA temporarily paused UMS\u2019 funding, the system said in a news release on March 11. In an email, the USDA\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer said it was evaluating \u201cif it should take any follow-on actions related to prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,\u201d according to the release.\n\n\u201cUSDA is committed to upholding the President\u2019s executive order, meaning any institution that chooses to disregard it can count on losing future funding,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said last month, according to a news release.\n\nSamantha Warren, UMS\u2019 chief external and governmental affairs officer, said Maine\u2019s public universities have always been compliant with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, and the system \u201cremained compliant when the NCAA updated its rules in February.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the NCAA adopted a sport-by-sport approach for transgender athletes, deferring to policies set by each sport\u2019s national governing body, subject to review and recommendation by an NCAA committee. Last month, following Trump\u2019s executive order, the college sports association updated its policy to limit \u201ccompetition in women\u2019s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (March 24, 2025, 9:10 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated which Maine institution was found to be in violation of Title IX. It was the Maine Department of Education, not the University of Maine System."

We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"\n\nSpace station commander Nick Hague, center, flanked by Starliner commander Butch Wilmore (left) and pilot Sunita Williams (right) during an orbital news conference Tuesday. NASA\n\nWilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.\n\n\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.\n\nThe Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.\n\nIn mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.\n\nTo minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nThe Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.\n\nThe four Crew 9 fliers inside the Crew Dragon that will carry them back to Earth around March 19. Left to right: Starliner pilot Sunita Williams, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, commander Nick Hague and Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore. NASA\n\nOn Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"\n\n\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nHours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"\n\nMusk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"\n\nWilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.\n\n\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"\n\n\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"\n\nNASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"\n\nWhen asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"\n\nWilliams said he disagreed.\n\n\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"\n\nGiven that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"\n\nIf all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.\n\nOnce on board, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help their replacements settle in before undocking and returning to Earth around March 19."

            "full_content": "U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan delivered the Democratic response to President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night.\n\nIn remarks delivered from Wyandotte, Michigan (about 15 miles south of Detroit), Slotkin criticized Mr. Trump's economic plans.\n\n\"President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America,\" Slotkin said. \"And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life.\"\n\nSlotkin said she would keep her response short, delivering a 10-minute remark after Mr. Trump wrapped his speech, the longest of its kind in decades.\n\nWhat to know about Sen. Elissa Slotkin\n\nSlotkin, 48, was a former CIA officer who worked in national security roles in the Pentagon and both the Bush and Obama administrations and has touted her work across the aisle as a moderate Democrat. During her time as an officer, she served three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military.\n\nIn the Obama administration, Slotkin briefed the former president on some of the most sensitive national security issues before she was nominated to serve as the assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at the Pentagon, according to her bio on the Senate website.\n\nSlotkin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018 and was reelected in 2020 and 2022. She was mostly known for pledging on the campaign trail to bring her bipartisan approach to the upper chamber. Slotkin said her bipartisan approach comes mostly from living in a household where her father was a Republican and her mother was a Democrat.\n\n\"I believe in bipartisan legislation. It's always better when it's bipartisan,\" Slotkin told CBS News Detroit in a one-on-one interview in October 2024.\n\n\"The idea that I would just be so partisan that I couldn't have Thanksgiving dinner with my dad just doesn't work for me. National security, we're just not trained that way,\" she added.\n\nWithin months of longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow announcing that she would not seek reelection, Slotkin announced her bid shortly for the seat, becoming the first Democratic candidate to enter the race. In the August 2024 primary, Slotkin held a strong lead against actor Hill Harper before taking on Republican Mike Rogers in the general election.\n\nThe Slotkin-Rogers race became one of the most watched because Michigan had not elected a Republican in over three decades. Slotkin narrowly beat Rogers in November, resealing the Democratic control over the two U.S. Senate seats.\n\nShe received four committee assignments in the Senate: Armed Services, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Agriculture, and Veterans. She was one of four Democrats to win a U.S. Senate race in a state where Mr. Trump won.\n\nPrior to the 2024 election, Slotkin told CBS News Detroit that she was focused on the military and economic threat, particularly from China.\n\n\"I think it's a different type of threat, but because we depend on them, we have a globalized economy; but whether it's their military advantages that they have in some cases or it's the way they have just dominated our supply chains and have a veto on our economic security, to me, it's really important, on a bipartisan basis, for us to come up with thoughtful plans on how to make sure we're prepared militarily if we need it, but also that we take a real serious approach to China investing in things like our farmland, our manufacturing facilities,\" Slotkin said."

Tammy Baldwin; and one is a swing voter who supported Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden before switching to Trump.\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n1. Jeff Scrima, the 47-year-old former mayor of Waukesha who now works in real estate, told NBC News he\u2019s \u201cfeeling very good\u201d because after years of watching politicians fall short on their promises, \u201cTrump is already doing what he said he\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country is in trouble if we don\u2019t change things, at least from a financial standpoint. We\u2019re going to go bankrupt. So I think that Trump and the administration understand the urgency, and they\u2019re taking the necessary steps to sort of right the ship,\u201d he said.\n\n2. Chip Schneider, 53, ultimately cast his ballot for Trump because he thought he had a clearer plan of action. Six weeks in, he told NBC News he feels \u201cgreat and cautious.\u201d He said that Trump is \u201cdelivering what he said,\u201d but warned he still has concerns, tariffs chief among them.\n\nWhile he added that he\u2019s \u201cwilling to suffer a little bit of pain to even out the score\u201d by punishing other countries with reciprocal tariffs, and that he thinks it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to judge\u201d whether Trump will be able to lower prices, \u201ca year is a fair amount of time to start seeing a bend in the curve.\u201d\n\nWhile Scrima loved the speed at which Trump is enacting his agenda, Schneider said he wants the president to \u201cslow down to really dig into it deeper.\u201d And while he\u2019s supportive of Trump\u2019s efforts to deport violent criminals in the country illegally, he wants to find a way to help \u201chard-working\u201d undocumented immigrants find a pathway to citizenship.\n\n3. Zack Lindsay, a 28-year-old who voted for Democrats in 2016 and 2020, showed slightly more skepticism. He praised Trump\u2019s recent executive order banning transgender athletes from participating in women\u2019s sports and said the world feels more stable under Trump than it would have been under Biden or Harris.\n\nBut he questioned the decision to slap tariffs on Canada. Lindsay said he thought that Trump\u2019s threats were mostly bluster aimed at securing a better deal for the U.S. and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really think he would go through with it.\u201d He also criticized the \u201cblow up in the Oval Office\u201d during Trump\u2019s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which he felt should have been handled behind closed doors.\n\nEven still, he shared Schneider\u2019s belief that it\u2019s too early to judge Trump on key issues, including on prices.\n\n\u201cThings don\u2019t necessarily change in a day. I\u2019d say a year to two years, and then I\u2019ll have a rough assessment of how I really think,\u201d he said, adding that his perception of Biden started to shift one year into his term.\n\nRead more: Polls show Americans are split on Trump ahead of his address to Congress, by Bridget Bowman and Ben Kamisar\n\nTrump's speech will provide an opportunity to reassure his coalition\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress tonight is an opportunity for the president to persuade the voters who elected him that they are getting the kind of change they demanded last November.\n\nTrump\u2019s winning coalition was strikingly blue-collar compared to previous Republican presidential campaigns \u2014 less affluent, more racially and ethnically diverse, and overwhelmingly made up of voters without four-year college degrees. Many of his backers were first-time voters, while others hadn\u2019t previously voted Republican. Overall, it was a coalition that prioritized strong leadership in a host of areas, with one towering above all others: the economy.\n\nHere the contrast between Trump\u2019s voters and Kamala Harris\u2019 voters was stark. On the basic question of the state of the economy, there was virtual unanimity among Trump supporters, according to exit polls: Ninety-five percent of them rated it as fair or poor, while a clear majority of Harris backers (59%) said it was in good or excellent shape.\n\nThese clashing assessments explained why each coalition\u2019s sense of priorities differed widely.\n\nFor that matter, 77% of Trump voters last November said that their own economic situation had worsened over the previous four years, while only 16% of Harris voters said the same. And 90% of Trump voters called inflation a hardship for the families, compared to 60% on the Harris side. In Trump, his voters saw a forceful leader and agent of change.\n\nThe first six weeks of Trump\u2019s second presidency have certainly been eventful. In his characteristically blunt style, the president has initiated action on multiple fronts. He has also, in characteristic fashion, drawn loud criticism and opposition.\n\nEspecially when it comes to the new voters Trump attracted last year, it\u2019s fair to wonder how they are perceiving all of this. Trump\u2019s challenge tonight is to reassure them that what they are witnessing isn\u2019t unfettered chaos but is instead the unavoidable noise that comes from necessary change.\n\nPOLL: How long will Trump\u2019s speech be?\n\nHistorically speaking, Trump has a penchant for delivering long joint addresses to Congress and State of the Union speeches. According to the University of California-Santa Barbara\u2019s American Presidency Project, the average of Trump\u2019s four speeches during his first term was about 80 minutes. That compares to 67 minutes for Joe Biden, 63 minutes for Barack Obama and 53 minutes for George W. Bush.\n\nBill Clinton was closest to Trump, averaging about 75 minutes during his presidency. But Clinton also holds the record for the longest joint address/State of the Union, going for nearly 89 minutes in 2000. Dating back to 1964, Richard Nixon gave the shortest speeches of this variety, with an average of roughly 35 minutes.\n\nSo, how long do you think Trump will speak for tonight? Vote in our poll:\n\nTrump follows through on tariffs threat, risking higher prices \u2014 and a trade war\n\nPresident Donald Trump has moved forward with a plan to put sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico, threatening a trade war with its closest trading partners \u2014 and higher prices for Americans on thousands of consumer goods, Shannon Pettypiece reports.\n\nThe U.S. was scheduled to begin collecting a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, according to a draft public notice of the rules posted Monday. Canadian energy products would be levied at a lower rate of 10%.\n\nOn Monday, Trump also added an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China on top of the 10% tariff he put on Chinese goods last month.\n\nSwift responses: As Jennifer Jett and Peter Guo report, China will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her country would enact countermeasures Sunday in response to the U.S. tariffs, adding that they would include both \u201ctariff and nontariff measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally, and we don\u2019t want to see you hurt either, but your government has chosen to do this to you,\u201d Trudeau said during a press conference Tuesday in remarks directed at the American people.\n\nThen, pivoting to speaking directly to Trump, Trudeau said: \u201cEven though you\u2019re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\u201d\n\nAn off-ramp? Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an appearance on Fox Business that an interim agreement with Canada and Mexico could come as soon as tomorrow that would allow their tariffs to be rolled back to some degree.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to figure out you do more, and I\u2019ll meet you in the middle some way, and we\u2019re going to probably be announcing that tomorrow,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cSo somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome the president moving with the Canadians and Mexicans, but not all the way.\u201d\n\nMore on the tariffs:\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Trump-Zelenskyy fallout: The Trump administration last night paused military aid to Ukraine after last week\u2019s Oval Office clash.

Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s long-awaited tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect Tuesday after he made clear that, unlike last month, there would be no last-minute reprieve. The 25 percent tax on imports from two of America\u2019s top trading partners has plunged the country into a trade war, and unchartered economic territory.\n\nAs Trum prepares to address the nation Tuesday night in his first joint address to Congress this term, it\u2019s unclear how long the tariffs will remain in effect. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled in an interview on Tuesday that the president is potentially close to a resolution that could be announced as soon as tomorrow.\n\n\u201cBoth the Mexicans and the Canadians were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they\u2019ll do better and the president is listening because you know he\u2019s very very fair and very reasonable,\u201d he said, in a sentiment that Trump\u2019s trading partners probably wouldn\u2019t agree with. \u201cSo I think he\u2019s gonna work something out with them.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average had already dropped by 650 points at the end of Monday, and markets continued to fall on Tuesday as the tariffs went into effect, wiping out all of Wall Street\u2019s post-election gains. The Dow ended up down 670 points by the end of the day.\n\nThe fallout from American allies was also swift.\n\nMexican president Claudia Sheinbaum denounced Trump\u2019s actions during a press conference, indicating that her government is prepared to retaliate. She said that she has a call with Trump scheduled for Thursday and will announce how exactly Mexico will respond during a public event on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason, rationale, or justification to support this decision that will affect our people and nations,\u201d she said per Reuters.\n\nCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said that his government has already levied retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. \u201cCanada will be implementing 25 percent tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods. Starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion of American products in 21 days\u2019 time,\u201d he said.\n\nIn strong remarks, Trudeau suggested that the tariffs were intended to harm Canada financially and that they stem from Trump\u2019s repeated aims to annex Canada and make it the 51st state:\n\nTrudeau: \"I heard he talked about banking again this morning in a tweet, which doesn't make any sense because 16 banks are currently active in Canada holding about $113b worth of assets in this country, so American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9Sexw914j1 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 4, 2025\n\nTrudeau also made a direct plea to the American people, framing Canada\u2019s move as an unavoidable consequence of their government\u2019s actions. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally. And we don\u2019t want to see you hurt either, but your government has chosen to do this to you,\u201d he said.\n\nTrudeau: I want to speak first directly to the American people\u2026 your government has chosen to do this to you. Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk. They have chosen to raise costs for American consumers on everyday essential items\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WQWpBVQxG4 \u2014 Acyn (@Acyn) March 4, 2025\n\nTrump called out Trudeau following his announcement, writing on social media, \u201cPlease explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\u201d\n\nRepublicans leaders appear mixed on Trump\u2019s tariffs. Senate majority leader John Thune signaled his hopes that the taxes will be quickly resolved. \u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019re a means to an end and not the end itself. I think they\u2019re hopefully temporary \u2014 designed to achieve a specific result,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, however, seemed willing to give the measure and the president the benefit of the doubt. \u201cThis is to continue good relationships and trade policies. I think this initiative will achieve that desired result,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAs the president said, just have a little patience with this. Let it play out, see how it develops, and I think at the end of the day America is going to be better off.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the new taxes on Canada and Mexico, Trump increased the current tariffs on China from 10 percent to 20 percent. This sparked a response from China, which levied tariffs of up to 15 percent on U.S. agricultural products including wheat, soybeans, and meat per the New York Times."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemocrats are rejecting House Republicans\u2019 plan to pass a stopgap spending bill through the end of September, raising the specter of a government shutdown in President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days and setting up a test of how far Democrats are willing to go to counter his administration.\n\nTop Democrats in the House and Senate are sharply opposed to Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s strategy for a six-month funding extension, insisting it would give even more leeway to Trump and Elon Musk to slash government programs. They also fear that agreeing to the GOP\u2019s lengthy extension could weaken some of the only leverage they have in a GOP-controlled Congress, and could potentially damage an argument in court cases challenging the White House\u2019s spending actions.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, called the GOP\u2019s plan for a one-year funding extension \u201ca non-starter\u201d and predicted Democrats would be \u201cunified in opposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in charge. And we\u2019ve tried to negotiate,\u201d DeLauro said, insisting it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s responsibility to fund the government since they control both chambers of Congress. \u201cElon Musk wants a shutdown. Why? Because then it\u2019s carte blanche \u2014 open parks, get rid of EPA, no research. It\u2019s carte blanche. He is for that.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders still believe that Democrats will ultimately fold in the face of a possible shutdown after the March 14 deadline and deliver the votes to help a funding bill reach Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nWith Republicans in control of Washington, Democrats are limited in what they can do, but Republicans will need their votes to pass a spending bill through Congress, creating an opportunity for the party locked out of power to make demands and potentially extract concessions.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have not yet communicated a plan to their members. Yet Democrats appear emboldened at a moment in which they have few other options to stand up to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink government, fire federal workers and shutter the work of agencies Congress already funded. And many Democrats argue that Republicans \u2013 not Democrats \u2013 would face public backlash for shutdown because they control the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks during a January 6 commemoration press conference on January 6, 2025, in Washington, DC. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThey run around telling everybody they have this great big mandate. Well, put on your mandate pants and pass what you want. If you want to work with us then they know what they have to do,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Juan Vargas said Democrats are in no mood to help bail out Republicans when they are focused on trying to fight against billionaire giveaways.\n\n\u201cThey want us to be part of that? Hell no. We\u2019d rather close down the government. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. Because they don\u2019t want to compromise,\u201d Vargas said.\n\nIf Democrats remain dug in, Johnson would need to deliver the votes for his so-called clean continuing resolution with Republican support alone. But with a small majority \u2014 and two Republicans, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Tony Gonzales of Texas, already opposed \u2013 Johnson may fall short of the votes he needs to execute on that plan, too.\n\nDemocrats say their preference is to force Johnson into a shorter-term spending bill that would allow appropriators to finish full-year spending bills and could give them more leverage to ensure Congress \u2013 not the administration \u2013 has power to dictate how federal funds are used.\n\n\u201cWe are in a position to enact an appropriations bill and we need a little more time so why wouldn\u2019t we buy ourselves a little more time. There actually is no need for this brinkmanship,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democratic appropriator from Hawaii, said.\n\nPrivately, House GOP leaders acknowledge it will be difficult to pass the plan without Democratic votes and are leaning hard on their conservatives \u2014 with help from the White House \u2014 to back it. Trump\u2019s budget director, Russ Vought, made the case behind the scenes to Freedom Caucus members on Monday night, arguing that the government needs to stay open for the work of DOGE to continue, according to a person in the room.\n\nThe next morning, Rep. Andy Harris, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told CNN that he would support it \u201cbecause the president wants it.\u201d And a group of House conservatives are planning to meet with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe GOP plan would essentially put government spending on autopilot for the next six months, alongside some small adjustments or \u201canomalies,\u201d such as funding for certain military projects. But Democratic leaders say they would reject that extension because it doesn\u2019t carry the usual legal constraints that come with bipartisan, negotiated packages \u2014 such as requiring the White House to abide by Congress\u2019s funding wishes, according to multiple people familiar with those high-level discussions.\n\nAnd if the White House chooses not to fund certain agencies or programs, Democrats insist they will have a weaker legal argument to challenge that in court.\n\nDemocratic leadership circulated a memo outlining the argument against a full-year stopgap over the weekend. The seven-page memo drafted by Sen. Patty Murray, which was obtained by CNN, labeled Trump\u2019s plan as a \u201cpower grab\u201d that would allow Trump and Russ Vought to turn off cash for blue states for \u201cwhatever vindictive or punitive reason they think up\u201d while giving them authority over \u201clarge slush funds\u201d for any new money.\n\n\u201cCongress should not pass a full-year CR that would cede immense discretion and authority to President Trump, Elon Musk, and Russ Vought to zero out programs and redirect funding as they see fit,\u201d the memo states.\n\nRepublicans, though, are making clear that they are not adding what they view as \u201cpoison pill\u201d language to attempt to win Democratic votes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to write a CR that\u2019s non-objectionable to every quarter as we can make it, whether you\u2019re in the Freedom Caucus or in the Democratic caucus. We\u2019re not trying to put 40 pills in, trying to hide anything. We\u2019re not trying to fool you. I don\u2019t want to give you an excuse to vote no,\u201d House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole told reporters, adding that it would include no new language on DOGE.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not putting any DOGE cuts in the CR,\u201d the Oklahoma Democrat said.\n\nNegotiators still have more than 10 days to find a path ahead but senior Democrats are warning that the full-year stopgap would not be acceptable even if it doesn\u2019t include cuts that would enshrine DOGE, as Johnson previously floated.\n\nDemocrats have been cautious in their messaging around the upcoming deadline, with top lawmakers stressing that Republicans are the ones in charge of Washington. But behind the scenes, many Democrats are insisting that they are not afraid of political ramifications and believe voters will blame Trump and the GOP for any fallout.\n\nThe memo is a key signal that Democrats are preparing their members to dig in on the fight, though it remains unclear whether a handful of Democratic senators would join Republicans to avert a shutdown.\n\nThere are other signs around the Capitol that a government funding clash is coming: Some House offices have made temporary changes to their payroll to ensure that staff can be paid in advance in case of a shutdown, and one group of congressional staffers saw a pre-planned trip canceled for the weekend of March 15.\n\nCNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi, Annie Grayer and Manu Raju contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Elizabeth Oyer\u2019s job as the U.S. pardon attorney is to run the process by which people apply for and receive clemency. A onetime federal public defender from Maryland, she is a nonpartisan advocate for second chances.\n\nThat\u2019s why two statements from her in the past month carried so much meaning.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nOne came after President Donald Trump appointed former federal inmate Alice Marie Johnson \u2014 who was once serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime \u2014 as his new \u201cpardon czar\u201d late last month. Oyer applauded the move.\n\n\u201cAlice is an inspiring and effective advocate, a wonderful and genuine person, and living proof that second chances make us safer and stronger,\u201d she wrote in a post on her LinkedIn page of Johnson, whose prison term Trump commuted in 2018 before pardoning her in 2020.\n\nBut just over a month ago, Oyer sent a much different communication. In an email to U.S. attorneys across the country, she conveyed deep frustration after then-President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 2,500 drug offenders, which he said was necessary in a justice system that disproportionately punishes Black and other minority offenders for nonviolent crimes.\n\n\u201cWhile I am a strong believer in the possibility of second chances through clemency, the process by which yesterday\u2019s action was carried out was not what we had hoped and advocated for,\u201d Oyer said in the Jan. 18 email, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cI understand that some of the clemency grants are very upsetting,\u201d the letter stated, according to the Journal.\n\nThe comments from Oyer, who was appointed by Biden in 2022, were some of the most notable in a series of criticisms from victims, prosecutors and even other Democrats about Biden\u2019s pardon process in his waning hours in office \u2014 with one U.S. senator going so far as to say the episode merited an overhaul of the federal pardon process.\n\n\u201cI am proposing that we actually impose some guardrails on the president of the United States, requiring an explanation, at the very least, some explanation for why pardon has been accorded, and some notice to the prosecutors,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told a Connecticut NBC station.\n\nDays after Biden\u2019s clemency announcement, President Donald Trump enacted his own politically motivated action. On the day he took office, Trump pardoned rioters involved in the attack on the U.S Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe ability to pardon someone is one of the few areas where the president\u2019s power is completely unchecked. There\u2019s no constitutional mandate for a president to go through a certain process, and they\u2019re free to pardon any person \u2014 no matter the crime or whether it could put a potentially dangerous person back on the street.\n\nThere have been plenty of calls to abolish the pardon power over the years, and presidents of both parties have used it to grant relief for friends, family members and donors.\n\nThe back-to-back presidential clemencies by Biden and Trump leaned on politics, drawing intensive scrutiny of the process and its potential for abuse.\n\nWhile Biden hailed his extensive clemency as \u201can important step toward righting historic wrongs\u201d and boasted that he had issued \u201cmore individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history,\u201d he only further inflamed some Justice Department officials, who were already angered over Biden\u2019s characterization of the agency as infected with \u201craw politics\u201d when he pardoned his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThey then saw Biden\u2019s mass clemency as both rushed and careless, according to two people with knowledge of the events.\n\nAs part of that move, only 10% of those granted clemency were Justice Department recommendations, according to one of the sources. Those who are recommended tend to already have been vetted to be sure that underlying violent conduct is not missed. There are some 6,100 people with active applications seeking shortened sentences or full pardons.\n\nAmong those who benefited from Biden\u2019s action \u2014 drawing outrage \u2014 was an inmate named Adrian Peeler who was convicted in the 1999 murder of an 8-year-old boy and his mother. Peeler, 48, had served his sentence for the murder but faced more prison time for dealing crack cocaine. He was not due to be released from a West Virginia prison until 2033.\n\nAnother was Lairon Graham, convicted of sex trafficking and trafficking fentanyl.\n\nAt the time of Graham\u2019s 2023 plea deal, Trini E. Ross, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, described Graham\u2019s crimes in stark terms.\n\n\u201cThis defendant not only sold dangerous and illegal drugs in our community, he used the addiction of vulnerable women to prey upon them and force them to commit sex acts for his financial benefit,\u201d Ross said in a statement. \u201cWe as a society cannot, and will not, tolerate this type of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s action means Graham\u2019s sentence was reduced from 22 years to 12\u00bd years.\n\nDanielle Sassoon, who resigned as the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York after the Trump administration pressured her to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, also sharply criticized Biden\u2019s commutations. In a Feb 2. op-ed in The Wall Street Journal (before her resignation), she said it was \u201cdisheartening to see some of the most dangerous offenders released on the readily disprovable misconception that they are nonviolent.\u201d\n\nThe frustration of many at the Justice Department was knowing that they have a backlog of thousands of requests for clemency \u2014 many of which officials saw as sympathetic \u2014 and watching Biden turned to his own agenda late in the game, according to one person familiar with the process, with Biden not making unfairly imposed lengthy prison terms a clemency priority until the 11th hour.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly rushed,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt was done with very little consultation with the pardon attorney\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nFurther frustrating Justice Department officials were the pardons handed out to members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, other members and aides of the House Jan. 6 committee, and Capitol and Washington Metropolitan police officers who testified before it. Biden timed the public announcement of those pardons for his last day in office \u2014 before one final strike: pre-emptive pardons for his family members, according to the person with knowledge of the process.\n\nA Biden spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAfter the Biden moves, Trump compounded frustrations in the Justice Department by pardoning all Jan. 6 Capitol rioters, even after his own vice president had said that those convicted of assault on police officers \u201cobviously\u201d shouldn\u2019t be pardoned. The department is now facing mounting challenges of another kind under Trump, including the demotion of prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 prosecutions who have been demoted to entry-level positions by Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia whom Trump appointed to lead the office on a permanent basis.\n\nJudges have made clear their displeasure at both the Trump and Biden pardons.\n\n\u201cNo \u2018process of national reconciliation\u2019 can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity,\u201d Judge Beryl Howell, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said in January.\n\nJudge Gary Brown, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, said that some of the Biden commutations \u201cspotlight the problems that invariably arise when a president\u2019s unreviewable pardon authority is deployed impetuously, resulting in careless execution of the president\u2019s directives. In this matter \u2014 involving sex trafficking, narcotics distribution and perjury \u2014 the grant of executive clemency seems inconsistent with its purported rational.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Johnson laid out what some of her newly created position entails, including looking for appropriate candidates for clemency. She stressed she would follow-up with those released from prison to be sure they receive appropriate support.\n\nZ\u00f6e Towns, executive director of FWD.us, an organization that advocates for criminal justice reform, said she applauds the moves made by the Biden administration, but in general, clemency should be a daily part of governing \u2014 not a last-minute action.\n\n\u201cThis should not be something we wait until the last gasps of any gubernatorial or presidential administration,\u201d Towns said. \u201cPeople should have a lot of chances to have their sentences re-examined, whether that\u2019s through parole boards that are meeting or judges that are doing second look sentencing reviews, and also clemency.\u201d\n\nTowns added support to Johnson becoming pardon czar, calling it \u201cextremely encouraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that somebody with her experience is in the role, and it\u2019s also really great that it\u2019s a role that has been created this early in a presidential term, and we\u2019re hopeful that it can mean really good things to come,\u201d Towns said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s case first came to Trump\u2019s attention after reality TV star Kim Kardashian championed her as a candidate for clemency based on Johnson\u2019s exorbitant non-violent drug sentence.\n\nJohnson was in federal prison for more than 21 years after she was convicted in connection to a drug trafficking conspiracy. In 2018, she told MSNBC she did not dispute her conviction, only the length of her sentence.\n\n\u201cI believe that I deserved some time, I really do. But I also believe that that time should be just and fair based on the crime. You can\u2019t tell me that a non-violent, first-time offender should have been given a life without parole sentence,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cDo you really think I deserved the same prison time as the Unabomber? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tapping of Johnson has drawn scorn from critics who accuse him of putting on a kind public face, even as he says drug dealers deserve the death penalty \u2014 something he repeated one day after he announced Johnson\u2019s appointment.\n\nLast month, at a Black History Month reception in the East Room of the White House, Trump praised Johnson and said he was empowering her to take a hands-on role.\n\n\u201cAlice, you\u2019ve been an inspiration to people, and we\u2019re going to be listening to your recommendation on pardons,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find people just like you \u2026 It should not have happened. So you\u2019re going to look and you\u2019re going to make recommendations, and I\u2019ll follow those recommendations, OK?\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix\n\nMeghan Markle dropped a new Netflix lifestyle show on Tuesday. The eight-episode series is primarily about the Duchess of Sussex claiming she\u2019s a relatable working mom while carefully slicing raspberries in half and arranging a rainbow-shaped fruit plate for her children. But there\u2019s a surprising secondary theme: dizzying name changes.\n\nThe drama started on February 18, when Meghan announced she was changing the name of her yet-to-be-launched business venture from American Riviera Orchard to As Ever. Although the Duchess wrote on Instagram, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to introduce you to As Ever,\u201d it appears she then tweaked the name again: The brand name is styled As ever (lowercase e) on the new website, which features a variety of fruit preserves, teas, and \u201cflower sprinkles\u201d that you can\u2019t actually purchase yet.\n\nNow Meghan has revealed that she, too, has a new(ish) moniker: the last name Sussex. This information is unveiled in a passive-aggressive exchange with Mindy Kaling during episode two of With Love, Meghan (just to add to the confusion, the Netflix show about the As Ever founder is named after a different sign-off phrase.)\n\nAs Meghan is explaining that she grew up as an average American \u201clatchkey\u201d kid who ate a lot of fast food, she informs Kaling that she\u2019s addressing her incorrectly.\n\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t think anyone in the world knows that Meghan Markle has eaten Jack in the Box and loves it,\u201d Kaling quips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny, too, that you keep saying \u2018Meghan Markle.\u2019 You know I\u2019m Sussex now,\u201d the Duchess replies in a tone that suggests she\u2019s not actually amused.\n\nThere\u2019s an awkward pause, then Meghan continues: \u201cYou have kids, and you go, \u2018Now I share my name with my children.\u2019 And that feels so \u2014 I didn\u2019t know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go, \u2018This is our family name, our little family name.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now I know, and I love it,\u201d Kaling says.\n\nOh yes , you are meghan MARKLE!!! Sussex is a county about which you have no idea!! Shameless creature!!! \ud83e\udd75pic.twitter.com/IHRKyOoH8Z \u2014 Suzie (@wuikle) March 4, 2025\n\nMeghan also talked about her fondness for Sussex in this week\u2019s People cover story:\n\nMeghan says the Sussex name \u2014 bestowed upon her and Harry by Queen Elizabeth on their 2018 wedding day \u2014 holds a deeper significance than she could have imagined before motherhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our shared name as a family, and I guess I hadn\u2019t recognized how meaningful that would be to me until we had children,\u201d she says. \u201cI love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H and I all have together. It means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nThe Sussex name, she adds, \u201cis part of our love story.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Duchess would rather not be referred to by her maiden name. (Catherine, the Princess of Wales, has been trying to get people to stop calling her Kate Middleton since 2011, to no avail.) But the fact that she is Meghan Sussex is, in fact, not well known.\n\nThere\u2019s generally a lot of confusion about royal surnames. The British royal family\u2019s official website has a whole page explaining how they\u2019ve changed over the past century. \u201cMembers of the Royal Family can be known both by the name of the Royal house, and by a surname, which are not always the same,\u201d it says. \u201cAnd often they do not use a surname at all.\u201d\n\nKing Charles\u2019s five grandchildren have always used different surnames. Prince William\u2019s three children go by Wales, the same surname he and Prince Harry used at school and in the military. But Harry and Meghan\u2019s children were originally Mountbatten-Windsor, and at some point, the whole family adopted Sussex as a surname, as People reported last month:\n\nWhile their 4-year-old son, Prince Archie, and 2-year-old daughter, Princess Lilibet, were previously known as \u201cMaster Archie Mountbatten-Windsor\u201d and \u201cMiss Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor,\u201d the children were afforded the titles of prince and princess when their grandfather King Charles became monarch in Sept. 2022.\n\nMeghan, 42, and Prince Harry, 39, used their children\u2019s royal titles for the first time in March 2023 when they announced Lili\u2019s christening, and their names have been updated to \u201cPrince Archie of Sussex\u201d and \u201cPrincess Lilibet of Sussex\u201d on the royal family\u2019s official website.\n\nPEOPLE understands that Sussex is their family surname.\n\nIf you can\u2019t keep all of this straight, don\u2019t feel bad; Meghan Sussex may be a bit confused too. The closing credits of With Love, Meghan list the royal as \u201cMeghan, Duchess of Sussex\u201d rather than \u201cMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex.\u201d Dropping \u201cthe\u201d is incorrect, according to GB News: \u201cTraditionally, the royal style difference is used by divorced members of the Royal Family after they lose the title.\u201d"

Habba defended the cuts and said she had no sympathy for the thousands of people who have lost their jobs.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t feel sorry for them,\u201d Habba said. \u201cThey should get back to work for the American people, like President Trump and this administration.\u201d\n\nA reporter then noted that some military veterans have been part of that group.\n\n\"That\u2019s something the president has always cared about \u2014 anybody in blue, anybody that serves this country. But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer dollars to pay people that actually work,\" she said.\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t mean that we forget our veterans by any means,\" she added. \"We are going to care for them in the right way, but perhaps they\u2019re not fit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work. And we can\u2019t, you know, I wouldn\u2019t take money from you and pay somebody and say, 'Sorry, you know, they\u2019re not going to come to work.' It\u2019s just not acceptable.\"\n\nHabba, who previously served as Trump's personal lawyer, said the president planned to highlight the cuts, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, in his speech Tuesday night.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs and VA Secretary Doug Collins didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWe\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers who have been laid off. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.\n\nHabba's remarks drew swift backlash from some veterans.\n\nEmily Erroa, an Army veteran who was fired from the Department of Energy last month alongside other employees who did not yet have full civil service protections, called Habba\u2019s statement \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\"The narrative that remote/teleworkers do not work is not accurate and insulting,\" Erroa, who had recently taken a job at the Energy Department after spending three years at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said. \"Especially when it comes to veterans that have [a] specific diagnosis due to fighting and serving the country.\"\n\nJesus Tony Ruiz, an Army veteran who was laid off from the VA last month, also criticized Habba's remarks.\n\n\"I lost my job in the VA thanks to Donald Trump,\" said Ruiz, who was invited to speak to lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday by the progressive group VoteVets. \"So what did I do for my country? I served my country, and now they fired me. So no, they\u2019re not helping me out whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAnother veteran, who requested anonymity because they still work in the federal government, called her remarks a \"slap in the face to those who have served, sacrificed and ... carry the scars both mental and physical from their service.\"\n\n\"Coming to work? It\u2019s not always as simple as showing up. Some days, I can\u2019t even stand up, and the pain is excruciating,\" this person said, adding, \"Does that make me unemployable in his [Trump's] eyes? Apparently so.\"\n\nAlina Habba, counselor to the president, questioned whether veterans who were fired from their federal jobs were \"fit\" to work. Jim Watson / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nThe Trump administration has fired thousands of federal workers over the last several weeks as part of the Elon Musk and DOGE-driven effort to find waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government and drastically cut federal funding across departments and agencies. The largest cuts were of probationary employees \u2014 people who were generally in their roles for less than two years, although some had much more experience in the federal government.\n\nThe heads of the White House budget and personnel offices informed federal agencies last week that they should start preparing for large-scale layoffs in the coming weeks and months.\n\nFormer workers, as well as a number of groups representing federal employees, have filed several lawsuits over the layoffs. A federal judge last week said that a memo from the Office of Personnel Management directing agencies to plan for mass layoffs was \"illegal.\" The ruling did not reinstate the fired employees, though.\n\nMilitary veterans work across the federal government and many work for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In February, the VA fired more than 2,400 employees, though it's unclear how many served in the military. On Monday, the VA terminated 585 \"non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts.\"\n\nA Navy veteran who works at the VA called Habba's comments \"insulting and demeaning.\"\n\n\u201cI work with approximately 50% veteran co-workers,\" the person said, adding, \"Without exception, I can tell you that, at least from my experience, veterans work exceptionally hard, presumably owing to the discipline and culture of the military.\""

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune expressed wariness Tuesday over some of President Donald Trump\u2019s recent policies, including new tariffs from the administration that threaten to raise the prices Americans pay for a wide array of goods.\n\nThune, who represents South Dakota \u2013 a state that relies heavily on trade with Canada, said while he thinks the president is attempting to secure \u201can outcome that addresses a concern that the American people have\u201d with his recently imposed tariffs on the country along with Mexico and China, the economic impacts are an issue.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an issue in my view. I mean, I think you have to think about the economic impacts through inflation,\u201d Thune told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash when pressed on whether the tariffs, and potential cost to every day Americans, are good policy.\n\n\u201cI think you have to look at growth in the economy and how that\u2019s impacted by all this. Those are, those are real issues. And so the administration is going to have to take, in my view, as they, as they evaluate some of these policy decisions the macro-economic impacts of these,\u201d he continued on \u201cInside Politics.\u201d\n\nThe comments from the top Senate Republican come ahead of the president\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term. Trump will deliver his \u201cThe Renewal of the American Dream\u201d-themed remarks just hours after the 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada took effect, causing a volatile morning on the markets and raising alarm among some red-state senators about the impact.\n\nBut the Republican leader did not go so far as to write off Trump\u2019s move entirely, saying, \u201cI think this is a president who has used that authority in ways that have gotten outcomes and results,\u201d and adding that he thinks \u201cthe markets, in time, will stabilize.\u201d\n\nStresses need for US leadership on world stage\n\nIn the wake of the administration\u2019s pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine following Trump\u2019s heated Oval Office argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, Thune cautioned against American isolationism and stressed the need for continued US leadership on the world stage.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want America to become isolationist,\u201d Thune told Bash. \u201cNow again, what form America\u2019s involvement and support takes is a matter of debate. And, you know, we can talk about whether soft power, hard power, what components that ultimately entails. But I think in the end, people look to us to be a leader, and we have to provide that leadership.\u201d\n\nCalling last week\u2019s heated Oval Office meeting \u201cunfortunate,\u201d Thune suggested the pause was \u201cdesigned to get the players to the table.\u201d\n\nThe Republican leader, who has historically supported Ukraine in its war against Russia, said the pause was the president\u2019s attempt to get European nations more engaged in providing security for the country, while acknowledging America\u2019s global leadership role.\n\n\u201cI think we have very extensively invested heavily in Ukraine. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s probably the political support for continued financial investment there, but if the European nations can step up and with American support in terms of training and intelligence sharing and all the things that we can provide and offer, we still have to be the deterrent to bad behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nWarns federal workers must be treated as \u2018real people\u2019\n\nDuring his remarks, the president is expected to point to Elon Musk\u2019s reshaping of the federal government as evidence of the administration\u2019s change in Washington.\n\nMusk, who has spearheaded the Trump administration\u2019s swift reduction of the federal workforce through his Department of Government Efficiency, is expected to be in the House chamber for the president\u2019s speech, a White House official told CNN.\n\nAsked about the appearance and how the world\u2019s richest man is \u201cgoing about business,\u201d Thune said: \u201cI think that he\u2019s kind of going about business as you would in a private business. And obviously there are nuances in dealing with the federal government that are probably different than what he\u2019s accustomed to in the private world.\u201d\n\nThune said he thought Musk was addressing some Americans\u2019 concern that the federal government is a \u201cbloated bureaucracy\u201d but, he told Bash, \u201chow they go about it matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are, any time you do this, it\u2019s, you know, you also have to pay attention to the aftermath of that and how it impacts people. I mean, these are real people. They need to be treated that way,\u201d he said of the impacted federal workers.\n\nThune said \u201cthe overall goals and objectives are the right ones. And I think he brings an eye to this that probably, you know, we you couldn\u2019t have gotten just by having, sort of the Congress or somebody else do it,\u201d but argued that \u201cprobably better-attuned\u201d Cabinet officials and agency heads will be in place to make decisions.\n\nCNN\u2019s Melissa DePalo contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nAs his 25% tariffs on imported Canadian products took effect on Tuesday, President Donald Trump repeated one of his many false claims about Canada \u2013 wrongly saying, again, that Canada prohibits US banks from operating there.\n\n\u201cCanada doesn\u2019t allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market. Oh, that seems fair to me, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Tuesday morning.\n\nCNN and others debunked Trump\u2019s claim a month ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing prohibiting American banks from operating here, including having retail branches,\u201d Cristie Ford, a professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s law school, said in an email in February.\n\nCanada tightly regulates the banking industry, and it requires various government approvals before a foreign-owned bank can open in the country. But US banks have been operating in Canada for well over a century; the Canadian Bankers Association, an industry group, said in a February statement that \u201cthere are 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches with around C$113 billion in assets currently operating in Canada\u201d and that \u201cU.S. banks now make up approximately half of all foreign bank assets in Canada.\u201d\n\nTyler Meredith, former head of economic and fiscal policy for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, noted on social media in February that Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, US Bank, JPMorgan, and Northern Trust are among the US banks with current Canadian operations. You can see the others here and here.\n\nMeredith said in an interview that \u201cwe take a very careful look at people who want to come into our banking sector, because we consider financial services to be a core asset to Canada and to the Canadian economy\u201d and try hard to avoid the \u201ccascading consequences\u201d the world has seen with bank failures in the US \u2013 \u201cbut there are existing American institutions, Chinese institutions, Japanese institutions, and European institutions\u201d that have permission to operate in Canada.\n\nUS banks can apply to launch a subsidiary in Canada, which is known as a \u201cSchedule II\u201d entity, or a \u201cbranch\u201d in Canada (not to be confused with a retail branch), which is known as a \u201cSchedule III\u201d entity.\n\nWhen a non-Canadian bank establishes a Canadian subsidiary, \u201cthat subsidiary will be subject to the same regulatory regime and capital requirements as a domestically owned and operated bank,\u201d said Bryce Tingle, a professor at the University of Calgary\u2019s law school, in a February email. \u201cIt will have exactly the same powers and market access as a Canadian bank.\u201d\n\nJeremy Kronick, director of the Centre on Financial and Monetary Policy at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Toronto, explained in a February email that there are downsides to the subsidiary option from the perspective of foreign banks: A subsidiary is \u201ca separate legal entity from their parent, thus requiring their own local capital and liquidity structures.\n\nFrom the foreign bank\u2019s perspective, this is obviously inefficient.\u201d\n\nMost US banks operating in Canada have chosen the \u201cbranch\u201d option that does not subject them to the requirements of a subsidiary. However, there is a different restriction on branches: They are not allowed to accept deposits lower than $150,000 CAD.\n\nThat, of course, means they can\u2019t conduct retail operations for average Canadian citizens \u2013 but they can engage in various profitable activities, for companies and wealthy individuals, that are less visible to the general public. The Canadian Bankers Association said the US banks in Canada \u201cspecialize in a range of financial services, including corporate and commercial lending, treasury services, credit card products, investment banking and mortgage financing.\u201d\n\nKronick said: \u201cBottom line: there are trade-offs to each option, but foreign banks certainly can operate in Canada. A case could probably be made that the restrictions on both options prevent full competition with Canadian banks, but not that \u2018Canada doesn\u2019t even allow US Banks to open or do business there\u2019 as Trump stated.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Charles Krupa/AP Photo\n\nLast month, the NHL\u2019s 4 Nations Face-Off tournament lent hockey the kind of jolt the sport has spent years searching for. The inaugural event\u2019s finals, which pitted the U.S. against Canada, garnered incredible ratings, with 10.4 million viewers tuning into ESPN at one point. That made it the highest-rated hockey game ever on ESPN and the biggest non-NFL event ever on ESPN+. I had multiple friends tell me it was the first hockey game they\u2019d watched in years.\n\nThis was the sort of cultural event that could only explode to such an extent because of outside forces, a narrative that was larger than the game itself. Those outside forces are not in short supply. The game took place amid the madness currently unfolding in the United States \u2014 specifically, President Trump\u2019s deranged rants about making Canada the U.S.\u2019s 51st state. Trump\u2019s comments are the sort of dead-brained slop that Americans have (foolishly or not) mostly stopped taking seriously, but which Canadians (quite understandably) have met with unmitigated fury and righteous national pride. That Trump called the U.S. hockey team before the game added fuel to the fire, but it also confirmed the driving story line of the game: Unlike at the Miracle on Ice 45 years ago, we were the bad guys this time. Canada was David; we were Goliath.\n\nDavid, a.k.a. the Canadians, triumphed. And while most American sports fans have since shifted their attention over to spring training and NFL free agency, Canadian fans are far from done using sports as a venue to express outrage at the U.S. Essentially every time the American national anthem plays at a Canadian venue, vigorous booing now follows. It happened in Montreal during the first 4 Nations matchup between the U.S. and Canada and at an MLS event in Vancouver over the weekend, and it happens at every Raptors game. During a Netflix WWE event in Toronto on Sunday night, it got so loud you could barely hear the song.\n\nCanadians loudly boo during the U.S. National Anthem at WWE in Toronto tonight to show their opposition to Donald Trump and his administration pic.twitter.com/QYUDku65cW \u2014 MeidasTouch (@MeidasTouch) March 2, 2025\n\nNow, soccer and hockey are one thing, but when the anthem gets booed at a rasslin\u2019 event, you can count on America\u2019s dumbest meatheads to get involved: \u201cKinda sucks that it\u2019s in the terrible country of Canada that booed our national anthem to start this entire thing!\u201d said ESPN\u2019s $85 million goon Pat McAfee. Unfortunately for him, the booing is unlikely to stop anytime soon. It will likely become a regular occurrence at Toronto Blue Jays games beginning in April, and it may well become the signature story line of the upcoming Stanley Cup playoffs. It turns out that when a powerful madman challenges his neighbor and oldest ally\u2019s sovereignty, that neighbor gets a little pissy about it.\n\nAnd in the wake of the horrifying disaster in the Oval Office last week, in which Trump and Vice-President J.D. Vance berated Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and made it clear (if it wasn\u2019t already) that America will be standing with Russia against Ukraine and no-longer-under-any-illusions European allies, I feel confident in saying that this is just the start.\n\nIf you were watching the 4 Nations Face-Off, you might have noticed the absence of one rather prominent hockey country. There are currently 66 Russian players in the NHL \u2014 more than Finland, for what it\u2019s worth \u2014 but they weren\u2019t a part of the event for the same reason Russia hasn\u2019t been a part of the last few Olympics: Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. (There were only 15 Russian Olympians in Paris, all listed as \u201cindividual neutral athletes.\u201d) The IOC is not totally on an island with this. While Russian and Belarusian athletes have been allowed to participate in international tennis tournaments since 2022 (except for one Wimbledon), they are forbidden from playing for their countries and officially compete under the banner of no nation.\n\nSo, uh, here\u2019s the thing: If the United States is supporting Russia against Ukraine \u2014 which it sure feels like it unequivocally is \u2014 and the United States is aggressively antagonizing its traditional allies both here in North America and in Europe, well \u2026 is it our turn?\n\nIt may not be an academic question. Just last month, the Trump administration began a pressure campaign aimed at forcing the IOC to stop allowing transgender athletes to compete at international competitions, which it has permitted since 2004. That is a battle, as anyone who watched the Paris Olympics and the nonsensical right-wing backlash to it knows, that is unlikely to fizzle out anytime soon. We are only two months into the new administration and, more to the point, we are now less than a year from the Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy. Do you think the United States is going to get more in the international community\u2019s good graces between now and then? After all, the IOC and ITF \u2014 and, really, any international athletic ruling body \u2014 is made up primarily of transatlantic allies; there aren\u2019t many people in charge of these sports from countries who didn\u2019t vote for the United Nations\u2019 resolution supporting Ukraine sovereignty last week. It\u2019s basically nations that are already banned from these organizations \u2014 and, now, us.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely anyone\u2019s going to be blacking out the American flag anytime soon; we are still (for now) the most powerful country in the world and remain the linchpin \u2014 and often founder of \u2014 key international organizations. Trump has also not (yet) invaded another country, and even if he did, nobody was banning the U.S. post\u2013Iraq War. But America\u2019s increasingly close association with a pariah country, combined with our relentless turn against historical allies, does come with an undeniable cost. It\u2019s not just boos and sour looks from locals when we\u2019re on vacation in Europe, either.\n\nTrump and his \u201cAmerica first\u201d crew won\u2019t care about sports-bureaucrat scolding. But over the next three years, the two largest sporting events on earth are coming to the United States: the World Cup next year, and the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. While it might seem extreme to imagine the United States so isolated from the rest of the world that countries might consider not sending their athletes or teams to those events, well, think about how far the United States has fallen in the world\u2019s estimation in just the first two months of Trump 2.0. Now imagine it a year from now, or a year and a half from now. If Russia were scheduled to host an Olympics right now \u2014 as it last did in 2014 in Sochi, which I attended, and which happened during Putin\u2019s invasion of Crimea \u2014 do you think countries would actually go? Now think about where we\u2019ll be this time next year, or 2026. Do you think Trump & Co. are going to work to rejoin the international community over the next 24 months? Or will they do the opposite? Even if boycotts aren\u2019t on the table, it\u2019s easy to imagine the World Cup and Olympics becoming political bargaining chips in all kinds of unseemly ways (a country could threaten to skip them unless Trump revokes tariffs, for instance). It\u2019s also not hard to imagine the U.S. welcoming Russia back onto the global sports stage, as surreal as that would be. And forget about the mega-events: Anytime an American sports team travels abroad the next three years, they will likely be cast as villains.\n\nThis is the thing about isolating ourselves, about recklessly tearing down international alliances that have existed for more than 100 years: The rest of the world is, in fact, watching. Eventually, we will have to cross paths with them, whether you want to or not. The United States is turning away from the world. The world, however begrudgingly, is starting to do the same to the United States. Are we ready to be the bad guys? Like, really the bad guys? One thing is for certain: Pat McAfee better start getting used to boos."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA majority of the Supreme Court appeared prepared Tuesday to shut down a lawsuit from the Mexican government alleging American gun manufacturers should be held responsible for cartel violence on the Southwest border.\n\nThe justices debated the high-profile case in their quiet, ornate courtroom as relations between Washington and Mexico City were fraying in real time. President Donald Trump allowed a 25% tariff on Mexican goods to take effect and the president of Mexico vowed to impose retaliatory duties within days.\n\nMexico sued Smith & Wesson and six other major US gun makers in 2021 for $10 billion in damages, alleging that the companies design and market their guns specifically to drug cartels that then use them in the \u201ckilling and maiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and ordinary citizens throughout Mexico.\u201d\n\nBut the Supreme Court \u2013 both conservatives and at least some of the liberal justices \u2013 peppered the lawyer for Mexico with questions indicating they were concerned with the prospects of allowing the lawsuit to go forward. And the broader diplomatic context was clearly on the mind of several members of the court.\n\n\u201cMexico says that US gun manufacturers are contributing to illegal conduct in Mexico,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, said at one point. \u201cThere are Americans who think that Mexican government officials are contributing to a lot of illegal conduct here.\u201d\n\nSuppose, Alito pondered, a US state decided to sue Mexico for what it viewed as aiding and abetting crime in the United States. Would Mexico, he asked, \u201cbe willing to litigate that case in the courts of the United States?\u201d\n\nPart of Mexico\u2019s argument is that American gunmakers are manufacturing and marketing guns that appeal to cartels and that they\u2019re selling them to distributors that are known to deal with organized crime.\n\nBut Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether Mexico had cleared the legal bar it needs to by pointing to products like the Super \u201cEl Jefe\u201d pistol.\n\n\u201cThose are all things that are not illegal in any way,\u201d said Roberts, a conservative. \u201cThere some people who want the experience of shooting a particular type of gun because they find it more enjoyable than using a bb gun.\u201d\n\nNot a Second Amendment fight\n\nThe case does not center on the Second Amendment, but gun-control and gun rights groups are nevertheless closely engaged in the fight.\n\n\u201cThe gun industry defendants are trying to use this case to rewrite the law and dramatically expand their immunity to include actions that break the law,\u201d David Pucino, legal director with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence told CNN. \u201cThe Supreme Court should reject that dangerous invitation to shut the courthouse door on victims of gun violence.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican government argues that between 70% and 90% of guns recovered at crime scenes in its country are made in the United States. There is only one gun store in all of Mexico, its lawyers said, and \u201cyet the nation is awash in guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is facing a choice: Hold the American gun industry accountable for fueling organized crime at the southern border or give American manufacturers near total immunity,\u201d Hudson Munoz, executive director of Guns Down America, told CNN.\n\nBut even some of the Supreme Court\u2019s liberals, who have tended to side with gun control groups in the past, said they were concerned about Mexico\u2019s position.\n\nWhat Mexico is asking for, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said, appeared to \u201camount to different kinds of regulatory constraints that I\u2019m thinking Congress didn\u2019t want the courts to be the ones to impose.\u201d\n\nNRA slams Mexico\u2019s suit\n\nGun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, say that the lawsuit is an effort to \u201cdestroy\u201d the American firearms industry by making it easier to sue for huge sums, despite a 2005 law meant to protect gun makers from an increasing number of lawsuits filed by Democratic governors and mayors nationwide.\n\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act generally shields gunmakers from liability for crimes committed with their products. An exception permits those suits when there\u2019s a close connection between the harm \u2013 in this case, the use of guns in Mexico \u2013 and the companies\u2019 actions.\n\n\u201cMexico has extinguished its constitutional arms right,\u201d the NRA told the Supreme Court in a brief. \u201cNow (it) seeks to extinguish America\u2019s.\u201d\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, picked up on that position during the arguments, questioning what would stop all sorts of lawsuits against companies that make products that wind up being used illegally.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a real concern, I think, for me about accepting your theory,\u201d he told the lawyer for Mexico.\n\nMexico also argues the gunmakers have resisted design changes to their products \u2013 such as making serial numbers harder to tamper with \u2013 that would make the guns less appealing to gangs because the weapons could more easily be traced.\n\nThe manufacturers, Mexico said in court documents, advertise the guns as \u201cmilitary-grade\u201d and design special-edition products like the Super \u201cEl Jefe\u201d pistol the country says are targeted for sale to gangs.\n\nA federal district court backed the gun makers, but the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals concluded Mexico\u2019s suit could go forward. The gun companies appealed to the Supreme Court in April.\n\nGuns, cartels and social media\n\nSome of the argument Tuesday focused on a decision it handed down just two years ago in a case dealing with the social media company now known as X.\n\nIn Twitter v. Taamneh, the family of a victim killed in a 2017 terrorist attack in Turkey tried to sue the social media giant for contributing to the attack because it hosted content helping ISIS recruit followers and raise money. In a unanimous decision, the court said the connection between the content at issue and the attack wasn\u2019t closely related enough to allow the family to sue.\n\nIt\u2019s a point the gun manufacturers are quick to highlight in their written arguments. The short version, according to the companies, is that they have no control over what people do with the guns they make.\n\n\u201cThis court has repeatedly held that it requires a direct connection between a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury,\u201d the gun manufacturers told the high court in their appeal. \u201cIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy.\u201d\n\nBut the appeals court ruling in favor of Mexico, which was also unanimous, said that the gunmakers\u2019 conduct may have been something more than what was alleged against X. All three appeals court judges who reviewed Mexico\u2019s case were appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\n\u201cThey are not mere passive observers of the buyer\u2019s illegal activity,\u201d the three-judge panel wrote, \u201cbut more akin to a calculated and willing participant in the supply chain that ends with a profitable illegal firearm market in Mexico.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated following oral arguments."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night will act as an extension \u2013 and explanation \u2013 of the rapid change he\u2019s unleashed in just 44 days of his new term.\n\nHe will face his biggest audience yet as he pushes for congressional Republicans, who have narrow majorities, to turn his agenda into law \u2013 the outcome of which will go a long way toward shaping the success of his presidency.\n\nRepublicans have largely rallied around the president, but there have been early cracks in party unity over some of the administration\u2019s actions to cut government services and Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric toward Ukraine. Late Monday, Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, which is already raising concern in some corners of the GOP even as many Republicans have praised Trump for last week\u2019s Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech is also coming on the same day as 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada went into effect, causing a volatile morning on the markets amid fears of a global trade war and raising alarm among some red-state senators about the impact on their states.\n\nTrump is mindful of the skepticism and criticism he is facing from many Republican lawmakers over the emerging trade war, with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other top advisers fielding calls \u201call day long,\u201d one senior administration official told CNN.\n\nThe president is unfazed by the criticism, aides say. But to deflect from the furious critiques over tariffs, Trump plans to shine a light in his speech on a series of executive orders he has signed on cultural issues that are widely popular with the Trump base.\n\n\u201cWatch,\u201d the senior administration official told CNN, \u201cour Republicans will be clapping all night long.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced Monday evening that \u201cThe Renewal of the American Dream\u201d is the theme of the speech.\n\n\u201cTomorrow night will be big,\u201d Trump wrote Monday on social media. \u201cI will tell it like it is.\u201d\n\nHere is what to watch during Trump\u2019s first address to Congress of his new administration:\n\nHe\u2019ll try to deliver on his campaign pledges \u2013 but will there be specifics?\n\nAfter becoming the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote, Trump now faces pressure to deliver on campaign promises, like lowering prices.\n\nHis party has full control of Congress, but given how fast political winds can shift in Washington, Trump\u2019s advisers have made speed their priority in pushing his agenda \u2013 targeting the two-year window before the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nTrump himself has taken a lesson from his first term \u2013 he\u2019s not waiting for the perfect moment to execute on his promises. Instead, he signs executive orders almost every day, sometimes deciding only in the minutes beforehand which to sign.\n\nOne Trump adviser said a goal of the president\u2019s speech would be connecting his flurry of early moves to the lives of average Americans. Trump will likely address his plan to lower prices, although the specific contours of his speech were still coming together Monday.\n\nExplaining whiplash-inducing changes\n\nSince taking office a second time, Trump has overseen a dramatic reshaping of the federal government, much of it at the hand of the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest man, who has emerged as one of the most visible and influential advisers to Trump, will be in the House chamber for the speech, a White House official told CNN, and will be held up as a leading example of the administration\u2019s swift action to change Washington.\n\nEntire agencies \u2013 which in a previous age would be sending their priorities to the White House for inclusion in the speech \u2013 have been gutted in the new Trump era. Tens of thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs.\n\nNot all Republicans are fully on board. Some lawmakers been bombarded with constituent phone calls and voters at town halls who are angry at the dramatic cuts to the federal government.\n\nRallying GOP Congress behind his agenda\n\nThe president\u2019s address comes amid disagreement among House and Senate Republicans over how to enact a budget that aims to reduce spending, protect Social Security and make permanent the signature tax cuts from Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nHe is poised to rally Republicans behind his agenda, advisers said, without offering specific guidance for how to achieve it.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who will sit behind Trump\u2019s left shoulder, has proven more than willing to accommodate the president\u2019s whims.\n\n\u201cThere is no daylight between the House Republicans and Senate Republicans,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cWe all have exactly the same idea and mission and that is to deliver the America First agenda.\u201d\n\nHow much will he speak to foreign affairs?\n\nTrump\u2019s speech will be heavily focused on his domestic agenda, an official told CNN, with Trump previewing his core policy proposals for the next four years.\n\nStill, one of the main areas of interest is how the president uses the global stage to address the wars abroad, specifically between Russia and Ukraine \u2013 and how hard a line he takes against Ukraine after pausing aid.\n\nTrump has discarded decades of American foreign policy orthodoxy, forging ahead in pursuit of new deals with countries like Russia \u2013 while other allies like Ukraine are left as collateral damage. Foreign ambassadors who customarily attend the address have been scrambling to explain the changes to their capitals.\n\nIt was only a year ago that Biden administration officials tried to get Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine\u2019s president, to Washington as a guest at the 2024 State of the Union speech (she couldn\u2019t make it, citing scheduling conflicts). Trump\u2019s address comes four days after Trump castigated her husband in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump said a day ahead of the speech that he would address the Ukraine situation.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you know. We\u2019re making a speech, you probably heard about it, tomorrow night, so I\u2019ll let you know tomorrow night,\u201d he said Monday when asked if he thought the mineral deal with Ukraine was dead.\n\nHow Democrats respond\n\nBack in 2020, Trump\u2019s rivals felt emboldened. After his address that year, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be seen on camera ripping up a copy of his speech.\n\nAn open question this year is how Democrats respond in the room. Party leaders are still scrambling to settle on a message and a plan for how to present a counterbalance to Trump, mindful of the drubbing that Democrats took in the November elections.\n\nThe party has tapped freshman Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan to deliver the formal rebuttal, an often thankless task that can still elevate a junior politician\u2019s profile. A former CIA analyst and member of the US House, Slotkin won Michigan last year at the same time that Trump carried the state.\n\nMade-for-TV moments\n\nEver the television showman, Trump has long relied on an element of surprise for his primetime addresses to Congress.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s speechwriting team has been working on multiple drafts, aides said Monday that Trump has spent little time on the address \u2013 aside from a few theatrical moments that are intended to resonate with the audience on television and inside the House chamber.\n\nUnlike during Trump\u2019s first term, top adviser Stephen Miller hasn\u2019t taken the lead in crafting this speech, leaving the task to other speechwriters. However, he and Trump\u2019s other senior aides will all be involved in edits heading into Tuesday evening.\n\nTrump is expected to take a victory lap, touting his election win \u2013 something he argues delivered him a mandate to enact sweeping change, despite its relatively small margin \u2013 as well as lauding what one senior White House official referred to as the \u201csuccesses and accomplishments\u201d from his first six weeks in office.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "full_content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Every morning for 47 years, Gaily Cowart\u2019s mother woke up in her sun-filled bedroom overlooking a lush garden and the San Gabriel Mountains beyond.\n\nThat garden and much of her mother\u2019s home are now covered in ash and soot after the Eaton Fire ripped through Altadena on Jan. 7, destroying more than 9,000 residences in the foothill community north of downtown Los Angeles. At least 17 people died, and thousands more were displaced.\n\nCowart\u2019s childhood house survived the flames but is surrounded by charred homes and razed businesses near what used to be Altadena\u2019s bustling business corridor. The neighborhood off Lake Avenue sustained some of the worst damage in one of two major fires that swept through Los Angeles County in January.\n\nThe garden of Gaily Cowart's childhood home in Altadena, Calif. Courtesy Gaily Cowart.\n\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires displaced about 150,000 residents, and many remain in rentals and hotel rooms nearly two months later. Survivors whose homes are standing face ballooning smoke remediation and restoration costs, as well as insurance companies that are lowballing payouts even though some offer smoke damage coverage.\n\nNBC News spoke with seven homeowners whose houses survived the fires. Six of them paid for smoke damage coverage through insurance, and one did not have the option through the state\u2019s insurer of last resort.\n\nStill reeling from the destruction, they now face tens of thousands of dollars in costs or more to deep clean and remediate remaining toxins inside their homes. They anticipate being displaced for months as they begin rebuilding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really tricky being in a home that did not burn down,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a gray area with insurance thinking, \u2018Just wipe everything down and it\u2019ll be back the way it used to be.\u2019 But it\u2019s like, 'No, I\u2019ve got soot and ash that I can see with my eyes.'\u201d\n\nThe insurance industry has long been fraught in California, where wildfires are getting bigger and deadlier every year. Major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies or are refusing to renew existing ones to offset skyrocketing costs across much of the state.\n\nResidents were blindsided last year when State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurer, announced it would drop coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments. It blamed costs associated with inflation, catastrophe exposure, reinsurance and regulations for its need to protect its bottom line.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Altadena resident Andrea-Marie Stark emerged from a State Farm information tent frustrated by the lack of progress in getting her remediation estimate approved. Service was scheduled to start Monday on her three-bedroom, two-bathroom ranch-style house facing Eaton Canyon, where the fire was first reported.\n\nBut State Farm had not yet approved the estimate, which ranged from $80,000 to $100,000 to pull insulation from the walls, remove harmful particles from all surfaces and replace furniture, clothing and appliances exposed to excessive smoke and ash.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to lose my place in line,\u201d Stark said of the approval delay. \u201cAnd then I could lose a place to live.\u201d\n\nAndrea-Marie Stark and her husband in their smoke-damaged home in Altadena. Courtesy Andrea-Marie Stark\n\nStark\u2019s house is one of several that survived the inferno on her block, but its proximity to the flames meant everything inside was coated with a thick layer of soot. Christmas decorations turned gray in the ash, and her clothing has the strong odor of smoke.\n\nA charred smoky smell lingers on Stark's street. A neighboring house has been razed to its foundation, with only the chimney left standing. In the distance, green moss and leaves sprout amid the burned branches and fallen limbs of Eaton Canyon.\n\nStark and her husband evacuated to a friend\u2019s home the night of the fire after they secured their four rabbits, five chickens, three cats, a dog and a horse in their crates. They have been jumping from friend\u2019s home to friend\u2019s home ever since. They hoped to return to Altadena by mid-March after having booked a smoke remediation company that said it could complete the work quickly.\n\nBut State Farm had not responded to her claim for two weeks, and she worried she would need to pay for the remediation herself, plus rent if her appointment had to be rescheduled.\n\nIn an emailed statement, State Farm said it is \u201ccommitted to paying what we owe, promptly, courteously, and efficiently.\u201d As of Feb. 26, it has received more than 11,750 fire and auto claims related to the fires and paid nearly $2.2 billion to customers, it said.\n\nTo cope with the anxiety associated with surviving a catastrophic event, Stark and her husband started a Monday night support group for residents whose homes are still standing. It is a way for people to speak openly about what few others can understand.\n\n\u201cSafeness is an internal feeling. Safety is external, and they\u2019re both ruptured right now,\u201d said Stark, a trauma-trained counselor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to express this to someone without a home, you know, because I don\u2019t want to disrespect their experience and make them think that I\u2019m not grateful. That\u2019s called survivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d\n\nThe smell in Marcie Habell\u2019s Altadena home nauseates her. A remediation company recommended taking it down to the studs to fully restore it. She cannot imagine returning to it right now, let alone sitting on her fabric couch or using any of her towels or linens.\n\n\u201cI can be in my house for less than five minutes,\" said Habell, whose home is one of just two standing on her block. \"It\u2019s insane that it happened, and then on top of it, the way that insurance is behaving just compounds the tragedy.\u201d\n\nShe has been quoted upward of $22,000 just for toxicity testing, and she expects rent could run $4,000 to $4,500 a month. That's on top of paying her mortgage if her insurance company does not agree to cover the full cost, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are getting zero guidance from anyone for those of us who happen to have a standing home and are surrounded by the apocalypse,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Sollner, California's deputy insurance commissioner, said in a statement that \"smoke damage is real and insurance companies must investigate claims properly, not deny them outright or pressure homeowners into accepting less than they are owed.\"\n\nMore than 33,710 insurance claims related to the Los Angeles-area fires have been filed, and nearly $7 billion in claims have been paid, according to state Insurance Department.\n\nGaily Cowart and her mom, Faye Cowart whose home in Altadena is just one of a few left standing on her block. Courtesy Gaily Cowart\n\nCowart is handling her mother\u2019s smoke damage claim from Dallas, where she has been living for more than a decade. She flew to Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to pick up her mother from a friend\u2019s house and took her back to Texas. Cowart\u2019s mother, Faye Cowart, has early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and struggles with being in a new place. But Cowart fears her old neighborhood is too toxic to return to.\n\nInitial estimates to remediate the Spanish-style two-bedroom, two-bathroom house started at $55,000. A landscaper bid $3,000 to restore the garden and remove potentially toxic soil. Including furniture removal and buying new clothing, Cowart fears, the cost to fully restore her mother\u2019s home and everything in it could quickly top $100,000. Howard\u2019s Allstate adjuster has not finalized their payout or agreed to pay long-term rent while Howard remains displaced, Cowart said.\n\n\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t go home,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cJust on a basic human level, no one has told us what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d\n\n\"We continue to support California customers with wildfire claims and are working to resolve them with speed and care,\" a spokesperson for Allstate said in an emailed statement, adding the company has paid more than $750 million to California customers since the fires started.\n\nRob Rhatt, an insurance analyst for Lending Tree, said it is \u201cfrustrating and not surprising\u201d that insurance companies are slow to handle smoke damage claims. Unlike damage from fires, which is structural and clearly visible, damage caused by invisible smoke does not neatly fall into most categories. It requires professional testing, cleaning and restoration with expensive outside vendors.\n\nSimply put, homes in high wildfire-risk areas are bad for business.\n\n\u201cThese catastrophic losses have really cut into their profitability,\u201d Rhatt said of insurance companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not just cutting into their profitability where they\u2019re making less money, but it\u2019s actually threatening their solvency to the point where they\u2019re losing money insuring homes in California.\u201d\n\nPacific Palisades resident Ian Hardcastle said he never had the option to fully insure the 2,600-square foot home he shared with his wife and 14-month-old child near Temescal Gateway Park, where the Palisades Fire sparked.\n\nAfter they bought their house in 2021, he signed up for the California FAIR Plan, which provides coverage for those who cannot obtain insurance from private companies, and hoped any wildfires would stay tucked in the mountains and canyons, as they had historically.\n\nBut on Jan. 7, a wind-driven inferno ripped through the state park behind his house and devastated the surrounding neighborhood. His home was overwhelmed with billowing smoke and toxic ash for several days. Hardcastle can stand to be inside for only a few minutes at a time.\n\nHis adjuster quoted $1,826 for remediation, but a $5,000 deductible means Hardcastle will receive no payout for work that could cost much more.\n\n\"This, this little plot of land was our special happy place, so we're happy it's still here,\" Hardcastle said Thursday as he toured his property. \"We want to come back, but again, we don't know when that will be.\""

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump is ordering a pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine after his heated Oval Office argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official told CNN Monday.\n\nThe halt in aid, which came after Trump held a series of meetings with top national security officials at the White House, could have dire effect on Ukraine\u2019s war-fighting abilities, officials and analysts said. It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cThe president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,\u201d the White House official said.\n\nAfter more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Monday\u2019s pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putin\u2019s hand.\n\nThe pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelensky\u2019s bad behavior last week.\n\nUkraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks \u2014 perhaps until the start of the summer \u2014 before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. The Biden administration rushed shipments of weapons to Ukraine in its waning days, providing the country with large stockpiles of advanced weapons.\n\nIt is those sophisticated weapons \u2014 including the long-range ATACMS missiles \u2014 that have allowed Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, a strategy that could suffer if those weapons remain paused.\n\nWhile European nations may be able to replace US shipments of artillery, supplemented by Ukraine\u2019s own growing defense industry, the most advanced weapons used by Kyiv come from the United States.\n\nImpact could be \u2018crippling\u2019\n\n\u201cThe impact is going to be big. I would call it crippling,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has closely followed the war.\n\nCancian estimated that Ukraine would feel the impacts of the pause in aid within two to four months, as aid from European countries helps Kyiv remain in the fight for now. \u201cThat\u2019s why they don\u2019t fall off a cliff, but when your supplies get cut in half, eventually that shows up on the front lines,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cTheir front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse \u2013 even catastrophic \u2013 peace settlement.\u201d\n\nBut Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces. \u201cThere might be a way out of this, but it\u2019s going to be extremely humiliating for Zelensky,\u201d Cancian said.\n\nThe White House made the decision to pause military aid to Ukraine for now as officials seek an acknowledgement from Zelensky about the breakdown in relations following Friday\u2019s blowup in the Oval Office.\n\nAccording to several officials, Trump and his senior aides are seeking an acknowledgement from Zelensky \u2013 potentially in the form of a public apology \u2013 before moving ahead with a deal on Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, which had been close to agreement before Friday\u2019s meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday in an interview on CNN.\n\nThe halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States\u2019 traditional European allies like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone,\u201d one US official said.\n\nA European official called the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pause military aid to Ukraine \u201cpetty and wrong.\u201d\n\nThe official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beyond disappointed,\u201d the official told CNN\n\nSince the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. The largest of these packages was nearly $3 billion, though most were far smaller. Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the US for the weapons on social media, as well as in calls and meetings with American officials.\n\nThe pause comes one day after a defense official told CNN that military aid to Ukraine announced by the Biden administration was still flowing. Those shipments included critical munitions such as anti-tank weapons, thousands of artillery rounds, and rockets. Those shipments were expected to continue for several weeks, but the decision from the Trump administration freezes the aid that was en route.\n\n\u201cDoD is also providing other capabilities, such as armored vehicles, as soon as required repairs are completed,\u201d the defense official said on Sunday. The US had set up facilities in Poland to repair Western equipment damaged on the battlefield before sending it back to the Ukrainian military.\n\nThere are also multiple longer-term contracts between arms manufacturers and the US to send weapons systems and air defense systems to Ukraine.\n\nMixed reaction from Republicans\n\nRepublicans in Congress, where the party holds majorities in both chambers, have been split on continuing aid to Ukraine amid its three-year war with Russia.\n\nEarlier Monday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes \u201cso far,\u201d saying, \u201cthe American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and there\u2019s no end in sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, \u2018Let\u2019s bring an end to it,\u2019\u201d the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, \u201cthen we will.\u201d\n\nHowever, he warned if Zelensky \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to negotiate peace, then it\u2019s not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war.\u201d\n\nGOP Sen. Susan Collins, however, denounced the pause on Monday night, arguing that the US needs to continue backing its ally.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical time for Ukraine. And I managed the Ukraine supplemental last year that provided additional help to Ukraine, and I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It\u2019s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,\u201d the Maine Republican said.\n\nCollins acknowledged that Congress may not be able to do anything to ensure Ukraine continues to receive aid from the US.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is linked to the president\u2019s drawdown authority,\u201d she noted, pointing to accusations during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term that he had \u201cslow walked\u201d aid.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve seen this movie before, and I remain convinced that it\u2019s not only in Ukraine\u2019s interest but our interest to back Ukraine because Putin is not going to stop there,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chair Republican Rep. Brian Mast told CNN he \u201cknew it was an option\u201d for the Trump administration to pause all US military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think people can assume that everything is on the table with Ukraine right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Morgan Rimmer, Annie Grayer, Ali Main, Manu Raju and Sarah Davis contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemonstrators gathered at more than 50 Tesla showrooms across the United States on Saturday in protest of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s role in slashing government agencies as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency established by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe protests are part of \u201cTesla Takedown,\u201d which, according to its website, hopes to encourage stakeholders to \u201csell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreating a vote of no confidence in him from the shareholders, that would be the ultimate goal,\u201d Alex Winter, a Los Angeles-based actor and filmmaker who is one of the main organizers, told CNN.\n\nThe first Tesla Takedown protest was on February 15 after Winter spoke with Joan Donovan, a sociologist and professor at Boston University, who suggested a Tesla protest on Bluesky, an alternative to Musk\u2019s X.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest person, began leading DOGE on January 20. Musk\u2019s role has received criticism from the start, due in part to buyout offers to federal employees alongside mass layoffs; dismantling the US Agency for International Development; and seeking access to sensitive payment systems.\n\nThe Tesla Takedown movement is also gaining traction internationally. There was a protest Friday in Barcelona, and three protests are set for this weekend in London; Lisbon, Portugal; and Reykjavik, Iceland, according to Winter.\n\n\u201cI am very satisfied, even with where we are now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provided people an easy way to protest during a very difficult time.\u201d\n\nProtests have varied in size, with some of the largest demonstrations taking place in the cities of Boston and Portland, as well as in California and Florida, according to Winter. About 1,000 protesters gathered with signs Saturday in Tucson, Arizona. In Washington, DC, what started as only two demonstrators standing outside a showroom in the Georgetown neighborhood grew to about 20 within an hour.\n\nThe demonstration included chants of \u201cElon Musk has got to go,\u201d as well as drivers honking horns in support.\n\nPeter Jones, a 59-year-old pilot, told CNN that he searched on Friday for upcoming protests but found none. He said if it weren\u2019t for his wife, who heard the chanting and was curious about the protest, they would have missed out.\n\n\u201cIt feels great because right now I feel powerless,\u201d Jones said. \u201cNobody can keep up with all of the destruction. I don\u2019t feel empowered unless we get out into the street; that\u2019s one thing we have is mass.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 wife, Bonnie Jones, said she\u2019s concerned about Musk\u2019s other investments and contracts, including the high-speed internet service Starlink, because Musk has not been properly vetted through a confirmation hearing like other Trump appointees.\n\nProtestors gather at a Tesla showroom in Washington, DC, chanting \u201cDOGE needs to go\u201d and \u201cWho voted for Elon Musk? No one voted for Elon Musk.\u201d Auzinea Bacon/CNN\n\nDonna Powell, a retiree in the Washington, DC, area, told CNN this is her 20th protest against the Trump administration and Musk\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cTesla stock has been going down and we want to see that continue and we want to see Musk hurt,\u201d said Powell. \u201cWe also hope that Congress will grow a spine and do what they\u2019re elected to do.\u201d\n\nHitting Musk where it hurts\n\nDeclining sales, which could lead investors to sell off their stock, hurt Tesla\u2019s value \u2014 which accounts for much of Musk\u2019s net worth. He owns nearly 411 million shares of Tesla, or 13% of the company.\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn December, Musk became the first person to have a net worth above $400 billion. He has since lost $52 billion in net worth as shares of Tesla (TSLA) have plunged 27.6% in February.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Tesla Takedown movement will have much of an impact on the company. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive site Edmunds, noted there hasn\u2019t been a bump in Tesla owners appraising their used cars.\n\nSome hesitation could be that selling a car relies on other factors, including the cost of buying a new vehicle while interest rates are high and because Teslas are now less expensive, she said.\n\nAlthough Tesla may face pushback because of Musk\u2019s involvement in the government, some Tesla owners and potential buyers are likely separating Tesla as a company from Musk, she said. Caldwell added that the attention Musk has received from DOGE is not good for Tesla\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the other car companies, most people couldn\u2019t name another automotive CEO and much less their opinion on politics,\u201d Caldwell told CNN.\n\nTesla reported global sales of 1.79 million in 2024, compared with 1.81 million in 2023. The 1.1% drop was Tesla\u2019s first annual decline in 12 years.\n\nTesla recently reported a 16% decline in sales between December and January. That was an improvement after Tesla sales dropped 24% between December 2023 and January 2024.\n\nAnother explanation for decreased sales could be that Tesla hasn\u2019t made many new changes, Caldwell said. Aside from a few refreshes to old models and the release of the Cybertruck, the cars are \u201ca bit older.\u201d The company is also a smaller share of electric vehicle makers as it faces increased competition from General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and other brands."

We need effective leadership. https://t.co/a0vVYRF4iP pic.twitter.com/JIrhD1Edqs \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@andrewcuomo) March 1, 2025\n\nDespite his considerable baggage, Cuomo is widely expected be the front-runner for the Democratic primary \u2014 at least initially \u2014 on name recognition alone, and he is already on top of early polls. In 2021, the now-67-year-old political scion resigned as governor amid a barrage of sexual-harassment allegations (which he continues to deny). He was also accused of mishandling the COVID crisis after his administration was found to have underreported the number of people who died in nursing homes during the pandemic.\n\nBefore his sudden downfall, Cuomo had been expected to surpass his father, Mario Cuomo, by winning a fourth term as governor. He was also once considered a potential presidential candidate, but now he\u2019s literally trying to reintroduce himself to New Yorkers (\u201cHi, I\u2019m Andrew Cuomo,\u201d is how he begins his announcement video).\n\nAnd here\u2019s how Cuomo addressed his past \u201cmistakes\u201d:\n\nDid I make mistakes, some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show that every day. But I promise you this: I know what needs to be done and I know how to do it, and I will give it my all to get the job done \u2014 and it will get done.\n\nIn October, the GOP-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic sent a letter to the Justice Department recommending charges against Cuomo over the nursing-home scandal. It\u2019s not clear if the DOJ will launch its own investigation into Cuomo now that it\u2019s run by Trump political appointees who have already used federal charges against Mayor Adams to their apparent advantage.\n\nSimilarly to how Adams ran for the job, Cuomo is framing his mayoral campaign around fears that the city isn\u2019t safe. In his announcement video, over footage of people living on the street, Cuomo referenced migrants and crime after declaring that \u201cour New York City is in trouble\u201d:\n\nYou feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person, or when the anxiety rises up your chest as you\u2019re walking down into the subway. You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence. The city just feels threatening, out of control and in crisis.\n\nHe also indicated that as mayor, he would be open to working with Trump:\n\nI will work with anyone who wants to work for the benefit of New York. I hope President Trump remembers his hometown and works with us to make it better. But make no mistake, I will stand up and fight for New York. I have done it before and will do it again.\n\nCuomo already has a sizable war chest of money left over from his previous political life, as well as some public proponents, including Representative Ritchie Torres, who this week told the New York Post he was backing Cuomo\u2019s bid. The Bronx Democrat said that New York needs a \u201cMr. Tough Guy\u201d with \u201cthe courage to stand up to extremist politics \u2014 both from the far left and far right.\u201d\n\nOther mayoral candidates quickly attacked Cuomo on Saturday:\n\nWelcome, @andrewcuomo !\n\n\n\nIn honor of your sad attempt to get attention, let's remember your time as Governor of New York\u2014before you resigned for sexually harassing 13 women and leading thousands of elderly New Yorkers to their deaths during Covid-19.https://t.co/JhXFMphn17 pic.twitter.com/zafkiIqD8x \u2014 Brad Lander (@bradlander) March 1, 2025\n\nAndrew Cuomo is now officially running to lead the city he repeatedly threw under the bus as governor.

            "full_content": "Seattle AP \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s plan to pull federal funding from institutions that provide gender-affirming care for transgender youth will remain blocked on a long-term basis under a federal judge\u2019s ruling in Seattle late Friday.\n\nUS District Court Judge Lauren King previously granted a two-week restraining order after the Democratic attorneys general of Washington, Oregon and Minnesota sued the Trump administration \u2014 Colorado has since joined the case.\n\nKing\u2019s temporary order expired Friday, and she held arguments that day before issuing a preliminary injunction blocking most of Trump\u2019s plan pending a final decision on the merits of the case. She rejected a portion of the states\u2019 challenge regarding the order\u2019s protections against female genital mutilation, on grounds that \u201cno credible threat of prosecution exists\u201d in such cases.\n\nTwo of Trump\u2019s executive orders are at issue in the case.\n\nOne, \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism,\u201d calls for stripping federal money from programs that \u201cpromote gender ideology.\u201d\n\nThe other, \u201cProtecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\u201d calls for the federal government to cut off research and educational grants for institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, that provide gender-affirming care to people under age 19. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care, including puberty blockers and hormone treatments, following the order.\n\nMedicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care, and Trump\u2019s \u201cProtecting Children\u201d order suggests that practice could end. It also raises the prospect that medical professionals could be criminally charged for providing gender-affirming care under a law that bans medically unnecessary genital mutilation of underage females \u2014 a notion that the states suing Trump call repugnant and legally unsupportable.\n\nYoung people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth \u2014 a condition called gender dysphoria \u2014 are far more likely to suffer from severe depression and to kill themselves if they do not receive treatment, which can include evaluation by a team of medical professionals; a social transition, such as changing a hairstyle or pronouns; and eventually puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.\n\nWashington Attorney General Nick Brown walks down the steps of a federal court in Seattle after a hearing over President Donald Trump's order against gender-affirming care for youth on Friday, February 28, 2025. Manuel Valdes/AP\n\nIn her ruling Friday, the judge said the order was not limited to children or to irreversible treatments and that it doesn\u2019t target medical interventions performed on cisgender children.\n\n\u201cIn fact, its inadequate \u2018means-end fit\u2019 would prevent federally funded medical providers from providing necessary medical treatments to transgender youth that are completely unrelated to gender identity,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor example, a cisgender teen could obtain puberty blockers from such a provider as a component of cancer treatment, but a transgender teen with the same cancer care plan could not.\u201d\n\nIn his arguments Friday, Washington Assistant Attorney General William McGinty stressed the urgency of the issue.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be young people who are going to take their lives if they can no longer receive this care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe executive order uses derisive terminology \u2014 words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 that contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States. Such care is widely endorsed by the medical community, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nKing, the judge in Seattle, grilled Justice Department attorney Vinita Andrapalliyal in court about the meaning and effect of Trump\u2019s executive orders.\n\n\u201cWhat is gender dysphoria?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYour honor, I am not a medical provider,\u201d Andrapalliyal responded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thing, correct?\u201d King asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a medically recognizable diagnosis?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an official position on that,\u201d Andrapalliyal said.\n\nThe judge continued to press, saying she was \u201clooking for a legitimate government interest\u201d that would justify Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nThe four Democratic attorneys general suing in Seattle argued that the orders violate equal rights protections, the separation of powers and the states\u2019 right to regulate issues not delegated to the federal government.\n\nThe Trump administration disputed those claims in court filings. \u201cThe President\u2019s authority to direct subordinate agencies to implement his agenda, subject to those agencies\u2019 own statutory authorities, is well established,\u201d Justice Department attorneys wrote.\n\nIn addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service; set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender; and would ban transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.\n\nMany legal challenges have been filed."

            "full_content": "Jefferson City, Missouri CNN \u2014\n\nA bill before the Missouri State Senate would introduce $1,000 rewards for people identifying undocumented immigrants who are then taken into custody.\n\nThe proposal would make it a state felony for anyone in the US illegally to enter and stay in Missouri. It would create an opportunity for licensed bond agents to become bounty hunters. And it would create a fund not just for the bounty hunters, but anyone who provides information on an undocumented individual that results in their arrest.\n\nSenate Bill 72 is still in committee and may never become law. But opponents say it\u2019s already spreading fear and changing the lives of both legally residing and undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hateful,\u201d Ashley Chavarria told CNN. Chavarria is the US-born daughter of two Mexicans who came across the border illegally in the late 1980s and have stayed ever since. She said she\u2019s already seen Latinos, some undocumented, in Missouri\u2019s capital Jefferson City area staying away from English classes and even afraid to collect their children from school since the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the onset of his mass deportation drive.\n\nAnd the new bill could make things worse, added Chavarria, who works at a social service agency for Hispanic communities made up of both citizens and non-citizens. \u201cIt\u2019s actually going to put more fear into people and turn people against each other,\u201d she said.\n\nAshley Chavarria says she struggles to to explain the current political situation to her children, aged 8 and 9. CNN\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, freshman state Sen. David Gregory took time to criticize what he said had been misinformation about his plan both when introducing the legislation and in a short interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing things like \u2018oh, this places a bounty on people.\u2019 No, it doesn\u2019t\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJust because we\u2019re dispatching bounty hunters after a warrant has been issued is not a bounty. It\u2019s actually a reward system through a hotline.\u201d\n\nThe bill creates a felony of \u201ctrespass by an illegal alien\u201d if an undocumented immigrant enters and stays in the state.\n\nThe text of the bill talks of setting up a toll-free phone line, email address and online portal where people could \u2014 anonymously if they wish \u2014 report suspected violators.\n\nIf an undocumented immigrant \u201cis arrested and imprisoned\u2026as a result of a report to the information system, the person who made the report shall be eligible to receive a reward of $1,000,\u201d it says.\n\nGregory insists that incentive is a reward \u2014 similar to those offered by local and national law enforcement agencies seeking information on crimes \u2014 and not a \u201cbounty.\u201d\n\nMerriam-Webster defines \u201cbounty\u201d as \u201ca reward, premium, or subsidy especially when offered or given by a government: such as \u201ca payment for the capture of or assistance in the capture of an outlaw.\u201d\n\nIn the bill, the punishment for violating the \u201ctrespass by illegal alien\u201d felony is life imprisonment without parole, though it says someone could be released to the custody of the federal government if they were going to be deported within 24 hours. Gregory, who represents parts of St. Louis, told CNN he had heard opposition to the life term and was discussing it with fellow senators.\n\nA separate bill he introduced said a court may conditionally release a defendant charged with the state trespassing felony during their initial court appearance if it \u201cfinds that the defendant is seeking asylum and does not pose a danger to the community.\u201d However, if a \u201ccourt finds that the defendant is seeking asylum but poses a danger to the community, the defendant shall be denied bail entirely,\u201d and remain in custody throughout the course of their trial, the bill states. The bill would only go into effect if Senate Bill 72 became law.\n\nGregory emphasized people would only be approached and detained after an investigation finds evidence against them and a warrant is issued by a judge.\n\n\u201cThese concerns we\u2019re hearing that bounty hunters are just going to be kicking in doors, that\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s illegal now, it\u2019s illegal under my bill,\u201d Gregory told CNN.\n\nState Sen. David Gregory, left, photographed speaking to CNN's Omar Jimenez, said there has been misinformation about his bill. CNN\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m hearing other types of harassment concerns or things like normal, everyday citizens walking up and saying, \u2018hey, you show me your papers,\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s illegal. That\u2019s illegal today. And it\u2019s illegal under my bill,\u201d he said.\n\nThose concerns were raised by some of the dozens of people who spoke against the bill during a senate committee hearing.\n\n\u201cThis bill would not only tear apart families, schools and congregations and communities, but also pit neighbors against one another,\u201d said Yazmin Bruno-Valdez, who introduced herself as a longtime Missouri resident, community advocate and \u201cDreamer\u201d who was brought to the US as a child and is currently allowed to remain.\n\nImmigration and civil rights attorney Javad Khazaeli told CNN Gregory\u2019s stated intention could be overrun if the bill becomes law.\n\n\u201cWhen you put bounties on people, you\u2019re incentivizing grabbing people,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd when you grab people, bad things happen.\u201d\n\nKhazaeli, who\u2019s based in St. Louis, spent a decade as a federal government lawyer advising officers in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies about immigration law. He was aware of times when local law enforcement officers would seek training on immigration regulations as they targeted a specific safety problem. But even with training, there would almost inevitably be problems, he said.\n\n\u201cWe saw issues where local law enforcement officers were arresting Puerto Ricans because they thought Puerto Rico wasn\u2019t part of America. Every time you have any kind of interaction like this, the only possible way for the person on the other end who\u2019s being harassed to get out of it is by showing their papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow this is exactly \u2014 and I\u2019m not trying to be hyperbolic here \u2014 but this is exactly what we had in Nazi Germany,\u201d he added.\n\nThat being said, it could be surprising that the lone voice from a member of the public supporting Gregory\u2019s bill in committee came from Rabbi Ze\u2019ev Smason.\n\nSmason, a rabbi in St Louis for 25 years, rejected the comparisons to the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly were they doing in Nazi Germany? They were turning in neighbors if they had a 16th of Jewish blood within them and then they took them in cattle cars and they exterminated them. That\u2019s what was done in Nazi Germany. Is that what\u2019s being done over here?\u201d he asked.\n\nRabbi Ze'ev Smason was the lone voice speaking in favor of the bill at a public session. . CNN\n\n\u201cI see no reasonable comparison between the two,\u201d he added.\n\nHe told CNN it was a matter of justice. \u201cI think people, even though we\u2019re not a border state, are very concerned about illegal immigration \u2026 because it\u2019s an abrogation of the law and, in general, a spirit of lawlessness is something that\u2019s destructive to our community and our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMistakes could be made, he conceded, but he trusted in the judicial system. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that most of the time our police and our courts get it right,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyer Khazaeli said the publicity around Gregory\u2019s bill has already had a chilling effect, even on immigrants with legal status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing people who\u2019ve been in this country for decades, legally, terrified,\u201d he said, mentioning one woman from Europe who had been a legal permanent resident for 30 years, now looking to become a citizen because she was afraid of what could happen.\n\nAt the state capitol, Gregory said: \u201cMy intention is to make sure that we, as a state, can step up \u2026 and protect our women and our children and our Missourians from the dangerous immigrants. I\u2019m sorry that that scares them but that is not the intent.\u201d\n\nHe said he was optimistic the bill would pass but that it would take time.\n\nIf the senate progresses the bill, it will go to the state House of Representatives.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson wrote, \u201cI have not heard any enthusiasm from House Republicans about doing any bounty hunter legislation. We are pleased that President Donald Trump is addressing illegal immigration at the federal level, including by signing the Laken Riley Act, which enables states to work with the federal government on immigration.\u201d\n\nA similar bill put forward by the Mississippi Legislature was killed in early February.\n\nThat bill had many of the hallmarks of Missouri Senate Bill 72 including: a $1,000 reward for tips that led to the arrest of undocumented immigrants, the creation of a \u201ccertified bounty hunter\u201d program, and also the threat of life in prison.\n\nJavad Khazaeli, an immigration and civil rights attorney, said he was ready to sue if SB72 passed and people were detained illegally. CNN\n\nThe American Immigration Council estimated there were nearly 70,000 undocumented immigrants living in Missouri. State Attorney General Andrew Bailey said there were up to about 100,000.\n\nThey include Chavarria\u2019s parents, who Chavarria said currently have work permits but are also in the process of trying to legalize their status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen my parents asking for a handout,\u201d Chavarria said, rejecting some narratives used against migrants.\n\nChavarria also said she wanted criminals off the streets whatever their citizenship, as did the people she knew. \u201cThe right immigrants know that we have to respect a country that we\u2019re not citizens of,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re aware of that and that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nNow with children of her own, she has at times struggled to explain this moment in American politics. They\u2019re 8 and 9 years old.\n\n\u201cThey tell me that the kids in school will scream \u2018Trump, Trump, Trump\u2019, and I tell them like, well, that\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI do try to let them know just to always be proud of who they are,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go very in depth with them because they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe system is way broken,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we could put the effort that we\u2019re putting into deporting all these immigrants, I wish that that effort could go into fixing that system, setting it up to where there\u2019s an actual pathway to citizenship or residency,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nBut for this bill and this moment, Khazaeli said he and other lawyers were ready.\n\n\u201cIf they push this forward, we\u2019re just going to sue them and we\u2019re going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to start arresting people that they have no right to arrest, they\u2019re going to start detaining people that they have no right to detain.\u201d\n\nHe said he was concerned that even if the \u201cbounty\u201d part of the bill got dropped, other measures he sees as too extreme could pass.\n\n\u201cThis could happen in Missouri, and we\u2019re preparing for that.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDan Bongino, the incoming deputy director of the FBI, suggested on his popular podcast in January that the agency he is now about to help lead was complicit in planting pipe bombs around Washington ahead of the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cI believe the FBI knows the identity of this pipe bomber on January 6th, four years ago, and just doesn\u2019t wanna tell us \u2018cause it was an inside job,\u201d Bongino said on his podcast.\n\n\u201cFolks, this guy was an insider,\u201d he added. \u201cThis was an inside job. And it is the biggest scandal in FBI history.\u201d\n\nA former Secret Service agent and NYPD cop, Bongino has become a successful conservative media personality in part by spreading conspiracy theories about the so-called deep state that alleges federal workers are plotting to undermine the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe FBI is a frequent target of his ire.\n\nBongino has called the bureau \u201ccorrupt\u201d and even suggested it doctored surveillance footage of the pipe bomb suspect, suggesting the bomb was planted by law enforcement to create a narrative that Trump supporters were trying to assassinate then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you this many times,\u201d he added on the January show. \u201cThe person who planted that bomb was definitely an insider. It was not an anti-Trump person. It was someone planting a bomb to create a narrative that crazy MAGA people are trying to assassinate Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nThe unsolved case of who planted two pipe bombs the night before the riot, one near the Democratic National Committee and the other near the Republican National Committee, has fueled a wide range of conspiracy theories, many of which have been fodder for Bongino\u2019s successful podcast.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security watchdog report published in 2024 detailed how close Harris came to the \u201cviable\u201d pipe bomb placed near the DNC that day.\n\nThe Dan Bongino Show is consistently one of the most popular podcasts on the Apple Podcast charts.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Bongino, a White House spokesperson praised him to CNN.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump brilliantly selected Dan Bongino\u2014a highly-qualified former NYPD police officer and U.S. Secret Service agent\u2014as the next Deputy Director of the FBI,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs President Trump said, Bongino will work alongside Director Kash Patel to bring law and order, fairness, and justice back to America, and his willingness to give up his wildly popular podcast shows his dedication to serving our country.\u201d\n\nA FBI spokesperson told CNN, \u201cThe FBI does not have any comment.\u201d\n\nBongino did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n\nKash Patel, the newly-confirmed FBI director, has also raised conspiracy theories about the pipe bomb, including in January, on a conservative podcast.\n\nTogether, Patel and Bongino, two of MAGA world\u2019s most well-known figures, will help President Donald Trump remake the FBI amid his long-standing grievances with the bureau stretching back to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nA CNN KFile review of Bongino\u2019s social media account on X found that he first began to sour on the FBI in May 2017 after a special counsel was appointed to take over the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation, accusing the \u201cdeep state\u201d of trying to undermine Trump. He has since published multiple books alleging an anti-Trump cabal trying to sabotage the president.\n\nCNN also found that Bongino deleted numerous tweets, including one from the day of the Capitol riot that attacked then-Rep. Liz Cheney for saying the states had to uphold the Constitution and certify the results.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when states violate the Constitution? Does a \u2018Constitution\u2019 serve a purpose if it only binds parties that believe it\u2019s a Constitution?\u201d Bongino wrote.\n\nBongino also deleted tweets that refer to the \u201cdeep state,\u201d including one in which he wrote, \u201cThe Deep State is determined to have Trump\u2019s scalp.\u201d It is unclear when the tweets were deleted or why.\n\nBongino routinely doubled down on conspiratorial rhetoric regarding the FBI, adding that if declassified information confirmed the pipe bomb was an inside job, the FBI would deploy another cover-up of a training exercise gone wrong.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to say it was a training exercise. We put these training bombs down there because we weren\u2019t sure the security around Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on January 6th was gonna be any good. We put these training devices to test everyone,\u201d Bongino said. \u201cNo, this was not a training. This was an effort to frame MAGA people.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Winter Hawk contributed to this story."

            "full_content": "The meeting between Trump, Vance, and Zelensky is a great clarifying moment, the first time president Trump or any president has, in a dramatic way, said no to the Washington establishment consensus in foreign policy, or, more informally, the blob. The blob, as most know, always gets its way. Through well-funded think tanks, establishment journalists, the military\u2013industrial complex and its many congressional supporters, tells us the proper way to think about foreign policy. Since the end of the Cold War, it has operated with no real opposition. (During the Cold War, when there was a serious enemy, there was actually more vigorous debate\u2014d\u00e9tente or no d\u00e9tente? Nuclear missiles in Europe? Keep fighting in Vietnam or let it go?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe blob always wins. Bombing Belgrade in support of a Kosovo insurgency, no opposition. Invasion of Iraq, no real debate until the invasion has obviously gone sour. Fighting in Afghanistan for years after anyone entertained any hope that the country could be turned into any kind of viable non Islamist state. Obama showed signs of wanting to circumvent the blob\u2014but political realities compelled him to maintain former Cheney aide Victoria Nuland as his premier official dealing with Russia. Ditto on his hope to curb Israeli settlements, another Obama hope that went down.\n\nBut the blob really kicked into overdrive with Ukraine. The blob wanted NATO expansion (although in the 1990s most foreign policy professionals did not). Ukraine, half of whose population deeply despises the Russian identifying third, wanted American support for its side in its long-running civil war. Its government wanted Kiev to become capital of an American NATO base with American nuclear missiles aimed at St. Petersburg.\n\nThe blob concurred. In 2014, the blob took the side of anti-Russian protesters in a street coup which overthrew an elected Ukrainian president who wanted to maintain strong ties to Russia. Tens of millions of dollars were spent by blob entities (e.g. the National Endowment for Democracy) to support the street putschists. Blob politicians made countless pilgrimages to Kiev\u2014no one doubted on which side virtue lay. (This was well before any Russian seizure of Ukrainian territory; it is remarkable how united the Washington blob could be about a domestic struggle in an obscure country half the world away\u2014whereas anyone in politics usually knows there are two or more reasonable sides to any question.) Russia, having lost the street battle in Kiev, seized the Russian-populated Crimean peninsula, home to its Black Sea fleet.\n\nZelensky was elected hoping to negotiate and calm the civil war between Russian-identifying Ukrainians and their foes. But he was quickly corrected by the Biden administration\u2014to be anti-Russia was the key to winning American support and aid. The blob hated Russia. Zelenskly complied with Biden. Putin, clearly at the end of his tether, massed troops on the border to show his open displeasure, hoping obviously for a negotiation that would push Ukraine off the NATO track. It never came.\n\nSince the 2022 invasion, blob propaganda went into overdrive. Zelensky is \u201cChurchill,\u201d Putin is \u201cHitler\u201d was a message drilled in thousands of times in the American media. If Putin wasn\u2019t stopped, he would march to the English Channel, said the blob. (Putin\u2019s armies couldn\u2019t manage to take Kiev, and for a while seemed as if they might lose the war entirely.) And once Zelensky\u2019s forces, outmanned and outgunned, began to lose, Zelensky faced a dilemma. Probably the only way he could survive was to bring America into the war\u2014survive not just politically but physically. Zelensky could be killed by pro-Russian forces, or by the neo-Nazi formations that are more powerful in Ukraine than in any country. So Zelensky had an objective interest in escalating the war, bringing America in. One could feel sorry for him\u2014he didn\u2019t choose the war, but objectively his interest was in a wider war.\n\nSomehow it took Donald Trump to recognize that a wider war against a nuclear-armed Russia was very much not in America\u2019s interest. No other American candidate for president did. (J.D. Vance, however, did\u2014he said early on that he didn\u2019t \u201ccare that much\u201d about Ukraine, and since our \u201ccaring for\u201d Ukraine has led to hundreds of thousands of dead and maimed Ukrainians, surely there are some in that country\u2014probably millions\u2014 who wished the blob hadn\u2019t cared so much as well.)\n\nStanding up the blob takes enormous self-confidence, a readiness to take on serious, able enemies\u2014real courage. Trump obviously dissed Zelensky in the Oval Office, but, more importantly, he dissed the blob as well. The blob will seek its revenge."

            "full_content": "Washington, DC CNN \u2014\n\nWhite House chefs were at work in the West Wing on Friday laying out plates of rosemary chicken, celery root puree and collard greens when the sound of raised voices began floating over from the Oval Office.\n\nInside, a remarkable scene was unfolding. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had begun berating their guest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a hitherto unseen public implosion of a key global relationship.\n\nFor supporters of Ukraine, the moment was disastrous: Everything that could have gone wrong in a meeting between two headstrong leaders did, in the span of 10 minutes.\n\nYet for all the shock, it was not an unforeseen outcome. Indeed, in the lead up to the talks \u2014 which were intended to culminate in the signing of a new agreement on rare earth minerals \u2014 many allies of both men quietly wondered whether their already combustible dynamic would end in triumph or catastrophe.\n\nEfforts were taken to prepare Zelensky for a successful meeting with Trump, who is famously susceptible to flattery and highly attuned to how he\u2019s being treated. The Ukrainian president was warned to focus squarely on the minerals deal \u2014 and to avoid getting drawn into a fight.\n\n\u201cI told him this morning, \u2018Don\u2019t take the bait. Don\u2019t let the media or anyone else get you into an argument with President Trump. What he\u2019s doing today is resetting the relationship,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was among a group of Republican and Democratic senators who met Zelensky before he came to the White House.\n\nOther European leaders who\u2019d come through the building this week offered Zelensky their own guidance, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who has found success in an approach to Trump that balances adulation with pushback.\n\nStill others \u2014 including some US officials \u2014 tried to discourage Zelensky from making the trip to Washington at all, believing work was still needed to strengthen what had already become a hostile relationship.\n\nStill, by the time Zelensky was pulling into the White House gates on Friday, few could have predicted quite how explosive the ensuing 139 minutes would become \u2014 though some detected early signs of trouble.\n\nStepping from his black SUV wearing what has become his standard uniform \u2014 drab military shirt and pants \u2014 Zelensky did not belie any tension with Trump, who had walked through the halls of the West Wing to greet him.\n\nBut some US officials watching from afar saw a problem: Zelensky\u2019s attire.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re all dressed up,\u201d Trump said with an air of sarcasm as he greeted Zelensky and shook his hand.\n\nBefore the Oval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match, Zelensky was asked by a reporter from a right-wing outlet \u2014 handpicked by the White House to be in the room during the talks \u2014 why he was not wearing a suit in the United States\u2019 highest office.\n\n\u201cI will wear a costume after this war will finish, yes,\u201d Zelensky said, responding in English. \u201cMaybe something like yours, yes, maybe something better. I don\u2019t know, we will see. Maybe something cheaper. Thank you.\u201d\n\nPerhaps taking a lesson from the parade of foreign leaders who had preceded him in the White House over the past month, Zelensky did not arrive empty handed. He brought with him the UFC belt won by the Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk last year.\n\nThe colorful gold belt, which sat propped on one of the end tables as the two men got to talking, went unmentioned during the talks, glinting under the lights.\n\nFor the first 40 minutes of their talks, Trump did not evince outward bitterness toward Zelensky, instead discussing the minerals deal they were planning to sign later in the day.\n\nIndeed, upstairs in the East Room a long wooden table had been prepared for the signing ceremony, with four chairs ready for the signatories.\n\nIt was never to be.\n\nThe vice president speaks up\n\nJoining the conversation after remaining mostly silent, Vance interjected \u2014 \u201cHold on. Hey, I want to respond to this\u201d \u2014 to make the case for Trump\u2019s efforts at bringing the conflict to an end.\n\n\u201cThe path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,\u201d he said, directing his comments to Zelensky.\n\nThat is where everything went south.\n\nA bristling Zelensky \u2013 himself unaccustomed to public rebukes after three years of stalwart Western support \u2013 indignantly laid out the ceasefires Russia had broken in the past.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What \u2013 what do you have \u2013 what do you \u2013 what do you mean?\u201d he asked incredulously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\u201d Vance responded from his place on the sofa next to Trump.\n\nIt only devolved from there.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,\u201d Vance said in a sharp reprimand. \u201cYou should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\u201d\n\nWhen Zelensky tried \u2013 somewhat unsuccessfully \u2013 to get a word in, Trump erupted in anger.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards right now,\u201d he bellowed, talking right over Zelensky when he objected.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people,\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, Trump dismissed the media from the room.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be great television, I will say that,\u201d he called out as reporters filed out.\n\nA rattled Ukrainian delegation \u2014 including the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova, who stopped taking notes during the meeting and simply placed her head in her hands \u2014 left the Oval Office to regroup in the Roosevelt Room, just down the hall.\n\nHuddling with his own key advisers to assess the situation, including Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump was enraged, saying he felt disrespected by Zelensky\u2019s tone.\n\n\u201cZelensky played it as wrong as he could play it. He came into Oval acting like a tough guy. It didn\u2019t play well. Everyone in the room felt insulted,\u201d one US official said. \u201cNow Zelensky will have to figure out how to fix this on his own. We can\u2019t fix it for him.\u201d\n\nThe president ultimately decided that Zelensky was \u201cnot in a place to negotiate,\u201d one White House official said. He directed Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver the message to the Ukrainians who were waiting nearby: It was time for Zelensky to leave.\n\n\u201cTime is not on your side here,\u201d Waltz told Fox News on Saturday, recounting his conversation with Zelensky. \u201cTime is not on your side on the battlefield. Time is not on your side in terms of the world situation, and, most importantly, US aid and the taxpayers\u2019 tolerance is not unlimited.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians protested, saying they wanted to continue the talks, the White House official said. But the request was declined.\n\nAs the plates of salad, chicken and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that had been planned for lunch sat uneaten on carts in a hallway outside the press secretary\u2019s office, the Ukrainians were instructed to leave.\n\nThe surreal day of broken diplomacy unfolded in the span of less than three hours.\n\nZelensky\u2019s motorcade left the White House gates at 1:42 p.m., with no fanfare or sendoff. He was driven a short distance away to the Hay Adams Hotel, where he and his advisers were staying.\n\nLess than an hour later, he sent a message on social media expressing his gratitude to his hosts: \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit.\u201d He added, \u201cUkraine needs just and lasting peace and we are working exactly for that.\u201d\n\nTrump allies rally around the president\n\nBy then, a White House that had started the day looking to make a deal with Ukraine had suddenly changed course and sought to turn the diplomatic uproar into a moment of strength by launching an extraordinary public relations offensive.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and VP Vance are standing up for Americans,\u201d the White House said in the first of several statements Friday afternoon. A few hours later, another message was sent with words of support from members of the Trump cabinet.\n\n\u201cAmen, Mr. President,\u201d Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said.\n\nGraham, a close ally of Trump who had met with Zelensky earlier in the day, strode to the cameras outside the West Wings. He called on Zelensky to apologize or consider stepping aside.\n\n\u201cI have never been more proud of the president,\u201d Graham said.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the East Room of the White House, the set up for a news conference for Trump and Zelensky was dismantled. A large table for the two leaders to sign the agreement, against a backdrop of three Ukrainian and three American flags, was moved away.\n\nFor the next few hours, Trump worked inside the West Wing with his staff. He was seen in the Oval Office with Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, and other advisers before he stepped out to leave the White House for the weekend.\n\nMarine One was waiting, but Trump stopped to talk one more time, trying to put his stamp on the day\u2019s remarkable turn of events.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,\u201d Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to end the death.\u201d\n\nAsked if he wanted Zelensky to step down, Trump declined to answer directly, only saying: \u201cI want somebody that\u2019s going to make peace.\u201d\n\nA whirlwind day in Washington drew to a close as Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to his Mar-a-Lago resort for the weekend. Shortly after takeoff, Zelensky came on Fox News, for an interview that Trump watched on the presidential aircraft.\n\nZelensky said he did not believe he owed Trump an apology for the fiery outbursts in the Oval Office, but expressed his regret that it all unfolded on television for the world to see.\n\n\u201cI think it was not good,\u201d Zelenksy told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. \u201cI think it was not good.\u201d\n\nBut he said he believes his relationship with Trump and America will survive.\n\n\u201cYour people helped save our people,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe are very, very thankful.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this reporting.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

These are his items, and they needed to be returned to him,\u201d Habba said. Asked about concerns around the storage of sensitive materials at Mar-a-Lago, Habba said, \u201cThey were personal items. You can\u2019t just go into somebody\u2019s home in this country. This is what differentiates us from a third world country.\u201d\n\nAs CNN previously reported, Trump allegedly kept classified documents at his Florida club, including in a public ballroom, bathroom and a bedroom."

            "full_content": "David Weiss, the federal attorney who investigated and prosecuted Hunter Biden, quietly resigned in January, NBC News has learned.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Delaware and a spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed that Weiss stepped down as both U.S. attorney and special counsel on Jan. 17 \u2014 three days before President Donald Trump began his second term.\n\nNo statement or announcement was made at the time, and a copy of Weiss\u2019 resignation letter has not been made public. By comparison, former special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s resignation was included in a court filing shortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the matter told NBC News that Weiss submitted his resignation voluntarily \u2014 he was not asked to resign, the sources said.\n\nWeiss did not respond to a request for comment Friday night.\n\nHe was succeeded by acting U.S. Attorney Shannon T. Hanson. Hanson previously worked for Weiss in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here.\n\nIt was expected that Weiss would step down at some point after he concluded his investigation and issued his final report on Biden. That report was made public Jan. 13.\n\nIn it, he bashed President Joe Biden for pardoning his son Hunter.\n\nIn the official White House statement announcing the pardon, the president described the prosecution of his son as a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d which prosecutors for the special counsel later disputed in a court filing.\n\nBiden repeatedly said during the 2024 presidential campaign, including after he dropped out, that he would not pardon his son.\n\nThe cases brought by Weiss led to a guilty verdict on gun-related charges in Delaware and a guilty plea on tax and fraud charges in California. Biden was scheduled to be sentenced in December 2024 for both cases.\n\nAs NBC News previously reported, Weiss pointedly responded to critical statements by Joe Biden about the investigation following the December pardon.\n\nWeiss wrote in his final report that the president could not \u201crewrite history,\u201d suggesting that Biden\u2019s criticism of the case against his son when he announced his pardon decision had maligned \u201cthe public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoliticians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public\u2019s confidence in our criminal justice system,\u201d Weiss wrote. \u201cThe President\u2019s statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.\u201d"

Tim Scott of South Carolina, opportunity didn't come without a struggle.\n\n\"To anyone who believes that opportunity ought not come with headwinds, I don't know where you live, but it ain't reality,\" the 59-year-old mused to a crowd on a recent afternoon overlooking the U.S. Capitol.\n\nRaised by a single mother in North Charleston, Scott described being plagued by low self-esteem after failing several courses in high school, including civics. He credits his faith for a reversal in political fortune.\n\nScott is the longest-serving Black senator in U.S. history, and the first Black chair of a standing Senate committee in his role atop the powerful Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\n\n\"If we are to overcome the obstacles in our way, it won't be red or blue. It won't be black or white. It will be green,\" the South Carolina Republican declared to rousing applause.\n\nDuring Black History Month, Scott hosted an Opportunity Summit event where he announced his goal of making $1 trillion in investments accessible in underserved communities over the next decade. He was joined by Walter Davis, a founding member of the holding company, Peachtree Providence Partners.\n\n\"It is incredibly important for us to figure out how to unlock capital for disadvantaged communities,\" Scott explained. \"My goal is to set the kind of parameters that allows for $1 trillion of capital to be set free in disadvantaged communities in the next 10 years. I believe we can get to $2 trillion!\"\n\nScott pointed to his own experience as a small business owner when he ran an insurance firm prior to entering politics.\n\n\"That's called the American way, or at least it's supposed to be the American way,\" Scott said. \"And I aim to make sure that, from a banking perspective, we have the flexibility of regulators so that small business owners with a good plan, with decent credit, have access to the capital to start hiring people from their own communities.\"\n\nScott has made economic development a core pillar of his policy agenda, which includes affordable housing, education, low tax rates and financial literacy and inclusion. He cited proposed legislation, such as the Road to Housing Act that seeks to expand housing supply, and the Empowering Main Street in America Act, meant to streamline access to capital access for more entrepreneurs.\n\n\"Those two things, housing and small businesses, transform minority communities and disadvantaged communities all across America,\" Scott said.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker also continues to champion the expansion of his Opportunity Zones initiative, bipartisan legislation passed as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act he spearheaded to provide federal tax incentives to economically distressed areas. The initiative has generated more than $85 billion in investment, according to Scott.\n\n\"He's the father of Opportunity Zones,\" President Trump touted this month during a White House Black History Month reception. \"He came into the White House, the Oval Office, with this idea, and it's probably the number one economic development project ever in our country.\"\n\nIn an op-ed Friday for Fox News, Scott said he wants to unlock opportunities for others just as his family sacrificed for him.\n\nScott told the story of his grandfather, who was born in 1921 and dropped out of school when he was 8 years old. He said he never learned to read or write, but had a photographic memory and once advised him that \"I could be a victim or I could be victorious, but I couldn't be both\"\n\n\"A man who had no access, lived long enough to watch me beat Strom Thurmond's son for Congress in the place where the Civil War started,\" Scott reflected. \"Our relatives have paid too high a price for us not to see discomfort as a motivating factor for our success.\""

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the closing weeks of last year\u2019s presidential campaign, House Speaker Mike Johnson quickly walked back remarks he made while standing alongside a vulnerable Republican member in New York.\n\nJohnson had pledged to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act if Donald Trump became president \u2014 a position he quickly realized was not popular in battleground districts and could hurt his members\u2019 re-election bids.\n\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act is not on the agenda for repeal,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that soon followed his October comments.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nFast-forward to Tuesday, and Trump, now president, made a request of Johnson on camera during a nationally televised speech before a joint session of Congress: Repeal the CHIPS Act.\n\n\u201cYour CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing,\u201d Trump said, weaving at Democrats after noting a Taiwanese semiconductor company\u2019s recently announced an investment in the U.S. \u201cWe give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that was important to them was they didn\u2019t want to pay the tariffs,\u201d Trump continued, before addressing Johnson directly. \u201cYou should get rid of the CHIPS Act. And whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt. Or any other reason you want to.\u201d\n\nWhile Johnson proceeded to stand and clap following Trump\u2019s suggestion, the reception on Wednesday from other Republicans was far icier. Though Republicans were aware of Trump\u2019s opposition to the legislation, senior lawmakers weren\u2019t given a heads up that Trump would make those demands during his joint address, and they have no plans to take up a repeal of the law anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe have too many other items to deal with that are higher on the list,\u201d one top Republican leadership aide said. \u201cI highly doubt this will be addressed in any upcoming package.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a huge appetite for that,\u201d echoed a senior Senate Republican aide.\n\nThe legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. It allocated $280 billion in new funding to boost the domestic production of semiconductors and chips, and to bolster research and development. Funding has been awarded to projects in roughly two dozen states, according to the Commerce Department\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly what he was getting at there,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. \u201cThere are some questions around what that statement meant, but there certainly are ways we ought to be able to take all these restrictions off how the money is being spent. He\u2019s right about that, there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\n\nTrump, as well as some conservatives, have criticized the legislation as offering subsidies for wealthy companies, with the president suggesting that tariffs would be far more effective in getting semiconductor companies to open up shop in the U.S.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Wednesday, Johnson said there is \u201cwork we need to do to address the CHIPS Act,\u201d voicing concerns with the Biden administration\u2019s implementation of the law.\n\nHe added that Republicans will \u201cwait on\u201d Trump\u2019s upcoming budget proposal to \u201csee how he handles\u201d the CHIPS Act before making any decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk and discussion about it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nYet Republican senators who supported the legislation were caught by surprise by Trump\u2019s remarks during his Tuesday address.\n\nSen Todd Young, R-Ind., said Wednesday that they conflicted with assurances he was given by Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees in an effort to secure his vote for their confirmation.\n\n\u201cI have to admit, I was surprised,\u201d Young, the lead Republican on the legislation, told reporters. \u201cHis comments seemed in tension with the reassurances I had received privately and publicly from his now-Cabinet [members], reassurances which I sought in order to be supportive of certain nominees.\u201d\n\nYoung said he\u2019s reached out to the White House after the address.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with them, seeking clarity,\u201d he added. \u201cI remain hopeful and frankly my expectation remains that we will be actively working on them to improve the program, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m looking to the future.\u201d\n\nSeventeen Senate Republicans voted to support the legislation in 2022, though some of those members are no longer senators. In the House, 24 Republicans voted for final passage of the bill.\n\nThe legislation has been largely considered a successful effort to jump-start chip manufacturing in the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to happen,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Wednesday when asked if he would support a repeal of the legislation, which he backed in 2022. \u201cThe origins of that program started back in his administration, and I think what they produced is huge investments made in the United States at TSMC, Samsung, and Micron and other companies, and it\u2019s made it possible now for the president to announce this additional huge investment by TSMC for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a fellow supporter of the legislation, said he would be curious to see what Trump has in mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see what he\u2019s going to replace it with,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally speaking, I want to bring chip manufacturing here, but if he\u2019s got a different way to do it, I\u2019m open-minded.\u201d\n\nA second senior GOP Senate aide said Republicans were unlikely to even be able to repeal the CHIPS Act in the coming weeks, given pressing needs around spending and reconciliation bills.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be time with what we need to do on the floor,\u201d this person said. \u201cCHIPS will be complicated to actually unpack too because it has financial hooks already in the states.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a lead author of the legislation, said in a statement Wednesday that the legislation was supported by members of both parties \u201cbecause we need it to strengthen our national security, stay ahead of China, bolster our supply chains, and bring manufacturing back home from overseas.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are already feeling the positive impacts and new economic energy in their towns in every corner of America, from Ohio to Arizona,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI do not think the president will find much support in Congress for undermining these CHIPS investments and the massive amount of jobs they are creating.\u201d\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said the CHIPS Act was predicated on lessons learned during the first Trump administration \u201cthat when we didn\u2019t have our supply chains here, there were enormous disruptions in things for which there was a global demand and that we didn\u2019t make here, and it jeopardized our national security as well as our health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that was sound policy, that helped us economically, and we should stand behind it,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nThe law was passed under the 60-vote threshold, meaning it\u2019ll require 60 Senate votes to repeal. Republicans hold 53 seats.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing this administration with great regularity flout the Congress. \u2026 We could see some of that in this dimension, too,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting we will. I\u2019m just saying, we\u2019ve already seen that in other arenas.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s backtracking last fall came as he was in the district of a member who was seeing benefits from the legislation, then-Rep. Brandon Williams, R-N.Y., highlighting the potential political backlash for seeking to undo the legislation.\n\nAfter Johnson said Republicans were likely to repeal the CHIPS Act, Williams stood next to him and vowed to \u201cremind\u201d Johnson \u201cnight and day\u201d about the importance of the law.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s an important thing for your district, you need this guy there to make that case,\u201d Johnson replied.\n\nSoon after their public comments wrapped, Johnson released a statement saying the legislation may not be on the chopping block but that \u201cthere could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill \u2014 to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements.\u201d\n\nWilliams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after the event and that the speaker \u201capologized profusely, saying he misheard the question.\u201d\n\nWilliams ultimately lost his House race. In January, Trump nominated him to be the Energy Department\u2019s undersecretary for nuclear security.\n\nCORRECTION (March 6, 2025, 11:52 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the number of House Republicans who voted for final passage of the CHIPS Act. It was 24, not one.\n\nAllan Smith reported from New York; Frank Thorp V, Sahil Kapur and Julie Tsirkin reported from Washington, D.C."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to remove the head of a government watchdog agency while a legal challenge to his firing plays out.\n\nIn a brief, unsigned order issued Wednesday afternoon, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the Trump administration to put on hold a lower-court ruling that said Trump\u2019s firing of Hampton Dellinger was unlawful. That ruling said Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, was entitled to stay at his post.\n\n\u201cThis order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\u201d the appeals court said in its order Wednesday. \u201cAppellants have satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court said it would expedite its review of the lower-court ruling.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Dellinger will appeal the court\u2019s order to the US Supreme Court on an emergency basis. The case has already gone to the high court once before. CNN has reached out to Dellinger\u2019s office for comment.\n\nThe court\u2019s order is the latest dramatic development in Dellinger\u2019s ongoing fight to keep his job after Trump moved to fire him in early February. In an earlier episode of legal wrangling, Dellinger was able to stay on the job while a federal judge in Washington, DC, considered his challenge to his ousting.\n\nIn a major ruling issued last Saturday, that judge \u2013 Amy Berman Jackson \u2013 rejected Trump\u2019s argument that the federal law saying the special counsel can be removed \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIt would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the legal proceedings, Trump asked the Supreme Court to step in on his behalf, but the high court blocked his effort to immediately fire Dellinger \u2013 deciding to wait for lower courts to weigh in on the legality of the dismissal.\n\nDellinger was positioned to be a significant independent official in the government whom federal civil servants could go to as whistleblowers and have some protection from retaliation. Typically a relatively low-profile but important job in the federal workforce, the Office of the Special Counsel is taking on new significance in Trump\u2019s era of removing government employees after considering their political loyalties.\n\nThe OSC is unrelated to special counsels like Jack Smith or Robert Mueller who are appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations.\n\nFollowing Jackson\u2019s ruling, Trump, represented by the Justice Department, quickly pressed the DC Circuit to put the order on hold, arguing that the Constitution \u201cempowers the President to remove sole agency heads, such as the Special Counsel, at will.\u201d\n\nBut attorneys for Dellinger urged the intermediate court to reject the administration\u2019s request and to review the merits of the case in the ordinary course.\n\nThe appeals court, they wrote in a filing, \u201cshould reserve these weighty issues for full deliberation and maintain stability and continuity at OSC in the interim.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz and John Fritze contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Facebook, Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s got to be strange when your sibling becomes an online sensation, like when Australian academic Rachael Gunn (a.k.a. Raygun) rocketed to fame during the Olympics last summer for her less-than-stellar performance in breakdancing \u2014 a viral event that was compounded by the allegation that she rigged the system to get on the Aussie national team ahead of some more qualified candidates.\n\nRaygun may now know how it feels to be on the other side of that dynamic. Months after everybody had moved on from her brave performance in Paris \u2014 and her retirement from competitive breakdancing \u2014 Raygun\u2019s brother is the Gunn sibling everyone in Australia is talking about. On Wednesday, Brendan Gunn was charged with a crypto-related crime by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn, Gunn is a director at Mormarkets Pty Ltd, a firm that takes investors\u2019 cash and turns it into crypto or invests it abroad. In the spring of 2020, regulators say that Gunn \u201cdealt with two bank cheques\u201d worth $181,000 Australian dollars (about $115,000 USD). These \u201ccheques\u201d were allegedly the proceeds of a crime. Despite knowing this, they charged, Gunn kept trying to open bank accounts even though bank officials \u201crepeatedly\u201d informed Gunn that they were concerned about these deposits. If that sounds confusing, Australian news outlets are calling this \u201calleged money laundering\u201d or \u201cmoney reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime.\u201d As it happens, people are also considered innocent until proven guilty in Australia.\n\nGunn does not appear to have entered a plea, and his next court date is expected on April 29. In addition to his work converting cash to crypto (something that is pretty easy for anyone to do with a service), Gunn also describes himself as a \u201chuman-centric\u201d recruiter who \u201cdiscovers the \u2018who\u2019\n\nfor exceptional teams.\u201d After his sister\u2019s brush with controversy, he held strong in his support. \u201cYou will always be a winner to me,\u201d Gunn wrote on X."

Plus, Andrea Mitchell dives into what\u2019s next for Ukraine and its European allies as the United States continues to scale back assistance.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nWhy Trump isn't hitting the road after his speech\n\nA go-to move for presidents who\u2019ve just delivered prime-time speeches before joint sessions of Congress is to quickly travel outside of Washington to start selling the glut of proposals they\u2019ve laid out before the biggest televised audiences they might attract all year.\n\nDonald Trump did just that as a new president eight years ago, but this time he appears to be staying put, Peter Nicholas, Olympia Sonnier and Yamiche Alcindor report.\n\nComing off his address Tuesday night, Trump had no post-speech travel in the offing, a senior administration official said. He remained at the White House on Wednesday, meeting with members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to discuss government funding.\n\nNo place like home: Trump has kept presidential travel to a minimum in his second term.\n\nApart from a whirlwind two-day trip that included stops in North Carolina, California and Nevada in the first week of his new term and a stop in New Orleans last month for the Super Bowl, Trump\u2019s only travel outside Washington has been to South Florida, where he has a home and ready access to his golf clubs.\n\nThe reason appears to be twofold. One, Trump has long been a bit of a homebody, relishing the gilded comforts of his Palm Beach and northern New Jersey resorts, along with his namesake Manhattan tower.\n\n\u201cHe likes sleeping in his own bed,\u201d a White House official in Trump\u2019s first term said in an interview. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like hotels. He was more than happy to give a speech somewhere as long as he could fly out the same day and sleep in his own bed.\u201d\n\nTwo, in terms of raw politics, Trump\u2019s name won\u2019t be on the ballot again, meaning there\u2019s no compelling need to blanket the swing states. A person involved in Trump\u2019s political operation said the next time he has to travel for political reasons \u201cwill be for the midterms to sell candidates.\u201d\n\nDelegating tasks: Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance has been eager to hit the road, visiting the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas, today.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nAs the U.S. rolls more assistance back, Ukraine scrambles on next steps\n\nBy Andrea Mitchell\n\nYou rarely, if ever, see a CIA director reveal on national television that the United States is stopping intelligence-sharing with a wartime ally, on top of halting weapons shipments, as John Ratcliffe did today on Fox Business.\n\nThe message to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: There are consequences for not obeying the will of the American president. European NATO partners are scrambling to backfill for what the United States isn\u2019t providing, but they don\u2019t have the air defenses or intelligence assets that only the United States can offer.\n\nNow, French President Emmanuel Macron is proposing a partial ceasefire. Zelenskyy is doing verbal backflips, repeatedly apologizing for challenging President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. And Trump signaled in his speech to Congress that he might be open to resume negotiations with Ukraine while declaring he has received \u201cstrong signals the Russians are ready for peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be beautiful?\u201d he added.\n\nIndeed, if Russian leader Vladimir Putin were ready for peace, other than on his terms, it would be \u201cbeautiful.\u201d But there is no U.S. intelligence assessment or evidence from the tempo of Russian attacks against Ukraine indicating that\u2019s true.\n\nStill, even some of Ukraine\u2019s strongest European supporters tell me they wish Zelenskyy had found a way to be more diplomatic and flatter Trump last week. Although they understand that the leader of a besieged nation can\u2019t easily ignore that 20,000 Ukrainian children have been kidnapped by Russia and given new names and identities when he hears Trump extol Putin as a partner in peace.\n\nFor decades, U.S. presidents of both parties have supported NATO as a multilateral bulwark against the former Soviet Union and now Russia. This administration\u2019s sudden reversal of that bipartisan foreign policy is shocking enough. But since Friday\u2019s Oval Office showdown with Zelenskyy, the transformation of lifelong cold warriors is truly head-spinning.\n\nA few stalwarts are beginning to speak up. Asked last night about the halt in U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said: \u201cLook, if I am Putin, I\u2019m loving a pause, I\u2019m plussing up troops at the border, I\u2019m trying to get more drones from Iran, I\u2019m trying to get more crap from North Korea, I\u2019m getting the illicit money coming from China, and I\u2019m loving a pause and I\u2019m loving a cessation of a resupply to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Tillis\u2019 message to the administration?\n\nHe said, \u201cPutin\u2019s a liar and a murderer. Let\u2019s get it right with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPoll result\n\nYesterday, we asked you how long you thought Trump\u2019s speech to Congress would last. The most common answer was 90 minutes \u2014 not far off from the roughly 100 minutes he ended up going for.\n\nTrump set a record for the longest speech to a joint session of Congress or State of the Union address, besting Bill Clinton, who spoke for nearly 89 minutes in 2000, according to the University of California-Santa Barbara\u2019s American Presidency Project.\n\nThat\u2019s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today\u2019s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Ben Kamisar.\n\nIf you have feedback \u2014 likes or dislikes \u2014 email us at politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a fan, please share with everyone and anyone.

That\u2019s basically what happened to Attorney General Pam Bondi last week \u2014 but in this case, the recipient was the Trump White House and MAGA conspiracy theorists, and the present was previously released information on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, repackaged into a binder.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s new attorney general managed to anger people across the political spectrum last week when she teased the release of new files related to the Epstein investigation on Fox News, only to hand out binders full of previously released documents to far-right influencers, including Mike Cernovich, Liz Wheeler, Jack Posobiec, Rogan O\u2019Handley (a.k.a. DC Draino), and Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik.\n\nSo what was Bondi thinking? On Tuesday, ABC News reported that neither the dozen-plus MAGA influencers nor the senior White House officials who organized the February 27 event were informed of Bondi\u2019s plans to distribute the Epstein files, as she thought it would be a welcome surprise:\n\nAhead of the Justice Department\u2019s public release, Bondi directed her staff to compile binders of the materials to distribute to the influencers at the event, sources said. She also instructed her team not to inform White House officials of the plan, according to multiple sources, apparently thinking the surprise would be well received inside the West Wing.\n\nThe White House had organized the event a week earlier to engage influential pro-Trump voices who the president credits with aiding his 2024 campaign. According to multiple sources, the agenda never included distributing Epstein-related materials.\n\nIt seems the viral images of the influencers brandishing the binders \u2014 which were marked \u201cDeclassified,\u201d though they did not contain official government declassification markings \u2014 were not part of her plan. Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel unexpectedly handed out the documents at the meeting, then press cameras that were set up to cover British prime minister Keir Starmer\u2019s visit happened to capture the influencers leaving the White House.\n\nTrump does love made-for-TV theatrics, but usually he\u2019s the one berating a foreign leader or holding the map-doctoring Sharpie. ABC reports that the incident left White House officials scrambling to smooth things over with some of the president\u2019s most loyal supporters (though Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that):\n\nWhite House staff moved quickly to try and contain the fallout, privately reaching out to influencers who were critical of Bondi and the move online, according to sources.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, responding to a request for comment from ABC News, said, \u201cEveryone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump. Any notion to the contrary is completely false.\u201d\n\nEither way, it doesn\u2019t seem as though Trump himself is too angry about the botched stunt. He gave Bondi and Patel a shout-out during his address to Congress on Tuesday, as he claimed that \u201cour justice system has been turned upside down by radical-left lunatics\u201d and gestured at Democrats in the room.\n\nAnd Bondi has managed to deflect some of the blame onto the FBI\u2019s New York office. After the binders stunt flopped, she accused the office of withholding information about the Epstein investigation without providing evidence to back up that claim. The head of the office, James Dennehy, was forced to submit his resignation the following day. Dennehy said he \u201cwas not given a reason for this decision.\u201d But in addition to clashing with Bondi over the Epstein files, he had angered the Trump administration by publicly supporting bureau leaders who resisted pressure to turn over the names of people who investigated the Capitol riot.\n\nIn a Monday interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Bondi claimed that the FBI has now turned over a \u201ctruckload\u201d of Epstein files, which the bureau is reviewing \u201cas fast as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new administration, and everything\u2019s going to come out to the public. The public has the right to know. Americans have a right to know.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: Attorney General Pam Bondi says a \"truckload\" of Jeffrey Epstein files arrived on Friday, says FBI Director Kash Patel is looking through them now.\n\n\n\n\"We got them all Friday at 8AM. Thousands of pages of documents. I have the FBI going through them.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's now in the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rxABwmO5p2 \u2014 Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) March 4, 2025\n\nSo while Bondi\u2019s big surprise may have flopped, all\u2019s well that ends well. It looks as if she isn\u2019t facing any serious consequences, a well-respected FBI official who annoyed the Trump administration has been let go for unclear reasons, and the search for the (possibly nonexistent) Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d continues."

            "full_content": "Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nSince taking office, Donald Trump and his administration have embarked on an unsparing quest to reduce government spending by making substantial cuts to federal agencies across all sectors. Their efforts have resulted in slashed departmental contracts and programs, as well as mass layoffs of federal workers, in exchange for a questionable amount of savings.\n\nThough the cuts have prompted pushback and legal challenges, the president\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency agenda shows no signs of abating and the administration stands poised to institute further cuts to another crucial agency. The Associated Press reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs intends to eliminate at least 80,000 jobs as part of a restructuring of the agency, which provides health care and other benefits and services to American veterans.\n\nIn an internal memo, VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek outlined goals to return the department to its 2019 staffing levels to \u201cresize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.\u201d According to the outlet Government Executive, which first reported on the memo, the VA currently employs 482,000 staffers and would have to eliminate 83,000 jobs to reach its 2019 level of 399,000 workers. Syrek urged agency officials to work alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE in these efforts and to \u201cmove out aggressively while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach.\u201d\n\nIf implemented, the substantial cuts will impact veterans not just as care recipients but also as employees. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, veterans make up about 30 percent of the federal workforce. Democratic members of the House Appropriations Committee estimate that Musk and Trump\u2019s DOGE initiative has resulted in the firing of nearly 6,000 veterans from the overall civilian federal workforce as of late February. Several congressional Democrats sought to highlight this fact on Tuesday by inviting federal workers, many of them veterans, who were fired as a result of the administration\u2019s cuts to attend Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress as their guests.\n\nLast week, Trump was asked about the firings impacting veteran workers during a press conference with Keir Starmer, the prime minister of the United Kingdom. The president said he was aware that veterans had been caught up in the layoffs but gave no signal that a change in approach was coming. \u201cWe\u2019re watching that very carefully, and we hope it\u2019s going to be as small a number as possible. But we are having great success in slimming down our government,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump continued, \u201cWe love our veterans. We\u2019re gonna take good care of them.\u201d"

The second point was a reference to Canada\u2019s housing crisis, in which housing costs skyrocketed and banks began offering absurdly long mortgages under Trudeau\u2019s policies. The Conservatives believe an important part of the answer lies in cutting red tape to increase new home construction.\n\nWATCH \u2014 Trump on Negotiations with Trudeau: We Don\u2019t Need Canada \u201cfor Anything\u201d:\n\nPoilievre largely dismissed President Trump\u2019s complaints about Canada\u2019s weak border security and fentanyl smuggling, although he conceded that Trudeau\u2019s Liberals \u201chave not done enough on fentanyl,\u201d which is killing huge numbers of Canadians as well as Americans.\n\nPoilievre said Trump \u201cstabbed America\u2019s best friend in the back\u201d with his tariffs.\n\n\u201cMy message to the president is this: Canada will fight back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will defend our people and our economy, and we will put Canada first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that our economy will suffer,\u201d Poilievre conceded. \u201cBut so will yours, President Trump. In fact, you\u2019re already paying the price with trillions of dollars erased in stock market value over the last month of these threats.\u201d\n\nWATCH \u2014 Oh, Canada\u2026 Trump Threatens Canada\u2019s Leadership With Increased Tariff\u2019s for \u201cAbuse\u201d of USA:\n\n\u201cAlready, Americans are paying higher gas prices as, at midnight, a new American gas tax kicked in on U.S. working-class taxpayers and motorists,\u201d he said.\n\nPoilievre predicted that American workers would lose their jobs as they lost access to Canadian raw materials they were \u201cgetting at an incredible and ridiculous bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your businesses will be selling fewer products to your closest neighbor \u2014 and that\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d he warned.\n\nPoilievre said Canadians are \u201cslow to anger and quick to forgive,\u201d but Trump\u2019s tariffs have \u201cprovoked\u201d them to fight back.\u201d\n\nAddressing the \u201cmillions of Canadians who are anxious today\u201d after Trump \u201cattacked\u201d the Canadian economy, the Conservative opposition leader promised to fight for their jobs, families, and \u201cchance at owning and paying off a home\u201d \u2014 a dig at Trudeau and his liberals, on a Conservative signature issue, slipped into a speech largely directed at Trump.\n\n\u201cI will fight to put Canada first,\u201d he promised.\n\nPoilievre\u2019s feisty attitude could be partly due to polls that show the Liberals coming back after a disastrous year in which they ran 20 points behind the Conservatives and seemed in real danger of slipping into third place behind the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP).\n\nSome of this polling surge could be due to voters deciding they disliked Trudeau much more than they disapproved of his party, so with the unpopular prime minister on his way out, the Liberals recaptured some lost ground.\n\nSome political analysts in both Canada and the U.S. are convinced Trump\u2019s tariff threats also played a role in jolting the Liberals back to life. Canadians are said to be furious at Trump, and with Trudeau gone, they appear willing to take a second look at the Liberals as the party more likely to fight back against Trump with both passion and effectiveness.\n\n\u201cPeople who have followed Canadian politics for a long time can\u2019t think of an instance where we\u2019ve seen a shift in vote intention that\u2019s as rapid and as significant as what the polls are currently showing,\u201d University of Calgary political science professor told the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nPoilievre\u2019s remarks on Monday and Tuesday were clearly calibrated to reassure Canadian voters he is ready and willing to fight back against Trump, and also to remind voters that the Liberals left Canada in a weak position for that fight.\n\nPoilievre finds himself competing against Liberal leaders whose task is to convince voters they can handle Trump far better than the exhausted pipsqueak who will shortly vacate the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 unless the reinvigorated and suddenly tough-talking Trudeau decides his hour has not passed after all.\n\nTrump raised that possibility in a social media post Wednesday after a phone call with Trudeau he described as \u201csomewhat friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place, which made me curious, like, what\u2019s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!\u201d Trump wrote."

Whatever happens, we need to provide ourselves with more arms, more equipment in terms of defense, to provide a dissuasive force.\"\n\nMacron warned that Ukraine cannot be abandoned in its fight against Russia because, he said: \"Who can believe that in this context, Russia will stop at Ukraine? Russia has become, and will remain, a threat to France and Europe.\u201d\n\nThe French president made clear that France and other European countries must take concrete steps, including investing in defense and military capabilities, to protect the security of their nations and Ukraine's.\n\n\u201cTo remain a spectator in this dangerous world would be crazy,\" Macron said. \"The initiatives for peace are going in the right direction, and I welcome them, and we need to continue to help Ukrainians resist until they can negotiate with Russia a solid and lasting peace for themselves and for all of us. The path to peace cannot be achieved by abandoning Ukraine.\"\n\nMacron reiterated remarks made by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the weekend at a defense summit in London that Europe may have to put boots on the ground in Ukraine.\n\n\"Our forces will be there if necessary to guarantee peace, not before a peace agreement is signed,\" Macron said Wednesday. \"We will continue to meet with allies to move toward the signing of such an agreement. It's a plan for a lasting, solid, verifiable peace agreement, which we're working on with European partners and Ukraine.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X that he was grateful for Macron's \"clear vision and our joint efforts to achieve peace.\"\n\n\"Peace must be real, not just a word\u2014it cannot mean Ukraine\u2019s capitulation or collapse. It must be just, reliable, and lasting, and this can only be achieved through strong and long-term security guarantees \u2014 for Ukraine, Europe, and the entire world,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nMacron and Starmer have teamed up in a desperate attempt to heal American-Ukraine ties after last Friday\u2019s extraordinary shouting match at the White House involving Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Both Starmer and Macron have sought to balance their yearslong outspoken support for Zelenskyy with the need to retain good relations with the United States.\n\nTeeing up his speech, Macron said on X that it came in a \u201cmoment of great uncertainty, when the world is facing its greatest challenges.\u201d Starmer told British lawmakers Wednesday that he had spoken with Trump three times since he visited the White House last week.\n\nThis Anglo-French mission has at times appeared onerous.\n\nAfter the Oval Office spat, Trump continued to berate Zelenskyy on social media, with the president and some of his team suggesting that Ukraine\u2019s leader could or should be ousted from office. The administration then paused aid to Ukraine, a vital lifeline holding back the Kremlin war machine.\n\nThe aid freeze is a serious blow not just to Ukraine, whose biggest military backer is the U.S., but also Europe, which is years away from being able to defend itself against Russia without Washington.\n\nThings shifted Tuesday when Trump said during his joint address to Congress that he had received \u201can important letter\u201d from Zelenskyy stating the Ukrainian president's desire for peace and his gratitude for U.S. support.\n\nZelenskyy confirmed the thrust of this missive in an X post on Tuesday, calling the White House clash \u201cregrettable,\u201d thanking Trump\u2019s team and saying he was ready to sign a deal giving Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s rich mineral wealth.\n\nStill, there is much to resolve.\n\nUkraine is reluctant to sign a ceasefire without \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d \u2014 meaning protection from Europe and the U.S. against Russia violating the truce, as it has done before.\n\nSupporters and independent analysts worry that a ceasefire would allow Russia to regroup \u2014 as well as showing Russian President Vladimir Putin that attacking a European country is not only permitted, but rewarded.\n\nZelenskyy once stood firm in demanding these security guarantees. But now facing pressure from Moscow and Washington, he suggested on X that he would accept a minerals deal that was merely a looser \u201cstep toward\u201d such promises."

            "full_content": "Photo: Win McNamee/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress on Tuesday night felt familiar, though it was delivered in a much different venue. In a tone reminiscent of a campaign speech, the president boasted about his accomplishments and claimed to have a strong mandate from the American people, prompting raucous cheers and frequent standing ovations from Republican members. But unlike at a Trump rally, the audience was also filled with disapproving Democrats. And things took a turn early on as Representative Al Green, a Texas Democrat, stood and disrupted Trump\u2019s speech, shouting, \u201cYou have no mandate to cut Medicaid!\u201d\n\nAfter multiple warnings, House Speaker Mike Johnson directed the Sergeant of Arms to remove Green from the House chamber to the sounds of cheers and some Republicans singing, \u201cHey, hey, hey, good-bye.\u201d\n\n.@RepAlGreen (D-TX) is removed from the Joint Session of Congress. pic.twitter.com/GJVHJpZHGc \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) March 5, 2025\n\nDuring his time in Congress, Green has challenged Trump many times. He filed the first articles of impeachment against Trump back in 2017 following the firing of FBI director James Comey, despite a lack of support from many in his party at the time. He went on to file two more attempts at impeachment. Green told reporters outside the chamber that he spoke out in defense of programs like Medicare and Medicaid that are at risk for cuts under Trump\u2019s administration and that he\u2019s ready to accept any repercussions from his actions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll accept the punishment. It\u2019s worth it to let people know that there\u2019s some of us who are going to stand up against this president\u2019s desire to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security,\u201d he said.\n\n.@RepAlGreen after being removed from Joint Session of Congress: \"I'll accept the punishment.

In an interview with Fox News following Trump\u2019s speech, Johnson expressed support for censuring Green for his disruption, calling his actions \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect that there\u2019ll be a censure resolution brought on the floor to discipline him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do that inside the House. We have to maintain decorum.\u201d\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus indicated Wednesday morning that it would be filing a censure motion against Green later in the day. Representatives Troy Nehls and Dan Newhouse intend to introduce their own separate motions against Green. The internal disciplinary sanction requires a majority vote from the full House of Representatives, which the Republican Party currently holds by a slim margin. If passed, Green would be only the fifth House member to be censured since 2010."

No cause of death was provided.\n\n\u201cThroughout his career, he was known for his bipartisan leadership, dedication to his constituents, and unwavering commitment to improving the lives of all Houstonians,\u201d the office said.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership informed members of Turner\u2019s death during a meeting Wednesday morning, according to a source in the room.\n\nLater in the day, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Democratic colleagues held a moment of silence at an afternoon event in honor of Turner, calling his passing tragic and unexpected. The Democratic leader remembered Turner as a \u201cpowerful, profound principled public servant.\u201d\n\nTurner was sworn into Congress in January after serving eight years as the mayor of Texas\u2019 biggest city. Before that, he also spent 27 years in the Texas House where he was a powerhouse on the state\u2019s appropriations panel.\n\n\u201cA remarkable public servant who impacted millions of people. He rose from poverty but never forgot where he came from. It is a terrible loss for the city and a personal loss for me,\u201d Houston Mayor John Whitmire said of Turner in a statement posted by the City of Houston.\n\nTurner came out of retirement to succeed the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who was her own force in Texas politics during her two decades in the US House.\n\nTurner was the preferred pick by Jackson Lee\u2019s children in the competitive primary to replace her after her death in July 2024. He vowed to, like Jackson Lee, devote his time to securing federal resources for the sprawling district.\n\nThe 70-year-old said in 2022 that he had been treated for bone cancer but declared himself \u201ccancer free\u201d in an interview with the Texas Tribune later that year.\n\nHis death came as a shock for his fellow congressional Democrats, who had sat with him at the president\u2019s joint address Tuesday evening. He attended the speech with his guest, a Houston resident and mother whose 2-year-old daughter has a rare genetic condition and relies on Medicaid to survive.\n\nIn recent months, Turner had been outspoken \u2014 and in his words, \u201chopeful\u201d \u2014 about how Democrats can rebound from the GOP\u2019s electoral win in November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic simply because I know what we are made of,\u201d Turner told a crowd at the Houston Black American Democrats last month. \u201cThe only way that we lose is that we fail to use what we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful. I did not come with a head bowed. I know the president is in office. A lot of things he has done. But I\u2019m optimistic. I\u2019m positive. I don\u2019t have a hard time going to bed at night.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Among the many problems that have emerged in federal law enforcement over the last six weeks is the campaign against key personnel. Indeed, there\u2019s been an unsubtle campaign to purge federal law enforcement of prosecutors and FBI officials who worked on cases that Donald Trump didn\u2019t like.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi suggested this week that these efforts are ongoing \u2014 and likely to get worse. USA Today reported:\n\nThe Justice Department has fired all of Jan. 6 special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s staff and is working to \u2018root out\u2019 anyone at the department and FBI who it believes doesn\u2019t like President Donald Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi has confirmed. ... Over eight minutes, she described a scorched-earth effort currently underway to purge the 115,000-employee Justice Department of any staffers involved in investigating Trump during or after his first term in office and other perceived enemies of the president.\n\n\u201cWell, first and foremost, we got rid of the Jack Smith team. Gone. Those people are gone,\u201d the increasingly hyper-partisan attorney general said. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to find ... a lot of people in the FBI and also in the Department of Justice who despise Donald Trump, despise us, don\u2019t want to be there.\u201d\n\nBondi added, \u201c[W]e\u2019re going to root them out. We will find them, and they will no longer be employed.\u201d\n\nJust so we\u2019re all clear, the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official isn\u2019t talking about identifying Justice Department employees who are necessarily bad at their jobs. Rather, Bondi appeared to describe a process in which law enforcement personnel who disagree with Trump will be hunted down and kicked out of the department.\n\nWhen it comes to matters of law and politics, I tend not to agree with National Review\u2019s Ed Whelan on much, but the conservative lawyer\u2019s take on the attorney general\u2019s comments rang true.\n\n\u201cCareer DOJ lawyers who do their jobs (most of which have nothing to do with politics) should not be rooted out because they \u2018despise\u2019 the president,\u201d Whelan explained online. \u201cThat\u2019s true of those who despised Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Biden just as it\u2019s true of those who despise Trump. It\u2019s very bad that AG Bondi either doesn\u2019t understand this or needs to pretend she doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDuring his tenure as attorney general, Merrick Garland went to extraordinary lengths to avoid appearing partisan or political in any way, often to the frustration of Democratic lawmakers and the party\u2019s base. Garland had seen what had transpired during Trump\u2019s first term, and by all accounts, he was determined to restore integrity to the office.\n\nThe idea that he\u2019d go on national television and vow to \u201croot out\u201d conservative critics of the Democratic White House at the Justice Department is ridiculous.\n\nAnd yet, here we are, watching his successor infuse her office with partisan politics at a breathtaking pace.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage."

            "full_content": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nEven as he was delivering the most partisan address to Congress maybe ever, Donald Trump\u2019s public support seemed to be regularly eroding. An updated FiveThirtyEight average of Trump\u2019s approval ratings on March 4 showed him going underwater for the first time since reoccupying the White House, with 47.6 percent approval and 47.9 percent disapproval. That puts Trump back in the same territory of public opinion he occupied during his first term as president, where (per Gallup) he never achieved more than 50 percent job approval, and averaged a mere 41 percent.\n\nPerhaps Trump will get lucky and conditions in the country will improve enough to validate his agenda, but it\u2019s more likely that the same sour public climate that overwhelmed Joe Biden will now afflict his predecessor and successor.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos survey that pushed Trump\u2019s numbers into negative territory showed a mood very different from the 47th president\u2019s boasts about a new \u201cgolden age\u201d for our country:\n\nThirty-four percent of Americans say that the country is headed in the right direction, compared to 49% who say it is off on the wrong track. When it comes to several specific issues, Americans are more likely to say things are off on the wrong track than going in the right direction: cost of living (22% right direction / 60% wrong track), the national economy (31% right direction / 51% wrong track), national politics (33% right direction / 50% wrong track), American foreign policy (33% right direction / 49% wrong track), and employment and jobs (33% right direction / 47% wrong track).\n\nSo all the hype about Trump being a popular president who was in the midst of engineering a major realignment of the American electorate is already looking more than a bit hollow. Trump has a solid Republican base of support and a solid Democratic opposition, with independents currently leaning towards the Democratic Party on most issues. Perhaps Trump\u2019s agenda will gain momentum and support, but since he\u2019s not trying to reach out beyond his party\u2019s base at all, he\u2019s going to need a lift from Americans who only voted for him in 2024 as the lesser of evils and may not vote in the 2026 midterms at all.\n\nAt present Trump has lost whatever presidential \u201choneymoon\u201d he initially enjoyed after his return to the White House, and needs to find new converts to return to genuine popularity. He\u2019s not off to a great start."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA divided Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to keep billions of dollars in foreign aid approved by Congress frozen.\n\nHowever, the court did not immediately say when the money must be released, allowing the White House to continue to dispute the issue in lower courts.\n\nThe ruling was 5-4.\n\nThe order was unsigned but four conservative justices dissented \u2013 Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. That put five justices in the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe majority noted that given a court-ordered deadline to spend the money last week had already passed, the lower courts should \u201cclarify what obligations the government must fulfil to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order.\u201d\n\nIn a strongly worded dissent, Alito wrote that he was \u201cstunned\u201d by the court\u2019s decision to permit the lower-court judge to order the administration to unfreeze the foreign aid at issue in the case.\n\nAlito added: \u201cA federal court has many tools to address a party\u2019s supposed nonfeasance. Self-aggrandizement of its jurisdiction is not one of them.\u201d\n\nWhile the ruling was 5-4, it was \u201cextremely modest,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\n\u201cThe unsigned order does not actually require the Trump administration to immediately make up to $2 billion in foreign aid payments; it merely clears the way for the district court to compel those payments, presumably if it is more specific about the contracts that have to be honored,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cThe fact that four justices nevertheless dissented \u2013 vigorously \u2013 from such a decision is a sign that the Court is going to be divided, perhaps along these exact lines, in many of the more impactful Trump-related cases that are already on their way.\u201d\n\nThe appeal raced to the high court within days \u2013 exceedingly fast by the federal judiciary\u2019s standards. It is the second case to reach the justices dealing with Trump\u2019s moves to consolidate power within the executive branch and dramatically reshape the government after taking power in January.\n\nAt the center of the case is billions in foreign aid from the State Department and the US Agency for International Development that Trump froze in January as he sought to clamp down spending and bring those agencies in line with his agenda. Several nonprofit groups that rely on the funding for global health and other programs sued, asserting that the administration\u2019s moves usurped the power of Congress to control government spending and violated a federal law that dictates how agencies make decisions.\n\nIn a brief on Friday, the groups described the administration\u2019s actions as having a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact.\n\nThey told the court that the funding \u201cadvances US interests abroad and improves \u2013 and, in many cases, literally saves \u2013 the lives of millions of people across the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn doing so, it helps stop problems like disease and instability overseas before they reach our shores,\u201d the groups said.\n\nUS District Judge Amir Ali on February 13 ordered that much of the money continue to flow on a temporary basis while he reviewed the case. Days later, the plaintiffs argued that the administration was defying that order and continuing to block the spending and Ali then ordered the Trump administration to spend the money at issue by midnight Wednesday.\n\nAli was named to the bench by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Trump administration rushed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court hours before that deadline, urging the court to at least pause it for a few days. The administration is making \u201csubstantial efforts\u201d to review payment requests and spend the money, the government agued, but it couldn\u2019t turn the spigot on fast enough to meet the Ali\u2019s timeline.\n\nThe groups that sued have balked at that explanation, arguing that a small number of political appointees within the administration \u201care refusing to authorize essentially any payments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has not taken \u2018any meaningful steps\u2019 to come into compliance,\u201d the groups said a Supreme Court filing earlier Friday.\n\nRoberts, acting alone, gave the administration a brief reprieve on Wednesday, issuing what\u2019s known as an \u201cadministrative stay\u201d that pushed pause on the case so that both sides could submit written arguments. The chief justice handles emergency cases rising from the federal appeals court in Washington, DC.\n\nAmong the groups challenging the freeze are the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, a New York-based organization working to speed HIV prevention and the Global Health Council, based in Washington, DC, which represents other groups that administer health programs.\n\nThe Trump administration revealed in court filings in the case that it is attempting to terminate more than 90% of the USAID foreign aid awards.\n\n\u201cIn total, nearly 5,800 USAID awards were terminated, and more than 500 USAID awards were retained,\u201d a filing from the administration said.\n\n\u201cThe total ceiling value of the retained awards is approximately $57 billion,\u201d the filing said.\n\nIn addition to the USAID award terminations, \u201capproximately 4,100 State awards were terminated, and approximately 2,700 State awards were retained,\u201d the government told a lower court, referring to the State Department.\n\nAid programs around the world have ground to a halt due to the sweeping funding freeze and review of billions of dollars of assistance. It also comes as the Trump administration has either placed the majority of USAID\u2019s workforce on leave or terminated them.\n\nDemocrats celebrate ruling\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats said the ruling shows that Trump\u2019s power to freeze spending is not unlimited.\n\n\u201cThat money had already been appropriated, things were already in action, and so I think the Supreme Court ruled the right way, and now the administration needs to unfreeze them and allow those contractors and the work to be done,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Commitee.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal called it \u201ca very important ruling\u201d from \u201ca Trump-dominated court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it reinforces \u2026 that Congress has authorization to appropriate money, and that people rely on that authorization for those programs, and that when you do the work, you should get paid when it\u2019s been authorized,\u201d the Washington state Democrat told CNN.\n\nAsked if she\u2019s confident the payments will be turned on, Jayapal said she\u2019s not confident about anything, \u201cbut I hope that the Trump administration will pay attention to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler and Devan Cole contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration appears to have ordered at least a partial halt to the crucial intelligence that the United States shares with Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion, according to a US military official and public remarks made by top Trump administration officials.\n\nStatements from national security adviser Mike Waltz and CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Wednesday morning indicated that a pause in intelligence sharing is in place but the extent of the limitations was not clear. Both officials also suggested that the pause may be short-lived if the president can be satisfied that Ukraine has taken steps towards negotiations to end the war \u2013 a controversial effort that appeared to be derailed after Friday\u2019s fiery Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWe are pausing, assessing, looking at everything across our security relationship,\u201d national security adviser Mike Waltz told CBS News, asked directly about intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. The Trump administration had already announced a freeze in weapons deliveries to Ukraine, part of the White House effort to attempt to pressure Kyiv into a swift end to a war it didn\u2019t start.\n\nStill, Waltz told reporters after the interview that he spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart over the phone this morning, and he projected optimism on the state of talks since Zelensky issued a statement yesterday saying that he is ready to negotiate peace.\n\n\u201cWe are having good talks on location for the next round of negotiations, on delegations, on substance. So, just in the last 24 hours since the public statement from Zelensky, and then the subsequent conversations, which I\u2019m going to walk inside and continue, I think we\u2019re going to see movement in very short order,\u201d Waltz said.\n\nZelensky\u2019s top aide Andriy Yermak said later Wednesday that Ukrainian and US officials have agreed to meet \u201cin the near future,\u201d following the phone call with Waltz.\n\nYermak, who is Zelensky\u2019s chief of staff, said he and Waltz \u201cdiscussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace\u201d during the call.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe in an interview on Fox Business on Wednesday also suggested that the pause on intelligence sharing may soon be ended.\n\n\u201cYou saw the response that President Zelensky put out,\u201d Ratcliffe said, referring to recent statements from the Ukrainian president that the country was ready to negotiate. \u201cSo I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away.\u201d\n\nIf the freeze is total and sustained, multiple sources familiar with the information shared with Ukraine over the past three years of war said, it could deal a devastating blow to Kyiv\u2019s ability to fight on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad,\u201d one source familiar with the arrangement said. \u201cCombined with the stopping of military assistance and foreign aid, it pretty much guarantees a Russian victory without there needing to be a peace deal.\u201d\n\nA top Russian lawmaker, Andrei Kartapolov, in recent days called for the US to stop providing Ukraine with intelligence, underscoring the boon Trump may have already offered Moscow on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cIt would be much more important if the Americans stopped giving them with intelligence information, then this would allow us to achieve results more quickly,\u201d Kartapolov said.\n\nSince the early days of the conflict, the US has provided extensive information on Russian force movements and locations, as well as intercepted communications about their military plans and the movement of their spies \u2013 intelligence that officials say has been as important as any American weapon system to both Ukraine\u2019s ability to protect its cities and push back on Moscow on the battlefield.\n\nWhen Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2022, the source familiar with the sharing said, Russia was planning an airborne operation to seize key facilities in Kyiv that could have allowed them to sack the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine was able to successfully derail the operation because of intelligence that the US shared.\n\nIn the lead up to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Ratcliffe and the transition team were told of the value of intelligence sharing with Ukraine by US officials who stressed that it was a hallmark of their achievements on the battlefield, according to another source familiar with those discussions.\n\nOne US military official said that the US is now offering fewer surveillance flights to the Ukrainians, as well as less satellite coverage \u2013 both of which are essential to Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend its cities against Russian missile attacks.\n\nBut underscoring the fluid nature of the situation, as recently as Tuesday, another US military official in the region said that American military contact with the Ukrainians, including some intelligence sharing, was continuing.\n\nA key concern for Ukraine is whether the administration \u2014 or Trump\u2019s ally, Elon Musk \u2014 will allow the satellite internet system Starlink to continue operating. That system has been a critical component to the Ukrainian military response that has allowed its forces to communicate on the battlefield.\n\nFor some US officials, the decision to limit intelligence sharing with Ukraine not only helps Russia \u2014 it is tantamount to a betrayal of Ukraine. The CIA has worked closely with Ukrainian special operations forces since 2014, when Russia first took action to seize control of Ukraine, supporting a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and annexing Crimea.\n\nIn the early days of the 2022 conflict, prominent Republicans \u2014 including now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 complained that the Biden administration wasn\u2019t sharing intelligence with the Ukrainian military quickly enough.\n\nNow, many US military and intelligence officers \u201cfeel we are abandoning our allies on the battlefield,\u201d said one former intelligence official who remains in contact with old colleagues.\n\nCNN\u2019s Matthew Chance contributed reporting.\n\nThis story and its headline have been updated with additional reporting."

He also said Secretary of State Marco Rubio would oversee efforts to regain control of the Panama Canal and invited Greenland to join the U.S. \u201cif you choose.\u201d\n\n\u2192 On immigration, Trump said he is waging the \u201cmost sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.\u201d He also highlighted the passage of the Laken Riley Act.\n\n\u2192 Missing from the speech was any mention of the thousands of federal workers who have been fired since Trump has taken office.

            "full_content": "The biggest reason President Donald Trump won the White House again was dissatisfaction with the economy under Joe Biden. Specifically, the public\u2019s frustration over a spike in inflation, which, even after it cooled, appeared to leave widespread, lingering resentment over the cost of everyday items at the grocery store and elsewhere. Trump has now enacted an extraordinary tariffs regime that will, by design, cause a spike in many of those items.\n\nTrump\u2019s 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Canada and Mexico and 20% tariffs on goods from China mean that around 40% of the items imported into the United States will be subject to a border tax. Those tariffs will, economists explain, almost inevitably be passed on to consumers as higher prices, just as they were after Trump\u2019s far more targeted tariffs in 2018.\n\nWill Trump's base buy his inevitable lies that he\u2019s not to blame for the pinch on their wallet?\n\nCompanies that make canned goods are warning about higher prices since most steel for making cans is imported. Craft beer companies generally don\u2019t have the ability to lower costs to mitigate the higher price of cans, so they will almost certainly raise prices to deal with higher costs. A lot of popular fruit, such as avocados, tomatoes and strawberries, is imported from Mexico and will be hit with tariffs. The most popular beer in America, Modelo, is a Mexican import.\n\nBeyond grocery store items, tariffs could exacerbate the affordable housing crisis by making the lumber imported from Canada more expensive.\n\nMany companies perceived as purely domestic manufacturers who would seemingly benefit from a penalty on foreign competition will nonetheless take a blow because of supply chain norms. Consider, for example, that U.S. auto manufacturers rely on car parts from Canada and Mexico and are going to see a huge spike in costs. \u201cLet\u2019s be real honest: Long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors in February.\n\nJared Bernstein, the former chair of Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, estimated in a January column for MSNBC that \u201c25% tariffs on all imports out of Canada and Mexico and 10% on China would cost the average household $1,500-$2,000.\u201d (Since then, Trump has doubled the tariff rate on Chinese imports.)\n\nGlobal markets plunged after the tariffs went into effect Tuesday, and Canada, Mexico and China have announced their own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, setting in motion a trade war within an extremely interdependent sphere of the global economy. Economic analysts are warning that the drag caused by a tax on over a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of imports is likely to help push the U.S. economy into a recession. As businesses try to navigate an uncertain economic environment with rising costs, hiring is likely to slow down, which in turn is likely to reduce consumer spending and deal a significant blow to economic growth.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of tariffs is not only far more sweeping than anything he did during his first term; it\u2019s the most sweeping use of tariffs by the U.S. government in about a century. The coming economic pain raises political questions: What will happen to Trump\u2019s reputation as an effective steward of the economy as tariffs cause prices to soar and possibly induce a recession? Will business elites who have warmed to him finally experience buyer\u2019s remorse? Will Trump's base buy his inevitable lies that he\u2019s not to blame for the pinch on their wallet? Will some of the hard-core MAGA base finally hit a wall and turn on its dear leader?\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs fulfill the ultranationalist promise he made countless times on the campaign trail. He occasionally warned us of the hardship to come alongside his tirades against migrants and nonsense about bringing down prices. But the pain is due to arrive now, and his having predicted it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessary or any easier to afford."

            "full_content": "Consider, for a moment, the example of Dan Osborn. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nIf the first election of Donald Trump was a boon to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, the second might have granted new life to moderates. Trump\u2019s popular-vote victory \u2014 his only, and one of the most dispiriting events for the American left in the twenty-first century \u2014 put to rest several long-standing arguments about the national electorate. It was far easier to blame racism for Trump\u2019s shock win in 2016 because Barack Obama had stumped aggressively for Hillary Clinton, who still beat Trump by two percentage points. Eight years later, Trump has made tremendous gains with Latino, Asian, and even some Black voters, and his 2024 coalition was more multiracial than any liberal pundit would have predicted just a few years ago.\n\nIn turn, many of the de rigueur causes of the 2010s have fallen out of vogue. Black Live Matter is moribund, and there are no calls to abolish ICE despite Trump promising mass deportations. The Women\u2019s March didn\u2019t materialize to oppose Trump\u2019s inauguration. Climate activism, which burned so hot in the late 2010s and early 2020s, is at a low ebb, and despite David Hogg\u2019s rise to vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, there is nothing approximating the mass marches over gun control that took place in 2018 and 2019. Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on so-called DEI initiatives and \u201cwoke\u201d have triggered only limited backlash from Democrats, who seem increasingly willing to move on from culture war.\n\nThe latest evidence of a possible moderate resurgence was a gathering hosted by Third Way, the centrist Democratic think tank, last month. Unlike the DNC, which has not performed any autopsy of 2024, Third Way produced five pages of takeaways that it believes explain Democratic failure and can plot a path back to power. They blame a failure to prioritize economic concerns, an overemphasis on identity politics, allowing the \u201cfar-left\u201d to define the party, and an attachment to unpopular institutions like academia, the media, and government bureaucracy for Trump\u2019s ascendance. Among Third Way\u2019s proposals is a ban on \u201cfar-left candidate questionnaires\u201d and a movement \u201caway from the dominance of small-dollar donors whose preferences may not align with the broader electorate.\u201d They argued, too, for Democrats to embrace \u201cpatriotism, community, and traditional American imagery\u201d and to \u201cget out of elite circles and into real communities\u201d like tailgates, gun shows, local restaurants, churches. It was time, they proclaimed, to celebrate \u201cmoderation, individualism, and masculinity.\u201d\n\nGiven the slow bleed of working-class voters from the Democratic Party, especially men, much of this is sound reasoning \u2014 if easy to mock on social media. Ruben Gallego, the new Democratic senator from Arizona, has said the left needs to understand that \u201cevery Latino man wants a big-ass truck.\u201d Democrats are afraid, Gallego said, of \u201csaying, like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s help you get a job so you can become rich.\u2019\u201d The GOP, for many voters, has become the aspirational, freedom-loving party, while Democrats embody the nattering, faculty-lounge caricature, too affluent and alien. There is an image problem that Democrats will need to fix. Pumping out new policy platforms isn\u2019t enough.\n\nBut the battle back to power \u2014 and the hope for Democrats, really, of erecting any sort of sustainable and durable majority \u2014 will be far more complicated than simply pivoting to the center. Behind Third Way\u2019s argument that small donors represent an energized minority that could force certain Democrats to take unpopular positions is the implication that large donors are a safer bet \u2014 as if millionaires and billionaires weren\u2019t capable of corroding the priorities of politicians and dragging them away from where the median voter might be. If it\u2019s understandable Third Way doesn\u2019t want Democrats to be openly \u201canti-capitalist\u201d (capitalism itself polls well, after all), the plea for Democrats \u201cto stop demonizing wealth and corporations broadly\u201d is odder.\n\nWhat evidence is there that corporate skepticism has damaged either party? Were it up to Third Way, Trump would never have turned against NAFTA and Obama would have tried to triangulate John McCain on economics, running to the right as the financial sector collapsed in 2008. Bernie Sanders\u2019s enduring popularity, including his recent, packed-out rallies against oligarchy, should be impossible. Sanders, the self-identified socialist from Vermont, has always been confounding for Third Way, especially his 2016 presidential campaign, which won more than 40 percent of the primary vote against Clinton, the overwhelming front-runner.\n\nSanders never became president, and several of his most prominent prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, embody some of the 2010s and early \u201920s excesses that cost Democrats votes, like calls to defund the police and comparisons of migrant detention facilities to \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d But Sanders himself, even at the height of the George Floyd protests, was against pulling funding from police departments, instead enraging progressives by reiterating his belief that officers should be paid more money. On immigration, Sanders is far more humane than any Republican but has decried an open border, likening it to a scheme for the wealthy to procure cheap labor. A supporter of gun control, Sanders was nevertheless more moderate than many cultural liberals because he had risen to power in a rural state where Republicans once held great sway.\n\nA more culturally right-wing version of Sanders almost nabbed a Senate seat in deep-red Nebraska last year, and it\u2019s peculiar that many Democrats, including Third Way, still don\u2019t want to talk about it. Dan Osborn came within seven points of defeating Deb Fischer, an incumbent Republican, in a state Trump would carry by more than 20. Osborn, a mechanic and labor leader, had led a strike at Kellogg\u2019s Omaha plant in 2021; on economic issues, he represented everything Third Way, which is Clintonian centrist at its core, resents. He supported raising the national minimum wage, bolstering railway safety, strengthening Social Security, and making it easier for workers to organize into labor unions. On culture, he did pivot right: He backed Trump\u2019s border wall and gun rights. He notably campaigned as an independent, not a Democrat, and targeted the very small donors Third Way wants Democrats to shun. Osborn did not commit to caucusing with the Democrats if he won, but at minimum, he would not have been an automatic vote for Trump in the Senate.\n\nMost Democrats now agree that they have a Senate problem: The 2024 election cycle was not as devastating for Democrats as initially feared, with slim victories in Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but even this slight overperformance has resulted in a comfortable 53-47 GOP majority. To escape the minority and eventually find a way to 52 or 53 seats, Democrats will have to compete, as Third Way and many others argue, for working class and non-college-educated voters, especially in rural areas. This will mean, in addition to fixing the Democratic brand, fielding more candidates like Osborn who can make Trump states competitive again. It will not mean abandoning small donors or the economic populism that thrills them. It will mean being a tribune for the working class."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Republican-heavy audience that tuned in to hear President Donald Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday greeted it with tempered positivity, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nSpeech-watchers broadly said Trump\u2019s policies would take the country in the right direction, with majorities saying the same across five issue areas that were the focus of the president\u2019s speech. But fewer expressed strong confidence in Trump to help people like them, use his presidential power responsibly or provide the nation with real leadership.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 speech-watchers said they had at least a somewhat positive reaction to Trump\u2019s speech tonight, with a smaller 44% offering a very positive response. That\u2019s lower than the 57% of viewers who rated Trump\u2019s initial address to Congress very positively eight years ago, or the 51% who said the same of President Joe Biden\u2019s initial address in 2021. It also comes just below the 48% \u201cvery positive\u201d rating Trump saw for his 2018 State of the Union.\n\nGood marks from speech-watchers are typical for presidential addresses to Congress, which tend to attract generally friendly audiences that disproportionately hail from presidents\u2019 own parties. In CNN\u2019s speech reaction polls, which have been conducted most years dating back to the Clinton era, audience reactions have always been positive.\n\nThe pool of people who watched Trump speak on Tuesday was about 14 percentage points more Republican than the general public.\n\nThe Trump-friendly audience reacted negatively to a protest effort from a Democratic member of Congress. Eight in 10 Americans who watched the speech said they saw Rep. Al Green\u2019s interruption of Trump\u2019s speech as inappropriate, with just 20% saying the representative from Texas acted appropriately. Green was ejected from the House chamber after continuing to protest following a warning from House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nRoughly 6 in 10 viewers said in a poll conducted before the speech that they approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency overall. By contrast, Trump\u2019s approval rating is underwater with the American public as a whole, a CNN poll released Sunday found, with 48% of U.S. adults approving of his performance as president and 52% disapproving.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech on Tuesday did little to further improve the already-positive perspectives of his audience. In a survey conducted prior to the speech, 61% said they believed his policies would move the country in the right direction; afterward, 66% of the same people said his policies would take the country down the right path. The share who believed Trump has had the right priorities so far stood at 56% prior to the speech and 59% immediately following its conclusion.\n\nHalf of speech-watchers said they held a lot of confidence in Trump to provide real leadership, while 45% said they had a lot of confidence in him to use his presidential power responsibly, and just 4 in 10 expressed high confidence in his ability to help people like them. Majorities of 65% or more said they had at least some confidence in him across each metric.\n\nTrump scored his highest marks of the night for his policies on immigration: 76% of speech-watchers said his proposed policies on that issue would take America in the right direction, compared with closer to 6 in 10 who said the same of his proposals to change how the government works (63%), or his proposed policies on the economy (62%) or tariffs (56%). That\u2019s a shift from CNN\u2019s polling on his first term speeches, when he consistently rated higher on economic issues than on those related to immigration.\n\nMost who tuned in said they thought his proposed policies on foreign affairs would move the country in the right direction (61%). Speech-watchers are also largely aligned with Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine and Russia. Majorities said that based on what they heard in the speech, the president\u2019s policies toward Ukraine (63%) and Russia (58%) offered the right amount of support for each country. Sizable minorities, though, see Trump as too supportive of Russia (37%) and not supportive enough of Ukraine (33%).\n\nAnnual presidential addresses rarely lead to significant shifts in presidential approval among the broader American public, particularly in recent years. Historically, first-year addresses to Congress have tended to be better rated than later State of the Union speeches and more likely than others to result in an approval rating bounce. But Trump, the first president in the era of modern presidential polling to serve nonconsecutive terms, isn\u2019t new to the office \u2014 and current levels of polarization may also curtail his speech\u2019s potential to affect public opinion.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by text message with 431 US adults who said they watched the presidential address on Tuesday, and are representative of the views of speech-watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the speech, and were selected by a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of speech-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report."

He celebrated his crackdown on migration. He repeatedly taunted his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying the former president imposed \u201cinsane and very dangerous open border policies\u201d and offered little in the way of olive branches to Democrats, instead touting his 2024 victory as a mandate to reshape the nation.\n\nHere are our takeaways from the speech \u2014 and how it sets up the rest of Trump\u2019s 2025.\n\nTrump defends his tariff moves: Trump said the 25% tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico \u201care about protecting the soul of our country\u201d as scores of Republicans applauded.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of how Trump has transformed the traditionally pro-free trade GOP, though there is some unease in the party about the tariffs\u2019 effects on prices and the broader economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a little disturbance,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut we\u2019re OK with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d\n\nOutlining the agenda for the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d: Trump spent significant time on issues ranging from transgender athletes to the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. But the biggest thing Congress may work on this year will be a massive tax and spending bill, and Trump outlined his priorities.\n\nTrump reiterated his calls to cut taxes and include several campaign trail tax promises in a bill later this year \u2014 specifically killing taxes on tips and overtime. Congressional Republicans are wrestling with the feasibility of those proposals.\n\nWhat was missing: A few thorny issues were mostly or entirely missing from the speech, reflecting the broad goal of rallying Republicans.\n\nThe return of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza earned a mention, but Trump did not delve much deeper into the broader issues facing the Middle East. And as the GOP\u2019s budget and spending plans take shape, there was no mention of Medicaid \u2014 a major portion of the federal budget that could be a target for changes. And Trump did not delve into the federal worker cuts that have sparked anxiety among some congressional Republicans and pushback from the public.\n\nRead the rest of the takeaways here \u2192\n\nDemocrats' silent protests of Trump speech overshadowed by one outburst\n\nBy Scott Wong and Frank Thorp V\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats silently protested Trump \u2014 refusing to applaud, holding up signs calling him \u201cking\u201d and \u201cliar\u201d and, for some, walking out of the address altogether.\n\nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, didn\u2019t get the memo.\n\nAfter Trump told lawmakers he had won a mandate, the progressive rabble-rouser rose, began waving his cane at Trump and yelled out repeatedly: \u201cYou have no mandate!\u201d The sergeant at arms promptly removed Green from the chamber \u2014 a first during modern-day presidential addresses to Congress.\n\nIt was not what Democratic leaders had wanted. They had warned their rank-and-file members before the joint address not to bring props and to stay on message \u2014 the focus should stay on the federal workers fired by Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, as well as the everyday Americans harmed by their policies and cuts.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to keep every congressional Democrat in line. From the moment Trump walked onto the House floor, it was clear this would not be the usual speech to Congress. Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the new DOGE subcommittee, silently held a sign behind Trump reading: \u201cThis is NOT normal.\u201d\n\nAfter he greeted Trump, Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, reached across the aisle, ripped the sign away from Stansbury and tossed it in the air \u2014 all on live TV.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, stood when Trump walked down the center aisle but did not applaud.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., brought an erasable whiteboard into the chamber and scribbled various messages to Trump throughout the night: \u201cNO KING,\u201d \u201cTHAT\u2019S A LIE\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re cutting Medicaid,\u201d for instance.\n\nRead more from inside the House chamber here \u2192\n\nMore coverage\n\nThat\u2019s all From the Politics Desk for now.

Rather, the numbers they refer to are products of a known problem with the government\u2019s data.\n\nThere are millions of people over age 100 in the Social Security Administration\u2019s database, but the vast majority aren\u2019t receiving benefits.\n\nInspectors general at the agency have repeatedly identified the issue, but the Social Security Administration has argued that updating old records is costly and unnecessary.\n\nAn SSA IG report from 2023 showed 18.9 million people listed as 100 years or older \u2014 but not dead \u2014 were in the database. But \u201calmost none\u201d currently receive SSA payments.\n\nThe SSA\u2019s inspector general also found in a report released in July that from 2015 to 2022, only 0.84% of benefits payments were improper. That 0.84% of improper benefits payments totaled $71.8 billion over eight years. The report also says most of the improper payments were overpayments \u2014 not payments to dead people or people who didn\u2019t qualify.\n\nIn addition, according to the agency\u2019s online records, just 89,106 people \u2014 not tens of millions \u2014 over age 99 received retirement benefits in December, out of the more than 70 million people who receive benefits every year.\n\nFact check: Under whose watch did egg prices spike?\n\nTrump said: \"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control \u2014 and we are working hard to get it back down.\"\n\nThis needs context.\n\nIt\u2019s true that egg prices spiked during Biden\u2019s presidency as inflation rose steadily. The average price of one dozen Grade A eggs peaked during the Biden administration in January 2023 at $4.32, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. It eventually retreated, falling to less than half that by late 2023, before it rose again last year.\n\nAccording to that government data, however, the average price of one dozen Grade A eggs peaked this January at $4.95, a month in office that Trump shared with Biden \u2014 a product of the growing transmission of bird flu among chickens. That is nearly double the price they were in January 2024 ($2.52).\n\nFact check: Trump says car plants are \"opening up all over the place\"\n\nTrump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody\u2019s ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made, never seen. That\u2019s a combination of the election win and tariffs. It\u2019s a beautiful word, isn\u2019t it, that, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It\u2019s going to boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three, the top people, and they\u2019re so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly false.\n\nNo automaker has announced a new plant since Trump took office and began instituting new tariffs. Reuters reported that Honda planned to produce 210,000 Civics in Indiana instead of Mexico, but the company hasn\u2019t made a public announcement.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s unclear whether Honda would expand its operations in Indiana, open a new plant or simply move production of the new Civic to the plant and reduce production of other vehicles there, too. Honda\u2019s Indiana plant produces as many as 250,000 vehicles annually.\n\nIn addition, Trump\u2019s move to impose a 25% tariff on all imports coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico could add thousands of dollars to the cost of each new vehicle.\n\nImmigration\n\nFact check: Trump claims illegal immigration \"destroyed\" Aurora, Colo., and Springfield, Ohio\n\nTrump said: \"Joe Biden didn\u2019t just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody has ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.\"\n\nThis is false.\n\nSpringfield and Aurora have long been some of Trump\u2019s favorite targets when it comes to examples of American cities he likes to nod to as being overrun by migrants, though he often misrepresents the situations there.\n\nHe didn\u2019t mention any specific allegations about the two cities in his speech \u2014 but his reference to them is a clear reference to previous false allegations about them.\n\nFor example, Trump repeated a baseless claim about Haitian immigrants in Springfield eating dogs and other pets during a debate last year. The story provide false, however. The culprit was a non-migrant woman in a nearby town.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump also painted a sinister picture of Aurora during the campaign. At a rally there in October, he alleged the city had been overtaken by a Venezuelan prison gang \u2014 Tren de Aragua \u2014 after a social media clip went viral claiming the gang had taken over an apartment complex in Aurora.\n\nPolice at the time said there was no evidence the gang had taken over the complex, and Mayor Mike Coffman, a Republican, called Trump\u2019s descriptions \u201cnot accurate.\u201d\n\nFact check: Is Canada, along with Mexico, to blame for the fentanyl crisis?\n\nTrump said of Canada and Mexico: \u201cThey\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nWhile fentanyl comes across the border from Mexico in significant numbers, Canada is hardly to blame for the crisis. In the 2024 fiscal year, fentanyl seizures at the northern border were just 43 pounds, according to Customs and Border Protection data. Meanwhile, more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern border during the same period.\n\nFact check: Trump says many migrants who entered the country the past four years were criminals\n\nTrump said: \u201cOver the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection data, the Biden administration had more than an estimated 14 million migrant encounters at and between ports of entry at U.S. borders.\n\nMore than 118,000 migrants with criminal backgrounds were apprehended at U.S. borders during that time \u2014 a small part of the more than over 14 million migrant encounters. There have been instances of migrants found to have criminal records from their home countries after they\u2019ve entered the United States, but there is no evidence to support that it is widespread, and immigration officials have long cited challenges with getting criminal records from certain migrants\u2019 home countries before they cross the border.\n\nThe Trump administration has frequently cited the presence of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in the United States and the high-profile killing of the Georgia nursing student Laken Riley last year by a Venezuelan national who entered the country illegally in 2022 as indicative of widespread migrant crime.\n\nFact check: Is Trump responsible for \"the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever\"?\n\nTrump said: \u201cSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history \u2014 and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be true, but questions about the specifics remain.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump is speaking about border crossings, encounters and/or apprehensions.\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection data from 2000 to 2019 that compares apprehensions across the various sectors by month, the month with the fewest crossings on record was April 2017, at 11,677.\n\nCPB says, \u201cFrom Jan. 21 through Jan. 31, 2025, the number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border dropped 85% from the same period in 2024.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed last month on Truth Social: \u201cThere were only 8,326 apprehensions of Illegals by Border Patrol at the U.S. \u2014 Mexico Border.\u201d\n\nHealth\n\nFact check: Trump says more children are being diagnosed with autism\n\nTrump said: \u201cAs an example, not long ago, and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers, 1 in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it\u2019s 1 in 36. There\u2019s something wrong. One in 36, think of that, so we\u2019re going to find out what it is.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this ratio is correct. But the statistic is often used to justify opposition to vaccination.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pointed to vaccines to explain the substantial rise in autism diagnoses in recent decades, which have ballooned from an estimated 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today.\n\nBut the science is clear that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism.\n\nRather, research suggests that much of the increase is due to increasing awareness and screening for the condition, changing definitions of autism to include milder conditions on the spectrum that weren\u2019t recognized in previous years and advances in diagnostic technology.\n\nFinding the causes of autism is complicated, because it\u2019s not a single disorder, scientists and experts have told NBC News. In addition, those scientists and experts have said they believe that people develop autistic traits because of a combination of genetic vulnerability and environmental exposures.\n\nInternational\n\nFact check: Trump claims U.S. is spending much more on Ukraine than Europe\n\nTrump said: \u201cEurope has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They\u2019ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending. And we\u2019ve spent perhaps $350 billion, and they\u2019ve spent $100 billion. And we have an ocean separating us, and they don\u2019t. And Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly false.\n\nFrom Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 to last December, the United States had allocated $114.2 billion in aid to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute, which is tracking aid to Ukraine. That\u2019s not more than Europe spent: Those nations allocated more than $132.3 billion, with plans to allocate more.\n\nTrump is correct in pointing out that Europe has spent more on oil and gas than it spent on military assistance last year, according to estimates from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Oil and gas taxes account for a huge share of Russia\u2019s revenues each year.\n\nPolling\n\nFact check: Is the share of Americans who think the country is on \"right\" track at a record high?\n\nTrump said: \u201cFor the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nThis is false.\n\nTrump appears to be cherry-picking a single poll result and ignoring a few strong numbers from early in Biden\u2019s term. While he doesn\u2019t cite his source, it seems likely he\u2019s pointing to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll showing that 47% say America\u2019s on the \u201cright track.\u201d\n\nRasmussen is a right-wing poll that regularly partners with conservative authors and outlets to sponsor its polling. And it\u2019s controversial \u2014 the polling aggregation site FiveThirtyEight removed the poll from its averages last year over concerns about its partisanship and its methodology.\n\nIt\u2019s true that many polls have shown a bump in the classic \u201cright track, wrong track\u201d question since Trump took office. For example, NPR/Marist/PBS\u2019 newest poll found 45% saying the country is moving in the right direction, up from 35% in December and from even lower during earlier parts of the Biden administration.\n\nBut those highs have been hit before \u2014 47% said America was moving in the right direction in a July 2021 poll from NPR/Marist/PBS (49% thought it was moving in the wrong direction). And just months earlier, a Politico/Morning Consult poll found 51% of registered voters saying the country was going in the right direction."

            "full_content": "Photo: Ben Curtis/AP Photo\n\nBefore Donald Trump\u2019s first joint address to Congress since returning to the White House, I wrote about what things he might do to increase support for his agenda in the big speech. These included \u201cspeaking to the nation, not to his base,\u201d renouncing the chaos so many perceive his administration has engendered, asserting control over Elon Musk and DOGE, more closely relating his agenda to concerns, like rising prices, that Americans think he is inadequately addressing, and disclaiming responsibility for the government shutdown that may be just down the road. He didn\u2019t do any of these things.\n\nInstead, in the longest and by far the most partisan presidential address to Congress in history, Trump spoke strictly to his own partisans, aside from contemptuous dismissals of Democrats and interminable attacks on Joe Biden. He celebrated the chaos of his first days in office as the greatest beginning of any administration in history. He saluted Musk and cited many of the bogus anecdotal examples of \u201cwaste and fraud\u201d DOGE\u2019s novices had allegedly unearthed. He simply asserted his agenda would restrain inflation and didn\u2019t even address the looming government shutdown. The speech was essentially a warmed-over 2024 campaign-rally speech that didn\u2019t even attempt to persuade those not already persuaded that his administration was ushering in a \u201cgolden age \u2026 unlike anything ever seen.\u201d\n\nThere were no substantive new initiatives announced, at all, and much of the address and its many human props in the galleries had little or nothing to do with the agenda he\u2019s asked Congress to implement. Tax cuts, the beating heart of that agenda, were barely mentioned beyond dubious assertions about the magical effect of the tax cuts he promoted in 2017. The very specific budget cuts his allies are poised to enact went unmentioned as well, other than an absurd pledge to balance the federal budget. Trump didn\u2019t even bother to repeat his promises not to go after Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Though he spent inordinate time on demonizing immigrants, he offered absolutely no specifics or timetable for his pledge to deport all undocumented people in the country, and didn\u2019t even mention his radical proposal to end birthright citizenship. And despite his warm endorsement of DOGE, Trump never gave any indication of how far and how fast he intends to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d by firing federal employees and abolishing federal programs.\n\nThose looking for reassurance that the radical beginning of Trump 2.0 might give way to something more orderly and less divisive were given absolutely nothing in this speech. Business leaders and farmers hoping for an indication that his program of tariffs was temporary and would not trigger a trade war were told once again that tariffs are beautiful and powerful and would remain as a major source of federal revenues and a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s economic strategy, such as it is. Old-school conservatives looking for a vision of the kind of world an America First foreign policy might create were asked to cheer plans to take back the Panama Canal and grab Greenland \u201cone way or the other\u201d \u2014 agenda items many had hoped were a meme or even a joke. And despite the sycophantic welcome he received from Republican members of Congress, he gave them absolutely no direction on how to implement his many conflicting promises, and did everything within his rhetorical powers to ensure not a single Democrat will cooperate.\n\nSince this speech was so very similar to what he said every day on the 2024 campaign trail, and repeated in his inaugural address and in the turgid, debased language of his executive orders and his administration\u2019s memoranda and other public statements, it\u2019s time to conclude that we can never expect anything different from this president. He has all but stopped communicating with those of us who aren\u2019t wearing red hats and cheering his boasts and lies. This speech was supremely self-indulgent, and there\u2019s no reason to believe he will exercise self-restraint until the courts or the midterm electorate denies him the power to do exactly what he wants."

Looking to embrace a more balanced lifestyle while securing new opportunities?\u201d the website asks. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start building your European escape in the stunning paradise of Sardinia.\u201d"

President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America, and to do that, he\u2019s going to make you pay in every part of your life. Grocery and home prices are going up, not down, and he hasn\u2019t laid out a credible plan to deal with either of those. His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber and cars and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.\u201d\n\nSlotkin also had harsh words for Musk.\n\n\u201cIs there anyone in America,\u201d she asked, \u201cwho is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information and your bank accounts?\n\n\u201cWe need a more efficient government,\u201d she added. \u201cYou want to cut waste? I\u2019ll help you do it. But change doesn\u2019t need to be chaotic or make us less safe.\u201d\n\nSlotkin was one of the Democratic Party\u2019s few bright spots last year \u2014 a successful candidate for an open Senate seat in Michigan who outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris in the battleground state. A former House member who positioned herself as a more moderate voice in a party tilting left on cultural issues, Slotkin narrowly beat former Rep. Mike Rogers. Her victory has been held up in some corners of the party as a template for Democrats.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and I both won here in November,\u201d Slotkin said of Wyandotte. \u201cIt might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist across the United States, places where people believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids should do better. It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat, but it was never a big deal because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.\u201d\n\nSlotkin also has emerged as one of the sharpest critics of Democratic messaging, telling reporters after last fall\u2019s election that Democrats would be wise to focus more on \u201cissues that keep people up at night,\u201d like their bank accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science, but talking about those issues plainly, not from the faculty lounge but from the assembly line, is, I think, a very important message,\u201d Slotkin said then. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what you\u2019re saying but from what place you are talking about those issues. \u2026 I personally think that identity politics needs to go the way of the dodo.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, Slotkin warned of an American democracy \u201cat risk when the president pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different and tells certain people they shouldn\u2019t be included.\u201d\n\nShe closed her speech with a call to action.\n\n\u201cFirst: Don\u2019t tune out. It\u2019s easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever,\u201d Slotkin said. \u201cSecond: Hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they\u2019re voting. Go to town halls and demand and take action. That\u2019s as American as apple pie.\n\n\u201cThird: Organize. Pick just one issue you\u2019re passionate about and engage, and doom-scrolling doesn\u2019t count,\" she added. \"Join a group that cares about your issue and act.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Tuesday evening that the US has apprehended a \u201ctop terrorist\u201d involved in the 2021 bombing at Kabul airport\u2019s Abbey Gate in Afghanistan where 13 US service members and at least 170 Afghan civilians were killed.\n\nMohammad Sharifullah, who was allegedly involved in the planning of the bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, was charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support for terrorism. He arrived in the US on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the operation.\n\n\u201cTonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,\u201d Trump said in his joint address to Congress.\n\nPakistan acted on CIA intelligence that led to the arrest of Sharifullah, according to another source familiar with the matter. In his speech, Trump thanked Pakistan for \u201chelping arrest this monster.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif returned the message of gratitude in a statement issued on Wednesday, thanking Trump for \u201cacknowledging and appreciating Pakistan\u2019s role and support in counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nSharif said Pakistan\u2019s security forces apprehended Sharifullah, an Afghan national, \u201cin a successful operation conducted in Pakistan-Afghan border region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Trump once again attacked President Joe Biden over the handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, a criticism he made frequently on the campaign trail last year. Trump said he spoke to the families of the service members who were killed on a call before his speech \u201cand they did nothing but cry with happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly \u2013 over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown.\u201d\n\nSharifullah was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, according to an indictment unsealed late Tuesday.\n\nHe was interviewed by FBI agents on Sunday, where he told them he was recruited in 2016 into ISIS-K, a branch of ISIS. In the interview, Shariffullah \u201cadmitted to supporting and conducting activities on behalf of ISIS-K in support of multiple lethal attacks,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nSharifullah, who is also known as \u201cJafar,\u201d according to the court documents, was in prison from 2019 until two weeks before the Abbey Gate attack. When he was released, he was contacted by ISIS members for assistance in the attack.\n\n\u201cSharifullah was tasked with scouting a route near (Hamid Karzai International Airport) HKIA for an attacker. Sharifullah conducted surveillance on a route, specifically checking for law enforcement and American or Taliban checkpoints,\u201d the court documents state.\n\n\u201cSharifullah communicated to other ISIS-K members that he believed the route was clear and that he did not think the attacker would be detected while proceeding through that route.\u201d\n\nISIS members instructed him to leave the area around the airport, the court documents state. \u201cLater that same day, Sharifullah learned of the attack at HKIA described above and recognized the alleged bomber as an ISIS-K operative he had known while incarcerated.\u201d\n\nThe indictment also details Sharifullah\u2019s alleged involvement in two other attacks, claiming that he conducted surveillance and transported a bomber to an attack on embassy guards in Kabul in 2016, and provided weapons training for gunmen who carried out an attack on a Moscow nightclub last year.\n\nSharifullah made his first federal court appearance Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nMagistrate Judge William Porter ordered Sharifullah to be detained until his next hearing, which is scheduled for Monday afternoon.\n\nSharifullah wore a powder blue uniform and a black facemask during the 10-minute hearing. A Dari language interpreter aided him during the proceedings, and he was flanked by several US marshals.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t yet entered a plea. His public defender declined to comment about the charges after the hearing.\n\nTrump\u2019s CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, raised the issue during his first phone call with the Pakistani intel chief, which took place during his first few days on the job, the source familiar added.\n\nSenior members of the administration heralded the news.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump just announced, I can report that tonight the FBI, DOJ, and CIA have extradited one of the terrorists responsible for the murder of the 13 American soldiers at Abbey Gate during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal,\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X shortly after Trump announced the arrest. \u201cOne step closer to justice for these American heroes and their families.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Sophia Saifi and Josh Campbell contributed to this report"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s first address to Congress since returning to power was both a victory lap following a consequential first 43 days in office and an attempt to justify what he\u2019s done to an American public that may still be digesting his rapid-pace changes.\n\nOn tariffs, government cuts and foreign affairs, Trump has taken dramatic steps that have left Democrats fuming and even some Republicans skeptical, while foreign capitals have scrambled to respond. His task Tuesday was to say why.\n\nHe did that \u2013 to an extent. But the president also used his speech to relentlessly attack his opponents, blame his predecessor and air old grievances.\n\nThe president entered the chamber with a lot to say. His speech broke the record for longest annual presidential address to Congress in modern history, at just under one hour and 40 minutes. It was also one of the most partisan, with almost none of the customary calls for unity.\n\nA partisan affair\n\nFrom almost the first words of Trump\u2019s speech, it was evident it would not resemble many addresses to Congress in the past. He boasted about his November election win, attacked Democrats for standing in his way and complained they would never applaud his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,\u201d he said, describing his opposition as essentially a lost cause.\n\nThe dramatics extended to the audience, when Democratic Rep. Al Green interrupted the president repeatedly before House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to eject the Texas congressman.\n\nRep. Al Green shouts out as Trump addresses a joint session of Congress. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThe moment early in Trump\u2019s speech helped set the partisan atmosphere. Other Democrats held up signs or walked out of the chamber during the speech, defying leadership\u2019s calls to show restraint.\n\nAnd the president made little attempt to lower the temperature, repeatedly chastising Democrats for not helping advance his agenda. He pointed their way when referring to \u201cradical left-wing lunatics\u201d and even used his derogatory \u201cPocahontas\u201d nickname for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAlways in campaign mode\n\nThroughout the speech, Trump narrowed in on the culture war issues that thrill his base, promising to erase \u201cwokeness\u201d from society and touting some of his most divisive executive actions.\n\nHe bemoaned what he calls the unfairness of affirmative action and touted his efforts to roll back transgender rights and diversity programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military and it\u2019s already out, and it\u2019s out of our society. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nTrump used the guests in the first lady\u2019s box to illustrate his point, including female athletes, parents of children murdered by undocumented immigrants and a mother whose daughter Trump claimed had been \u201csecretly socially transitioned\u201d at school.\n\nTrump framed the moves as part of his \u201ccommon sense revolution,\u201d though each of the issues appeared designed to mostly appeal to his base.\n\nInstead of bridging any partisan gaps, the lines underscored the perpetual campaign mode Trump operates within, even as he\u2019s no longer running for office.\n\nAllyson and Lauren Phillips, mother and sister of the late Laken Riley stand as they are recognized by President Donald Trump. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRapid pace of change\n\nThe executive actions reshaping the federal government have come fast and furious in Trump\u2019s first month-and-a-half; his team is far more experienced this time around, and the president himself is impatient to fulfill his campaign promises.\n\nYet for many Americans, the flurry of changes has been confusing. Polls show skepticism seeping in about Trump\u2019s priorities. Tuesday\u2019s speech was an opportunity to present a cogent argument.\n\nHe chose to highlight Elon Musk, the billionaire in charge of his government efficiency effort who was sitting in the galleries.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s working very hard. He didn\u2019t need this. He didn\u2019t need this,\u201d Trump said, before goading Democrats further: \u201cEverybody here, even this side, appreciates it. I believe they just don\u2019t want to admit that,\u201d he said, pointing toward Democrats.\n\nLater, Trump recited a lengthy list of programs whose funding has been slashed by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, misleadingly calling them examples of fraud. And he repeated debunked claims that significant number of dead Americans are receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nDemocrats in the audience held aloft signs saying \u201cMusk steals,\u201d but the president\u2019s recitation of DOGE\u2019s efforts seemed far more focused on messaging about programs that, in his mind, reflect wasted taxpayer dollars than about detailing any actual government savings.\n\nRep.

Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIssue number 1\n\nThe hours ahead of Trump\u2019s speech were hardly the economic backdrop he may have hoped for. Stock markets tumbled as the broad tariffs he announced on Mexico, Canada and China reverberated among investors. Almost as soon as markets closed, his commerce secretary suggested there may be a pull-back on the new duties on Wednesday.\n\nNonetheless, Trump \u2014 who has advocated for tariffs since the 1970s, and once called \u201ctariff\u201d his favorite word \u2014 was not backing away from the strategy during his biggest speech of the year.\n\n\u201cWhatever they tariff us, we tariff them. That\u2019s reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we tax them,\u201d he\u2019ll said in the speech. \u201cWe will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.\u201d\n\nRepublicans stand as Democrats sit as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n\nMany Republicans have deep reservations about the tariffs, and lawmakers from states that could be hard-hit spent Tuesday on the phone with Trump\u2019s aides voicing their concerns. They had been hoping to hear from Trump a more fulsome explanation of his tariff plan, and an explanation of how average Americans might benefit.\n\nTrump was vague in the specifics, and he repeated his encouragement to farmers to \u201chave a lot of fun\u201d selling their products inside the United States (a sentiment he voiced on social media this week).\n\nBut he was adamant about the wisdom of tariffs, even as he acknowledged they could cause economic pain.\n\n\u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it\u2019s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re okay with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d\n\nA changed world\n\nTrump could hardly avoid the issue that has dominated the last week \u2014 the war in Ukraine \u2014 despite his address being largely focused on domestic matters.\n\n\u201cI am also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAt one point, Trump had hoped to herald a new rare earth minerals deal with Ukraine during his speech. But an Oval Office fracas last week with President Volodymyr Zelensky blew that up.\n\nInstead, Trump returned to his frustrations at how much US money has been spent on the conflict.\n\nBut he also responded positively to a social media post earlier Tuesday from Zelensky \u2013 Trump referred to a letter from the Ukrainian leader \u2013 in which Zelensky voiced regret for Friday\u2019s blowup and said he was ready to begin peace talks.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that he sent this letter,\u201d he said, without saying when he might try speaking to Zelensky again.\n\nBlame it on Biden\n\nTrump has made his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, a central figure of his second presidency, blaming him for everything from higher prices to foreign conflicts.\n\nTuesday\u2019s speech was no exception. He named Biden 12 times in his speech and referenced his administration another four times. He accused Biden of leaving him problems ranging from the high price of eggs to authorizing too much money for Ukraine, according to excerpts of the speech.\n\n\u201cAs you know, we inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,\u201d Trump said in his speech.\n\nLater, addressing attempts to pass a border bill last year, Trump said that instead of new legislation, \u201cAll we really needed was a new president.\u201d\n\nEvery president inherits obstacles left to them by the previous administration. Yet how much longer Trump can blame Biden for the country\u2019s continued challenges remains to be seen. Eventually, voters look to the office-holder to fix their problems \u2014 not blame them on someone else.\n\nDemocrats respond\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, the Michigan freshman who delivered Democrats\u2019 rebuttal, was assigned one of the infamously thankless tasks in politics.\n\nShe kept it short and to the point. She opened by accusing Trump \u2014 and, pointedly, Musk \u2014 of taking a \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cchaotic\u201d approach to reforming the federal government.\n\nDecrying the Oval Office berating of Zelensky, she alleged Ronald Reagan would be \u201crolling in his grave.\u201d\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin speaks from Wyandotte, Michigan. Paul Sancya/AP\n\nShe acknowledged Americans want change. But, in her telling, the change Trump is executing risks fundamental damage to the country.\n\nHer matter-of-fact approach contrasted with some other Democrats, who have tried to channel outrage in their opposition to Trump.\n\nInstead, Slotkin encouraged Democrats to embrace action, not anger: \u201cPick just one issue you\u2019re passionate about \u2014 and engage. And doom scrolling doesn\u2019t count,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

We want the world to know we stand in protest, we stand in power. We stand in pink and we stand in opposition.\"\n\nDuring Mr. Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress in 2017, Democratic congresswomen wore white to highlight women's rights. Last year, when then-President Joe Biden delivered a State of the Union address, caucus members also wore white to bring attention to reproductive rights.\n\n\"Our message is clear: women must be able to access the health care they need to control their own lives and futures. That means women, not politicians, should be in charge of whether, when, and how to start or grow their families. That includes access to birth control, access to abortion, and access to IVF,\" the group said in a statement in 2024."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration announced Tuesday that it is considering selling off hundreds of \u201cnon-core\u201d federal properties, according to the General Services Administration.\n\n\u201cGSA\u2019s decisive action to dispose of non-core assets leverages the private sector, drives improvements for our agency customers, and best serves local communities,\u201d the agency said in a news release linking to a list of 440 properties that included the headquarters of the FBI and the Department Justice.\n\nLater Tuesday, however, the list was scaled back to 320 properties, with all DC-based properties removed. By Wednesday, the list of federal buildings had been removed from GSA\u2019s website, which now says the list is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nThe agency said in a statement Wednesday the list was removed from its website due to \u201can overwhelming amount of interest.\u201d GSA said it planned to republish the list \u201cin the near future after we evaluate this initial input and determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.\u201d\n\nHowever, a source with knowledge of the situation said, \u201cThere was a miscommunication issue when posting the list. So they are pulling that back.\u201d\n\nThe source said the list mistakenly included federal buildings the administration does not want to sell. According to the source, the list should have included three categories of properties: buildings identified as required for government operation, buildings identified for disposal and buildings whose status could change at a later date and could eventually be put up for sale.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of rushing to get things out and posted without taking time to review what is actually being shared,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe list of 440 \u201cnon-core\u201d properties initially posted to the GSA website also included the departments of Veterans Affairs, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development; Federal Trade Commission; GSA\u2019s own headquarters; and the Old Post Office \u2013 where the Trump Organization had a 60-year lease until it sold it to the Waldorf Astoria hotel in 2022. Several of the buildings listed include staff from multiple agencies, such as the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center, the biggest federal government building in the Southeast.\n\nGSA said in its Tuesday release that most of the buildings flagged consist primarily of office space and that selling them will \u201censure taxpayers no longer pay for empty and underutilized federal office space.\u201d It also claimed it could potentially save \u201cmore than $430 million in annual operating costs.\u201d\n\nThe release said the agency has identified certain \u201ccore\u201d assets \u201cthat are needed for critical government operations,\u201d including courthouses and facilities key to national defense and law enforcement, which \u201cwill be retained for long-term needs.\u201d However, multiple courthouses, including the US Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, were on the list.\n\nThough many of the properties initially listed are in the Washington, DC, metro area, the list included buildings across the country, from Alaska to Florida.\n\nFederal workers ordered to return to office\n\nThe moves come as the Trump administration has ordered federal workers to return to their offices, marking an end to Covid-era rules allowing more flexibility. GSA on Tuesday did not specify where federal workers will go if their buildings are disposed of.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has been working with GSA on a plan to shed federal offices and collocate agencies, according to a source with knowledge of the plans. The goal is to have federal agencies share office space by connecting those that need workspace with those that have extra room.\n\nA recently launched program called \u201cspace match\u201d will allow agency heads throughout the government to fill out a Google form detailing how much space they need for their operations. The program is intended to offset the loss of workspace, but the source cautioned that closing these buildings could be expensive.\n\n\u201cThe cost to close buildings and relocate is pretty high \u2014 you have to clean out the old building and all of its furniture, etc., which for a 500,000 (square foot) building is not cheap,\u201d the source said. GSA will then have to find a place for displaced employees to go, which could mean purchasing new information technology infrastructure or possibly furniture.\n\nThe potential closure of the buildings echoes promises made during President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, where he vowed to move tens of thousands of federal jobs out of Washington, DC, and into \u201cplaces filled with patriots who love America.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump pushed to relocate federal agencies in Washington during his first term, when the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management was moved from the capital to Grand Junction, Colorado.\n\nAs part of a plan to conduct mass layoffs across the federal government, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management have asked federal agencies for an outline of \u201ca positive vision for more productive, efficient agency operations going forward.\u201d\n\nOMB and OPM have asked for agencies to submit proposals for office relocations away from the DC metro area and plans to reduce costs and improve efficiency through technology. Those are due no later than April 14 and should be implemented by September 30, CNN previously reported.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche contributed to this report."

Plus, Peter Nicholas dives into just how seriously Trump\u2019s supporters are taking his third-term flirtations.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nTrump and Musk dominate the first Cabinet meeting of the new administration\n\nBy Katherine Doyle\n\nWhen President Donald Trump convened his Cabinet secretaries for the first meeting of his new term today, a tableful of big personalities largely sat and watched as the main character of the early days of the administration took center stage once more.\n\nThe group, which included nominees who haven\u2019t yet been confirmed, was also joined by Elon Musk, whose early actions to reshape the federal bureaucracy have stoked rancor and unease among government employees, as well as murmurs of concern among some Republicans in Congress.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sacrificing a lot,\u201d Trump said as he introduced Musk. \u201cHe\u2019s getting a lot of praise, I\u2019ll tell you, but he\u2019s also getting hit.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting outlined the hierarchy in his administration, with many of his Senate-confirmed department heads spending an hour as audience members after the president gave the floor to Musk at the top of the meeting.\n\nTrump\u2019s secretaries watched as Musk, standing at the edge of a long table, explained DOGE and its work as \u201ca support function for the president and for the agencies and departments to help achieve those savings to effectively find 15% reduction in fraud and waste.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we bring the receipts,\u201d Musk added.\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Fact check: Jane C. Timm reports that many of the \u201creceipts\u201d on the DOGE list of savings aren\u2019t cuts to active contracts, but dozens of \u201cblanket purchase agreements\u201d about potential future work, meaning that some of the advertised cuts don\u2019t actually save money.\n\nTrump also made his expectations for his Cabinet clear. \u201cOh yeah, they\u2019ll follow the orders,\u201d Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about his control of the executive branch. \u201cOf course, no exceptions.\u201d\n\nRead more from Katherine on Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting \u2192\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f On the other end of Pennsylvania Ave.: Trump and Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn tactics are emerging as a key sticking point between the two parties, as the March 14 deadline to fund the government fast approaches, Sahil Kapur reports.\n\nRepublicans who control the House and the Senate are making it clear they won\u2019t accept constraints on Trump\u2019s authority.\n\nBut they will need Democratic support on a bill to avert a government shutdown to overcome the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, as well as to make up for expected defections from conservatives in the House. Democrats are using that leverage to demand guardrails in the bill to limit the executive branch\u2019s discretion and require the administration to carry out spending directed by Congress.\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Outside of Washington: Trump and Musk\u2019s efforts are having another effect for lawmakers: House Republicans are growing weary and wary of in-person town hall meetings after facing backlash over federal government cuts, Melanie Zanona, Jonathan Allen and Matt Dixon report.\n\nParty leaders suggest that if lawmakers feel the need to hold such events, they should do tele-town halls or at least vet attendees to avoid scenes that become viral clips. A GOP aide said House Republican leaders are urging lawmakers to stop engaging in them altogether.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump keeps toying with a third term \u2014 even though the Constitution forbids it\n\nBy Peter Nicholas\n\nA coterie of Donald Trump loyalists is in the early phase of a campaign to rewrite the Constitution so he can serve another term \u2014 an idea Trump has done nothing to discourage.\n\nAs a candidate last year and since he took office, Trump has teased, stoked, nurtured, fed and, if nothing else, kept alive the improbable notion that he might run and serve one more time.\n\n\u201cAm I allowed to run again?\u201d Trump said last month at a meeting with House Republicans in Florida.\n\nThe Constitution is clear on that point: He\u2019s not. Under the 22nd Amendment, no one may be elected president more than twice. That rules out Trump.\n\nDiehard supporters are undeterred, hoping to overcome that not-so-small obstacle.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., proposed a constitutional amendment that calls for extending presidential term limits from eight years to 12, meaning that if Trump wins again, he could stay in office until January 2033, when he\u2019d be 86 years old.\n\nAnd a poster displayed at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., over the weekend was captioned \u201cThird Term Project\u201d and showed Trump in imperial Julius Caesar garb.\n\n\u201cFor Trump 2028 ... And Beyond!\u201d it read.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 A serious or joking matter?: Opinions differ about the seriousness of the prospect among GOP lawmakers and former advisers who\u2019ve worked with Trump before. There\u2019s a strong view that he\u2019s simply trolling his critics \u2014 tormenting them by suggesting he\u2019s not going away.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump joking about a third term is like a chef joking about putting a Michelin star on his own restaurant \u2014 obviously not happening, but fun to watch the critics lose their minds over it,\u201d Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2020, told NBC News.\n\nYet others believe that if the Constitution is somehow amended to permit a third term, Trump would take the leap.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a procedural way to accomplish it, he\u2019s likely very much considering it,\u201d said Jenna Ellis, a 2020 Trump campaign attorney.\n\n\u201cThat does take a constitutional amendment, but let\u2019s not forget that the Constitution was amended to impose term limits, and that can be undone,\u201d Ellis added in an interview.\n\nRead more from Peter \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83d\udcdd Budget battles: Speaker Mike Johnson managed to get the House\u2019s budget resolution to advance Trump\u2019s legislative agenda approved by the narrowest of margins.

            "full_content": "Photo: Julio Cortez/AP Photo\n\nTexas officials announced Wednesday that a child has died after contracting the measles, the first fatality in an ongoing serious outbreak in the state and neighboring New Mexico over the past few weeks.\n\nThis marks the first death from measles in the United States since 2015, when a woman in Washington State died after likely contracting the virus at a medical facility during an outbreak. Prior to that, the last measles-related death of a child was in 2003, per a report from the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has a history of vaccine skepticism, said during a Cabinet meeting that his department has been following the outbreak. But Kennedy claimed that there had been two deaths from the spate of cases, even though there has been no public confirmation of an additional death.\n\nAnd despite the notable fact that anyone has died of measles at all, the HHS secretary also appeared to downplay the outbreak, noting that they aren\u2019t uncommon in the U.S. \u201cThere\u2019ve been four measles outbreaks this year. In this country last year, there were 16. So it\u2019s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year,\u201d he said. The CDC confirms that there were 16 measles outbreaks in 2024, categorized as an instance of three or more related cases, compared to three so far this year. But last year\u2019s figures marked a significant rise from the four reported outbreaks in 2023, after a quiescent post-pandemic period. And outbreaks have clearly become more common over the past 15 years amid surging vaccine skepticism.\n\nIn a press release, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed that the child who died was hospitalized in the town of Lubbock last week and had tested positive for the measles. The agency did not identify the child but said they were school age and not vaccinated for the disease.\n\nTexas first reported an outbreak of the measles in the state\u2019s South Plains region earlier this month. Since late January, the DSHS has identified 124 cases with most of the cases occurring among children and teenagers. Per the agency, 18 people have been hospitalized in connection with the ongoing outbreak. By comparison, there were 285 confirmed cases of measles in the United States in 2024, according to CDC statistics.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to originate in Gaines County, a rural region of Texas that has the bulk of the identified cases. According to the Texas Tribune, the state\u2019s vaccination rates have decreased since the COVID-19 pandemic, while requests for religious exemptions from vaccines rose significantly from 45,900 in 2018 to 93,000 in 2024."

            "full_content": "Angry birds of a feather. Photo: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nOne of the major themes of the very turbulent second Trump administration has been a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy to downplay or even reverse tensions between Washington and Moscow at the expense of relationships with Ukraine and Western Europe. This isn\u2019t much of a surprise, given the 47th president\u2019s long-standing admiration for Vladimir Putin as a fellow strongman (the best kind of a man, in their mutual estimation), along with the strategic imperatives of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach that eschews alliances or loyalties that aren\u2019t strictly transactional. There are also some parallels between the two men that are well known, including narcissism and a sort of cartoonish toxic masculinity, along with a base of support that includes billionaire oligarchs, Christian nationalists, and thuggish right-wing \u201cpopulists.\u201d\n\nBut the excesses surrounding Trump\u2019s return to office are bringing to light a more pointed set of comparisons, as explained by Jonathan Rauch in The Atlantic:\n\nToday, it is clear that what has happened since January 20 is not just a change of administration but a change of regime \u2014 a change, that is, in our system of government. But a change to what?\n\nThere is an answer, and it is not classic authoritarianism \u2014 nor is it autocracy, oligarchy, or monarchy. Trump is installing what scholars call patrimonialism \u2026\n\nPatrimonialism is less a form of government than a style of governing. It is not defined by institutions or rules; rather, it can infect all forms of government by replacing impersonal, formal lines of authority with personalized, informal ones. Based on individual loyalty and connections, and on rewarding friends and punishing enemies (real or perceived), it can be found not just in states but also among tribes, street gangs, and criminal organizations.\n\nIn its governmental guise, patrimonialism is distinguished by running the state as if it were the leader\u2019s personal property or family business. It can be found in many countries, but its main contemporary exponent \u2014 at least until January 20, 2025 \u2014 has been Vladimir Putin.\n\nPutin\u2019s form of patrimonialism is often compared to criminal, Mafia-boss conduct, with personal respect based on fear and loyalty being the coin of the realm, as Christian Baghai observed not long ago:\n\nBill Browder, head of the Global Magnitsky Justice campaign and author of Red Notice and Freezing Order, has been a staunch critic of Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership style. He likens Putin to the archetype of a mafia boss, suggesting that the Russian president\u2019s authority is precariously dependent on a type of respect that is rooted in fear rather than admiration. This comparison is not made lightly; in both popular culture and reality, a mafia boss commands through a combination of fear, violence, and the unspoken threat of retribution. Browder posits that Putin operates within a similar framework, where respect is synonymous with fear, and losing that respect could mean losing everything.\n\nPutin has managed to create a loose network of patrimonialist leaders, including Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and Narendra Modi of India, which Trump seems inclined to join.\n\nWithout question, Trump shares Putin\u2019s proprietary attitude toward the government over which he presides as though it is an extension of his business holdings; that\u2019s one reason he is so cavalier about conflicts of interest: Governing and profit-making are interchangeable activities in his mind. He has extended that mentality to his claims of unprecedented personal power over the executive branch, and as the embodiment of the executive branch, as well as over the legislative and judicial branches. Indeed, he has seen fit to delegate that vast personal power to the preeminent funder of his 2024 campaign, Elon Musk, who is treating the federal bureaucracy exactly the way he treated employees of companies he took over as owner. Musk is regarding the federal government as something he owns, because the actual owner, Trump, has given him free rein. Much of the confusion over Musk\u2019s official status (or the lack thereof) stems from the complete refusal by either Musk or his boss to view themselves as employees rather than owner-operators of the public sector. Owners don\u2019t need titles or limited grants of authority.\n\nThe \u201cpersonal business\u201d view of government also helps explain the ferocious Trump-Musk assault on the \u201cdeep state,\u201d which represents an alternative power base, as Rauch explains:\n\nPatrimonialism is suspicious of bureaucracies; after all, to exactly whom are they loyal? They might acquire powers of their own, and their rules and processes might prove obstructive. People with expertise, experience, and distinguished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are likewise suspect because they bring independent standing and authority. So patrimonialism stocks the government with nonentities and hacks, or, when possible, it bypasses bureaucratic procedures altogether.\n\nSound familiar? It should.\n\nAnother aspect of patrimonialism shared by Putin and Trump is a categorical refusal to share power with the opposition unless it is absolutely necessary. Both men have turned election victories into \u201cmandates\u201d so vast and unlimited as to make future elections as meaningless as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean Trump will be as successful as his friend (or other \u201cstrongmen\u201d who originally took power democratically) in subverting democracy; U.S. institutions designed to thwart dictatorship are undoubtedly more robust than their Russian counterparts ever were. But as we learned after the 2020 election, Trump has nothing but contempt for democracy unless it happens to serve his purposes.\n\nThe bottom line is that Trump will take his power grabs exactly as far as he is allowed to do by his congressional allies, the courts, and perhaps even some members of his administration who didn\u2019t sign on for making America great again via the concentration of all power in one very fallible man. If we are lucky, smart, and brave, the 47th president may still admire and emulate Vladimir Putin but won\u2019t achieve his corrupt and corrupting status as the personification of his country. Trump recently proclaimed: \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d Dress it up in red, white, and blue all you want, but that\u2019s un-American."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump made numerous false claims in remarks at the first Cabinet meeting of his new administration. The falsehoods spanned a wide variety of topics, including aid to Ukraine, trade with the European Union, the history of the EU, inflation, mail-in voting, drug overdose deaths, and where the US stands in international education rankings.\n\nTrump also left out critical context from two claims related to Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal government. Here is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s statements.\n\nUkraine and Europe\n\nUS vs. European wartime aid to Ukraine: Trump repeated his regular false claim that the US has provided $350 billion in aid to Ukraine while Europe has collectively provided just $100 billion in aid to Ukraine. That is not close to correct.\n\nAccording to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, Europe \u2013 the European Union plus individual European countries \u2013 had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December 2024 (about $259 billion) than the US committed (about $125 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $139 billion) than the US allocated (about $120 billion).\n\nThe US did have a slim lead in one particular category, military aid allocated, providing about $67 billion compared to about $65 billion from Europe. But even that was nowhere close to the giant gulf Trump described.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s \u201c$350 billion\u201d figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response has said on its website that \u201cas of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion, with $130.1 billion obligated and $86.7 billion disbursed\u201d \u2013 and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.\n\nObama\u2019s Ukraine aid: Trump revived a false claim he regularly made during his first presidency about the Obama administration\u2019s military aid to Ukraine, saying that \u201cthey said\u201d that Obama \u201cgave sheets.\u201d While he didn\u2019t say who \u201cthey\u201d are, it\u2019s not true that the Obama administration merely provided bedsheets to Ukraine (or \u201cpillows and sheets,\u201d as Trump used to say). While it\u2019s true that the Obama administration declined to provide weapons to Ukraine, it provided more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 that included counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, armored Humvees, tactical drones, night vision devices and medical supplies.\n\nThe European Union and trade: Trump repeated a false claim that the European Union doesn\u2019t \u201caccept, essentially, our farm products.\u201d The claim is false even with the \u201cessentially\u201d qualifier. The EU bought $12.3 billion worth of US agricultural exports in the 2023 fiscal year, making it the fourth-largest export market for US agricultural and related products behind China, Mexico and Canada, according to official data.\n\nThe formation of the European Union: Trump repeated his false claim that the European Union \u201cwas formed in order to screw the United States; I mean, look, let\u2019s be honest.\u201d Experts on the EU told CNN during Trump\u2019s first presidency that there is no basis for such claims, noting that US presidents had consistently supported European integration efforts.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s claims are preposterous,\u201d Desmond Dinan, a public policy professor at George Mason University who is an expert in the history of European integration, said during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cThe European Communities (forerunner of the EU) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint US-Western European plan to stabilize and secure Western Europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space.\u201d\n\nTrade\n\nTariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falsely claimed that the US took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs \u201cfrom China\u201d during his presidency, then falsely claimed that before his presidency, no other president took in even \u201c10 cents.\u201d\n\nThe US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, and often pass on some or all of the cost to US consumers. Study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nTrade with Canada: Trump repeated his vague claim that the US is losing $200 billion per year to Canada; he didn\u2019t define \u201close,\u201d but this is how he generally refers to trade deficits, and he has previously claimed the US has a $200 billion annual trade deficit with Canada.\n\nIn fact, the US goods and services trade deficit with Canada was about $40.6 billion in 2023, according to US government figures; even if you only consider trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the US deficit with Canada was about $72.3 billion, still far shy of Trump\u2019s figure. And it\u2019s worth noting that the deficit is overwhelmingly caused by the US importing a large quantity of inexpensive Canadian oil, which helps keep Americans\u2019 gas prices down.\n\nEconomy, education and health\n\nInflation during Trump\u2019s first term: Trump repeated his false claim that there was \u201cno inflation\u201d under his first presidency. In fact, year-over-year inflation was 1.4% in the month he left office, January 2021 \u2013 relatively low, but not nonexistent \u2013 and prices rose about 8% from the beginning of that presidency to the end.\n\nInflation today: Trump baselessly claimed that \u201cthe inflation is stopping, slowly.\u201d Inflation rose to 3% in January (a month largely under the Biden administration), and there is no indication that it is \u201cstopping,\u201d slowly or otherwise; Trump is pushing various policies that many economists describe as inflationary, notably including a variety of tariffs on imported goods. (Some low level of inflation is generally considered healthy for an economy, so the Federal Reserve targets a rate of 2% rather than stopping inflation completely.)\n\nEducation rankings: Trump repeated his false claim that the US ranks dead last, 40th out of 40 countries, in international education rankings. When asked by CNN to identify any education rankings list in which the US placed 40th out of 40, the White House couldn\u2019t do so. FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have noted that even among the wealthy, developed countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the US ranks well above average in reading and science and below average, but still far from last, in math.\n\nFentanyl deaths: Trump repeated his inaccurate rejection of official statistics on overdose deaths, claiming that \u201cwe lose 300,000 people a year to fentanyl, not 100 (thousand), not 95 (thousand), not 60 (thousand) like you read\u2026close to 300,000 people, dead.\u201d\n\nThere is no basis for Trump\u2019s \u201c300,000\u201d figure. In the 12-month period ending in September 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there were 55,126 deaths involving synthetic opioids including fentanyl \u2013 a terrible figure, but nowhere close to what Trump said. Even at the peak, US deaths involving synthetic opioids hovered under 80,000 for any given 12-month period.\n\nWhen Trump made similar \u201c300,000\u201d claims in 2024, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University, told CNN that this is \u201ca made-up number,\u201d saying, \u201cI have no idea where Trump is getting \u2018300,000\u2019 from.\u201d\n\nKolodny said it\u2019s likely that the number of US overdose deaths is undercounted, but that there is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s insistence that the real number is nearly triple the reported number. And Kolodny said the undercount issue is centered not on overdoses from illicit fentanyl smuggled across the southern border but on seniors\u2019 overdoses from accidentally taking too much of their legal prescription medications.\n\nForeign affairs\n\nTrump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that he \u201cgot rid of\u201d the ISIS terror group in just \u201cthree weeks\u201d even though \u201cpeople\u201d had told him it would take five years. The ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nMail-in voting: Trump falsely claimed, \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world that has mail-in voting.\u201d Various other countries, including Canada, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Spain allow some or all voters to vote by mail, though the specifics of their policies vary.\n\nFentanyl and Canada: Speaking of fentanyl, Trump claimed, \u201cA lot of it comes through Canada.\u201d It\u2019s debatable what counts as \u201ca lot,\u201d but US official statistics show that, of 21,889 pounds of fentanyl seized by US border authorities in the 2024 fiscal year, about 0.2% \u2013 43 pounds \u2013 was seized near the Canadian border. That\u2019s compared to 21,148 pounds at the Mexican border, about 96.6%.\n\nMilitary equipment and Afghanistan: Trump repeated his exaggeration that the US left tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. The Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.\n\nGovernment workers and spending\n\nThe five accomplishments email: Trump, speaking of the federal employees who did not respond to an Elon Musk email blast asking them to list accomplishments from the previous week, said, \u201cUsually that means that maybe that person doesn\u2019t exist, or that person doesn\u2019t want to say they\u2019re working for another company while being paid by the United States government.\u201d He added that these million people who didn\u2019t respond are \u201con the bubble\u201d for continued employment even though \u201cmaybe they don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t explain that there are benign explanations for the large number of non-responses. Leaders at multiple federal agencies told their employees not to respond to the email, and the Trump administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management told agencies that replying was voluntary. And some employees may have been sick, on vacation, on leave or without access to their email account by the response deadline of Monday; the email was sent to federal employees on Saturday.\n\nIn other words, a non-response certainly doesn\u2019t mean a federal employee is imaginary or that they are a real person improperly moonlighting at a second job on government time.\n\nDeceased people and Social Security: Trump said of Social Security: \u201cYou see people that are 200 years old that are being sent checks for Social Security. Some of them are actually being sent checks. So we\u2019re facing that down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that some Social Security checks are being sent to some long-deceased people. But as Musk insinuates that millions of long-deceased people might be getting money, it\u2019s important to note that Social Security already has a system in place to stop payments to people listed as being age 115 and older.\n\nA 2023 report from the inspector general who monitors the Social Security Administration found 18.9 million people age 100 or older who were not marked as deceased on their entry in a Social Security database, an issue Musk has discussed. But while the inspector general was critical of the Social Security Administration (SSA) over the issue, she also found that only 44,000 of these 18.9 million people were receiving payments.\n\nEven those 44,000 payments were not obviously fraudulent or erroneous. The inspector general noted that a larger number of living people in the US, an estimated 86,000, were age 100 or older.\n\n\u201cRegarding the 44,000 figure, I\u2019m confident that the vast majority of those are legit payments. So while there probably is some fraud, I don\u2019t think these numbers show any evidence of it,\u201d Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank who served as principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration during the George W. Bush administration, told CNN last week.\n\nThe acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, Leland Dudek, who was elevated to that post by the current Trump administration, tried to set the record straight in a February statement.\n\n\u201cThe reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,\u201d Dudek said."

            "full_content": "The ostensible Speaker of the House applauds the real Speaker of the House. Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIt was one of those moments Washington insiders love. Tuesday night, after a tense few days of negotiations with wayward GOP congressmen, House Speaker Mike Johnson pulled his budget blueprint from the floor and sent members home only to \u2026 reverse the decision and then win the vote by the smallest possible margin. Johnson pulls a rabbit out of the hat again, with a little help from Donald J. Trump, and his \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d is on course!\n\nPutting aside the hype, what really happened is that the very first stage of the process by which Trump\u2019s legislative agenda may be enacted is roughly half over. Because Trump was extremely tardy in communicating any preference between the Senate\u2019s approach of enacting that agenda in two budget reconciliation bills and the House\u2019s approach of rolling it all into one, the two chambers now have separate budget resolutions laying out a blueprint for the ultimate legislation. The Senate is now expected to defer to the House\u2019s approach but will rewrite the resolution to meet its own needs (Republican senators are reportedly anxious for even bigger tax cuts than the House). So some version of the resolution that passed Tuesday night on a 217-215 vote (Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only member to break party ranks) will be worked out between House and Senate in discussions that could take weeks. Only then will an actual budget reconciliation bill become possible, and all this maneuvering will become very real.\n\nThe broad outlines of the House budget resolution provide for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, $1.5 to $2 trillion in spending cuts for \u201cmandatory\u201d programs (i.e., those not subject to annual appropriations), and a $4 trillion increase in the national debt limit. The bill doesn\u2019t provide specifics; it just instructs House committees to cut spending to certain levels. A lot of attention is being paid to the $880 billion in cuts demanded from the Energy and Commerce Committee, since that will almost certainly require major cuts in Medicaid.\n\nA lot of the intra-GOP debate before passage of the resolution revolved around fears among House Republicans from marginal districts about the depth of cuts, particularly for Medicaid, and the desire of House Freedom Caucus types for even bigger cuts, not only for Medicaid and other safety-net programs but for the nonmandatory spending governed by annual appropriations bills. As the clock wound down for the vote on the House floor, Johnson brought in Trump to tell wavering members pretty much whatever they wanted to hear. The president jawboned the hard-core House Freedom Caucus members hungering and thirsting for deeper cuts, as the Washington Post explained:\n\nTrump worked the phone earlier in the day and during the evening vote series to sway Reps. Tim Burchett (Tennessee), Victoria Spartz (Indiana), Warren Davidson (Ohio) and Thomas Massie (Kentucky) to support the plan.\n\nAll the holdouts except for Massie flipped. \u2026\n\nBurchett said his conversation with Trump was the key factor to changing his mind. \u2026\n\nThere was no quid pro quo, but the president assured me that he would work toward cuts, and he\u2019s never lied to me.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the most persuasive argument may have been Johnson\u2019s incessant reminders that the budget resolution didn\u2019t mention specific cuts, giving those who wanted more and those who wanted less plausible deniability, as HuffPost reported:\n\nTo sway the moderates, Johnson and his lieutenants in the House GOP have fashioned a new talking point that insists the budget would not actually cut Medicaid because the word \u201cMedicaid\u201d isn\u2019t in the resolution.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even mention Medicaid in the bill,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nEventually, of course, decisions on budget and tax cuts will have to be made, though perhaps not until the cherry blossoms have bloomed and faded and summer\u2019s heat strikes Washington. In the meantime, separate negotiations over appropriations are underway to keep the federal government operating when stopgap spending runs out on March 14 (though some short-term extensions are likely), which in turn may revolve around Democratic demands that the Trump administration and Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE stop usurping congressional spending prerogatives and violating civil service protections. How it all fits together is anybody\u2019s guess at present, but so long as Democrats remain united, every step will require more promises, pressure, and lies from real Speaker of the House at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."

            "full_content": "Photo: Bryan Dozier/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty\n\nLast month, Donald Trump presented an absolutely appalling plan to have the United States \u201ctake over the Gaza Strip\u201d and \u201cdevelop it.\u201d This would entail expelling the 2 million Palestinians who currently live in the war-ravaged territory and giving them no right of return.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be cute, I don\u2019t want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East could be something,\u201d Trump said at a February 4 press conference. \u201cThis could be so magnificent.\u201d\n\nMany world leaders, activists, and religious figures agreed that Trump\u2019s plan \u201ccould be something\u201d \u2026 and that something is called ethnic cleansing.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what could be worse than that, but somehow Trump found a way to make his vision for Gaza even more disgusting. Late on Tuesday, Trump shared an AI-generated video to Truth Social and Instagram that depicts \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d for Gaza. Apparently, the president dreams of turning the territory into a Dubai-esque city of skyscrapers where he will revel in his wealth with pals Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and be worshipped as a golden god.\n\nThe deranged video crams a lot of information into just 33 seconds, so here\u2019s a breakdown.\n\nThroughout the clip, a dance track plays in the background proclaiming, \u201cTrump Gaza\u2019s finally here!\u201d These are the lyrics:\n\nDonald\u2019s coming to set you free, bringing the life for all to see. No more tunnels, no more fear, Trump Gaza is finally here. Trump Gaza shining bright, golden future, a brand-new life. Feast and dance; the deed is done. Trump Gaza No. 1.\n\nFirst we see the rubble that is present-day Gaza morph into a scene of children running onto a gorgeous beach with yachts and tall buildings in the background (presumably these are not Palestinian children as they will have been relocated). There are more scenes of palm-tree-lined luxury-shopping districts, then a shot of Elon Musk enjoying a hummuslike dip. The clip features four shots of the DOGE chief living it up in Gaza. In two, he is eating:\n\nAnd in two others, he is making it rain dollars:\n\nTrump will enjoy the pleasures of the new Gaza as well (maybe a bit too much: He looks pretty chunky throughout). We see Trump dancing with a scantily clad woman who is not his wife:\n\nAnd lounging on the beach with the Israeli prime minister:\n\nThis new Gaza will actually be freer than the United States under Trump, judging from the bearded, bikini-clad belly dancers frolicking in public:\n\nToward the end of the video, it\u2019s revealed that \u201cTrump Gaza\u201d doesn\u2019t just refer to the president\u2019s plan for the territory. It\u2019s actually the name of a new luxury resort:\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t just dreaming of slapping his name on another property. He wants to see the denizens of Gaza carrying golden Trump-head balloons (not to be confused with Trump-baby balloons):\n\nAnd perhaps basking in the glow of the Suddam Hussein\u2013esque golden Trump statue:\n\nPeople can also buy tiny gold Trump statues so they can worship false idols in the comfort of their own home:\n\nRecently, members of the Trump administration have portrayed the president\u2019s plans for Gaza as a kind of negotiating tactic meant to spur Arab leaders into action, as the New York Times reported:\n\nAfter President Trump shocked the Arab world last month by suggesting the entire population of Gaza be expelled from the territory, his aides reframed the idea as an invitation to the leaders of the Middle East: Come up with a better plan, or do it our way.\n\n\u201cAll these countries say how much they care about the Palestinians,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week. \u201cIf the Arab countries have a better plan, then that\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Rubio added.\n\nPresumably, some will argue that Trump is playing four-dimensional chess by dropping this revolting AI video. But maybe all it really shows is that Trump is a megalomaniac who doesn\u2019t care if Palestinians live or die and no longer feels the need to hide it."

            "full_content": "Democrats are chasing bad policy and bad politics in their short-sighted effort to thwart President Donald Trump\u2019s American energy renaissance, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) explained to Breitbart News on Tuesday.\n\nSenate Democrats are moving Wednesday to block Trump\u2019s national energy emergency in a gesture of opposition to the president\u2019s actions to lower energy prices and deliver on a key campaign pledge.\n\n\u201cDuring his campaign, President Trump emphasized the connection between a robust energy economy and getting inflation under control further,\u201d Lummis told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview. \u201cIt creates jobs, it creates energy in the country that is best able to produce clean energy, and that\u2019s the United States.\u201d\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump declared a national energy emergency to unleash American energy production after energy prices skyrocketed under former President Joe Biden. Biden moved to halt oil and natural gas leases, banned offshore drilling, and sought to require a majority of new cars sold in the U.S. to be electric vehicles or hybrids by 2032, Breitbart News\u2019 Sean Moran reported.\n\nThe burden hit all Americans, especially those in Lummis\u2019s home state \u2013 \u201cWyoming exports 12 times more energy than it consumes,\u201d Lummis emphasized. But Trump\u2019s designation of a national energy emergency is both increasing energy availability and lowering costs as well as furthering clean energy efforts.\n\n\u201cNow that President Trump has correctly opened opportunities for energy production \u2013 and I mean energy production of all kinds in this country \u2013 it helps us achieve a cleaner environment worldwide, because we can produce it so much cleaner than China, Russia and other countries on the other side of the planet,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt is going to have benefits all over the country, including the Northeast, the West Coast and areas that tend to be dominated by Democrat voters,\u201d Lummis expounded, adding \u201cit will give us a chance to show them that we can have less expensive, more abundant clean energy in this country, that we can protect our environment at the same time that we make ourselves not only energy independent, but energy dominant.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 resolution to revoke Trump\u2019s order is privileged, therefore, the Senate has to schedule a vote on the legislation. Lummis believes their effort is doomed to fail on the Senate floor and with voters weary of paying high energy prices.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get shot down in a big way,\u201d she said of Democrats. \u201cAnd it gives us, those of us who are for producing more clean American energy and the attendant jobs that go along with that, an opportunity to explain that\u2026 when we produce energy in the United States is actually cleaning up the global environment.\u201d\n\nChina is building dozens of coal plants, yet Democrats, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) have argued that America is in a clean energy \u201carms race\u201d with China.\n\nLummis, who saw firsthand the Chinese pollution emitted across the globe during a visit to South Korea, believes Democrats\u2019 crusade to promote alternative energy sources regardless of the consequences is short-sighted.\n\n\u201cModern coal fired power plants that use Yankee ingenuity and American technology and are extremely clean, and so I would tell my friend, Sen. Wyden, we should be building more clean coal-fired power plants here in the United States, and in fact, as a gesture of environmental goodwill around the world, we should teach China how to do their coal-fired power plants in a cleaner way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on the Democrats\u2019 resolution Wednesday.\n\nLummis is a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

            "full_content": "Photo: Michael M. Santiag/Getty Images\n\nWhen Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos stunned the newsroom on Wednesday by announcing that he was remaking the ideology of the \u201cOpinions\u201d section so that it would be \u201cwriting every day in support and defense\u201d of \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets,\u201d publisher Will Lewis eagerly hopped onboard. In a follow-up letter to staff, Lewis said he \u201cwill be so very proud for the Post to be known for its two key pillars,\u201d a departure from the righteous motto of \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d that Bezos adopted during Donald Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThis is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cDoing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.\u201d\n\nBut behind the scenes, Lewis had pointed out to Bezos that the change would have consequences for the health of the paper, according to a source familiar with conversations around the decision. This is ostensibly because the \u201cOpinions\u201d section is a crucial component of Lewis\u2019s vision for revitalizing the Post, the second of three newsrooms he outlined in his big plan to drive subscriptions and increase reader engagement. Opinion sections, though smaller than their news-gathering counterparts, are cheaper to produce and known to punch above their weight in terms of getting eyeballs \u2014 particularly when taking aim at the Trump administration. \u201cYou have an owner whose political perspectives are evolving quite rapidly and who, like a lot of billionaires, lives outside of consequence,\u201d said one Post insider. \u201cThis is probably not a great commercial move, but he has the cash to be careless.\u201d\n\nBezos\u2019s decision is the latest earthquake to hit the Post since he pulled the editorial board\u2019s endorsement of Kamala Harris on the eve of the 2024 election \u2014 a move that cost the paper some 250,000 angered subscribers, who likely associated the Post more with the truth-to-power journalism of the Watergate era than defending the integrity of free markets. Sources said it became clear at the beginning of 2025 that Bezos wanted such a shift, and Ben Mullin of the New York Times reported that Lewis in January sent \u201cOpinions\u201d editor David Shipley a memo with Bezos\u2019s ideas for an opinion section that more closely resembled that of the Rupert Murdoch\u2013owned Wall Street Journal. Shipley made the decision to step down in the past week or so.\n\nBezos has now made it clear that he intends to use the Post as an instrument of his own ideas and agenda after years in which he let Marty Baron, Fred Hiatt, and other editors steer the ship. \u201cJeff has clearly shifted his relationship with the paper from distant steward to person who has a plaything, and he\u2019s demonstrated a kind of impetuousness and a little bit of careless disregard that are very familiar to public life right now,\u201d the Post insider noted. And Bezos has also made it clear that, whatever plans Lewis may have to bring back subscribers, those are secondary to his political aims, which appear to include appeasing the Trump administration. (That Lewis\u2019s authority has been undermined was painfully evident in the fact that staff got the memo from Bezos first.) Baron said he couldn\u2019t be more \u201csad and disgusted\u201d with Bezos\u2019s change in approach.\n\n\u201cOpinions\u201d staff gathered for a meeting on Wednesday in which Shipley explained that he wanted an opinion section reflecting a wide range of voices and views \u2014 a \u201c360-degree view,\u201d as he put it, per an \u201cOpinions\u201d staffer. The staffer noted that Bezos has \u201ctalked in the past about wanting a broader range of views and encouraged us to look all over the country \u2014 and not in the traditional opinion silos of the coasts,\u201d adding, \u201cit seems like Jeff has reversed himself on that and no longer believes in hosting a national conversation.\u201d In his memo, Bezos wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\u201d\n\nWhat this decision means for \u201cOpinions\u201d staffers who don\u2019t align with Bezos\u2019s viewpoint remains to be seen. (Or even for those who do: \u201cI\u2019m very much in favor of free markets and individual liberty, but I never signed up to be a mouthpiece for Jeff Bezos or anyone else,\u201d as one staffer put it.) There is also the question of whether Bezos will begin meddling in the newsroom. His encroachment into the \u201cOpinions\u201d section prompted several top Post journalists to say publicly that they would quit if he interferes with their reporting. \u201cNo one has ever told me what to write,\u201d White House reporter Dan Diamond wrote on X. \u201cIf that changes, I\u2019d speak out and leave.\u201d Executive editor Matt Murray assured reporters that Bezos had no desire to do so. The opinion section \u201cis traditionally the provenance of the owner at news organizations,\u201d Murray wrote in a memo to the newsroom. \u201cThe independent and unbiased work of the Post\u2019s newsroom remains unchanged, and we will continue to pursue engaging, impactful journalism without fear or favor.\u201d\n\nAll this turmoil comes as the Post has seen an exodus of top talent, with more to come, including Pulitzer Prize winner Caroline Kitchener, who is heading to the Times. \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for the reporters of the Washington Post to do their jobs. It\u2019s his paper \u2014 I get that \u2014 but it just feels like a joke,\u201d one staffer said. \u201cIs Jeff Bezos going to allow the Washington Post editorial page to write things about freedom of speech for people he doesn\u2019t like? Or to write about free markets and how Amazon is a threat?\u201d\n\nAt least one person is a fan of the changes. \u201cBravo, @JeffBezos!\u201d Elon Musk wrote on X."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration moved forward Wednesday with its plans to conduct large-scale layoffs across agencies, the latest move to downsize the federal workforce.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management issued a memo to agency leaders with guidance on how to conduct their reductions in force, known as RIFs, and the reorganizations plans, taking another step to carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order entitled \u201cImplementing The President\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization Initiative.\u201d\n\nThe memo comes as the Trump administration is conducting a multi-pronged effort to overhaul federal operations and shed employees. In less than six weeks, it has laid off tens of thousands of probationary workers, placed other employees on administrative leave, offered a deferred resignation package and ordered staffers to return to the office full time.\n\nThe moves, along with a confusing weekend demand that staffers list their activities of the past week, have ratcheted up the anxiety levels of many federal workers, who until now had felt they had some job security. The federal government has not conducted a widespread reduction in force since the Clinton administration in the 1990s.\n\nAccording to Wednesday\u2019s memo, the principles to guide the agencies include conducting \u201ca significant reduction\u201d in the number of federal workers by eliminating positions that are not needed and reducing federal property holdings and budget, as well as providing better service to Americans and increasing productivity, according to the memo.\n\nThe first phase includes submitting lists of agency divisions and employees performing functions not mandated by law or regulation who are not considered essential employees during government shutdowns. The plans should also include lists of all jobs categorized as essential, of agency divisions that provide direct service to Americans and of any statutes that establish the agency, as well as the tools the agencies plan to use to reduce their staffs.\n\nPlus, agencies should provide suggestions for how to engage Congress to gain agreement on major restructuring efforts and on moving funds between accounts. The deadline for submitting the plans, which should include an implementation timetables, is no later than March 13.\n\nIn the second phase, OMB and OPM are asking for an outline of \u201ca positive vision for more productive, efficient agency operations going forward.\u201d Those are due no later than April 14 and should be implemented by September 30.\n\nThe information requested includes an agency\u2019s proposed organizational chart and confirmation that it has reviewed all employees\u2019 job descriptions, recent performance reports, length of service and veterans\u2019 status. OMB and OPM also want to know proposed relocations of offices away from the Washington, DC, metro area and plans to reduce costs and improve efficiency through technology.\n\nAgencies\u2019 plans should also include provisions of union collective bargaining agreements that could inhibit cost-savings and efficiency efforts and proposals to renegotiate those provisions. Also, agencies should provide justifications for excluding programs and divisions from the reductions, as well as areas for future large-scale layoffs.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Source: Trump administration to direct agencies to prepare for firings 01:40 - Source: CNN Source: Trump administration to direct agencies to prepare for firings 01:40\n\nAnd, as in the executive order, the memo notes that future hiring should be limited to one position for every four people who depart.\n\nExempted from this restructuring are positions in law enforcement, border security, national security, public safety and immigration enforcement, as well as the military and federal uniformed personnel, including the US Coast Guard. Also, the US Postal Service and the executive office of the President are not subject to the memo.\n\nIn addition, the guidance notes that any agencies or divisions providing direct services to citizens, such as Social Security, Medicare and veterans\u2019 health care, should not implement any reductions until OMB and OPM certify that the plans would have a \u201cpositive effect\u201d on delivering those services.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "Photo: Andrea Renault/STAR MAX/IPx/Getty Images\n\nEric Adams has long professed his innocence of the federal corruption charges levied against him. He also has a major rhetorical tendency toward the grandiose. So perhaps it wasn\u2019t surprising when the mayor invoked Jesus Christ on Tuesday as a comparison for his current plight.\n\nAdams was speaking at a Gracie Mansion reception alongside other administration officials commemorating Black History Month. During his remarks, the mayor told a story from his policing days about pulling over to assist civilians with a stalled car in the pouring rain, using it as a metaphor to advise the crowd to use their own personal light well.\n\nThen Adams turned to his unsettled legal situation, calling out those who have pushed for the mayor to resign from office. \u201cSo, this is a biblical moment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, when Jesus was on the cross, he said, \u2018God, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\u2019 All these Negroes who were asking me to step down, God, forgive them,\u201d he said, to applause and shouts from the crowd.\n\nAdams then ran down a list of his administration\u2019s accomplishments, claiming a record amount of new and affordable housing being built as well as an increase in job creation and tens of thousands of guns off the city\u2019s streets. \u201cWhat we have done, you have to be stupid to try to stop me from running this race. It\u2019s a level of buffoonery that\u2019s going on that\u2019s spreading as fast as COVID,\u201d he said.\n\nAdams was questioned about his comments during an appearance on FOX 5 New York\u2019s Good Day New York. Anchor Curt Menefee pressed Adams on his use of the word \u201cNegroes,\u201d noting that some people have an issue with that term being used.\n\n\u201cAre you implying if you\u2019re Black, you have to support you?\u201d Menefee asked.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019m asking for all New Yorkers to support me,\u201d Adams said.\n\nMenefee asked the mayor whom he was specifically referring to during his comments.\n\n\u201cWell, who has asked me to step down? If you look at that whole speech, the speech talked about the continuation of lighting your flame and continuing to light and shine. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in this administration with our team,\u201d Adams said. \u201cSo, those who have called for me to allow my flame to be prematurely extinguished, that\u2019s who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nAdams said that the people of New York City selected him to be their mayor and that nothing he has done has warranted his resignation or removal. \u201cI have not been convicted of a crime. I\u2019ve moved the city forward. I\u2019ve done the job that New Yorkers asked me to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, when you have those that are trying to usurp the power of the people, that is not democracy, and God forgive them.\u201d"

            "full_content": "At the 97th annual Academy Awards, presented on March 2, Adrien Brody won the Oscar for best actor for \"The Brutalist.\" Watch scenes from the winning performance and others nominated in the category of best actor, as well as interviews with the nominees below.\n\nThe 2025 Academy Award nominees for best actor: Adrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"; Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"A Complete Unknown\"; Colman Domingo, \"Sing Sing\"; Ralph Fiennes, \"Conclave\"; and Sebastian Stan, \"The Apprentice.\" A24; Searchlight Pictures; Focus Features; Briarcliff Entertainment\n\nAdrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"\n\nIn 2003 Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor Oscar-winner in history for his performance in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician struggling to survive in the Jewish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It was a role for which he virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning the piano so that he could play Chopin.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Brody is back with his second Oscar nomination for \"The Brutalist,\" Brady Corbet's lacerating tale of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States, and his efforts both to resume his career and to assimilate in a society where antisemitism and classism are rife.\n\nT\u00f3th is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. In this scene, T\u00f3th \u2013 who is working a construction site in Pennsylvania \u2013 is discovered by Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce), who sees in T\u00f3th a talent for which he wants to be the patron.\n\nT\u00f3th accepts a commission. But once his wife Erzs\u00e9bet (best supporting actress nominee Felicity Jones) arrives from Europe, T\u00f3th feels caught between his artistic impulses and the realities of working in an America that, in many cases, is closed to the foreign born:\n\nBrody, whose mother and grandparents fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution, said their sacrifices informed his performance. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"\n\nHe also heard the voice of his Hungarian grandfather in T\u00f3th. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said. \"I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"\n\nIn this extended interview with \"Sunday Morning,\" Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"\n\nBrody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the Golden Globe for best motion picture actor (drama), and the BAFTA for \"The Brutalist.\" The film received 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director (Brady Corbet).\n\n\"The Brutalist,\" released by A24, is playing in select theaters in 70mm, and is available via VOD.\n\nUPDATED: Brody received his second Academy Award, winning for his performance as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th in \"The Brutalist.\" [The film also won Academy Awards for its cinematography and original score.]\n\nIn an emotional speech, Brody addressed the film community: \"Acting is a very fragile profession. It looks very glamorous, and in certain moments it is, but the one thing that I've gained having the privilege to come back here is to have some perspective. And no matter where you are in your career, no matter what you've accomplished, it can all go away, and I think what makes this night most special is the awareness of that, and the gratitude that I have to still do the work that I love.\n\n\"Winning an award like this is, it signifies a destination. And It's something my character references in the film, but to me it also, beyond the pinnacle of a career, it is a chance to begin again, and the opportunity to hopefully be fortunate enough so that the next 20 years of my life that I can prove that I am worthy of such meaningful and important and relevant roles.\"\n\nBrody alluded to both the characters he played in \"The Pianist\" and \"The Brutalist,\" saying, \"I'm here once again to represent the lingering traumas and the repercussions of war, and systematic oppression, and of anti-semitism and racism, and of othering. ... I pray for a healthier and a happier and a more inclusive world, and I believe if the past can teach us anything, it's a reminder to not let hate go unchecked.\"\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"A Complete Unknown\"\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his first best actor Oscar nomination at age 22 for \"Call Me By Your Name,\" as a teenage boy who becomes the target of an older man. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet plays the iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan during the years when he made a name for himself as a folk artist and as a rock star who, to a segment of his fans, left the roots of folk music behind.\n\nIn this scene Dylan is introduced by Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton) for his first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he performs \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":\n\nPrior to shooting, Chalamet travelled to Minnesota to research Dylan's roots and his formative days. He returned to the state for a screening of the finished film in Minneapolis. In December Chalamet told CBS Minnesota station WCCO, \"I think he's very proud of his Minnesota heritage, and I think, in some ways, the way I relate to him is, I think the iron ore in his songs and the iron ore in his voice \u2014 as a New Yorker, as a 28-year-old New Yorker, I don't think my path would have really brought me out here, ever.\n\n\"So, the first time I got here I thought, 'Wow, what a gift, Bob Dylan, being in this guy's worldview.'\"\n\nThe actor was first attached to the project in 2019, but shooting was repeatedly delayed due to COVID and then the actors' strike. In the intervening years, Chalamet learned how to play the guitar. \"I don't know if I'll ever get this much time to work on something in advance,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter. He also gained 20 pounds prior to shooting, to better match the folk singer's physique.\n\nHe said the role marked the furthest that he'd stretched himself. \"And it became so biblical to me in terms of this man's life and his work that I felt if I let my focus err for a second, that I'd be self-loathing about it for years to come. I had three months to play Bob Dylan, and the rest of my life I don't get to be about that, so why not give it my all?\"\n\nTo connect with what the reclusive Dylan represented, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he disconnected from his own life for the two-and-a-half months of filming. He did not use his cellphone, or have visitors on set. \"I've never approached a character so intensely as Bob, 'cause I have such respect for the material,\" Chalamet said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day when something went wrong.\"\n\nIn addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he learned to perform about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script. But while Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie (to be played back on set during filming), he said they sounded \"too clean,\" and so he tried performing live on set, doing so the first time in a scene in which Dylan visits his terminally ill hero, folk artist Woody Guthrie, in a New Jersey hospital.\n\nDirector James Mangold said he knew Chalamet nailed \"Song to Woody\" on his first take: \"There's a moment in that scene right at the last stanza where he holds a note \u2013 that would never have happened if we'd used the playback track,\" Mangold said.\n\nChalamet also examined video of the singer, including footage taken of a Dylan performing a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" with Joan Baez, which he played at a reduced speed. \"That was when I really slowed down, 'cause it's fascinating the way Bob observes her,\" he said. \"And how he refuses eye contact in that video.\"\n\nIn \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet and Barbaro perform \"It Ain't Me Babe\":\n\nSpeaking of the finished film, Chalamet said, \"I was honored and counting my lucky stars that we got to bring this to life. Because nothing's a given. No opportunity is a given. No career is a given. I talked a lot about this with Edward Norton: the gift to work on something where every day \u2014 whether listening to the musicians we were playing, or the musicians that inspired them, or reading the authors that inspired them \u2014 you learn more about yourself.\"\n\nChalamet told \"60 Minutes\" he's not sure what he'd say to Dylan if he ever did meet him \u2013 but maybe not even mention the movie, and only talk about the weather: \"What his favorite sandwich is, or something like that ... I would play it super cool, you know? 'Cause I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise.\"\n\nChalamet won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.\n\nNominated for 8 Academy Awards, \"A Complete Unknown,\" released by Searchlight Pictures, is playing in theaters. and is available via VOD.\n\nSee also:\n\nColman Domingo, \"Sing Sing\"\n\nAt New York's Sing Sing prison, the organization Rehabilitation Through the Arts, or RTA, was formed to produce plays featuring incarcerated men performing classics by Shakespeare, as well as original plays that spoke to the lived experiences of men. The value of theater as a tool of reform was made palpable by RTA's success; compared to the prison's typical recidivism rate of 60%, only 3% of former inmates who had taken part in RTA were back in prison three years or less after their release.\n\nDirected by Greg Kwedar, the film \"Sing Sing\" was built on the experiences of real-life former inmates (two of whom, Clarence Maclin and John Divine G Whitfield, share an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay). Colman Domingo was nominated for playing Divine G, a founding member of Sing Sing's theater program and an award-winning author.\n\nIn this scene, Divine G attends a clemency hearing and describes to the commissioners how the prison program grew into something he calls \"wonderful\":\n\nDomingo was a journeyman actor whose work in recent years has exploded, from \"Fear the Walking Dead\" and \"Euphoria,\" to \"The Color Purple\" and \"The Madness.\" He received two Tony Award nominations (for acting in the musical \"The Scottsboro Boys\" and producing the play \"Fat Ham\"). He earned his first Oscar nomination last year for playing civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"\n\nHe talked about his recent success on \"CBS Mornings\" last November: \"I feel that it's been a long time in my journey, where suddenly the roles are sort of meeting my skill set and what I'm curious about and what I can do. So, it just feels like I'm a journeyman actor. I've been working for 34 years, and it just feels like, I never knew what this time would be like.\"\n\nLast March, on the day of the Oscars, Domingo posted a picture of himself on Instagram as a child, writing, \"His dream came true. Not easily. With dedication, hard work, hardships, triumphs, pitfalls, detours, reroutes and love and faith. Today is a good day for this kid. He already won. And as you can tell he always loved a pop of color. Got it from his parents.\"\n\nThat \"pop of color\" led to Domingo being asked by Anna Wintour to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala. \"She actually said, 'I'm not sure if you'd be interested in something like this or if you have time,'\" Domingo laughed. \"I said, 'I think I have time!'\"\n\n\"Sing Sing,\" released by A24, is available on VOD.\n\nSee also:\n\nRalph Fiennes, \"Conclave\"\n\nIn the thriller \"Conclave,\" based on Robert Harris' novel, Ralph Fiennes plays a Vatican insider tasked with running the gathering of the College of Cardinals in Rome to select a new pope. As Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, Fiennes navigates the intrigue of papal politics, a reluctant player consumed with doubt.\n\nIn this scene, Lawrence gives a sermon about the power of uncertainty in faith.\n\n\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.\n\n\"I was brought up a Catholic and then rebelled when I was 13,\" Fiennes said. \"My mother was a committed Catholic. So, 'God questions' have been in my family since I was a child.\"\n\nAnd did he come away with any answers to his own questions? \"No, I came away with more questions,\" he said.\n\nFiennes was nominated for an Oscar twice before, for \"Schindler's List\" and \"The English Patient.\" His performance in \"Conclave\" also earned him Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA nominations.\n\n\"Conclave\" is playing in theaters and is available via VOD.\n\nSebastian Stan, \"The Apprentice\"\n\nIn \"The Apprentice,\" set in 1970s and '80s New York City, a young Donald Trump, trying to take charge of his father's real estate business, comes under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, a notorious attorney-fixer, who instructs Trump on how to promote himself in the media. Cohn's dictum: Attack, attack, attack. Deny, deny, deny. Never admit defeat \u2026 lessons that Trump would carry through in his business career, social media projections and, later, political branding.\n\nIn this scene, Trump (best actor nominee Sebastian Stan) tries to sell himself to a newspaper reporter, using the motivation of Cohn (best supporting actor nominee Jeremy Strong) to not-quite-successful effect. It's clear he has a ways to go\u2026\n\nThe film, written by journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Ali Abbasi, premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival. While it received critical praise, potential film distributors shied away after the Trump campaign threatened to sue. The movie was ultimately picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment and released shortly before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn an appearance last October on \"CBS Mornings,\" Stan (whose credits include \"Gossip Girl,\" \"I, Tonya,\" \"Pam & Tommy,\" and playing Bucky Barnes in Marvel's Captain America franchise), admitted that he'd been warned by some to stay away from the project, specifically because it could be seen as a political third rail.\n\n\"Yeah, it's usually when I hear 'Don't do it,' I end up doing it!\" he laughed. \"But generally speaking, I think fear should motivate us to go into the storm, not run away from it.\n\n\"People are going to come into the film with a lot of baggage, a lot of projections [about Trump],\" he said. \"But I think trying to strip away all the noise and getting down to the basics \u2014 what is the emotional need? What is the drive? What was the potential of the man, and where did it end up? How did it all get to this today? And I think there's still value in understanding that.\n\n\"I think the film's about trust,\" said Stan. \"I think we have an opportunity to look at these people and genuinely ask ourselves, do we trust them? Can we use our human instinct rather than what we're being told to think, feel, and understand? Can we use our instinct to trust these people as we're going forward into the future?\"\n\nThis is Stan's first Academy Award nomination. He received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his \"Apprentice\" performance as well. This year he also received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in \"A Different Man.\"\n\n\"The Apprentice,\" nominated for two Oscars, is available via VOD.\n\nSee also:\n\nMore on the 2025 Oscars:"

            "full_content": "The following content is sponsored by PragerU.\n\nAndrew Breitbart famously said, \u201cPolitics is downstream from culture.\u201d This simple yet profound statement reveals the key to saving America. The left has long understood this principle, which is why they spent decades infiltrating media, entertainment, and education. They know that shaping culture is the surest way to shape society\u2014and they have been relentless in their mission.\n\nThe consequences are everywhere: an entire generation is bombarded with anti-American, leftist propaganda from celebrities, social media influencers, and corporate media. The loudest voices in our culture push socialism and open borders. They demand \u201ctrans visibility,\u201d bash President Trump, and rage against Elon Musk and DOGE for exposing government corruption.\n\nBut there is hope. Common sense is finally fighting back. Young people are questioning the radical ideas they\u2019ve been force-fed, and for the first time in decades, conservatism is gaining ground among the youth and in the age of social media, there has never been a better time to cultivate the next generation of young thought leaders than now.\n\nThis is where PragerU steps in.\n\nFor over a decade, PragerU has been at the forefront of changing the national conversation by reaching young people where they are\u2014online. In 2024 alone, PragerU videos were viewed nearly two billion times, with over 60 percent of its YouTube audience under the age of 35. More importantly, these videos change minds. A recent survey found that 70 percent of viewers reported changing their stance on an important issue after watching PragerU content.\n\nEven left-wing media outlets have been forced to acknowledge PragerU\u2019s influence. MSN recently admitted:\n\n\u201cAlthough PragerU traditionally sticks to multi-minute videos, they\u2019ve also gotten good at delivering short-form video clips with hard-hitting sound bytes, mastering a niche where conservatives often neglect to tread. This makes them highly influential among younger voters, an important voting bloc that turned out en force for the 2024 election cycle.\u201d\n\nPragerU doesn\u2019t just reach young conservatives\u2014it reaches young people across the aisle. In fact, 25 percent of PragerU viewers are not conservative. This means we are persuading the very people the left relies on to maintain their cultural dominance.\n\nBut they\u2019re just getting started.\n\nPragerU Is Looking for the Next Rising Conservative Star\n\nYoung people today are still lost. They\u2019re being misled by celebrities, influencers, and activists who tell them that America is the problem, that success is oppression, and that victimhood is a virtue. But we know their minds can be changed\u2014PragerU has a proven track record of doing just that.\n\nThat\u2019s why PragerU is launching a nationwide casting call to find the next generation of conservative influencers\u2014young, dynamic personalities who love truth, freedom, and America. If that sounds like you\u2014or someone you know\u2014this could be the opportunity to make a real impact.\n\nIn addition to working with some of the movement\u2019s most influential voices like Michael Knowles, Allie Beth Stuckey, and Charlie Kirk, PragerU has a history of cultivating the next generation of conservative leaders. Here are just a few of the talents PragerU has helped launch:\n\nWill Witt became a favorite among young conservatives with his Man on the Street interviews, short documentaries, and viral videos on PragerU, bringing millions of new viewers to the movement.\n\nAmala Ekpunobi was once a leftist activist\u2014until PragerU helped her become one of the most powerful free-thinking young voices in the country.\n\nAldo Buttazzoni joined PragerU after gaining national attention for exposing \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d drag shows in Dallas. His PragerU short documentary on masculinity, as well as his interviews with everyday Americans, conservative commentators, and young entrepreneurs, have garnered millions of views.\n\nCJ Pearson, the current Co-Chair of the GOP Youth Advisory Council, joined PragerU to help reach millions of young Americans through 5-Minute Videos, PragerU\u2019s Left vs. Right series, and recapping the biggest news of the week in PragerU\u2019s The Wrap Up.\n\nAlexis Wilkins, a country singer and unapologetic supporter of America\u2019s armed service members and veterans, blends entertainment, politics, and conservative values as a young cultural commentator.\n\nXaviaer DuRousseau was a BLM activist who transformed into one of Gen Z\u2019s strongest conservative voices. The former woke social justice warrior now hosts PragerU\u2019s new show Respectfully, Xaviaer, tackling pop culture and politics with a \u201cZillennial\u201d point of view.\n\nFranklin Camargo, a political refugee from Venezuela, uses his platform and PragerU Espa\u00f1ol to warn against the dangers of socialism and advocate for capitalism and free speech.\n\nPragerU has a proven track record of finding talent and amplifying their voices to reach millions with a pro-America message. If you want to join the movement as PragerU\u2019s next personality, apply today!\n\nHollywood and the corporate media have spent billions promoting young leftist influencers to spread their radical agenda. It\u2019s time for us to build up our rising stars\u2014the voices that will inspire young Americans to love their country, embrace freedom, and reject the left\u2019s destructive ideology.\n\nThis is the new front in the fight for America\u2019s future. If politics is downstream from culture, then culture is where we must win.\n\nAre you ready to be part of the movement?\n\nPragerU is looking for the next conservative influencer. Could it be you?\n\nTo learn more about how to apply, visit PragerU\u2019s official casting call page here."

            "full_content": "A flight officer scans the water in the southern Indian Ocean during a search for MH370 on March 22, 2014. Photo: Rob Griffith/AP Photo\n\nThe third search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has begun, 11 years after the plane practically vanished. On Sunday, a ship belonging to the American maritime-survey company Ocean Infinity arrived at a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean where the plane is believed to have crashed. It then deployed a trio of advanced robot subs three miles under the waves to scan the seabed using sonar waves. If successful, the effort will locate the wreckage of the aircraft together with the black boxes that will allow investigators to solve the mystery. If not, it will effectively disprove the analysis underlying the seabed search and suggest that officials bungled some fundamental assumptions.\n\nThe first underwater search for the missing plane was launched more than a decade ago, months after MH370 disappeared from air-traffic controllers\u2019 screens on March 8, 2014, during a routine red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China. Scientists at the satellite-communications company Inmarsat later found that the plane had sent seven automatic radio signals before vanishing for good. In analyzing the data, scientists were able to extract a route from Malaysia into the southern Indian Ocean and concluded that the plane\u2019s wreckage must lie near the end point of this path. Australia, which was responsible for finding the plane due to the search-and-rescue zone, hired a Dutch marine-survey company, Fugro, which dispatched a trio of ships to drag underwater sensors over the seabed. At first, officials were highly confident that they would locate the plane in short order, with one boasting that they had a 97 percent chance of success. But the plane was not in the search area measuring 46,000 square miles. Fugro increased the size of the search zone, then increased it again, without success. In 2017, the search was abandoned.\n\nHopes for finding the plane on the seabed would have ended there had not Ocean Infinity stepped forward the following year and offered to restart the search on its own dime, with payment only forthcoming if it was successful in finding MH370. Ocean Infinity used newer technology: autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that could prowl the depths in packs. Deployed from a single ship, the AUVs scanned an area nearly as big as the first search in a fraction of the time. But this effort, too, was in vain, and Ocean Infinity\u2019s second search was called off in May 2018.\n\nIn the years since its first search, Ocean Infinity has earned a name for itself as a highly capable underwater-survey company, not least by locating the wreck of a missing Argentine submarine in 2018. Since 2022, Ocean Infinity has launched a fleet of eight state-of-the-art, 250-foot-long ships that are capable of operating autonomously. It is one of these, Armada 78 06, that is currently on station in the search area, tending a flotilla of AUVs.\n\nAfter the second search, there was no reason to continue looking. Any reasonable scenario involving the plane\u2019s direction, speed, or changes in heading would have resulted in an end point in the ocean that had already been scanned. Malaysia, which retained overall responsibility for the investigation, announced that it would not authorize any further searches unless \u201cnew and credible information\u201d emerged indicating where exactly the plane had ended up.\n\nNo such information was forthcoming, but over the years various independent researchers continued to study the mystery, with some speculating that various lines of evidence all indicated a final resting place close to 35 degrees south latitude. The area had already been searched twice, but the ocean floor is rugged enough that the wreckage just might have been missed by earlier searches because it had fallen behind an outcropping or into a ravine. (Alternatively, if someone had hijacked the plane, they might have put it into an extended glide that took it beyond the area scanned so far.) It\u2019s this area that Ocean Infinity has now begun to search, less than a tenth of the size of previous searches. If the wreckage is there, the AUVs will likely find it quickly.\n\nGiven the scope of the search, it\u2019s entirely possible that the seabed scan will be finished before the 11th anniversary of MH370\u2019s disappearance in two weeks. If the wreckage is found, Armada 78 06 will likely deploy a different kind of robot sub called an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) to retrieve the black boxes, including a flight-data recorder that will show exactly how the plane flew into the southern ocean and a cockpit voice recorder that may contain clues about what happened to the pilots.\n\nIf the wreckage is not found, the picture will be altogether different. The plane\u2019s absence will strongly suggest that the authorities must have made a fundamental error when they analyzed the Inmarsat data. It will no longer be possible to say that they were just unlucky, that they happened to draw a line around a part of the probability distribution that didn\u2019t include the plane. By this point, every point in the ocean where the plane could plausibly have gone will have been searched. One or more of their assumptions must have been wrong.\n\nThere could be a positive outcome to the failure of the third and final seabed search: a long-overdue realization that investigators have been sleepwalking down a dead-end path. This, hopefully, will spur those responsible for finding the plane to acknowledge the failure of the past approach and bring in fresh blood. The case is too important to let go with a shrug and a wave of the hand. Eleven years ago, 239 people disappeared into the night. Until we make every effort to figure out what happened \u2014 including taking the painful step of admitting that all our past efforts were misguided \u2014 then we\u2019ll never solve the case, and there will be no way to say for sure that the same won\u2019t happen again.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Quite frankly, this makes no sense. Photo: Aaron M. Sprecher/Getty Images\n\nMy favorite genre of Donald Trump sound bites are the ones in which he obviously has no idea what he\u2019s talking about but keeps plowing forward regardless \u2014 the verbal equivalent of posting through it. A classic of the form came when he went on-camera in the wake of Hurricane Florence and said that it was \u201cone of the wettest we\u2019ve ever seen, from the standpoint of water.\u201d Trump\u2019s trademark public-speaking strength \u2014 one that, it must be said, has been waning considerably in the past couple of years \u2014 has been to feel entirely comfortable going in front of a camera and, rather than doing even the slightest bit of research to have the faintest notion of what might actually be going on, just winging it. Of all the Trump personality quirks that have lowered our national floor over the last decade, this is one of the most pervasive. We used to mock people for going on television despite being clueless on whatever they\u2019re supposed to be talking about. Now we\u2019re too busy looking at a second screen to notice. We\u2019re like the kids in Charlie Brown cartoons listening to teachers; we just hear the sounds.\n\nBut it\u2019s not like Trump is the only famous person who has made authoritative-sounding ignorance a trademark over the years. As a sports fan, Trump\u2019s soliloquies have always reminded me of a man who mastered the practice a long time ago. I suppose, then, I should not be surprised that people are encouraging him to run for president.\n\nThere are many quintessential Stephen A. Smith clips; he has, after all, built his career on the two-minute segment. But this one from 2018 is my favorite:\n\nStephen A Smith's scouting report for #TNF has Hunter Henry and Derrick Johnson as a key matchup...\n\n\n\nNeither has played a snap for the Chargers or Chiefs all year \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/1NyqfJY52G \u2014 NFL Retweet (@NFLRT) December 13, 2018\n\nTo recap: Smith, while discussing a game he was paid to analyze, mentioned two players who were not in fact on either team playing in the game, emphasized the importance of another who was not currently in the league, and got the name of one of the teams wrong. If he did not have someone else on the panel with him to correct him, he would have just plowed right through. Smith isn\u2019t a sports analyst. He has just mastered the art of sounding like one \u2014 he has, essentially, weaponized sports shouting.\n\nSmith isn\u2019t doing any more research now than he used to, but he and his network have learned that there\u2019s no reason to put him in a position where he\u2019s supposed to spout actual facts. The mistake of the 2018 segment wasn\u2019t that Smith didn\u2019t know anything about the teams he was discussing; it was that ESPN acted as if he was supposed to. Smith\u2019s segments now are constructed to be vague and basically content free \u2014 their main purpose is to generate a takeaway quote (on the 76ers from the other day: \u201cThis season is a joke!\u201d ). Then it\u2019s on to the next segment and the next quote. For all the talk of Smith \u201cdebating\u201d other commentators, that\u2019s not what he does anymore; that would require research or even talking points. It\u2019s much easier and safer to simply roll him out there, let him bark for a while, \u201crespond\u201d to someone else on the panel by cartoonishly furrowing his eyebrows, and cut back so he can bark some more.\n\nSmith has said his favorite debate \u201cpartner\u201d was Skip Bayless because \u201cI didn\u2019t have to show up to a morning meeting with [him].\u201d He used to be famous for writing his newspaper columns (back when he deigned to write anything at all) on his BlackBerry while commuting. He views knowledge as just something that might slow him down, get him bogged down in the annoying minutiae of facts and reality. His primary rhetorical trick is to loudly proclaim something so obvious that only a moron would think otherwise, so that when his opponent attempts to explain why an issue might actually be complicated and involve some nuance, it makes them sound like a sputtering simp. My old friend and Deadspin successor Tommy Craggs once said that Stephen A\u2019s sole skill was being \u201cemphatic on command.\u201d This skill is now the only skill anyone needs.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a skill that transfers easily into our degraded political discourse. After Democrats\u2019 crushing loss in November, the party has been agonizing over ways to appeal to disaffected voters \u2014 especially young men \u2014 who have drifted right over the years, often wooed by straight-talking, ostensibly nonpolitical figures like Joe Rogan. Though Smith has shown plenty of interest in politics, he doesn\u2019t come off as especially partisan (he\u2019s an independent), and, unlike much of the Democratic Party, he\u2019s undeniably entertaining. So why not him? Suddenly, the idea has gained currency. There he is, telling CNBC\u2019s Alex Sherman that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind being in office.\u201d There he is, explaining why Democrats find themselves in such a hole to Pod Save America\u2019s Tommy Vietor.\n\nIn an interview with The New Yorker\u2019s Jay Caspian Kang \u2014 a fine writer who has hopefully not become so much of an online creature that he honestly is taking any of this seriously, though with a headline like \u201cStephen A. Smith for President,\u201d there\u2019s definitely reason to worry \u2014 Smith says, \u201cWoke culture and cancel culture ravaged the country, the Democrats were way more focussed on that than the economy, immigration, and crime.\u201d This is, not to put too fine a point on it, surface-level drivel; it sounds like so much of Smith\u2019s output \u2014 like something your relative would pound onto their Facebook feed, or what a crank radio talk-show listener would call in to blare about while stuck in traffic. It\u2019s basically the political equivalent of \u201cJosh Allen can\u2019t win the big one!\u201d Surely Kang has heard this argument, such as it is, a billion times, and I can\u2019t imagine he takes it seriously at any sort of face value. Were any other person speaking, he\u2019d roll his eyes. But Stephen A. says it so emphatically that it almost takes the shape of an actual thought.\n\nThese two paragraphs in Kang\u2019s piece are telling. I have put the words that Smith actually says in bold.\n\n\u201cThey need to cleanse the Democratic Party as we know it,\u201d Smith told me in a phone call on Wednesday. Career politicians and consultants should still have some say in how future campaigns should be run, but he believed the Party, as a whole, had adhered to a litany of failed ideas and practices. \u201cThe Republicans said, \u2018We want Donald Trump,\u2019 \u201d Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been that way for ten years now. The Democrats say, \u2018It\u2019s Hillary\u2019s turn, now it\u2019s Biden\u2019s turn, now it\u2019s Kamala Harris\u2019s turn.\u2019 \u201d This succession of entitled candidates not only ignored voters who were indicating they wanted change; the Party swapped out kitchen-table issues for a series of alluring, and ultimately destructive, ideas about justice. \u201cWoke culture and cancel culture ravaged the country,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe Democrats were way more focussed on that than the economy, immigration, and crime.\u201d\n\nSmith also believes that the Party cannot overly engage in \u201cdemagoguery\u201d against Trump because the American people have grown tired of that message and are looking, instead, for someone who will take a more analytical approach. \u201cIf he\u2019s doing something good, let\u2019s say so,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf he\u2019s doing something harmful, let\u2019s say so.\u201d He has his reservations about Musk, but he does not object, in theory, to someone performing an audit of the federal government and trying to find pockets of waste and inefficiency. \u201cWhy are we reacting like this when we haven\u2019t even discovered everything he\u2019s found?\u201d Smith asked.\n\nI am not sure exactly what sort of political savior could save us from this moment, or whether one could actually exist, but, come on: \u201cWhy are we reacting like this?\u201d Uh, that definitely ain\u2019t it. (What a slogan! Get your picket signs and get out in the streets! Vive la r\u00e9sistance!) Why are we reacting like this? Seriously, what is this shit?\n\nThere are some completed thoughts in the above paragraphs, but they\u2019re Kang\u2019s, not Stephen A\u2019s. Smith\u2019s political \u201canalysis\u201d is a knee-jerk mishmash of RFK Jr. -style \u201cjust asking questions\u201d and the worst version of both-sides journalism, combined with a near-total lack of interest in what Trump or Musk may actually be doing. Most of his comments sound like a guy trying to pretend he prepared for his next camera segment. Who, exactly, was saying it was Biden\u2019s \u201cturn?\u201d When did Kamala Harris focus on \u201cwoke culture?\u201d (Probably not when she was talking about \u201clethal fighting forces\u201d in her nomination acceptance speech.) I\u2019m reminded of John Mulaney\u2019s great joke that the New York Post reads like \u201csomeone read a better newspaper and now they\u2019re trying to text you everything they can remember. Doesn\u2019t have to be right, just has to be short.\u201d Smith talks about politics like he scrolled through Post headlines and, to use Mulaney\u2019s term, \u201cgot the gist.\u201d Which is not all that different from how he talks about sports.\n\nLook, I\u2019ve got a long and complicated history with Smith myself, but I\u2019ll confess to have softened on him a bit in recent years. He has a shtick, and I do think this shtick has been corrosive to any sort of intelligent sports discourse, but I do not believe Smith is malevolent and, in the end, I do suspect his heart is generally in the right place, if it hasn\u2019t been entirely consumed by his persona at this point. In an age of Barstool and Pat McAfee, Smith is hardly the worst guy on the lot. He does seem to have an occasional sense of humor about himself \u2014 you can sense an earnest, even kinda likably dopey guy in there somewhere, as evidenced by his ever-amusing appearances on General Hospital. And anybody who does this to Jason Whitlock by definition cannot be all bad.\n\nBut in a world where expertise, rationality, and complexity are under constant assault by cartoonishly vile people foundationally motivated by willful and aggressive ignorance, the Stephen A. Smith political boomlet represents a deeply flawed kind of counterattack. The reasoning here is nothing more than \u201cHey, they have a bunch of people who don\u2019t know anything, maybe we should get our own person who doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d Stephen A. Smith for president \u2014 my God, I do not think I have ever written a more ridiculous phrase \u2014 is the result of giving up, of ceding everything that actually matters. If he is any sort of answer, then quite frankly we are not serious people."

            "full_content": "Britain\u2019s top LGBTQ+ charity is reportedly considering cutting half of its staff as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump freezing foreign aid payments.\n\nFar-left LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall has become so reliant on money from American taxpayers that up to half of its 114-person staff may be let go after foreign aid from the United States was cut off as a part of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda.\n\nAccording to a report from The Times of London, Stonewall staff were told last week that there would be a restructuring to \u201csecure the future of Stonewall for the long term as a significant LGBTQ+ organisation able to deliver impactful campaigns and legislative change across the UK and further afield\u201d.\n\nThe British paper of record said that insiders within the charity warned that such a restructuring could result in up to half of its staff being laid off.\n\nThe leftist charity received over half a million pounds sterling in the past three years from the American taxpayer through a State Department cutout known as the Global Equality Fund (GEF), which focussed on \u201cadvancing LGBTI rights around the world\u201d.\n\nAccording to the most recent accounting, the U.S. government foreign aid fund gave Stonewall \u00a3137,254 in 2021-22, \u00a3204,442 in 2022-23 and \u00a3233,583, making the American taxpayer the largest funder of the British LGBTQ+ charity during the time span.\n\nWhile Stonewall has claimed that its decision to \u2018restructure\u2019 its operation was motivated by several factors, chief executive Simon Blake previously acknowledged that the Trump administration\u2019s move to suspend foreign aid would impact \u201cprogrammes supporting LGBTQ+ communities around the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cStonewall\u2019s work in eastern Europe and the Caucasus is enabled by many funders, including the US government, and supports communities and law enforcement agencies to respond to anti-LGBTQ+ violence, often providing vital services to victims,\u201d he added.\n\nTherefore, Blake said that Stonewall would seek to \u201cmitigate the impact of the US government\u2019s decision\u201d.\n\nIn addition to the United States government, the leftist charity has also previously taken in millions from the British government, including under so-called Conservative party rule.\n\nOne of Stonewall\u2019s key influence operations has been to provide or sponsor woke training seminars to government officials, media companies, and educators in which they would lecture on the ever-evolving politically correct terminology, such as telling schools to stop using the words \u201cboys and girls\u201d and to use phrases like \u201clearners\u201d. On the backend, this was essentially enforced with diversity scores handed out by the charity to various organisations.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a backlash as the charity became increasingly radical on gender politics, particularly for downplaying biological sex and promoting the concept of \u201cgender identity\u201d, which have sparked accusations that the charity was promoting transgender issues at the expense of women. The charity also came under fire for its vociferous promotion of puberty-blocking drugs for children, the\n\nPublic backlash against the radical ideology promoted by Stonewall saw major institutions such as the BBC, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), and broadcasting regulator Ofcom, among others withdraw from its so-called \u201cDiversity Champion\u201d scheme and distance themselves from the organisation. Last month, The Times reported that every major government department had withdrawn from the diversity scheme."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe White House is suspending the active security clearances of lawyers from the large legal defense firm Covington & Burling who are working with former special counsel Jack Smith, who prosecuted Donald Trump unsuccessfully on behalf of the Justice Department under the Biden administration.\n\nAccording to a memo released Tuesday by the White House, all executive agencies are to suspend the clearances that may be used by Covington lawyers in private practice as the White House launches a \u201creview and determination of their roles and responsibilities, if any, in the weaponization of the judicial process.\u201d\n\nThe direction from Trump is clear pushback to the firm\u2019s work now, as it represents Smith as a private citizen facing investigations from Republicans. It also marks an escalation of the White House\u2019s retaliation against those who have supported the former special counsel\u2019s work.\n\nThe president, targeting Smith, said ahead of signing the memo in the Oval Office on Tuesday, \u201cWe\u2019re going to call it the deranged Jack Smith signing or bill.\u201d\n\nCovington lawyers are not the first attorneys to represent people perceived as political enemies of Trump who have lost their security clearances. Those clearances can allow them flexibility in practicing law when it relates to national security issues and classified aspects of cases.\n\nThe suspension of security clearances for private practice lawyers at Covington who previously held significant DOJ roles is a startling political approach that has rattled lawyers across Washington. It\u2019s long been a protected right for defendants and others facing investigations to be able to use lawyers of their choosing.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing less than a petty and vindictive attack on the legal profession, and particularly the ability of a select group of cleared lawyers to defend the interests of officials across the intelligence community,\u201d said Washington national security attorney Bradley Moss in response to the White House\u2019s move. Moss is a law partner of Mark Zaid, who also has had his security clearance revoked. \u201cThe bigger question is, how far is he going to take this war against the legal profession, and against anyone who stands for the rule of law?\u201d\n\nWhite House aide Will Scharf said ahead of the signing, \u201cOne law firm that provided pro bono legal services to the special counsel\u2019s office under Jack Smith\u2019s leadership was Covington & Burling. As a result of those actions, we\u2019re now going to be suspending and putting under review the security clearances for the attorneys and employees at that firm who worked with Jack Smith\u2019s team.\u201d\n\nIn response to the White House\u2019s move, a Covington spokesman said on Tuesday: \u201cWe recently agreed to represent Jack Smith when it became apparent that he would become a subject of a government investigation. Covington serves as defense counsel to Jack Smith in his personal, individual capacity.\u201d\n\nThe firm declined to provide any more information about a possible investigation into Smith, though Trump, appointees in his Justice Department, and Republicans in Congress have made clear they intend to revisit Smith\u2019s office\u2019s work. Covington also didn\u2019t say if or how many of its lawyers had active security clearances.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to defending Mr. Smith\u2019s interests and appreciate the trust he has placed in us to do so,\u201d the statement also said.\n\nSmith disclosed in a federal ethics form recently that Covington & Burling provided $140,000 worth of legal services to him as a gift.\n\nThe two lawyers at Covington representing Smith are Lanny Breuer, the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, and Peter Koski, formerly a public integrity prosecutor."

            "full_content": "In one of the most mud-slinging, wide-open Oscar races in years, picking winners is like walking a tightrope over a pit of snapping scandals.\n\nNo sooner did \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" -- a Spanish-language musical crime drama from a French director -- receive the most nominations (13) of any movie this year than its chances were dinged by resurfaced tweets from the film's star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly trans actress to score an acting nomination.\n\nThough Gasc\u00f3n has since apologized for her comments, many have wondered if the damage is insurmountable.\n\nThen there's the controversy around \"The Brutalist\" -- with 10 nominations, including best picture -- for using artificial intelligence to help acting nominees Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones in the very few scenes where they had to speak Hungarian.\n\nAnd what's with \"Anora\" -- boasting six nominations, including best picture -- filming all those sex scenes without an intimacy coordinator, as revealed by star and acting nominee Mikey Madison in a Variety chat?\n\nAnd does the blockbuster musical \"Wicked\" really deserve the top prize if it's only Part 1 of a film that won't be complete until Part 2 is released in November?\n\nClearly these issues have absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the nominees themselves. The film academy is always concerned with how it looks to the outside world. Still, the heated battle between image and merit only adds to the fun, especially in a super competitive year like this one when trying to figure out how nearly 10,000 Oscar voters are going to come to a consensus is more of a head-scratcher than ever.\n\nThe 2025 Oscars will take place Sunday, March 2, airing live on ABC and streaming live on Hulu beginning at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nLet the games begin with my predictions about who should win -- and who will win -- in the major categories.\n\nAdrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nColman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\")\n\nRalph Fiennes (\"Conclave\")\n\nSebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\")\n\nSHOULD WIN (if the public voted): Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nChalamet's performance as the young Bob Dylan is acting, singing, guitar-strumming, harmonica-blowing perfection.\n\nAnd just a week ago, after watching Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\") take most of the critics prizes, he finally caught a big break with a significant win from his peers at the Screen Actors Guild for transcending impersonation in a warts-and-all portrait that also captures the petulant arrogance of the future Nobel Prize winner whose music, lyrics and raw vocal rasp helped define a generation. Chalamet's transporting performance catches Dylan in the exhilarating act of inventing himself as multitudes, a fugitive troubadour and poet who's always creating and always in the wind.\n\nShould Chalamet, nominated before in the same category for 2017's \"Call Me By Your Name,\" win the Oscar on Sunday night, he will become, at 29, the youngest nominee ever to win the best actor prize, besting previous record holder Brody by nine months and change.\n\nTimothee Chalamet stars as Bob Dylan in the movie, \"A Complete Unknown.\" Macall Polay/Searchlight Pictures\n\nWILL WIN: Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nSorry Timmy, but the one to beat is still Brody -- the current holder of the title of the youngest best actor winner (he was one month shy of his 30th birthday when he won the Oscar for 2002's \"The Pianist\" as musician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi invasion of Warsaw.\n\nBrody tops even that career triumph with his \"Brutalist\" portrayal of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor who arrives in America after the war in a burst of anticipation and dread. Acting doesn't get better or go deeper than the emotional tour de force given by Brody, who brings every fiber of his being to the role of his career.\n\nA second Oscar seems inevitable.\n\nAdrien Brody is seen in a still from the film \"The Brutalist.\" Lol Crawley/A24\n\nCynthia Erivo (\"Wicked\")\n\nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n (\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\")\n\nMikey Madison (\"Anora\")\n\nDemi Moore (\"The Substance\")\n\nFernanda Torres (\"I'm Still Here\")\n\nSHOULD WIN: Mikey Madison (\"Anora\")\n\nThe odds favor Madison. Let me explain.\n\nWhile Oscar traditionally makes guys wait until they have some age on them, the gold statue practically climbs into the hands of a young beauty in a breakthrough part. I'm talking Audrey Hepburn (\"Roman Holiday\") to Gwyneth Paltrow (\"Shakespeare in Love\") and Jennifer Lawrence (\"Silver Linings Playbook\"). So why not bestow the crown on Madison, 25, acing the title role in \"Anora\" as the stripper/sex worker who falls for her own fantasy of marrying a handsome prince -- in this case the son of a Russian oligarch -- and living happily ever after.\n\nThe comic and dramatic chops Madison brings to the role really are award worthy.\n\nA scene from the movie \"Anora.\" Universal Pictures\n\nWILL WIN: Demi Moore (\"The Substance\")\n\nThe only thing Oscar loves more than a discovery is a comeback, and Moore practically defined the term by scoring her first nomination at 62 for \"The Substance,\" Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp horror-satire about Hollywood's greatest fear: aging.\n\nDuring her victory speech at the Golden Globes, Moore talked about being dismissed as a \"popcorn actress\" who should stay in her lane. No way. For pushing past vanity to find the bruised heart of a character who literally splits herself in half to preserve the illusion of timeless allure, Moore spoke to everyone who felt banished to oblivion at the first sign of a wrinkle. She also found her finest two hours on screen.\n\nHow does Oscar resist that? Two words: it doesn't.\n\nDemi Moore in \"The Substance,\" 2024. Metropolitan Films\n\nBest actor in a supporting role\n\nYura Borisov (\"Anora\")\n\nKieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\")\n\nEdward Norton (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nGuy Pearce (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nJeremy Strong (\"The Apprentice\")\n\nSHOULD WIN: Jeremy Strong (\"The Apprentice\")\n\nThe \"Succession\" Emmy winner is evil incarnate as Roy Cohn, the dark prince of a lawyer who served as the architect of Donald Trump's rise to power before he even seriously considered politics. Cohn's three commandments for success certainly stuck with his apprentice, played by best actor nominee Sebastian Stan: \"Attack, attack, attack; admit nothing, deny everything; and always claim victory -- never acknowledge defeat.\" Strong plays Cohn with a demonic humor that makes every laugh sting, even those that sow the seeds of his own discussion.\n\nStrong finds a path into Cohn's battered soul in a film that didn't deserve its box-office neglect. He'd be tough to beat, except for...\n\nJeremy Strong is seen in a still from \"The Apprenctice.\" Briarcliff Entertainment/YouTube\n\nWILL WIN: Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\")\n\nThe \"Succession\" Emmy winner -- he and Strong played feuding brothers on the landmark series -- is in the wrong category since his is a lead performance in every sense of the word as a misfit named Benji on a Holocaust tour of Poland, where his late grandmother escaped the death camps. Director Jesse Eisenberg, who wrote the Oscar-worthy script for this funny, touching and vital dramedy, plays the cousin who accompanies Benji on the trip. There's not a manipulative, sanctimonious, false note in Culkin's off-the-charts great performance.\n\nForget the category fraud, if there is a sure-thing among this year's Oscar nominees, Culkin is it.\n\nKieran Culkin and Jesse Eisenberg in \"A Real Pain,\" 2024. Searchlight Pictures\n\nBest actress in a supporting role\n\nMonica Barbaro (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nAriana Grande (\"Wicked\")\n\nFelicity Jones (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nIsabella Rossellini (\"Conclave\")\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a (\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\")\n\nSHOULD WIN: Isabella Rossellini (\"Conclave\")\n\nIf you want to know what a true supporting performance is, check out the magnificent Rossellini as Sister Agnes, the only female in this all-male conclave of cardinals in the timely business of electing a new Pope. Critics say that Rossellini has only one big dialogue scene, not enough to cinch the win. Nonsense. She creates a woman in full in the space between words.\n\nThis is a first nomination for the gifted daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto Rossellini, and she emerges as the film's moral conscience and its grieving heart.\n\nThis image released by Focus Features shows Isabella Rossellini in a scene from \"Conclave.\" Focus Features via AP\n\nWILL WIN: Zoe Salda\u00f1a (\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\")\n\nDon't expect the controversies swirling around her film and her co-star Gasc\u00f3n to hurt the chances Salda\u00f1a has at taking home her first Oscar.\n\nAs the lawyer at the center of the story -- hardly a supporting role -- Salda\u00f1a proves she's more than the action dynamo of the \"Avatar\" franchise and Marvel Cinematic Universe, but an actress of grit and grace. She might even propel her sensational song-and-dance, \"El Mal,\" into a best song Oscar.\n\nWhere Rossellini goes small, Salda\u00f1a goes big and, fair or not, the size of her portrayal should tilt the balance in her favor.\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a as Rita Moro Castro in \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Shanna Besson/Page 114/Why Not Productions/Path\u00e9 Films/France 2 Cin\u00e9ma\n\nBest picture\n\n\"Anora\"\n\n\"The Brutalist\"\n\n\"A Complete Unknown\"\n\n\"Conclave\"\n\n\"Dune: Part Two\"\n\n\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\"\n\n\"I'm Still Here\"\n\n\"Nickel Boys\"\n\n\"The Substance\"\n\n\"Wicked\"\n\nSHOULD WIN: \"The Brutalist\"\n\nBy any measurement of roaring talent and ambition, director Brady Corbet's intimate epic about the immigrant experience in America is the best picture of the year. \"Anora\" and \"Conclave\" are breathing down its neck, but the technical aspects from cinematography to score are top-notch and the direction of the category best Corbet and the acting of Brody, Jones and Guy Peace set a new gold standard. The crucial complaint is that \"The Brutalist\" is too long at three hours and 35 minutes. Length didn't hurt \"Oppenheimer\" and it shouldn't be a problem here -- except for the growing plague of short attention spans.\n\nSo unless Oscar voters come to their senses and do the right thing, I'm conceding defeat.\n\nAdrien Brody is seen in a still from the upcoming film \"The Brutalist.\" Lol Crawley/A24\n\nWILL WIN: \"Conclave\" ... in a squeaker victory over \"Anora\"\n\nI expect a dead heat on Oscar night, with the saints of \"Conclave\" just edging out the sinners of \"Anora.\" Either could prevail. \"Anora\" showed a recent surge by claiming victory at the influential producers and directors guilds -- Sean Baker's love letter to sex workers is definitely the cool kids' choice. But throwback voters, blanching at the sex, drugs and F-bombs in \"Anora,\" are more comfortable with Edward Berger's classical approach in \"Conclave,\" which won the day at the BAFTAs (the British Academy with an overlapping membership with the American version) and just a week ago grabbed the best ensemble cast trophy from the Screen Actors Guild, the largest voting group at the Oscars.\n\nIt's a coin toss, which should have us all holding our breath on the big night.\n\nWhat could be better?! Place your bets.\n\nRalph Fiennes stars as Cardinal Lawrence in \"Conclave,\" 2024. Focus Features\n\nThe 2025 Oscars will take place Sunday, March 2, airing live on ABC and streaming live on Hulu beginning at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nDisney is the parent company of Hulu, ABC and \"Good Morning America."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe White House is making clear it views President Donald Trump\u2019s Friday Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as an overwhelming win that underscores Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d leadership, dispatching top officials and allies to amplify Trump\u2019s handling of the situation even as European leaders are expressing unified support for Ukraine and its leader.\n\nTrump often took aim at US aid for Ukraine on the campaign trail, reflecting waning support among Americans for Ukraine and Zelensky over the past three years of the war. Trump views the conflict through an economic lens, seeking to rebuild a partnership with Russia and recoup some of the financial support the US has provided to Ukraine.\n\nThe president\u2019s top lieutenants, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2014 all of whom were in the Oval Office during the explosive meeting \u2014 appeared on news shows Sunday to offer praise to their boss and criticism of his Ukrainian counterpart as Trump is dramatically reshaping US alliances.\n\nThe efforts come as dozens of European leaders are gathering in London for what British Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as a \u201conce-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe,\u201d a major show of support for Zelensky.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, France's President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Zelensky, Romania's Interim President Ilie Bolojan, European Council President Antonio Costa and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a summit in central London on March 2, 2025. Justin Tallis/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes, everyone around this table,\u201d Starmer said in opening remarks at the Sunday summit.\n\nTrump\u2019s team, meanwhile, is doubling down, framing the contentious Friday meeting from a position of US strength, even as it has been met with glee by the Kremlin.\n\nDuring an appearance on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Waltz indicated US support for new leadership in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war,\u201d Waltz told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAnd if it becomes apparent that President Zelensky\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands,\u201d Waltz said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also suggested in an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Zelensky should potentially step aside after the tense meeting, saying, \u201cEither he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that.\u201d\n\nTrump himself suggested after the meeting that Zelensky does not want an end to the war. Waltz said Sunday that the Ukrainian leader needs to make it clear \u201cpublicly and privately\u201d that he is \u201cready to go to peace.\u201d\n\nWaltz, who compared Zelensky to an \u201cex-girlfriend that just wants to argue\u201d earlier in the weekend, continued to slam the Ukrainian leader\u2019s Friday actions and body language, castigating \u201cthe shaking of the head, the kind of \u2014 the arms crossed, we just \u2014 we found it incredibly disrespectful.\u201d\n\nRubio also went after Zelensky, who, he said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cfound every opportunity to try to \u2018Ukraine-splain\u2019 on every issue.\u201d\n\nAnd Lutnick cast Trump as \u201cthe peacemaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the peacemaker, and if Zelensky is not interested in peace, then he should go home and think about it,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nZelensky, Trump, and Vance at the White House on Friday, February 28, 2025. Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe White House press office has also sent multiple emails amplifying warm reviews and messages of support from key Republican allies on Capitol Hill, members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and other top White House officials.\n\n\u201cSupport continues to roll in for the unwavering commitment of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Vance to the American people and the Trump Administration\u2019s relentless pursuit of peace,\u201d an email sent to reporters Saturday said, highlighting remarks from Johnson praising Trump for \u201cputting America first\u201d; from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard thanking Trump for his \u201cunwavering leadership\u201d; and from Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri asserting that \u201cthe age of \u2018America last\u2019 foreign policy is over,\u201d among others.\n\nJohnson, who spearheaded an effort to pass more aid to Ukraine last spring despite threats to his speakership from some hardliners in his own party, told Bash he had done so to \u201callow Ukraine to sustain itself and position them for peace negotiations\u201d by extending support until Trump took office.\n\n\u201cThe plan worked, but now Zelensky has to follow through, and the fact that he acted as he did, I think, was a great disappointment,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said.\n\nHe said an assessment by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a frequent GOP critic of the president, that the Trump administration was \u201cwalking away from our allies and embracing Putin,\u201d was \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d arguing that Trump, who has hesitated to call Putin a \u201cdictator,\u201d has been \u201cvery clear\u201d that the Russian president is an aggressor in Ukraine.\n\nFormer House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner, historically an avid supporter of Ukraine and hardliner on Russia, called Zelensky\u2019s actions during the meeting with Trump \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got to hear President Trump. I mean \u2026 he engaged by saying, you know, people are dying,\u201d the Ohio Republican congressman said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop the dying. \u2026 Let\u2019s go forward with the peace negotiations, and then we\u2019ll determine what security arrangements need to be made around the peace negotiations.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nWhen he steps onto the dais in the House chamber on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will have another major platform to relay his second-term priorities. For Democrats, the moment will present a fresh test of whether they can effectively counter Trump\u2019s prime-time programming.\n\nDemocratic leadership chose a first-term senator elected in a battleground state Trump won in November to deliver the party\u2019s official response. A Democratic senator whose name is often talked about for 2028 is among those skipping the address, predicting it will be a \u201cMAGA pep rally.\u201d And a protest movement organizing online has identified March 4 \u2014 the day of Trump\u2019s speech \u2014 as its next day of action.\n\nThe varying tactics of Democrats in Washington and across the country will be on display as Trump delivers his address to a joint session of Congress six weeks into a second term during which he\u2019s swiftly moved to remake the federal government and implement his foreign policy vision, at times unnerving US allies.\n\nWhile Democrats have rallied against Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency cuts, lawmakers in Washington have struggled to stop the president\u2019s early actions or settle on a cohesive approach to push back on them. It comes amid a debate within the Democratic Party about the best way to handle Trump\u2019s second term and position Democrats for success in the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election \u2014 with some saying party leaders aren\u2019t doing enough.\n\nHeading into Tuesday\u2019s speech, Democratic leaders \u2014 from Capitol Hill to the Democratic National Committee \u2014 are hoping to present a united front. They want to zero in on how Trump\u2019s actions are negatively impacting people and falling short of promises he\u2019s made, including a pledge to lower costs. Democrats also are eager to warn that Republicans could put Medicaid at risk in the upcoming budget fight.\n\nDemocratic leadership is turning to Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan to deliver the official rebuttal, a sign of their desire to appeal to working-class voters after Democrats lost power in the White House and on Capitol Hill in 2024. After Michigan voters split their tickets, sending Trump to the White House and Slotkin to the Senate, the freshman Democrat has emphasized her party needs to focus on kitchen-table issues as it looks to rebuild.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin at a Senate hearing in Washington, DC, January 14, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Slotkin would use her rebuttal to \u201ccommunicate that Democrats are fighting to lower the cost of living and protect Social Security and Medicaid while Republicans cut taxes for their billionaire donors and Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, is set to deliver the official Spanish-language response.\n\nSenate and House leadership have encouraged lawmakers to invite individuals who have been affected by Trump\u2019s moves, including job cuts and funding freezes, as guests, Democratic aides said.\n\n\u201cWe ask that House Democrats attending the Joint Address bring a guest who has been harmed by the Trump administration\u2019s early actions or will be hurt by the House Republican budget,\u201d the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee told congressional offices in a memo obtained by CNN.\n\nThe DNC has also coordinated with the Democratic campaign committees and officials in states across the country to message against Trump and Republicans around the joint address, a party official said.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who was the only freshman Democratic senator besides Slotkin to win in a state Trump carried in 2024, said Democrats need to tune out distractions around Trump\u2019s speech and zero in on issues confronting Americans on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cWhat they really care about is the fact that the price of eggs is so high. It\u2019s hard to get a house. All these things that are really dragging down the everyday Americans trying to just do a little better,\u201d said Gallego, who is planning to take a disabled veteran and federal worker who was recently fired due to Trump\u2019s cuts to the federal workforce as his guest.\n\nBut some Democrats may decide boycotting the speech is the best approach. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a leading voice in the pushback to Trump, is skipping the joint address and will participate in a counterprogramming event with progressive advocacy group MoveOn instead.\n\n\u201cI think every Democrat needs to make up their own mind. I think that State of the Union speech is going to be a farce. I think it\u2019s gonna be a MAGA pep rally,\u201d Murphy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWe have to fight every single day, every single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of Democrats think maybe you should fight every third day, you should reserve your power and jump out of the bushes at the right moment,\u201d he added. \u201cI just think we have to be on the offensive 24/7.\u201d\n\nAnother possible 2028 contender planning to play in the Trump pushback on Tuesday \u2014 former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who will appear on a live edition of \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d following Trump\u2019s speech. And several Democratic governors, including Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, delivered their own \u201cState of the State\u201d addresses back home in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nThe Working Families Party has said Democratic Rep. Lateefah Simon of California will deliver a response on its behalf.\n\nMuch of the Democratic messaging efforts will take place on television and social media, but Democratic lawmakers sitting in the House chamber will also have to decide how to handle Trump\u2019s words on the spot.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi tears her copy of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address after he delivered it to a joint session of Congress on February 4, 2020. Vice President Mike Pence is at left. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nWhile Republicans at times heckled former President Joe Biden during his State of the Union speeches, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who famously ripped up Trump\u2019s speech during his last State of the Union, urged Democrats to exercise caution with the current president.\n\n\u201cAny demonstration of disagreement, whether it\u2019s visual or whatever, just let him stew in his own juice. Don\u2019t be any grist for the mill to say this was inappropriate,\u201d the California Democrat said in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nOutside of Washington, one protest movement is hoping to provide voters with an outlet to channel their frustration. The 50501 movement, which describes itself as a nonpartisan effort, chose the date of Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress as its next rallying point.\n\nOnline organizers have encouraged demonstrators to participate in \u201cMarch 4th for Democracy,\u201d to \u201craise their voices on this significant occasion, amplifying concerns that impact everyday lives,\u201d a source working with the effort said.\n\nProtesters rally against the Department of Government Efficiency outside the US Department of Labor on February 5, 2025, in Washington, DC. Kena Betancur/VIEWpress/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nIt comes as visible signs of voter discontent with Trump, Musk and the GOP administration have started to bubble up in pockets of the country. Constituents engaged in fiery exchanges with some Republican lawmakers at town halls when the House was on recess last month, echoing scenes that played out in 2017 during Trump\u2019s first term in office.\n\n\u201cI think anything that gets more people actively doing something in the real world and draws more folks into an oppositional movement against Musk and Trump is healthy,\u201d said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive organization Indivisible. \u201cEvery day, there are new people who were on the sidelines, who have had enough and are now trying to figure out what they could do.\u201d\n\nRecent CNN polling found broad Democratic dissatisfaction with how congressional Democrats have handled their response to Trump so far. Nearly three quarters (73%) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents surveyed said the party\u2019s caucus in Congress is doing too little to oppose Trump. Twenty-two percent said they\u2019re doing the right amount, and 5% said they\u2019re overdoing it.\n\nPotential showdowns over a March 14 government shutdown deadline and the Republican push for a major budget bill to enact Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda could emerge for Democrats in the coming weeks.\n\nA leading Democratic super PAC is already planning to step up its attacks over the Trump administration\u2019s policy vision. The House Majority PAC, the leading Democratic super PAC, is rolling out new ads warning of Medicaid cuts and featuring images of tech billionaire Musk wielding a chain saw rolling out in more than 20 congressional districts next week.\n\nGallego is planning to hold town halls in rural parts of his state in the coming weeks to detail how Medicaid cuts would \u201cdisproportionately affect\u201d them. The Arizona senator said Democrats need to make \u201csure we\u2019re taking the fight not just to our normal Democratic areas, but our really Republican strongholds.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cEverything we need to be doing is make sure to remind people that whatever the president\u2019s doing right now, whatever Elon Musk\u2019s doing now, is not making your life any better.\u201d"

But also rare is his friendship with the late, trailblazing publisher of the Washington Post, Katharine Graham. \"If there's any story that should be told, it should be her story,\" he said. \"If I was a young girl, I'd want to hear that story. It would change my self-image.\n\n\"She was one of a kind, and she was terrified of the job,\" Buffett said. \"She knew she could do things, but she'd been told all her life that she wasn't [allowed], and that females didn't do things. I mean, her mother told her, 'Nobody's interested in listening to you.' And so, all of a sudden, here she is, and she had an all-male board that was waiting for her, and all they wanted was her to stay home and cash the dividend checks.\"\n\nAn undated photo of investor Warren Buffett and Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. CBS News\n\nGraham was thrust into the role, taking over the company, after her husband, Philip Graham, died by suicide. She was then the center of some of the century's biggest stories. She made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers that helped lead to the end of Vietnam War. It was Graham who supported the investigative journalism that led to President Nixon's resignation after Watergate.\n\nAll this in spite of the fact that, Buffett said, Graham had had drummed into her head the idea, \"Only men can succeed at business.\"\n\nGraham herself once said, \"The worst handicap women work under is the self-inflicted one \u2013 that is, if you've grown up thinking of yourself as a second-class citizen, that you tend always to put yourself down.\"\n\nGraham's journey from housewife to the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company is laid out in a new documentary, \"Becoming Katharine Graham,\" now streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\nAnd at the center of the story is an unlikely friendship that began on June 4, 1973, when Buffett sent Graham a letter after buying a significant amount of the Washington Post Company's stock. \"I said, 'I'll never buy another share unless you personally okay it,' and I signed a document. Then we became friends.\"\n\nIn the documentary, Graham recalled of Buffett: \"He used to come to board meetings with about 20 annual reports, and he would take me through these annual reports. I mean, it was like going to business school with Warren Buffet.\"\n\nAsked why he invested in the Post to begin with, Buffett replied, \"It was ridiculously cheap. It was a super bargain. It was worth at least $500 million and was selling for $100 million.\"\n\nKatharine Graham's son, Don Graham, a former publisher of the Post, said that Buffett was the greatest thing in business that ever happened to Katharine Graham.\n\nBuffett said, \"She needed somebody to reassure her.\"\n\nI asked, \"What were the things you would say to her to boost her confidence?\"\n\n\"The biggest thing I said is, when you look in the mirror, it's a funhouse mirror because you're seeing it for the eyes of what the males are telling you about it,\" Buffett replied. \"So, my job is to turn that funhouse mirror into a regular mirror. And she knew I was on her side, and I admired her enormously. And she was torturing herself. She couldn't help doing that.\"\n\nThe documentary, for the first time, shows the public the full extent of President Nixon's feud with Graham. A White House recording features one of the president's conversations with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover:\n\nHoover: \"I saw her on TV last night, Mrs. Graham. I would've thought she's about 85 years old. She's only about, I think, something like 57.\"\n\nNixon: \"Oh, no, I know that.\"\n\nHoover: \"She's aged terribly.\"\n\nNixon: \"She's a terrible old bag.\"\n\nHoover: \"Oh, she's an old bitch, in my estimation.\"\n\nNixon: \"That's right!\"\n\nBut according to Buffett, \"Nixon didn't scare her at all.\" What did scare her was the idea of losing the paper. Never did that feel more real to Graham than in 1975, when the Post's printers damaged the presses and went on a bitter strike for more than four months, limiting the paper's circulation.\n\n\"How challenging was that time?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, it tore her apart,\" said Buffett. \"She was suffering in that way at that time more than she ever suffered during Watergate, or during the Pentagon Papers, or anything. But she thought she might be blowing everything.\"\n\nBuffett told us Katharine Graham prevailed because she was brave \u2026 and it's because of her that the Washington Post Company stock price went up more than 3,000 percent while she was publisher.\n\nBut she didn't just make Buffett a lot of money; she said she introduced to him \"the possibility that a steady diet of fast food and Cherry Cokes might not be the best for him.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but she didn't convert me!\" laughed Buffett, who said his favorite foods were what he was eating when he was six years old: \"Hot dogs and hamburgers and Coke and ice cream sundaes, and root beer floats are my favorite. I frequently have a dinner with a root beer float.\"\n\nOnce, attending a dinner at Graham's, prepared by a French chef, Buffett was served a lobster: \"Well, I unfortunately attacked it from the wrong side,\" he said. \"Of course, she was very reluctant to criticize me. Finally at some point she said, 'You know, it might be helpful \u2026' What did I know about lobsters?\"\n\nGraham died in 2001, and Buffett served as an usher at her funeral.\n\nAs for the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" the legendary investor is now 94 years old, still chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and still making front page news. Every word he utters has the power to roil the financial markets.\n\nWhen asked about the state of the economy today, Buffett demurred: \"Well, I think that's the most interesting subject in the world, but I won't talk, I can't talk about it, though. I really can't.\"\n\nAsked about how tariffs will affect the economy, Buffett stated, \"Tariffs are actually, we've had a lot of experience with them. They're an act of war, to some degree.\"\n\nI asked, \"How do you think tariffs will impact inflation?\"\n\n\"Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay 'em!\" he laughed. \"And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'\"\n\nDespite deflecting questions about the current news from Washington, or of Trump adviser Elon Musk's efforts to cut the government, Buffett did admit that he is bullish on American companies. \"A majority of any money I manage will always be in the United States,\" he said.\n\nAnd why is that? \"It's the best place!\" he laughed. \"I was lucky to be born here.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nThe documentary \"Becoming Katharine Graham\" is streaming via Amazon Prime\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\n\n\n\nStory produced by Julie Morse.

            "full_content": "Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux for New York Magazine\n\nBy shouldering his way into the mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo is betting that what New York voters want at City Hall is deep government experience, competent execution, and a mayor ready and willing to do battle with the Trump White House. His entry tests the political axiom that elections are about the future rather than the past.\n\n\u201cI think it changes everything and nothing at the same time,\u201d Laura Tamman, a professor of political science at Pace University, told me. \u201cAll of the folks who are currently running have assumed he\u2019ll get in the race; some of them have taken him on directly already. But at the same time, I think he\u2019s going to bring a focus and an energy to the race that we haven\u2019t seen yet, because New Yorkers know who he is, and they\u2019re going to respond to his candidacy.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s nearly 12 years as governor \u2014 not to mention four years as HUD Secretary and four as state attorney general \u2014 allow him to accurately claim to have far more experience than any of his rivals. But that also saddles Cuomo with more than a decade\u2019s worth of budget choices and half-forgotten projects, policies, political fights, and personal behavior that his opponents are already attacking.\n\n\u201cHe spent years treating New York City like his personal punching bag,\u201d said candidate for mayor Scott Stringer, the ex-comptroller, on social media. \u201cSlashing MTA funding and wrecking the subway while funneling money to upstate ski resorts, and trying to cut billions in funding for public school kids and Medicaid for city residents.\u201d\n\nUpstate ski resorts? Outside of chambers of commerce in the Catskills and Lake George, only a handful of government insiders remember that five years ago, Cuomo championed tax breaks for upstate lodges that installed renewable energy-powered lifts, snowmaking equipment, and other machinery. But a far more serious chapter of Cuomo\u2019s history is the barrage of sexual-misconduct and hostile-workplace accusations that forced him from office in 2021, and were backed up by findings from State attorney General Letitia James and the Justice Department under President Biden.\n\nWithin hours of Cuomo\u2019s video announcing his candidacy, the Working Families Party released a video, \u201cWomen Deserve Better,\u201d that features well-known women activists reciting misconduct allegations and calling Cuomo \u201ca bully and an abuser.\u201d Those voices are not likely to go away. Ditto for those who criticize Cuomo\u2019s handling of policies and information regarding nursing home deaths at the height of COVID and the $5 million advance he got for a book about the crisis that may have violated ethical rules by including work done by public employees.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, Cuomo\u2019s sizable lead over his rivals in recent polls is based in part on a record of accomplishments, including those memorable daily briefings during the COVID crisis, the successful fight to legalize same-sex marriage in 2014, and the completion of long-stalled public works projects, including the Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station, the expansion of the Second Avenue Subway, the rebuilding of an expanded Kosciusko Bridge (the city\u2019s first new bridge in 55 years) and the creation of a new terminal at LaGuardia Airport.\n\nCuomo is betting that a critical mass of voters will remember and reward his good deeds. \u201cWhen I wear my wedding ring and put it on every morning, the thought goes through my head that I wouldn\u2019t be able to wear it were it not for Andrew Cuomo,\u201d political consultant Jon Reinish told me. \u201cNot just people in New York, but for millions of people across the country, that memory is going to come back, and it\u2019s a really big deal.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s candidacy puts a spotlight on the central question of every municipal election year in New York: what are the main problems in the city that most urgently need fixing? For the last half century, each new mayor has been hired to fix a specific crisis that was caused, ignored or bequeathed by his predecessor.\n\nHere\u2019s how the shorthand, admittedly oversimplified, version of history goes: Ed Koch beat a crowded field in 1977 by promising budget austerity in the wake of the city\u2019s near-bankruptcy; David Dinkins unseated Koch in 1989 by proposing a calm, less divisive approach to community relations in the wake of high-profile cases like the Central Park Five debacle; and Rudy Giuliani beat Dinkins in 1993 by vowing to crack down on crime after New York hit an all-time high of more than 2,000 homicides in a single year.\n\nMike Bloomberg, elected mayor less than 90 days after the 9/11 terrorist attack, won when the city needed a businesslike approach to reviving the local economy and rebuilding Lower Manhattan; left-leaning activist Bill de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign was based on the argument that Bloomberg had built a prosperous city but neglected the needs of working families. And ex-cop Eric Adams was elected when the city\u2019s emergence from COVID was accompanied by a spike in violent crime that he vowed to reverse.\n\nCuomo\u2019s theory is that the main municipal crisis this election year is that Adams \u2014 plagued by massive high-level turnover and resignations \u2014 has turned out to be an ineffective leader who is too compromised as a criminal defendant to display the independence and forcefulness required to deal with President Trump.\n\nThe ex-governor has a case to make, but it won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\u201cEvery chief executive will have some accomplishments including Cuomo,\u201d Sal Albanese, a former city councilman who made his own run for mayor in 1997, told me on social media, describing Cuomo as \u201ca political mechanic with a ton of political baggage.\u201d I\u2019m not sure Cuomo himself would dispute that description. An image comes to mind of the ex-governor carrying a weathered, battered valise filled with a long list of allies, enemies, and tough decisions, slowly ascending the staircase into City Hall."

Mia Love, the first Black woman elected to Congress as a Republican, faces an increasingly grave prognosis as her condition has worsened while fighting an aggressive form of brain cancer, according to her daughter.\n\nPosting to her mother\u2019s X account Saturday, Love\u2019s daughter, Abigale Love, said that she and her mother\u2019s team have decided to prioritize being with her and keeping her comfortable at this time.\n\n\u201cSadly her cancer is no longer responding to treatment and the cancer is progressing,\u201d Abigale Love said.\n\nIn May, Love appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d to explain her 2022 diagnosis with glioblastoma brain cancer, or GBM. People diagnosed with GBM typically have just a year-and-a-half to two years to live, with only a 10% chance of survival after five years, according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nLove told Tapper she began receiving immunotherapy every three weeks since August 2023 as part of a clinical trial at The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University. Love discussed her hopeful outlook despite her then-prognosis of 10-15 months to live \u2013 which she has since surpassed \u2013 and how her Mormon faith has helped her persevere.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a cure in my faith and in science,\u201d she said. \u201cFunny thing is, my patriarchal blessing said you will have a long and prosperous life, a rich and rewarding life, so long as you decide to remain in public service.\u201d\n\nLove, who is 49, represented Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District from 2015-2019. She later joined CNN as a political commentator and was a rotating guest on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nLove offered a message of hope on Facebook last year to others who may be facing similar conditions.\n\n\u201cI recently shared details of my cancer journey with my friend Jake Tapper. It hasn\u2019t been an easy journey, but I share it because I want my journey to give others hope,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether you are facing a cancer diagnosis yourself, or fighting a different battle, there is hope! For me, that hope comes from my faith and my family. Both have been a source of immeasurable strength, peace, love, and support. Every day, I thank God for my life and a family who give that life beauty and meaning.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox sent well wishes on social media, saying, \u201cMia Love has served Utah with integrity, and her strength and grace continue to inspire us. Our hearts are with Mia and her family during this difficult time. Utah stands with you.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal judge ruled Saturday that the head of a government watchdog agency whom President Donald Trump is attempting to fire is entitled to remain in the post, setting up a dispute that will almost certainly be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe ruling from US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is a win for the head of the Office of Special Counsel, Hampton Dellinger, who sued the Trump administration over his firing in a case that has already gone to the Supreme Court once before. The latest decision removes some of the technical legal issues that complicated earlier appeals by the Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIt would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal.\u201d\n\nRuling otherwise, she said, would offer the president \u201ca constitutional license to bully officials in the executive branch into doing his will.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing the decision.\n\nDellinger\u2019s case may ultimately help to decide how much power Trump has to fire the leadership at independent agencies, many of whom are protected by federal laws that bar their dismissal absent neglect of duty or malfeasance. But until now, most of the legal wrangling has focused on procedural issues, such as whether certain temporary court orders can be appealed.\n\nJackson\u2019s latest decision will clear away some of those procedural hurdles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\u201d Dellinger said in a statement. \u201cMy efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\u201d\n\nThe US Office of Special Counsel is unrelated to special counsels like Jack Smith or Robert Mueller who are appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations. Instead, Dellinger handles allegations of whistleblower retaliation made on behalf of federal employees \u2014 including some who are also losing their jobs as Trump attempts to rapidly shrink the size of the government. Congress has made clear that the special counsel, created during the Carter administration, could be removed \u201cby the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d\n\nThe director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office fired Dellinger on February 7 in a brief email that cited none of those requirements, court records show.\n\nDellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2024 to lead the Office of Special Counsel for a five-year term.\n\nThe Supreme Court has considered the controversy once before, in the first case tied to Trump\u2019s whirlwind of activity to reach the high court since the president began his second term. Five justices agreed late last week to hold the matter in \u201cabeyance\u201d for several days. That decision essentially allowed the court to punt the case until a temporary order handed down by Jackson was set to expire.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report."

However, what he saw between President Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday made him think he was \u201cwatching Bravo TV.\u201d\n\nPortnoy devoted an entire video to his breakdown of the bizarre disagreement among world leaders that began \u2013 oddly enough \u2013 after a comment about embracing diplomacy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just here for the pizza reviews, keep it moving,\u201d Portnoy told his listeners. \u201cBut \u2026 I had to talk about this meeting with Zelenskyy. I posted on my Twitter [Friday]. I said [it was] the most surreal thing I\u2019ve ever seen in politics. Felt like I was watching Bravo TV.\u201d\n\nPortnoy correctly observed that everything at the meeting seemed fine until the end. He also outlined the stances of the camps supporting Trump and those opposing him.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re anti-Trump, you\u2019re basically saying, \u2018This is the worst day in the history of America,\u2019\u201d Portnoy said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically the same as Russia and a dictator and Putin and evil. And if you\u2019re pro-Trump, you\u2019re like, \u2018Finally, somebody sticking up for American citizens, American taxpayers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Barstool Sports founder noted the diplomatic failures of the Biden administration,\n\n\u201cThis previous administration, Biden has [called] Putin a killer, a dictator, all the things Zelenskyy says,\u201d Portnoy explained. \u201cAnd what has that gotten us? Hundreds of billions of dollars given to Ukraine, and they\u2019re really no closer to ending this war.\u201d\n\nIn another moment, Portnoy spent considerable time criticizing Zelensky for not being appropriately dressed to meet President Trump in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cYou can say whatever you want about Trump,\u201d Portnoy explained. \u201cHe takes signs of disrespect personally. He\u2019s very much about, you know, respecting other things. So, Zelenskyy shows up, and he\u2019s wearing his sweatshirt and his customary outfit, which is his way of essentially saying, \u2018I\u2019m at war. I don\u2019t have time to play politics or any other stuff.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor me, this is just stupid. We get you\u2019re at war, but you\u2019re coming to meet a new administration,\u201d he added. \u201d And it\u2019s just a sign of disrespect not to show the same level of respect (in) the Oval Office that Trump clearly thinks it deserves.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Portnoy stressed the need for Ukraine to show \u201cdeference\u201d to the country that has done so much to help them.\n\n\u201cThey should show some deference to or thank you to the American taxpayers. We don\u2019t have to continually foot this bill. But I respect or understand Trump not wanting to vilify Putin. The last administration did it every single chance they could get. It got us nowhere. Trump made it very clear he wants diplomacy. He wants to end the debt. He wants to end this war.\u201d\n\nPortnoy said, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily have the answers, but I think Trump and Vance handled this as well as they could. Like, we\u2019re not going to just get steamrolled by Zelenskyy at the expense of getting a deal done. And if that means we have to throw a couple flowers at Putin, so be it.\u201d"

Irving also sings the national anthem ahead of Vancouver Canucks and Vancouver Whitecaps games.\n\nStar sports commentator Pat McAfee loudly lambasted the Canadian fans for booing, and the country as a whole, in response during the Peacock broadcast.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"It kind of sucks that it's in the terrible country of Canada that booed our national anthem to start this entire thing,\" McAfee shouted at the broadcast table.\n\nToronto's booing of the anthem comes a week after hockey fans from both countries booed each other's anthems.\n\nDuring the NHL's 4 Nations Face-Off exhibition tournament from Feb. 12-20, fans in Canada booed the U.S. national anthem while fans in the U.S. booed the Canadian national anthem ahead of multiple games.\n\nIt started Feb. 13, when Canadian fans in Montreal booed the U.S. national anthem after President Donald Trump's recent threats to impose tariffs on Canada while also suggesting the country should become America's 51st state.\n\nThe booing prompted a flurry of brawls between Canadian and U.S. players in the first meeting of the tournament between the two teams Feb. 15. The U.S. won that game 3-1.\n\nNHL STAR DISHES ON TEAM USA PLAYERS' AMERICAN PRIDE: 'HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM AMERICANS IN GENERAL'\n\nThe Canadian national anthem was then booed at TD Garden in Boston before a 4 Nations game between Canada and Finland.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada then met in the final Feb. 20, and American fans in Boston once again booed the Canadian national anthem, albeit with a lighter tone. Canada won the game in overtime, 3-2.\n\nSince then, hostile rhetoric between the two countries, including in sports, has only escalated.\n\nCanadian men\u2019s soccer coach Jesse Marsch blasted Trump for his \"51st state\" remarks, calling them \"insulting\" Wednesday.\n\nDuring CONCACAF Nations League media day Wednesday, Marsch didn\u2019t hold back his opinion on Trump\u2019s comments, saying he was \"ashamed\" of how Canada was insulted by the president.\n\n\"If I have one message to our president, it\u2019s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,\" Marsch said. \"As an American, I\u2019m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard we\u2019ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies. But one thing\u2019s for sure, when I look forward a month from now, this will fuel our team. The mentality we have, the will we have to play for our country.\"\n\nNHL legend Wayne Gretzky has also been criticized by fellow Canadians for his apparent support of Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump recently said he asked Gretzky to become the next \"governor of Canada\" after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning.\n\nBut after Gretzky expressed support for \"Canada remaining a separate Country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State,\" Trump declared Gretzky a \"free agent.\"\n\nThat prompted hockey legend Bobby Orr, a fellow Canadian, to write in the Toronto Sun that he was disappointed to read criticism about Gretzky, someone he considers one of the \"greatest Canadians ever.\"\n\n\"How fickle can people be, when someone who has given so much time and effort to Canadian hockey is treated in such a way,\" Orr wrote. \"Listen, we all have our personal beliefs as they pertain to things such as religion and politics. Wayne respects your right to such beliefs \u2013 why can\u2019t you respect his?\"\n\nJanet Gretzky, Wayne's wife, read Orr's column, and she reacted on social media.\n\n\"Thank you Mr. Bobby Orr. Your words mean the world to Wayne and his family , i have never met anyone who is more Proud to be a Canadian and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments . . He would do anything to make Canadians Proud , with his Love for Hockey and his Country,\" Janet wrote in an Instagram post in which she shared Orr's column.\n\nTrump agreed Feb. 3 to pause tariffs for 30 days, which means they\u2019re expected to be imposed in early March. The tariffs imposed on Canada by Trump are a response to drug trafficking at the U.S.-Canadian border."

He even deputized billionaire Elon Musk to be the face of a new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBut critics say Musk\u2019s chainsaw approach to slashing government programs, contracts and jobs is having the opposite effect, sowing such confusion that it has hamstrung the bureaucracy\u2019s ability to serve the public and carry out key parts of Trump\u2019s own agenda.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s leading to paralysis, and nothing is getting done,\u201d said one Veterans Affairs official who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. The official described \u201cabsolute chaos\u201d at the agency, with even Trump political appointees afraid to misstep and incur a backlash from either the White House or the public.\n\n\u201cThe best employees are starting to look elsewhere,\u201d the official added. \u201cI can\u2019t overemphasize that enough.\u201d\n\nTrump and other White House officials say that the president is thrilled with Musk\u2019s work and wants him to be more aggressive. But there are signs of pushback within the political ranks of the administration, where Cabinet secretaries risk losing the civil servants best equipped to carry out critical government functions, and rank-and-file civil servants say exercises in navel-gazing have become a distraction from important work.\n\nIn short, running the government can be harder than it looks.\n\nEmail ultimatum fallout: Several veteran federal workers who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity said that managers and employers at agencies spent hours on Monday determining how to deal with Musk\u2019s email directive \u2014 beyond just the time it took to assemble bulleted lists.\n\n\u201cProbably spent at least 30-60 minutes sharing thoughts about how to approach it with other federal employee friends from different agencies,\u201d said one of the workers who asked that her agency not be named. \u201cProbably spent 60 minutes thinking about how it might be interpreted and also looked at the banned words to make sure I did not include those.\u201d\n\nThe employee was referring to words \u2014 such as \u201cdiversity\u201d \u2014 that the administration is averse to. \u201cI spent at least 30 minutes drafting [and] shared it with my manager via email before sending it,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMore on DOGE:\n\nTwenty-one civil service employees resigned en masse from DOGE, saying in a joint letter that they refused to use their technical expertise to \u201ccompromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans\u2019 sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Musk will participate in Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting tomorrow.\n\nAnd the White House confirmed that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of DOGE. Her LinkedIn profile has her listed as the senior adviser at the U.S. Digital Service since January, the agency that was morphed into DOGE.\n\nAfter facing blowback from constituents at town halls, several House Republicans are seeking more information and compassion from the DOGE effort.\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nAn economic warning sign for Trump in the polls\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nA flood of new polls this past week offered a snapshot of how Americans are feeling about Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Averaging them together, 46% approve of his job performance and 50% disapprove. That\u2019s hardly great by any historical standard, but also largely in line with what he posted during his first term (and actually at the higher end of that range).\n\nBut there was one noticeable difference: the economy.\n\nDuring his first term, this issue was a rare bright spot for Trump in polling. Over his four years in office, he averaged a 49% approval rating for his handling of the economy, with 41% disapproving, according to NBC News\u2019 polling. But in recent surveys, those numbers are now reversed.\n\nThe difference may not be massive in raw numbers, but it becomes more significant when you consider that Trump\u2019s average first-term rating on the economy outpaced all of his predecessors\u2019 this century.\n\nTrump\u2019s 49%-41% rating on the economy was much higher than his overall average job approval rating (44%-53%). And the contrast between his first-term economic numbers and those of his successor, Joe Biden, provided Trump with a key advantage during last year\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn the early part of his second term, though, Trump\u2019s numbers are in line with those of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, both of whom were weighted down by the economic upheaval of 2007 and 2008 and its lingering effects.\n\nThe administration\u2019s argument is that Trump has inherited a rough situation from Biden and that, in time, the economy will gain strength. But for now, Democrats are sensing a potentially potent political weapon to use against Trump and the GOP in this fall\u2019s off-year elections and next year\u2019s midterms.\n\nIf there\u2019s a silver lining for Trump and his party in his current ratings, it\u2019s that he also started out slow during his first term, posting his worst economic numbers during his initial months in office. Within a year, though, he was firmly in positive territory, something that could certainly happen again.\n\nBut if Trump\u2019s numbers remain where they are, or decline further, this could present a political opening for Democrats that they didn\u2019t have the first time he was president.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2611\ufe0f On the floor: House Speaker Mike Johnson is plowing forward with a vote as early as this evening on a budget resolution to advance Trump\u2019s legislative agenda even as he is still working to sway the holdouts.

            "full_content": "Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has continued to disrupt Washington with massive cuts to federal agencies and mass layoffs of government workers. Yet one question has remained through the organization\u2019s first month: Who exactly is running things?\n\nWhile Musk has long been the public and online face of DOGE, the White House has maintained that the Tesla CEO is not actually in charge. Last week, Joshua Fisher, the director of the White House\u2019s Office of Administration, said in federal court papers that Elon Musk has \u201cno actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\u201d per the Associated Press.\n\nThe administration maintained this posture on Tuesday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt fielded questions as to the identity of the DOGE administrator, a role established by the executive order that created the temporary initiative. Leavitt said that Musk is a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d and that he is overseeing DOGE but declined to say who is currently holding the administrator role.\n\nThen, in a sudden twist, the White House finally provided a name. Semafor reports that Amy Gleason is the acting DOGE administrator, citing an administration official. According to her LinkedIn account, Gleason most recently worked as a senior adviser at the United States Digital Service, the unit that was subsumed by DOGE when it was created. She has experience in health care, having worked as chief product officer for both the investment firm Russell Street Ventures and Main Street Health, which focuses on care in rural areas. The Washington Post reports that Gleason will be in charge of efforts to modernize IT and data at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe reveal immediately prompted questions about the extent of Gleason\u2019s involvement. CBS News reports that when contacted Tuesday, Gleason told the outlet she was in Mexico and declined further comment. Sources told the New York Times that Gleason was unaware that the White House was planning on revealing her role to the public.\n\nOn Wednesday, Leavitt told reporters that Gleason has held the position \u201cfor quite some time\u201d and that it wasn\u2019t a secret to anyone. \u201cEverybody knew and we said who she was to all of you because you are hounds in the media who are so obsessed with this for some reason. So, in the effort of transparency, we told you who that person is,\u201d she said.\n\nDoes Gleason support what her department has become? Is she in touch with Elon Musk? In some ways, this mystery has been solved, but in other ways it continues."

Her position with DOGE was first reported by the Washington Examiner.\n\nShe also worked in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, including being placed on the White House Coronavirus Task Force\u2019s data team, led by Dr. Deborah Birx, because of Gleason\u2019s technology background. In that role, Gleason led the creation of the national Covid-19 case tracker database.\n\nBefore returning to government work, Gleason joined Russell Street Ventures, a firm founded by Brad Smith, who is now a DOGE adviser.\n\nDespite pledging full transparency, the White House has refused or been unable to identify the administrator of DOGE, including during Tuesday\u2019s press briefing. While Musk has served as the initiative\u2019s public face and continues to issue social-media directives to government workers, the White House has maintained that his status is one of a special government employee, and not a full-time worker.\n\n\u201cSo, the president tasked Elon Musk to oversee the DOGE effort,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Tuesday when asked directly who was administering the initiative. \u201cThere are career officials and there are political appointees who are helping run DOGE on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nJustice Department attorneys were grilled in a court appearance Monday about who the administrator was, but none were able to say then, either.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s involved? Who\u2019s in charge? Who\u2019s giving them direction?\u201d Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly asked government attorneys at the hearing, which examined DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive data systems at the Treasury Department.\n\nJudges, including Kollar-Kotelly, have raised the lack of clarity around DOGE\u2019s structure as impeding their ability to decide the emergency disputes before them.\n\nShe and others have raised possible constitutional issues, depending on the chain of command at DOGE and who is behind the sweeping decisions that have the upended federal government\u2019s operations in recent weeks.\n\nThe White House official did not say how long Gleason has been the acting administrator.\n\nIt had been unclear to some employees if Gleason had the acting administrator position when she led an all-staff meeting in person in Washington, DC, last week. She did not make it known nor did people ask at the time. Gleason gave a message at the meeting signaling, \u201cI am here to move the organization forward and to reassure you that all your projects are a priority,\u201d according to a federal employee who has worked with Gleason but asked to remain anonymous because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss her new role.\n\nThe employee described Gleason, in general, as \u201cdirect and to the point.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Sunlen Serfaty, Michael Williams and Shania Shelton contributed to this report."

Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump 2.0 enterprise is already conducting a really big gamble with its three-pronged smash-and-grab assault on the federal government via Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE, Russell Vought\u2019s OMB, and congressional Republican budget cuts. Everyone involved understands that the kind of Americans who decide elections tend to dislike big government and bureaucrats as an abstract matter but also like a lot of specific things Washington provides. Much of the game right now involves the size and speed of the inevitable backlash to what the new administration (and particularly Musk) is doing. And for Republican politicians expected to implement and lead cheers for this extravaganza in public-sector demolition, many anxious eyes will be on early electoral tests for the GOP, which now owns the very federal government it\u2019s seeking to disable.\n\nThe bad news for Republicans is that one of the very first and most closely watched tests will be in Virginia (which, along with New Jersey, has one of the two off-year gubernatorial contests of 2025). Virginia has an unusually strong tendency to react negatively to the party controlling the White House (11 of the last 12 gubernatorial races in the state have been lost by the sitting president\u2019s party). Worse yet, vote-heavy northern Virginia is a vast bedroom for the federal employees and contractors that Musk is decimating, cackling like a cartoon villain as he goes. It\u2019s not surprising to see that Trump\u2019s current popularity in the state is sinking. A new Roanoke College poll showed just 37 percent of Virginians approving the job Trump is doing and a record 59 percent disapproving. Republicans had thought Trump was doing relatively well in this state: He lost it by 5.7 percent in 2024 as opposed to a 10.1 percent loss in 2020. Indeed, the GOP was bullish about their prospects in Virginia generally with incumbent (and term-limited) Governor Glenn Youngkin remaining relatively popular and the race to succeed him between his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, and Democrat Abby Spanberger looking very close. But the Roanoke College poll showed Spanberger leading that race by double digits (39 percent to 24 percent).\n\nAside from the near certainty that federal budget cuts and personnel firings are going to be a problem for Republicans between now and the November general election, the Roanoke survey showed other elements of Trump\u2019s agenda not looking great to these highly influential voters. Big majorities felt that wealthy people and corporations do not pay their fare share of federal taxes, which is relevant to Trump\u2019s plans to cut taxes for both. And 76 percent of respondents said undocumented immigrants (of which there are likely many in Virginia) should be allowed to stay in the country \u201cwith conditions,\u201d while only 26 percent flatly favored deporting them.\n\nYou\u2019d think in these circumstances that the relative popular Youngkin could help Republicans distance themselves from Trump and avoid some of the likely backlash to his policies. But in today\u2019s GOP, that\u2019s just not in the cards, as the Bulwark reported:\n\n[F]ear not, DOGE\u2019d-off workers of the Commonwealth! Gov. Glenn Youngkin has a message for you: Your days of leeching off the public may have come to an end, but with a little elbow grease and pluck, you just might successfully transition to actual productive work in the private sector.\n\nThat was the gist of Youngkin\u2019s strikingly tone-deaf press conference yesterday, focused on the cheerful theme VIRGINIA HAS JOBS. \u201cListen,\u201d Youngkin said, \u201cwe have a federal government that is inefficient, and we have an administration that is taking on that challenge of rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse and driving efficiency in our federal government. It needed to happen \u2026\u201d\n\nOnline attempts yesterday to soothe Virginia\u2019s laid-off federal workers weren\u2019t going much better. Lieutenant Gov. Winsome Sears, who is running to replace the term-limited Youngkin, released a direct-to-camera video acknowledging \u201cconcern about the federal government workforce transition,\u201d and sharing five links to \u201cadditional resources to assist.\u201d All five links led to broken \u201c404 Page Not Found\u201d website errors.\n\nBarring an extremely unlikely change of course by the federal administration across the Potomac River, Trump\u2019s policies will continue to be a lodestone for his party in Virginia this year. And the Virginia gubernatorial race will likely remain a source of hope for Democrats looking for concrete signs that the 47th president\u2019s November victory was after all a flash in the pan rather than the sort of remorseless trend MAGA activists seem to assume is in the works. Perhaps Glenn Youngkin\u2019s craven surrender to the team harassing his constituents will earn him a nice ambassadorship somewhere."

Because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold.\u201d\n\nTrump: \"We've actually going to Ft Knox to see if the gold is there. Because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold.\" pic.twitter.com/NuVU2G15sv \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 24, 2025\n\nThe state of the U.S. government\u2019s gold reserve at Fort Knox has been the focus of conspiracy theories for decades. The highly secure Kentucky military base stores 147.3 million ounces, which is currently worth around $433.7 billion, according to the U.S. Mint. The U.S. left the gold standard in 1971, but if Fort Knox has less gold than the government says \u2014 or none at all \u2014 it could roil gold markets, aside from being a massive scandal.\n\nSo why has this suddenly become a top concern for the Trump administration? Apparently because ZeroHedge tweeted at Elon Musk. On February 15, the DOGE chief had this exchange with the conspiracy-minded financial news site on X:\n\nOver the next few days, Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee \u2014 longtime Fort Knox gold skeptics \u2014 urged DOGE to do an audit. Musk said the American people want to know if the gold is \u201cstolen\u201d or \u201cstill there,\u201d and replied to an Alex Jones post, \u201cIt would be cool to do a live video walkthrough of Fort Knox!\u201d\n\nSince the first gold shipment arrived at Fort Knox in 1937, federal officials have checked on it several times, most recently during the first Trump administration. Per Forbes:\n\nThe Fort Knox depository has only opened its doors to non-authorized personnel on three occasions: In 1943 for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1974 for 10 Congress members to break down \u201ccobwebs\u201d to \u201cre-assur[e] the public that their gold is intact and safe\u201d and in 2017 for a delegation including Sen. Mitch McConnell, R. Ky., and then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \u201cIt is freakishly well secured,\u201d then-Gov. Matt Bevin, R. Ky., said after visiting the Fort Knox depository in 2017. \u201cThe gold is safe,\u201d Bevin added.\n\nAnd last week, Trump\u2019s new Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told iHeart Radio host Dan O\u2019Donnell that the department audits Fort Knox every year, and that \u201call the gold is present and accounted for.\u201d He added that senators are welcome to come see for themselves.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: @USTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirms to me that yes, there is still gold in Fort Knox. pic.twitter.com/NUQzYrexZI \u2014 Dan O'Donnell (@DanODonnellShow) February 19, 2025\n\nBut it seems Trump doesn\u2019t trust his own Treasury secretary on the matter. He has brought up Musk\u2019s Fort Knox audit, unprompted, several times in the past week. On February 19, Trump kept steering the conversation back to gold as he took questions from reporters on Air Force One.\n\n\u201cWe hope everything\u2019s fine with Fort Knox, but we\u2019re going to go to Fort Knox, the fabled Fort Knox, to make sure the gold is there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the gold isn\u2019t there, we\u2019re going to be very upset.\u201d\n\nA day later, Trump told Republican governors that he will join Musk on his as-yet-unscheduled visit to Fort Knox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually going on this one. All my life I\u2019ve heard about Fort Knox. That\u2019s where the gold is kept,\u201d Trump said at a reception in Washington, per The Hill.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a little bit shaky. We\u2019re getting the yips on this stuff. Like, I want to find out,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up the doors. I\u2019m going to see if we have gold there. Did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox?\u201d\n\nSo why is Trump taking time out of his busy schedule to personally investigate the contents of Fort Knox? The likeliest explanation is that he\u2019s just fulfilling a boyish fantasy, like when he played with big trucks and became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. Who wouldn\u2019t want to tour the \u201cfabled Fort Knox\u201d? Here\u2019s how the New York Times described the congressional visit the vault back in 1974:\n\nStacked from the floor 8 feet to the ceiling in a vault 6 feet wide and 12 feet deep were 36,236 bars, glistening in the half\u2010light. The effect of standing in the presence of about $1,775,688,776.85 worth of gold in one room was awesome. \u2026 \u201cOhs\u201d and \u201cahs\u201d arose from 10 members of Congress who were there to see whether, indeed, the gold was still there.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s fixation on the idea that \u201cmaybe somebody stole the gold\u201d is a bit suspicious. The president has a habit of accusing other people of things he\u2019s guilty of himself and a well-known fondness for all things gold. Perhaps he isn\u2019t the most trustworthy detective to put on the case.\n\nThis post has been updated."

Tesla\u2019s market value dropped below $1 trillion for the first time since November 2024.\n\nTesla sales are in an unprecedented slide, and the company\u2019s sales dropped 45% last month across Europe despite the popularity of electric vehicles there, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. And though Musk is a deeply polarizing figure, it\u2019s not clear that his politics are playing a major role in Tesla\u2019s sales slump. Growing competition, especially in China, and sinking demand growth in the United States are playing a major role in Tesla\u2019s slump this year.\n\nNevertheless, Tesla\u2019s stock slide represents a stark change in investors\u2019 attitudes from November 2024, right after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Musk had never been richer, with his net worth hitting a record $347.8 billion, Bloomberg reported, after a steady rally for Tesla.\n\nInvestors believed that Musk\u2019s influence in the Trump administration would usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company. Musk, Tesla\u2019s largest individual shareholder, was roughly $83 billion richer since Election Day by the end of November.\n\nSteve Man, global lead director for auto and industrial market research at Bloomberg Intelligence, told CNN over email that Tesla could still \u201cthrive beyond the noise.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s \u201cpolitical maneuvers steer headlines and spark backlash in parts of the consumer base, but the company continue to drive cutting-edge tech with ambition to build a loyal fanbase,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk\u2019s alliance with Trump pushed his ventures to the forefront. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, as well as the owner of X and the CEO of other ventures, including Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Company. He now oversees the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and has made a number of controversial job cuts and downsizing in the federal government, including thousands of layoffs across agencies.\n\nMusk\u2019s net worth dropped $5.2 billion this past week, according to the latest update to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index. He\u2019s still the richest person in the world with a net worth of $380 billion \u2014 a whopping $144 billion richer than the second-richest person in the world, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThree different federal judges delivered legal setbacks and slap downs to President Donald Trump in the span of an hour and a half on Tuesday in a series of cases challenging controversial moves taken during the early days of his second term.\n\nThe rulings from judges in Washington, DC, and Washington state are the latest to pump the brakes on Trump\u2019s agenda, underscoring the critical role courts have taken on for foes of Trump looking to frustrate his actions.\n\nIn DC, Judge Loren AliKhan issued a preliminary injunction that indefinitely blocks the administration from freezing federal grants and loans. The ruling expands an earlier block the appointee of former President Joe Biden issued last month shortly after the White House ordered the funding freeze.\n\n\u201cIn the simplest terms, the freeze was ill-conceived from the beginning. Defendants either wanted to pause up to $3 trillion in federal spending practically overnight, or they expected each federal agency to review every single one of its grants, loans, and funds for compliance in less than twenty-four hours. The breadth of that command is almost unfathomable,\u201d AliKhan wrote in her ruling.\n\nShe went on to say that the spending freeze was \u201cirrational, imprudent, and precipitated a nationwide crisis.\u201d\n\nThe issue of withholding federal funds has become a major flashpoint during the opening weeks of Trump\u2019s second term, with other pending cases challenging the White House\u2019s decision to suspend all foreign assistance.\n\nShortly before AliKhan issued her ruling, a separate jurist in the DC federal courthouse \u2013 Judge Amir Ali \u2013 ordered the Trump administration to pay foreign aid-related money owed to government contractors and nonprofit groups by Wednesday night, amid the legal fight over the freezing of USAID and State Department funds.\n\nThat order amounted to a legal reprimand after the plaintiffs in the cases repeatedly accused the administration of not complying with Ali\u2019s earlier temporary restraining order that revived the funding contracts and grants that existed at the end of the Biden administration.\n\nAli \u2013 also a Biden appointee \u2013 rebuffed an earlier call by the challengers for the administration to be held in contempt for its alleged non-compliance. But he issued a new order requiring, in more forceful terms, that the government pay money owed to contractors and non-profits for work that had already been completed by the February 13 order.\n\nMeanwhile, across the country in Washington state, a federal judge in Seattle issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday that halts Trump\u2019s executive order suspending refugee admissions and funding.\n\nJudge Jamal Whitehead, who was also appointed by Biden, said that Trump\u2019s \u201cactions amount to an effective nullification of congressional will in establishing the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the president has substantial discretion to suspend refugee admissions, that authority is not limitless,\u201d the judge said.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day back in office, also directed a review of the refugee program and stated that resettlement should only resume if deemed to be in the \u201cnational interest\u201d \u2013 a move critics argue is a de facto refugee ban.\n\nCases advance to next stages\n\nThe administration is facing at least 80 cases challenging a range of actions taken during Trump\u2019s first few weeks back in office.\n\nThe plaintiffs behind those challenges have seen some success as they\u2019ve pressed judges to issue emergency relief during the early stages of the litigation. But the White House, too, has scored some court victories in cases brought against the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal workforce and shutter the US\u2019 foreign aid agency.\n\nMany of the cases are finally getting a more thorough review by judges who are mulling whether to issue preliminary injunctions to block the contested government action. Such a decision is often the final trial court-level ruling issued in cases before they\u2019re appealed by the losing side.\n\nAs AliKhan explained her reasoning for issuing the preliminary injunction in the funding freeze case, she said the nonprofits that brought the case were likely to succeed on their claims that the freeze was unlawful.\n\n\u201cThe scope of power (the Office of Management and Budget) seeks to claim is \u2018breathtaking,\u2019 and its ramifications are massive,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBecause there is no clear statutory hook for this broad assertion of power, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.\u201d\n\nAnd AliKhan noted that her earlier order temporarily halting the funding freeze was just that \u2013 temporary.\n\n\u201cThe relief Plaintiffs now seek is a more durable version of the relief they sought then, when their members were on the brink of extinction,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn sum, Plaintiffs have marshalled significant evidence indicating that the funding freeze would be economically catastrophic \u2013 and in some circumstances, fatal \u2013 to their members.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed and Angelica Franganillo Diaz contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

This had led to a lot of grand old sucking up to Trump over the years. But since his second term began, the Republican sycophant industrial complex has moved into a new gear. Below are the most egregious recent examples of the term so far.\n\nA bill to make Trump\u2019s birthday a national holiday\n\nOn February 14, New York representative Claudia Tenney introduced a bill to make Donald Trump\u2019s birthday, June 14, a federal holiday.\n\n\u201cHis impact on the nation is undeniable,\u201d Tenney wrote in a statement announcing the bill. \u201cJust as George Washington\u2019s Birthday is codified as a federal holiday, this bill will add Trump\u2019s Birthday to this list, recognizing him as the founder of America\u2019s Golden Age.\u201d (So far, the golden age has consisted of plunging consumer confidence and fears of more inflation due to Trump\u2019s tariffs.)\n\nA bill to put Trump on Mount Rushmore\n\nFlorida representative Anna Paulina Luna proposed a bill in January to make Mount Rushmore a little more crowded by adding Trump\u2019s visage alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMount Rushmore, a timeless symbol of our nation\u2019s freedom and strength, deserves to reflect his towering legacy \u2014 a legacy further solidified by the powerful start to his second term,\u201d Luna wrote, just eight days into the term. The one-page bill did not detail how or where sculptors would chisel Trump\u2019s face into the 5,725-foot mountain in South Dakota, or how they would get his hair right.\n\nA bill to change the name of Greenland to \u2018Red, White and Blueland\u2019\n\nAnother stunt bill came from Representative Buddy Carter, who proposed legislation changing the name of Greenland to \u201cRed, White and Blueland.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has correctly identified the purchase of what is now Greenland as a national security priority, and we will proudly welcome its people to join the freest nation to ever exist when our Negotiator-in-Chief inks this monumental deal,\u201d Carter said in a statement announcing the bill last month.\n\nA resolution to allow Trump to serve a third term\n\nJust three days into Trump\u2019s second term, Representative Andy Ogles was hoping for a third. The Tennessee Republican filed a resolution to amend the Constitution and void the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. Trump \u201chas proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation\u2019s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal,\u201d Ogles fawned.\n\nA pair of bills to put Trump\u2026on a bill\n\nRepresentative Brandon Gill of Texas announced his plans to introduce legislation to replace the face of founding father Benjamin Franklin with Trump on the $100 bill. The congressman told Fox News that the move \u201cis a small way to honor all he will accomplish these next four years.\u201d His legislation would require the Treasury Department to begin workshopping designs by 2026 with the intention of having the Trump bills in circulation in 2029.\n\nGill isn\u2019t the only member of Congress proposing a currency-based tribute to the president. Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina also introduced the \u201cDonald J. Trump $250 Bill Act\u201d which would direct the Treasury Department to design a $250 bill featuring Trump\u2019s face, in honor of the upcoming 250-year anniversary of the founding of the United States. Notably, Wilson\u2019s bill would also revise a centuries old statute barring living figures from being depicted on currency, adding an exemption for those who have served as president.\n\nA U.S. Attorney that calls himself Trump\u2019s lawyer\n\nEd Martin, the nominee for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has joined Trump\u2019s spat against the Associated Press over the outlet\u2019s refusal to re-designate the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. On Monday, Martin posted on an official government account that his office was serving as \u201cPresident Trumps\u2019 lawyers\u201d and that he would remain \u201cvigilant in standing against enemies like the AP.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the typo, a U.S. Attorney is appointed to uphold the law, not to do the president\u2019s bidding or treat journalists like hardened criminals. Leave that kind of thing to the deputy director of the FBI, Dan Bongino."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson pulled off a stunning turnaround Tuesday night to rescue a critical vote to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda that had seemed doomed just moments earlier.\n\nSurprising even some of his critics, Johnson and his leadership team capped hours of drama in the Capitol by successfully flipping multiple Republican holdouts to pass a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward moving Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda forward. With help from last-minute phone calls from Trump, GOP leaders spent all of Tuesday in a furious pressure campaign to win backing for their plan.\n\n\u201cThe world didn\u2019t end today. But I do see the edge,\u201d Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, said of the whiplash in the House.\n\nRepublicans had punted the vote Tuesday night only to turn around minutes later to call fleeing members back to the floor to muscle through the plan.\n\nIn the end, Johnson lost just a single vote \u2014 fiscal hawk Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 which was all he could afford. The Democrats\u2019 whip team scrambled to get near-full attendance on their side: Rep. Brittany Pettersen flew with her 4-week-old baby to make it in time for the vote and Rep. Kevin Mullin, who is recovering from complications from knee surgery, flew with an IV from California.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Democratic lawmaker brought her newborn son to vote against GOP proposal 01:13 - Source: CNN Democratic lawmaker brought her newborn son to vote against GOP proposal 01:13\n\nBut the drama won\u2019t end there: Johnson and his allies acknowledge that what comes next will be much more difficult. Tuesday night\u2019s vote itself was procedural and GOP leaders from the House and Senate will need to agree on how exactly to move ahead with Trump\u2019s sprawling legislative package now that they have adopted divergent plans. The days-long saga over the House budget blueprint laid bare bitter divisions among Republicans that will make it extraordinarily difficult to pass that package in both chambers.\n\nStill, the win comes at a critical time for Trump and Johnson as their party faces crushing deadlines ahead, including avoiding a government shutdown next month and the threat of an economic default later this spring. As with Tuesday night\u2019s vote, navigating those political landmines will require near total unity from the GOP.\n\nGOP leaders will now get to work on exactly what will make it into Trump\u2019s first legislative package. The newly passed House GOP plan calls for sweeping tax cuts, steep spending cuts and a two-year debt limit hike, as well as new money for border security and energy production. The Senate\u2019s plan, however, contains only national security and energy money, while punting on the more contentious items for later.\n\nThe stakes are high for GOP leaders: Trump is eager to pass his agenda as quickly as possible, even as party leaders must comply with the extremely strict constraints of the budget powers that allow their party to pass a package without Democratic votes. And Republicans will need to tread carefully on reforms to popular programs like Medicaid, food assistance and Pell grants \u2014 concerns that nearly sunk the budget plan this week.\n\nThe successful vote capped a dramatic 12 hours for Johnson. In the morning, he held a tense meeting with House Republicans to convince his members to back the budget blueprint or risk forgoing key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nBut by the afternoon, House GOP leaders were still struggling to lock down the votes, and even the relentlessly upbeat Johnson acknowledged he may need to pull it.\n\nThe votes weren\u2019t there around 7:30 p.m., when the speaker moved to scrap plans to hold the vote at all. But then his leadership team \u2014 with help from a Trump call to Rep. Victoria Spartz \u2014 was able to win over the last holdouts. So, just moments after dismissing members, Johnson called them back to vote and passed the GOP\u2019s budget blueprint.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, said he decided to change his vote after he received \u201cassurances\u201d of a future plan that could survive the Senate to trim discretionary spending, though he offered no specifics.\n\nAnd Spartz added that she spoke with Trump on health care issues, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s on board to get some great things done on health care. \u2026 I trust his word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the last few weeks are showing us how difficult it is to move any package through the House,\u201d Rep. Dusty Johnson, a leadership ally, acknowledged earlier Tuesday. \u201cThis is a motley crew.\u201d\n\nHours before the scheduled vote, hardline conservatives insisted there weren\u2019t enough spending cuts in the plan, even as centrist-leaning Republicans remained uneasy about the size of those cuts and whether they could impact popular programs like Medicaid. And Johnson\u2019s efforts to win support even backfired in some corners. Massie said he left a meeting Tuesday morning even more dug in against the budget than before.\n\n\u201cThey convinced me in there, I\u2019m a no,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said, holding up a thick packet of leadership talking points and railing against their plans line by line. By the time of the vote, Massie remained the only GOP \u201cno.\u201d\n\nJohnson and his whip team had spent the last several days trying to win over their more moderate members, many of whom had raised concerns that the budget plan could ultimately lead to cuts to the low-income health program Medicaid.\n\nAhead of the vote, Republicans from northeastern states were particularly wary of plans to cut $880 billion over a decade from federal health and energy programs, which they fear cannot be achieved without cutting Medicaid, the hugely expensive health program, since Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare.\n\nGOP leaders have strongly pushed back against the idea that benefits would be cut, noting that the budget plan is only a framework and not specific policy. They argue there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits, though it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.\n\n\u201cThis is a procedural vote. You tell me what the cuts are,\u201d House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN when asked about swing seat lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Medicaid cuts.\n\nIn the end, Johnson only recorded a single Republican defection.\n\n\u201cWe will get there, as we always do,\u201d the speaker predicted earlier in the day, when he was still lacking at least a half-dozen votes.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Alison Main, Morgan Rimmer, Veronica Stracqualursi and Aileen Graef contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Timothy Fadek/Redux\n\nOn February 17, President Donald Trump nominated a lawyer named Ed Martin to serve as the acting U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., and Martin jumped into the job with great vigor \u2014 including decisions to dismiss January 6 charges against a defendant he is representing and firing the prosecutors on that case. Unlike almost every person before him who previously served in the role, he has no experience as a prosecutor. But he has plenty of on-the-job training as a Republican operative and pro-Trump partisan. Below are some of Martin\u2019s most brazen efforts yet.\n\nDismissed the Capitol riot prosecutors\n\nMartin spent most of his career in Missouri politics, losing races for governor and attorney general before becoming the state\u2019s GOP chairman. Later, he helped organize the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021 that fed into the riot at the Capitol.\n\nLast last month, the week after Trump issued a blanket pardon to those charged over the Capitol riot, Martin fired 30 federal prosecutors who had worked on cases involving the riot. In an email to his staff, Martin described the prosecutions as a \u201cgreat failure of our office\u201d and has advocated for reparations for those who served time. He then went on the offensive, sending a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer suggesting he may investigate his March 2020 statement that Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would \u201cpay the price\u201d for voting against abortion access. (Schumer later walked it back.) \u201cWe take threats against public officials very seriously,\u201d Martin wrote.\n\nAlso dismissed the case of a Capitol riot convict he was still defending\n\nWhen Trump issued pardons for January 6 convicts on his first day, he also ordered the Justice Department to dismiss any outstanding indictments related to the riot. Martin, on his second day as U.S. Attorney, filed to dismiss these cases \u2014 including one of a defendant named Joseph Padilla who was convicted of assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon. Martin moved to dismiss the case, even as he was on file as Padilla\u2019s defense attorney.\n\nThe day after Reuters reported on the conflict \u2014 lawyers are not allowed to serve in both the prosecution and the defense team \u2014 Martin filed to withdraw as Padilla\u2019s attorney. But he could not step down. The judge on the case determined determined that Martin was \u201cnot in good standing\u201d with the court and was not permitted to file motions because his attorney membership was expired.\n\nCalled himself \u2018President Trumps\u2019 lawyer\u2019\n\nFederal prosecutors are sworn to protect the Constitution, not be loyal to a president. But Martin has so far adapted his role to fit the Trump\u2019s understanding of the Justice Department as an extension of his personal legal team.\n\nOn Monday, following the Associated Press lawsuit against the White House barring them access for refusing to use Trump\u2019s \u201cGulf of America\u201d name, Martin tweeted from the official U.S. Attorney\u2019s account that his office was in fact were \u201cPresident Trumps\u2019 lawyers.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s all in for DOGE\n\nAt the federal level, he has bought into Elon Musk\u2019s campaign to strip the government for parts. In early February, he wrote a public letter to Musk offering his office\u2019s services to the Department of Governmental Efficiency, writing that he would \u201cpursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo testifies before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. Photo: Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nA possible 11th-hour entry by Andrew Cuomo has loomed over the New York City mayoral race for weeks. Now it looks like he\u2019s about to throw his hat in the the ring, and he appears to be in a very good position to do so.\n\nA Honan Strategy Group\u2013conducted poll from Tusk Strategies, first reported by the New York Post, found the former governor leading among likely Democratic voters with 38 percent of the vote, putting him far out in front of the rest of the primary challengers. Leftist Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani received 12 percent, followed by incumbent mayor Eric Adams with 10 percent, comptroller Brad Lander with 7 percent, and former comptroller Scott Stringer with 5 percent. Brooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie came in at 2 percent, and Queens state senator Jessica Ramos at one percent.\n\nThough the survey hails from Cuomo-friendly territory (Politico recently reported that Tusk Strategies\u2019 CEO has been making calls on the former governor\u2019s behalf), its findings are similar to earlier polls that showed Cuomo with a double-digit lead over the crowded field. And another new poll out on Tuesday, by UniteNY poll, has Cuomo leading the primary with 35 percent in the first round. That survey takes into account New York City\u2019s ranked-choice voting system and differs significantly from the Tusk Strategies one beyond the Cuomo number; it shows Stringer in second place with 17 percent and Adams in third place with 15 percent.\n\nCuomo has probably seen enough to finally jump in. Sources tell the New York Times that the former governor could launch his campaign as soon as this weekend with fundraisers to follow within days. He was recently endorsed by his onetime rival Carl McCall and Representative Ritchie Torres and is expected to receive the backing of the New York City District Council of Carpenters, which previously supported Adams, per Politico. More key endorsements are likely to follow.\n\nBut Cuomo\u2019s high name recognition is likely a double-edged sword. In 2021, his long tenure in Albany ended in disgrace following numerous allegations of sexual harassment against him. Though Cuomo resigned, he always maintained his innocence and made moves to sue one of his accusers, Charlotte Bennett, for defamation. The former governor has also been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, facing accusations that his administration knowingly undercounted the number of deaths in nursing homes related to the virus. Last year, Cuomo testified on the issue before a Republican-led House panel that later alleged he lied to Congress and made a referral to the Justice Department. Earlier this year, a Justice Department inspector general report concluded that pandemic investigations into Democratic-led states conducted during Trump\u2019s first term might\u2019ve been politically motivated, something that Cuomo and his team have long argued.\n\nCuomo\u2019s potential challengers have long been prepared for this moment. Myrie has criticized the former governor for being \u201cquiet\u201d on the impacts of Trump\u2019s presidency; his campaign launched a website with a running clock noting the length of his silence. In October, Ramos pushed back on the idea a Cuomo comeback in a lengthy thread on social media.\n\n\u201cLike Donald Trump begging for a second term, Andrew Cuomo wants you to think that it will be different this time \u2014 that if we go back, things will move forward. But we know better: We are not going back,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMamdani and Lander have both sought to draw parallels between Cuomo and Adams:\n\nCuomo is gearing up to run for Eric Adams\u2019 second term. https://t.co/0IyGpWlby3 \u2014 Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) February 21, 2025\n\nA New York Democrat hasn\u2019t sold out his party this bad since Andrew Cuomo formed the IDC. https://t.co/1WMNsCrS8O \u2014 Brad Lander (@bradlander) January 21, 2025\n\nAs for Adams, he has continued to downplay the former governor\u2019s strength in the polls, citing the fact that during his first mayoral campaign Adams also trailed entrepreneur Andrew Yang. \u201cSo in February, Andrew was kicking my rear. And you know what? We don\u2019t say Mayor Yang. We say Mayor Adams,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, polls don\u2019t make mayors. People do.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Will this man suffer to pay for Trump\u2019s tax cuts? Photo: Thomas Barwick/Getty Images\n\nAdminister truth serum to any rock-ribbed True Conservative, and odds are you\u2019ll find a deep (if often suppressed) desire to take a sledgehammer to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Both were perennial targets of the great austerity-budget advocate Paul Ryan during his years as House Budget Committee chairman and then as House Speaker (not to mention 2012 vice-presidential nominee). Much more recently, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership report (you know, the one Trump claimed he knew nothing about but that clearly shaped most of his first steps as the 47th president) referred to Medicare and Medicaid as \u201cthe principal drivers of our $31 trillion national debt.\u201d Medicare, of course, which provides health insurance and other critical benefits to the nation\u2019s seniors, is legendarily a political third rail. So Republican politicians, sometimes with fingers crossed behind their backs, frequently promise not to cut Medicare or its cash-benefit counterpart, Social Security. You can see that promise in Agenda 47, Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign platform.\n\nPrecisely because Medicare is so popular, Republicans who are seeking money to pay for tax cuts or to reduce the size of government often focus their wrath on Medicaid, the federal-state program that mostly provides health insurance to low-income people. That\u2019s what Republicans tried to do in their narrowly unsuccessful Obamacare repeal legislation the last time Trump was president, and this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson will urge Republicans to pass a budget blueprint guaranteeing another assault on Medicaid.\n\nBut Medicaid is very important to those who use it (eligibility varies to a considerable extent by state). As health-policy expert Jonathan Cohn points out, that\u2019s a lot of people; at least 70 million Americans are on Medicaid:\n\nGOP proposals [to cut Medicaid in 2017] provoked an outcry from people who stood to lose coverage \u2015 not just working adults, but also senior citizens and people with disabilities, many of whom rely on Medicaid to pay for home care or nursing homes.\n\nThat coalition today is, if anything, bigger than it was back then. Something like two-thirds of Americans have been on Medicaid or have a family member who has been, according to surveys from the research organization KFF. It has also become a financial lifeline for the health care industry, especially hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income residents.\n\nSo now, Republicans are using their traditional tactic of not acknowledging that Medicaid cuts are Medicaid cuts. Even as his congressional allies debated exactly how much money to wring from the program to help pay for Trump\u2019s border-security and tax-cut demands, Trump himself told Sean Hannity in an interview, \u201cMedicare, Medicaid \u2014 none of that stuff is going to be touched.\u201d Later, the White House \u201cclarified\u201d his remarks by saying the administration sought to protect Medicaid \u201cwhile slashing the waste, fraud and abuse within the program.\u201d Following suit, Johnson blandly asserted that the $800 billion or so in Medicaid savings he\u2019s expecting the relevant House committee to produce will come out of \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d\n\nSome House Republicans are calling b.s. on that chestnut, as Politico reports, quoting Texas congressman Tony Gonzales:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s waste, fraud and abuse in every program in the government, including Medicaid \u2014 but at what point do you stop cutting into the fat and start cutting into the bone? You can\u2019t pull the rug out from millions of people.\u201d\n\nGonzales, who has a large constituency enrolled in the program, already co-authored a letter with seven other House Republicans representing large Hispanic populations asking Johnson to rethink where the GOP is headed on Medicaid. And he said he plans to personally confront the speaker about the issue at a scheduled meeting tonight.\n\nJohnson can only afford to lose one House Republican vote and still pass his budget blueprint. While these Medicaid protectors in the House are generally described as \u201cmoderates,\u201d a warning against deep Medicaid cuts was also issued by MAGA senator Josh Hawley.\n\nWhat stratagems might Johnson & Co. adopt to cut Medicaid spending without directly cutting Medicaid benefits? The most obvious is a Medicaid \u201cwork requirement,\u201d which some states adopted during the first Trump administration without significant results, other than burdening people already working (a big majority of those on Medicaid) with documentation requirements and also afflicting those with caregiving responsibilities. But it\u2019s entirely possible Republicans will redeploy past proposals that don\u2019t cut out \u201cwaste\u201d but instead shift cost responsibilities to the states, such as the per capita cap on federal Medicaid payments that was part of the 2017 Obamacare-repeal legislation, or a Medicaid \u201cblock grant\u201d designed as a way station to a complete state takeover.\n\nSo we could see a Republican revolt against major Medicaid cuts now when they are just in the \u201cblueprint\u201d phase (legislation implementing them will come in the spring or summer), or a battle that flares up before they are final. One thing that\u2019s clear is that Medicaid is tangible and affects an awful lot of people and their representatives in Washington. There\u2019s nothing abstract about fighting Medicaid cuts, particularly when they can accurately be described as being executed to pay for tax cuts for Trump\u2019s billionaire friends. So it very much could become and remain a flash point."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 The House adopted a budget proposal on Tuesday that paves the way for implementing President Trump's legislative agenda, handing a major victory to House Speaker Mike Johnson who had been trying to sway a small number of holdouts in the final hours before the vote.\n\nRepublicans narrowly adopted the resolution in a 217-215 vote with no Democratic support and only one GOP defection \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. With one Democrat absent, Johnson could afford to lose just one GOP vote. Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio, Victoria Spartz of Indiana and Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who had said they would not vote for the resolution, ultimately caved.\n\n\"We got it done,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the resolution's adoption. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We are going to deliver the American first agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step in that process.\"\n\nHouse GOP leadership stalled bringing up the resolution for more than an hour then appeared to pull the vote, before bringing the bill back up minutes later. The House Democratic Whip's Office said Republicans had assured Democrats there would be no further votes before it was brought back up.\n\nJohnson worked the phones with Mr. Trump to persuade holdouts to vote for the package that would enact Mr. Trump's massive defense, border security, energy and tax agenda. At one point before the vote, the House leader huddled in the back of the chamber with Spartz, Burchett and Massie, before leaving the floor with Spartz, who had had a phone to her ear.\n\nThe president was a \"big help,\" Johnson said. He added that he didn't make any commitments to holdouts to get them to flip to yes, saying \"we just got everybody to yes.\"\n\nJohnson has been racing to move forward with the resolution, a crucial step in the budget reconciliation process, after House Republican infighting spurred the Senate to forge ahead with a competing plan earlier this month. Johnson won a key victory last week when Mr. Trump endorsed his chamber's budget outline.\n\nThe House GOP budget plan instructs committees to craft legislation that would cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and at least $1.5 trillion in spending, while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back, according to an amendment to the resolution that was added to appease conservatives.\n\nHouse Democrats widely oppose the measure, and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, wrote a letter to his caucus on Monday telling them \"it's imperative that we are present with maximum attendance.\"\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, who gave birth a month ago in her home state, flew to Washington with her newborn son to vote against the resolution. Rep. Kevin Mullin of California, who has been battling a blood clot and infection after recent knee surgery, also made the vote.\n\n\"We had Kevin Mullin literally leave a hospital bed in California, travel here with an IV on the airplane, because he knows how important this vote is,\" said Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the minority whip.\n\n\"Brittany Pettersen is on maternity leave, but she understood on behalf of her constituents and the American people how important it was to be there,\" Jeffries said.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, was the sole absence. The Arizona Democrat has been battling cancer.\n\nDemocrats have warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits that could be pursued in the budget reconciliation process. The resolution tasks relevant committees with finding billions of dollars in cuts, some of which could target Medicaid, which has prompted concern among some Republicans, especially in battleground districts.\n\n\"This is the very beginning of the process, and they struggled until the very end, Democrats were unified, and we will remain unified throughout this process, because this reckless Republican budget will bring nothing but destruction to the American people,\" Jeffries said.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York was among the Republicans worried about Medicaid cuts, but she met with Johnson on Monday and said he assured her that Medicaid recipients would not be removed from the rolls \"unless they are not fulfilling the work requirements, and they're not citizens.\"\n\nHouse Republican leadership pushed back on the Medicaid concerns on Tuesday, calling it a Democratic talking point. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota said the budget resolution \"merely unlocks the opportunity for committees to begin drafting legislation,\" calling it a \"blueprint to save America.\" And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that the vote is simply one to begin the reconciliation process.\n\nStill, Johnson wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues, and the budget resolution instructs the committee overseeing Medicaid to find $800 billion in cuts. Johnson said cuts to the program would target \"fraud.\"\n\n\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" Johnson said, when asked whether there could be cuts to the program down the line. \"What we're talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste and abuse.\"\n\nThe House vote came after the Senate adopted its budget late last week, while the House was away on recess. Since Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House resolution, Senate Republicans have billed their own budget plan as a backup. The Senate plan would divide the reconciliation process into two bills, with the first aimed at quickly delivering resources for border security and defense, while a later bill would tackle the tax priorities. Senate Republicans also want to make the tax cuts permanent, which the House version does not do.\n\nand contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nDon\u2019t be shocked or awed. The daily explosion of chaos and confusion emanating from the White House during the first month of the new Trump administration is a political strategy intended to minimize accountability by leaving the president\u2019s critics demoralized, distracted, and disoriented, unable to figure out which battles should be fought.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like drinking from a fire hose,\u201d Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia told the New York Times a week after Trump took office. That\u2019s putting it mildly. Daily reports of federal workers being summarily fired by the thousands are running side by side with tales of businessman Elon Musk and his DOGE team ransacking databases and making wild, unproven, and inaccurate claims of government fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration is openly siding with Russia against Ukraine and actively undermining the NATO alliance; trying to drum transgender warriors out of the military; preparing a purge of FBI agents who investigated the January 6 insurrection; weathering an internal mini-revolt at the Justice Department caused by its attempt to rescue Mayor Eric Adams from corruption charges; and, of course, launching a mass deportation campaign.\n\nAll along the way, we\u2019ve seen a steady stream of cheap distractions like Trump renaming the Gulf of Mexico, vowing to eliminate the penny, or pretending to take over the U.S. Postal Service. The official White House social accounts recently posted an image of Trump wearing a crown and proclaiming \u201cLong Live the King.\u201d\n\nSeparating what\u2019s serious from what\u2019s nonsense has not been easy. Congressional Democrats have their work cut out for them, and so do all of us members of the media, who are a primary target of the chaos strategy. \u201cThe Democrats don\u2019t matter,\u201d MAGA operative Steve Bannon told a reporter back in 2018. \u201cThe real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\u201d In a 2019 Frontline interview, he elaborated: \u201cThe opposition party is the media, [and] because they\u2019re dumb and they\u2019re lazy, they can only focus on one thing at a time. \u2026 And all we have to do is flood the zone. Every day we hit them with three things, they\u2019ll bite on one, and we\u2019ll get all of our stuff done. Bang, bang, bang. These guys will never be able to recover.\u201d\n\nEvery self-respecting journalist should take Bannon\u2019s insult as a professional challenge. Those of us working the political beat \u2014 whether in small towns, big cities, remote statehouses, or the White House \u2014 regularly encounter efforts at media misdirection cooked up by slimy, amoral operatives, shady politicians, and the bombastic businessmen who fund them. The stakes are higher this time, but the game has never changed. And political journalists, who are (mostly) neither dumb nor lazy, need to rise to the occasion.\n\nThat starts with identifying \u2014 and downplaying \u2014 sucker bait like Trump\u2019s mid\u2013Super Bowl announcement that he had \u201cinstructed my Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\u201d It might be tempting to churn out stories about how each new penny costs 3.7 cents to produce, but there\u2019s no need, because according to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, only Congress has the power \u201cto coin Money [and] regulate the Value thereof.\u201d So \u201cTrump kills the penny\u201d is a non-story or, at best, a half-story unless it looks like Congress is preparing to take action (they aren\u2019t).\n\nWhenever Trump or his aides start blowing smoke, the question to ask is: What are they trying to hide? In my opinion, the most important story to focus on \u2014 the one that they want us all to ignore \u2014 is the shocking, open corruption and self-dealing by Musk and the Trump family.\n\nA few days before his inauguration, Trump launched a crypto meme coin, $TRUMP, that has no intrinsic value but quickly soared in price. Trump\u2019s stake, on paper, reached $58 billion for a short time before the price collapsed. That was a hint of things to come.\n\nTrump\u2019s conflicts of interest include his stake in Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent group of Truth Social. It\u2019s the largest source of Trump\u2019s wealth, and as a publicly traded company, notes the Times, \u201cwhile foreigners are not allowed by law to make campaign contributions to Mr. Trump, there is no limit on their ability to buy large chunks of stock in his company, perhaps in an effort to intentionally push up the stock\u2019s value and further enrich the Trump family.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s opportunity for a money grab is even more obvious. His companies have been awarded or promised $21 billion in federal contracts since 2008, including more than $20 billion paid or promised by NASA to Musk\u2019s SpaceX company and $5.6 billion promised by the Department of Defense, with a maximum future payout of $32.8 billion, according to the Independent.\n\nMusk is set to begin probing the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has fined him and Tesla and is investigating alleged wrongdoing connected to Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter in 2022. The billionaire and his operatives are also scouring data and recommending changes at the USDA and the Labor Department, which have investigated Musk\u2019s companies.\n\nAnd it was Musk who gleefully announced he had dismantled the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which regulates digital payment systems like the one Musk wants to turn X into. He has also challenged the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board, which regulates the right to form unions and previously clashed with the billionaire over his treatment of employees.\n\nAll news reports about the Trump-Musk dismantling of our government should include phrases like \u201cthe businessman, whose companies currently hold billions of dollars in government contracts from the very agencies he is probing\u201d or \u201cMusk, who stands to make money by weakening the agencies that regulate his private business.\u201d And White House claims that the self-dealing billionaire is engaged in an honest, disinterested search for waste and fraud should be challenged or ignored.\n\nThe response to Trump and Musk from every newsroom in the country should be to flood the zone with truth."

            "full_content": "In one of many sweeping changes to the functioning of the federal government, reports suggest that President Trump plans to take control over yet another independent agency, the U.S. Postal Service. Not content to have his handpicked postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, a holdover from the first Trump presidency, in place, Trump has signaled a desire to fundamentally alter the agency by bringing the service under direct executive branch control within the Commerce Department.\n\nThe purported goal of such a takeover is to make it operate with greater efficiency. But any Trump-controlled version will just bring us closer toward post office privatization, or serve as a means by which the administration could control a critical channel of communication among Americans that has largely protected our privacy for centuries.\n\nThe Post Office Act helped spread commerce and civic associations that were the lifeblood of the nation in the early 19th century.\n\nThis storied system, warts and all, predates the republic. It needs to remain free and independent, and must continue to serve as a lifeline to communities, not just another means through which the president can exert further control over America\u2019s communications and reward his political supporters.\n\nIn the 1770s, prior to the \u201cofficial\u201d start of the American Revolution, the upstart Continental Congress knew the value of a functioning and free postal system, creating what they called a \u201cconstitutional\u201d postal system that would enable them to communicate throughout the colonies without fear that their letters would be opened by loyalist postmasters. The Founders then wrote into Article I of the Constitution: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power to establish Post Offices and post Roads.\u201d\n\nIn October 1791, President George Washington transmitted his third annual address to Congress. In it, he stressed that a strong and modern postal system would spread \u201cknowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government,\u201d and protect the people \u201cagainst the effects of misrepresentation and misconception.\u201d\n\nCongress would then pass the Postal Act of 1792 that didn\u2019t just create the system as authorized by the Constitution, it also baked into the law the privacy of our communications, set mail rates and allowed lower rates for newspapers. Like Washington, James Madison believed a strong and effective postal system would ensure that \u201call virtuous Citizens\u201d would understand \u201cevery salutary public measure\u201d taken by government officials. It would give such citizens \u201cconfidence\u201d in their elected representative and ensure the population\u2019s \u201ccooperation with\u201d government actions.\n\nWhat is more, the Post Office Act encouraged the growth of the postal system and helped spread commerce and civic associations that were the lifeblood of the nation in the early 19th century.\n\nAt the end of John Adams\u2019 term as president, the nation had already created over 900 post offices, with over 21,000 miles of post roads. That system would continue to grow, and several decades later, the American postal system was larger than that of England, France and Russia at the time. Given its breadth and reach into virtually every community in the new country, for many Americans the postal system was the federal government, and its workforce rivaled even that of the standing army.\n\nToday, the USPS is the largest civilian employer in the government, with roughly 600,000 workers, many of them holding civil service and union jobs.\n\nThe postal system has been a political flashpoint at different moments in our nation\u2019s history. Andrew Jackson threatened to censor abolitionist tracts sent over the mails into slave states, claiming such information would result in a slave revolt. In the 20th century, during World War I and the later McCarthy era, law enforcement engaged in surveillance of those suspected of disloyalty to the nation.\n\nThe postal system was also no stranger to corruption, and charges of nepotism and political cronyism led to passage of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 that made the U.S. Post Office an independent agency, to prevent it from being used for nefarious political purposes.\n\nToday, the USPS is the largest civilian employer in the government, with roughly 600,000 workers.\n\nThe post office of the 19th century was often found in a dry goods store or other, similar commercial establishment in far-flung rural communities, serving as a hub of information and connecting such communities to the larger nation. Today, the postal system and post offices, in particular, continue to serve for many as their connection to loved ones and the economy. Low-income people without ties to financial institutions use the post office to obtain money orders to pay their rent and utility bills.\n\nBringing the Post Office under direct control of the executive branch would make crippling it even easier, lead to the destruction of the civil service and union protections of its hundreds of thousands of workers, and open the door for companies, like Amazon \u2014 that both deals in e-commerce for itself and other e-commerce companies, and whose CEO has been cozying up to and palling around with the president of late \u2014 to have a field day. They could raise rates and fill in the void created by a severely weakened postal system.\n\nSuch a system would also serve, like the colonial postal system, as a source of surveillance and monitoring of the president\u2019s critics.\n\nShould the president take such an action, which would defy the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, it will invite lawsuits that are likely to prevail. Like with so much else the administration is doing, however, that specter does not seem likely to prevent such action. But the courts can, and should, protect this critical and independent American institution on which many rely and in which many place their trust.\n\nAlthough not perfect, it is still better than any alternative the Trump administration might come up with, which is likely to be simple privatization and would leave Americans at the mercy of the private companies that would seek to step into the void. In this instance, like democracy, a free and independent postal system may not be the best possible system, it is just superior to any possible alternative that has been tried."

            "full_content": "Hours after his party\u2019s victory in Germany\u2019s federal elections, likely incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz began to soften his stance on immigration as he looks to form a coalition with leftist parties rather than the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany.\n\nWhile Merz campaigned as a supposed immigration hardliner, the successor to Angela Merkel as the leader of the Christian Democrats and the likely next leader of the country appears to be following the tradition of notionally right-wing politicians abandoning their election-time promises once the votes have been counted.\n\nAhead of the election, Merz put forward a plan to increase deportations and enact strict border restrictions to prevent illegal migrants from entering Germany from other EU nations, including those who claim to be asylum seekers. He argued that such restrictions should be made permanent and was joined in a controversial vote by the AfD. However, after winning the election on Sunday, Merz said that such measures should only be \u201ctemporary\u201d, broadcaster NTV reports.\n\n\u201cNone of us wants to close the borders,\u201d Merz claimed on Monday in a blatant attempt to court the establishment leftist Social Democrats to form a new government. During the campaign, the leftist parties argued that enacting border controls with its neighbours would be a violation of EU rules and, therefore, refused to support his plan.\n\nThe SPD was roundly rejected by German voters on Sunday, the party suffering its worst electoral loss since the Second World War. For the first time, it has come third place rather than first or second, possibly heralding the very end of the two-party system. Nevertheless, Merz appears intent on continuing the \u201cfirewall\u201d around the AfD, in which establishment parties in Berlin refuse to work with the populist-right party.\n\nThis likely means Merz will need to temper his positions to court the Social Democrats. Indeed, SPD leader Lars Klingbeil said on Monday that he expects that \u201cMerz will change his course and his tone significantly\u201d from the campaign if he hopes to form a government with the left-wing party. The SPD will also likely look to pressure Merz to ignore Germany\u2019s limits on debt, as it seeks to expand welfare and funding for Ukraine.\n\nShould Merz succeed in wooing the ousted SPD back into government with his CDU, it would mark the return of the so-called \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that governed the country during the European Migrant Crisis of 2015, which was facilitated in large part by the then-Angela Merkel-led government in Berlin.\n\nAfD leader Alice Weidel branded the likely chancellor\u2019s comments as an acknowledgement of \u201celection fraud\u201d from the CDU leader, saying that he \u201cthrew all his election promises overboard.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Merz] no longer wants to close the borders and wants to talk to the Greens and SPD about reforming the debt brake. This is politics against the will of the voters!\u201d\n\nThe issue of migration played a central role in the collapse of the former left-wing government, with a string of migrant terror attacks breaking out across Germany over the past year, including in Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg, and Munich.\n\nAfter Merz doubled down on his pledge to seek a coalition with the SPD rather than with the AfD, Weidel predicted that Merz would become merely an \u201cinterim\u201d chancellor and that his government would not last its full term, given that it would have to bend to the leftist agenda that voters rejected on Sunday.\n\nMerz is also facing challenge from within his own party, with powerful Minister-President of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik W\u00fcst calling for a significant increase in deportations, saying: \u201cWe need full planes every week that take people to where they are already entitled to an asylum procedure in Europe.\u201d\n\nW\u00fcst argued that Berlin needs to take the lead in reforming EU immigration policy, including increased external border protections, the registration of people who enter the bloc, and particularly the Dublin Regulation which stipulates that supposed refugees should apply for asylum in the first EU nation they arrive in.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just let it continue like this at random,\u201d he said."

            "full_content": "It is difficult if not impossible to parody that which has already become a parody of itself. And perhaps, when taking the measure of last weekend\u2019s Principles First conference in downtown Washington, parody isn\u2019t quite the right register to sound. Disgust will do just fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Principles First summit bills itself as the anti-MAGA alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. As such, the timing of the summit, which on Sunday afternoon was briefly interrupted by a bomb scare, was not accidental. A few miles south, across the river from Alexandria, CPAC was underway. Vice President J.D. Vance, fresh off giving our European friends a lesson on how self-styled democracies ought to behave, was greeted with a hero\u2019s welcome. By comparison, the star power at Principles First was decidedly second rate\u2014dinner theater for DeSantis die-hards.\n\nThe lineup of guest speakers was a who\u2019s who of a Republican Party that thankfully no longer exists.\n\nAmong the headliners was arch-neocon Bill Kristol. Kristol has been a fixture on the speakers and podcast circuit in the years since Rupert Murdoch shut down his neoconservative rag, The Weekly Standard. As Tucker Carlson once observed, \u201cUnder ordinary circumstances, Bill Kristol would be famous for being wrong.\u201d But credit where it is due, he\u2019s taken that talent and turned himself into the country\u2019s premier NeverTrump grifter.\n\nIn the eyes of the self-styled defenders of the republic such as those who gathered at the Principles First conference, Kristol isn\u2019t among the leading villains of our recent and blood-soaked past but a source of solace. He reassures his dwindling conservative followers that the age of Trump is an aberration\u2014the country has momentarily taken leave of its senses\u2014and we, the true elite, only have to wait out the Barbarians.\n\nJoining this esteemed company was none other than former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. After dropping out of the Republican presidential race in February 2016, he wormed his way back into Trump\u2019s good graces. By May of 2016 he was named chairman of Trump\u2019s presidential transition team. Yet when the governor was unceremoniously shown the door, Trump went from being a potential meal ticket to, in Christie\u2019s telling, a \"coward\" a \"puppet of Putin\u201d and \u201cthe cheapest S.O.B. I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work for Christie who, after illegally closing down the approach to the George Washington Bridge in 2013, hung his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, a single mother of four, out to dry. She served 13 months in prison. He ran for president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Alberto Gonzales. For an organization which bills itself as one in opposition to lawlessness and an out-of-control chief executive, the inclusion of Gonzales, former attorney general under George W. Bush, is really a bit of a head scratcher. According to the human rights attorney Scott Horton, even a cursory inventory of the crimes committed by Gonzales would include \u201cperjury, violations of the Hatch Act, misrepresentations to Congress, suborning perjury and obstruction of justice,\u201d to say nothing of his role \u201cin the introduction of torture into intelligence interrogation practices in violation of the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Convention on Land Warfare.\u201d\n\nThere were of course the usual suspects from the Conservatism Inc. echo chamber. Alumni from the ill-fated Weekly Standard who now run under the banners of The Bulwark and The Dispatch were among the featured guests. Stephen Hayes, author of a 2004 book about the alleged \u201cconnection\u201d between Obama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein appeared alongside Jonah Goldberg, another purveyor, in the early years of the War on Terror, of the conspiracy theory that Iraq\u2019s leader and al Qaeda were in cahoots. Goldberg lectured the audience about the importance of truth in politics.\n\nAt some point, it gets to be enough already.\n\nThese ghosts of GOP past have, since 2016, with the enthusiastic help of corporate and legacy media outlets such as CNN and MSNBC, laundered their reputations and emerged as lonely, courageous and principled defenders of the American constitutional order\u2014but only after having spent most of the last 25 years doing their level best to trash it.\n\nThe real reason these people fell out with Trump was because they perceived him not as a threat to the constitution but as a threat to their careers. Look at Christie and the super-hawk John Bolton. These opportunists looked at Trump with stars in their eyes when he gave them a seat at the table\u2014but once he pulled the chair out from under them, they became his most vociferous opponents. You\u2019d have to be about as clueless as former Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah (who, as it happens, was another honored guest at Principles First) to think there\u2019s anything more at work at one of these confabs than grievance\u2014grievance that Trump took away their party without so much as breaking a sweat.\n\nThe backdrop to these cross-town conferences is the brewing battle over Elbridge Colby \u2014 whose confirmation as undersecretary of defense for policy is being contested by the Ghosts of Republican Party Past.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s Zombie Caucus, including Senators Mitch McConnell, Roger Wicker, Lisa Murkowski and of course, the very same members of Conservatism Inc. that brought us, among other niceties, Iraq, Guantanamo, torture, black sites, ISIS, and a new and dangerous nuclear arms race, are determined to derail Colby for being insufficiently in awe of neoconservatism\u2019s track record since 9/11.\n\nThe problem facing the Zombie Caucus is that even in the event they are able to block Colby their brand of Republicanism has about as much popular appeal as another Christie presidential run: zero.\n\nMeanwhile, As Politico pointed out last week, Vance and other administration officials are sending \u201ca clear message to the world that Republican foreign policy as they have known it is dead \u2014 and they\u2019re not sorry about it.\u201d\n\nLooks like the undead at Principles First have yet to get the memo."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal judge has indefinitely blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender service members, dealing a major defeat to a controversial policy the president resurrected from his first term.\n\nIn a scathing ruling, US District Judge Ana Reyes said the administration cannot enforce the ban \u2014 which was set to take effect later this month.\n\nReyes, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote that the ban \u201cis soaked in animus and dripping with pretext. Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2013 some risking their lives \u2013 to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe judge said she was pausing her preliminary injunction until Friday morning to give the administration time to appeal it to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by transgender active-duty service members and others hoping to enlist in the military who would be barred from service under the ban. Reyes said they had shown that they would likely succeed on their claim that the ban violated rights afforded to them by the Constitution.\n\nDays after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directing the Pentagon to implement its own policies that say transgender service members are incompatible with military service. The government had argued that continuing to permit trans individuals to serve in the US would negatively affect, among other things, the military\u2019s lethality, readiness and cohesion.\n\n\u201cDefendants have not provided a legitimate reason for banning all transgender troops,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Defense Department for comment.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued that the president had broad authority to determine who can serve in the military, but Reyes rejected that argument in her ruling, writing: \u201cThe President has the power \u2014 indeed the obligation \u2014 to ensure military readiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt times, however, leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons,\u201d Reyes continued. \u201cFirst minorities, then women in combat, then gays filled in that blank. Today, however, our military is stronger and our Nation is safer for the millions of such blanks (and all other persons) who serve.\u201d\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, a similar ban he issued in 2017 that drew at least four lawsuits arguing the prohibition represented an unconstitutional form of sex discrimination. Federal district courts across the nation temporarily blocked the ban from taking effect. Judges from Washington, DC, to Washington state said that it violated the constitutional rights of transgender people.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, let the ban take effect in 2019, but did not rule on whether it was constitutional before President Joe Biden reversed it in 2021.\n\nLate last month, the Pentagon released its guidance implementing Trump\u2019s order. The guidance said the military would kick out transgender service members who don\u2019t meet specific requirements under its new policy.\n\n\u201cService members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria will be processed for separation from military service,\u201d said a memo outlining the new policy, which was signed by the official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\n\n\u201cThe Department only recognizes two sexes: male and female,\u201d the policy memo says. \u201cAn individual\u2019s sex is immutable, unchanging during a person\u2019s life. All service members will only serve in accordance with their sex.\u201d\n\nAt the time, a senior defense official said there are 4,240 service members across active-duty, reserve, and the National Guard with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, defined as the psychological distress an individual feels when their gender identity differs from their gender at birth. But not every transgender individual has gender dysphoria.\n\nThe official said that approximately 1,000 service members have received gender-affirming surgery between 2014 and 2025.\n\nReyes\u2019 ruling was quickly hailed by the lawyers representing the ban\u2019s challengers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decisive ruling speaks volumes,\u201d said Jennifer Levi, an attorney with GLAD Law. \u201cThe Court\u2019s unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the Court\u2019s clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Haley Britzky contributed to this report."

Plus, Lawrence Hurley reports on a rare rebuke of the president from the chief justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f We want to hear from you!\n\nHave a question for the NBC News Politics Desk on the flurry of Trump administration moves, Elon Musk and DOGE\u2019s activity, what comes next on Capitol Hill, or our new poll?\n\nSend your questions to politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com and we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter.\n\nThe gap within the gender gap\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nIn last year\u2019s presidential election, white voters made up an estimated 71% of the national electorate. That\u2019s a number that for decades has trended downward as the country\u2019s population has diversified, but it\u2019s still more than six times larger than the share of Black and Hispanic voters (11% each) and nearly 25 times that of Asian voters (3%).\n\nTypically, the white vote is understood as being Republican-friendly, with pronounced gender and education gaps.\n\nBut there is a more useful \u2014 and revealing \u2014 way to understand the politics of white voters, something that is evident in the new NBC News poll. Call this the gap within the gap.\n\nIt represents a layering of the education gap (which has exploded during the Trump era) on top of the more established gender gap. When these are combined, a gaping chasm emerges \u2014 and two specific groups come into focus.\n\nOn one end are white men without four-year college degrees. This is a generally blue-collar demographic that is now deeply aligned with Trump and opposed to progressive politics. On the other end are white women with at least a four-year college degree. This is a more affluent demographic that has been racing leftward, particularly on cultural issues, and is squarely opposed to President Donald Trump.\n\nBoth groups pack a formidable punch. Eighteen percent of all voters last year were non-college white men and 17% were college-educated white women. And they have come to exist in polar opposite political and cultural universes, each one unrelatable and probably unrecognizable to the other.\n\nThis is captured vividly in the NBC News poll. Take a basic question: Do voters have a positive or negative view of Trump? Among all voters \u2014 regardless of race, gender or class \u2014 46% have a positive view and 49% a negative one. Among white voters only, Trump is a bit more popular: 52% have a positive opinion compared with 45% who have a negative opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, 69% of white men without a degree view Trump positively and just 28% see him negatively \u2014 a 41-point net-positive rating. And among white women with a degree, it\u2019s 29% positive and 67% negative \u2014 for a net-negative of 38 points. That adds up to a whopping 79-point net rating gap between these two groups when it comes to their perception of Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to the various aspects of Trump\u2019s job performance, the splits are just as massive.\n\nMore from the NBC News poll: American voters are deeply divided on DEI programs and political correctness, by Bridget Bowman\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pushes back against calls to impeach judges who rule against Trump\n\nBy Lawrence Hurley\n\nChief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement today rebuking President Donald Trump and his allies for calling to impeach judges who have ruled against the administration.\n\n\u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\u201d Roberts said in a statement.\n\nTrump allies have called for various judges to be impeached for blocking administration policies in the first months of his second term.\n\nBut Trump himself raised the stakes on Tuesday, when he called for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg after he blocked the deportation of Venezuelan migrants.\n\n\u201cThis judge, like many of the Crooked Judges\u2019 I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d Trump posted.\n\nSoon after Roberts issued his statement, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, wrote in a post on X that he had introduced articles of impeachment against Boasberg. He claimed Boasberg had committed an impeachable offense by issuing a temporary restraining order against the administration over its novel invocation of a wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport certain illegal immigrants.\n\nWhile a handful of federal judges have been removed from office in the past, it has been because of gross misconduct in office, such as taking bribes, not as a result of individual decisions they have made.\n\nFederal judges have frequently intervened on Trump\u2019s agenda since he took office again in January and began implementing a set of aggressive policies that have raised several novel legal issues. That has angered the administration and the broader MAGA base, leading to increasingly frequent calls for impeachment and raising concerns within the judiciary.\n\nRead more from Lawrence \u2192\n\nRelated: DOJ refuses to answer some questions from the judge who blocked Alien Enemies Act deportations, by Gary Grumbach, Chloe Atkins and Dareh Gregorian\n\nExplainer: How Congress could \u2014 but probably won\u2019t \u2014 impeach a federal judge, by Frank Thorp V, Kyle Stewart and Lawrence Hurley\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \u27a1\ufe0f Gaza ceasefire collapses: Israel\u2019s military launched the deadliest strikes on the Gaza Strip since the agreement of its ceasefire with Hamas, killing hundreds of people and threatening to compromise the fragile truce.

            "full_content": "Trump and Musk in the hypermasculine world of UFC. Photo: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nArguments over how Trump won and Democrats lost in 2024 remain in the background of today\u2019s political discourse: Trump fans are focused on exaggerating the size and significance of the GOP victory, and Democrats are mostly settling scores with one another. But there\u2019s also some serious analysis of hard data underway. And this week, an election diagnosis from Blue Rose Research\u2019s David Shor, who was interviewed by Vox\u2019s Eric Levitz and the New York Times\u2019 Ezra Klein, is drawing particular attention.\n\nMuch of Shor\u2019s findings confirm the conventional wisdom about how Trump won in 2024, including three main points: (1) Trump made significant gains as compared to his 2020 performance among Black, Latino, Asian American, immigrant and under-30 voters; (2) Trump did better among marginally engaged voters than did Kamala Harris, reversing an ancient assumption that Democrats would benefit from relatively high turnout; and (3) inflation was the overriding issue among persuadable voters, even as Democrats overemphasized the threat to democracy posed by Trump\u2019s return to power.\n\nIt\u2019s Shor\u2019s explanation of why these trends occurred that\u2019s most interesting. Among every Trump-trending slice of the electorate, unique pressures related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic inflation that followed undermined support for the incumbent Democratic Party. But there were some other things going on. For example, the non-white-voters trends reflected, Shor told Levitz, a delayed ideological polarization that had hit white voters decades ago:\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nTo put it another way, non-white voters were disproportionately loyal to the Democratic Party for many years, and that loyalty inevitably began to wear off. The intense ideological polarization of the 2024 election sped that process along, even though one might expect that Trump\u2019s barely concealed racism and overt nativism would slow it down. Why didn\u2019t they? Mostly, Shor suggests, because Trump-trending voters weren\u2019t viewing or reading media coverage of the 45th president\u2019s horrific views and conduct:\n\nPeople who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They\u2019re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it\u2019s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don\u2019t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nThe massive impact of diverse media consumption is most evident in Shor\u2019s analysis of the single-most-stunning finding about the 2024 results: the huge gender gap among young voters, with Trump doing exceptionally well among young men, as he explained to Klein:\n\n18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics \u2026\n\nIf you look at zoomers, there are some really interesting ways that they\u2019re very different in the data. They\u2019re much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them.\n\nIf I were going to speculate, I\u2019d say phones and social media have a lot to do with this.\n\nKlein suggests some very specific points of divergence between young men and young women that Shor agrees with entirely:\n\nIt seems plausible to me that social media and online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get. If you\u2019re a 23-year-old man interested in the Ultimate Fighting Championship and online, you\u2019re being driven into a very intensely male online world.\n\nWhereas, if you\u2019re a 23-year-old female and your interests align with what the YouTube algorithm codes, you are not entering that world. You\u2019re actually entering the opposite world. You\u2019re seeing Bren\u00e9 Brown and all these other things.\n\nFinally, Shor provides some definitive evidence that Democratic messaging about Trump\u2019s anti-democratic characteristics fell on rocky ground. By an astonishing 78 percent to 18 percent margin, voters said \u201cdelivering change that improves Americans\u2019 lives\u201d was more important than \u201cpreserving America\u2019s institutions.\u201d This finding suggests that in 2024, and right now, Democrats should exploit Trump\u2019s broken promises about the economy and other practical concerns instead of focusing on how Trump has broken those promises. This isn\u2019t a binary choice as much as a perspective on how to talk about outrages like Elon Musk\u2019s assault on the federal government, which negatively affects the benefits and services Americans rely on and is intended to benefit Musk\u2019s fellow plutocrats via skewed tax cuts and paralysis of corporate oversight, as Shor told Levitz:\n\nTrump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party \u2014 namely, they\u2019re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they\u2019re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It\u2019s Paul Ryan\u2013ism on steroids.\n\nSo, in office, Trump may be undermining the very trends that made his 2024 comeback possible. That\u2019s important to know."

            "full_content": "Photo: Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nAs it turns out, there may be some unintended consequences to telling the world that you once got so high on magic mushrooms that you thought Courteney Cox\u2019s toilet had turned into a head, which then talked to you as you were peeing in it.\n\nIn his memoir, Spare, Prince Harry admitted to doing various recreational drugs including marijuana, cocaine, and several psychedelics. The British royal probably didn\u2019t think this was a big deal, as he is not an elected official, we\u2019re well past the \u201cI didn\u2019t inhale\u201d era, and he spilled lots of far juicier gossip in the book.\n\nBut in March 2023, two months after his memoir was released, the Heritage Foundation raised concerns that Harry may have lied on his visa application when he moved to the U.S. in 2020, responding to questions about current and past drug use that all applicants must answer. The conservative think tank behind Project 2025 tried to obtain Harry\u2019s immigration records under the Freedom of Information act. The Department of Homeland Security denied the request, so the Heritage Foundation sued.\n\nNow, after a lengthy legal battle, Harry\u2019s records are set to be released. On Saturday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled in favor of the Heritage Foundation, ordering the Department of Homeland Security to release redacted versions of Harry\u2019s immigration documents by the end of the day on Tuesday.\n\nTheoretically, Prince Harry could be in trouble with immigration authorities if he lied on his application, as CBS News explains:\n\nAdmission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S..\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t seem very likely that Harry, who lives in California with his American wife, Meghan Markle, and their two young children, is going to be deported.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation said all along that it was pursuing Prince Harry\u2019s files to make a broader point about the Department of Homeland Security allegedly giving certain people preferential treatment under the Biden administration, as CNN reported:\n\nAttorneys for the Heritage Foundation see the case as part of a larger effort to uncover non-compliance with the law by DHS in different areas \u2013 including accusations from Republican lawmakers that DHS is \u201cdeliberately refusing to enforce the Country\u2019s immigration laws and is responsible for the current crisis at the border,\u201d court filings read.\n\n\u201cThis is a case that concerns Prince Harry, but what it\u2019s focused on is DHS\u2019s conduct,\u201d Dewey previously said.\n\nThese comments were made in 2023, and obviously a lot has changed since then. The second Trump administration is already cracking down on immigration, with ICE even sweeping up some U.S. visa and green-card holders. Meanwhile, the president is floating the idea of a new \u201cTrump gold card\u201d visa program that would give \u201cvery high-level people\u201d a new \u201croute to citizenship\u201d \u2014 if they pay about $5 million. So presumably highlighting the inequities of the U.S. immigration system is not a top conservative priority at the moment.\n\nImmigration attorney Charles Kuck told CNN that he was \u201cstunned\u201d the judge allowed the release of Harry\u2019s immigration files, and he does not think the prince will be booted from the U.S.\n\n\u201cGiven that many of these facts were known about Harry before he filed for his green card, then I don\u2019t think immigration is going to be able to revoke his green card,\u201d Kuck said. \u201cThis is being done as a publicity stunt, not, I think, to ultimately take Harry\u2019s green card away.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump himself is no longer interested in kicking the prince out of the country. Last year Trump said, somewhat vaguely, that U.S. authorities should take \u201cappropriate action\u201d if it turns out Harry lied on his immigration application. But last month Trump did a 180 when the New York Post asked if he still wants to deport Prince Harry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cI\u2019ll leave him alone. He\u2019s got enough problems with his wife. She\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nWhy did Trump change his tune? It\u2019s unclear. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t want to create any more family drama for King Charles ahead of his second state visit to the U.K. Or maybe Trump meant what he said, and for once people\u2019s distaste for Meghan Markle is working in Prince Harry\u2019s favor."

(Xiomara Vizcaya via AP)\n\nMIAMI -- Franco Caraballo called his wife Friday night, crying and panicked. Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants held at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo\u2019s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny S\u00e1nchez, learned Caraballo was among the more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are now held in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nS\u00e1nchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE\u2019s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that prison in El Salvador, a massive complex where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold the prisoners, many of them Venezuelan. The Venezuelan government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about my son,\u201d said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nAli David Navas Vizcaya had been in U.S. detention since early 2024, when he arrived from Mexico at a U.S. border crossing where he had an appointment to talk to immigration officers. He called her late Friday night and said he thought he was being deported to Venezuela or Mexico. His name is no longer in ICE\u2019s system.\n\nNearly 8 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy collapsed. Most initially went to other Latin American countries but more headed to the U.S. after COVID-19 restrictions lifted during the Biden administration.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservative have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard line to deal with immigration.\n\nThe Trump administration says it is using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Tren de Aragua members, saying the gang was invading the U.S., though it has not provided any evidence to back up gang-membership claims.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged in a court filing Monday that many people sent to El Salvador do not have criminal records, though they insisted all are suspected gang members.\n\n\u201cThe lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat,\u201d said a sworn declaration included in the filing, adding that along with their suspected gang membership \u201cthe lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 3, Caraballo went to an ICE office in Dallas office for another mandatory check-in with the agents handling his asylum request. He had been coming regularly to the office for months.\n\nWhat gang member, his wife asked, would walk into a federal law enforcement office during a Trump administration crackdown that has left immigrants across the country terrified they would be deported?\n\n\u201cWe followed the law like we were told to. We never missed any\u201d meetings with authorities, said S\u00e1nchez, who remains in the U.S. trying to secure her husband\u2019s release. S\u00e1nchez said her husband, who she married in 2024 in Texas, has had no run-ins with the law in the U.S. She also showed The Associated Press a Venezuelan government document showing he has a clean criminal record there.\n\nS\u00e1nchez believes he was wrongly accused of belonging to Tren de Aragua because of a tattoo in the shape of a clock marking the birthday of his daughter from a previous relationship.\n\n\u201cHe has lots of tattoos but that\u2019s not a reason to discriminate against him,\u201d she said.\n\nS\u00e1nchez said she and her husband left Venezuela in 2023 with barely $200 and spent the next three months sleeping in plazas, eating out of trash cans and relying on the goodwill of fellow migrants as they journeyed north.\n\nShe thought the sacrifice would be worth it. Her husband had been working as a barber since the age of 13 and in the United States he was hopeful he could find a new start, escaping the poverty wages and toxic politics of Nicolas Maduro\u2019s ironfisted rule in Venezuela.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has blasted the transfers, calling them \u201ckidnappings\u201d and urging people to protest Tuesday in the capital, Caracas, to demand that detainees in El Salvador be sent to their homeland.\n\nJorge Rodriguez, Maduro\u2019s chief negotiator with the U.S., urged Venezuelans living in the U.S. to return to home.\n\nThe American dream, he said, had turned into \u201ca Salvadoran nightmare.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez agrees. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n\u201cWe fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, and Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis contributed to this report."

Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLast week, Chuck Schumer helped Congress avert a potentially lengthy shutdown by supporting a Republican stopgap bill to fund the government. But in doing so, the Senate minority leader has sparked significant ire from several factions of his party.\n\nAmid the intense backlash, which appeared to prompt a swift postponement of his pending book tour (though security concerns were given as the official reason), Schumer took to the airwaves in a series of interviews Tuesday to defend his position and his leadership role. In an appearance on The View, Schumer made a point he had made before: that the continuing resolution presented by the Republicans was \u201cbad,\u201d but that the prospect of a shutdown would\u2019ve been far worse.\n\n\u201cI knew it was a difficult choice and I knew I\u2019d get a lot of criticism for my choice. But I felt as a leader I had to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer told the hosts that a shutdown would\u2019ve allowed Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and U.S. Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, whom he called a \u201creally evil man,\u201d to enact further deep cuts to government spending, posing a potential risk to key programs like SNAP and Medicaid that could be eliminated under the guise of not being \u201cessential\u201d to government function:\n\n\"I felt as a leader I had to do it.\"\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader @SenSchumer defends his decision to vote for the Republicans' House-approved government funding bill, telling @TheView a government shutdown would have been \"devastation like we have never seen.\" pic.twitter.com/MOvquCLS6M \u2014 The View (@TheView) March 18, 2025\n\nSchumer\u2019s decision to back the Republican funding bill went against House Democrats, who largely voted against the legislation, as well as members of his own caucus who loudly went against the minority leader\u2019s move. Ultimately, only nine Democratic senators joined Schumer in voting to advance the bill. The outrage has prompted speculation that Democrats might seek new leadership in the Senate as groups like Indivisible called on Schumer to step aside. CNN reported last week that some Democrats have even begun to urge people to challenge Schumer for his seat in 2028, specifically naming Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has denounced Schumer\u2019s move as a \u201ctremendous mistake.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about such chatter, Schumer insisted that he\u2019s still the right leader for this moment, citing his Democratic gains in the Senate in 2005 and 2020. \u201cWe have a lot of really strong talent in the House, in the Senate, in the governors. We have a great bench. As for the Senate caucus, of which I\u2019m the leader, I should be the leader,\u201d he said.\n\n.@SenSchumer responds to Democrats questioning his leadership after he supported the Republican spending bill to avert a government shutdown: \"We are united in going after Trump and showing the American people that he is making the middle class pay for the tax cuts on the rich.\" pic.twitter.com/TgwbnlosYR \u2014 The View (@TheView) March 18, 2025\n\nIn an earlier appearance on CBS Mornings, Schumer said Democrats\u2019 strategy of hammering home the impact of Trump\u2019s policies on the lives of everyday Americans is already having an impact. \u201cIf we keep at it every day relentless, fighting and showing how they\u2019re hurting people so badly, Trump\u2019s numbers will get much lower and his \u2014 both popularity and his effectiveness \u2014 will decline,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer on CBS: \"I am the best leader for the Senate ... I am the best at winning Senate seats.\" pic.twitter.com/kWK9dkRsle \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 18, 2025\n\nLast week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the rest of the leadership initially lambasted Schumer\u2019s decision to advance the bill in a statement, writing that Democrats in the chamber \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d But on Monday, Jeffries responded to a reporter asking if he supports Schumer\u2019s leadership in the Senate after avoiding a similar question days earlier. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said."

            "full_content": "In February, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired the top lawyers for the Army, Navy and Air Force in a bid to ensure \u201cthey don\u2019t exist to be roadblocks to anything that happens.\u201d Rosa Brooks, a professor at Georgetown Law, wrote on X at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re planning to break the law: you get rid of any lawyers who might try to slow you down.\u201d\n\nNow the Guardian, citing \u201ctwo people familiar with the matter,\u201d reports Hegseth is planning a \u201csweeping overhaul of the judge advocate general\u2019s corps as part of an effort to make the US military less restricted by the laws of armed conflict.\u201d (The report has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News.) The Guardian also says that, according to the same sources, the overhaul of the JAG corps is designed to retrain military lawyers \u201cso that they provide more expansive legal advice to commanders to pursue more aggressive tactics and take a more lenient approach in charging soldiers with battlefield crimes.\u201d\n\nConsidering the U.S. military\u2019s long track record of documented human rights abuses and disregarding civilian life, Hegseth\u2019s maneuvering looks like he wants to make the military more vicious and callous than it already is. And while the U.S. military is far from the only one in the world that shows negligence toward civilian life in combat zones, its conduct is the most highly scrutinized and influential in the world given its unrivaled reach, power and interventionism since World War II.\n\nAtop all this, Hegseth is also cutting jobs and offices focused on reducing civilian deaths from U.S. combat operations. Though the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and the Civilian Protection Center were set up during Trump\u2019s first term, in his second term these offices are being framed as an obstacle to the U.S.\u2019 ability to wage war. But retired U.S. Army Gen. Joseph Votel told NPR last week that he believed that it would be harmful to the military\u2019s functioning to remove them. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is designed to be more constricting on commanders. I think it\u2019s really designed to be more informative in helping us be a better educated and smarter force.\u201d\n\nThese changes are all consistent with what we know about Hegseth\u2019s draconian and primitive attitudes toward combat. The former Fox News host \u2014 who has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault, excessive drinking and mismanagement in his previous jobs \u2014 is obsessed with the narrative that the U.S. military has gone soft and needs to be reignited with a \u201cwarrior ethos.\u201d In particular, Hegseth insists that the military is held back by \u201cwokeness.\u201d\n\nIn his book \u201cThe War on Warriors,\u201d Hegseth wrote of his experience as a soldier with the Army National Guard during the George W. Bush administration, \u201cIn some cases, our units were so boxed in by rules and regulations and political correctness, we even second-guess ourselves. That needs to end.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that Hegseth was deployed in the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. In both conflicts, the U.S. carried out morally and strategically catastrophic wars that resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths \u2014 often due to overly permissive rules of engagement \u2014 and torture of locals. The problem wasn\u2019t too many rules, it was too few of them.\n\nIn a breach of norms, Hegseth has appointed his personal lawyer and former naval officer, Timothy Parlatore, as a Navy commander in the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps. Jason Dempse, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former U.S. Army officer, wrote in The Atlantic that Parlatore\u2019s appointment reflected \u201can odious philosophy of warfare\u201d:\n\nLike his new boss at the Pentagon, Parlatore has a pattern of providing support to soldiers accused of grave misconduct, even war crimes. He notably represented Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL court-martialed on charges including the murder of a captured fighter (though he was found guilty only of one, lesser charge), along with a second SEAL accused of serious sexual offenses. Elevating a lawyer with this record does not bode well for the armed services Hegseth hopes to build.\n\nMoreover, as my colleague Steve Benen recently reminded us: Parlatore \u201chad another very high-profile client: Parlatore was part of Donald Trump\u2019s legal defense team after the president was charged with multiple felonies in the classified documents/Mar-a-Lago scandal.\u201d It\u2019s safe to predict that Parlatore isn\u2019t going to be elevating the already-beleaguered moral stature of the U.S. military.\n\nHegseth\u2019s vision for American defense policy is consistent with Trumpism more broadly \u2014 an appetite for strong man rule and a disregard for rule of law and decency. It certainly doesn\u2019t bode well for Trump\u2019s increasingly preposterous claims that he wants to be a president \u201cof peace.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The stock market rose to record heights after Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 re-election. Wall Street reveled in Trump\u2019s promises of even more tax cuts and defanged regulators, not to mention making the world safe for saying all those politically incorrect thoughts about DEI. What could go wrong?\n\nPlenty, it turns out. Trump\u2019s only been in office two months and the S&P 500 is lower than it was before Nov. 6 and in correction territory. The risk of a recession is rising, and confidence for consumers and small businesses is plummeting, even as fears of inflation are increasing. Multiple Fortune 500 companies report a softening in consumer spending. The dreaded word \u201cstagflation\u201d is getting tossed around.\n\nThe Trump administration is hardly offering reassurance.\n\nNo wonder so few people, it seems, want to plan a getaway: The Conference Board reports that under 40% of Americans are planning a vacation in the next six months. In the last 40 years, that number has only been lower during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Recession.\n\nThe Trump administration is hardly offering reassurance. Not only do the president and staffers like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent refuse to rule out the possibility of a recession, they are even arguing that economic pain will result in a better future. The president called it \u201ca period of transition.\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted Trump\u2019s tariff policies will be \u201cworth it\u201d even if they lead to a recession.\n\nAs one banker told the Financial Times, \u201cWith hindsight, we did not appreciate the nature of what the administration was going to be like.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say.\n\nWall Street\u2019s enthusiasm for Donald Trump was always a triumph of hope over experience and evidence. True, absence makes the heart grow fonder, but there were signs everywhere, long before Trump was elected, that he was serious about tariffs \u2014 which Wall Street, rationally or irrationally, abhors \u2014 and other policies that have both roiled the markets and sparked warning signs in the economy since his inauguration. And if nothing else, you would think the chaotic management of the Covid pandemic and violent end of his first term would give the masters of the financial universe pause.\n\nIt did not.\n\nEven in the best of circumstances, Trump is a chaos monster. More than ever before, he\u2019s embraced chaos as both an economic and governing strategy. That is, you shouldn\u2019t need me to tell you, is a risky way to run an economy.\n\nFor example, there is a case to use tariffs in a way that is strategic, stable and reliable, and that would promote the long-term goal of strengthening the nation\u2019s manufacturing capacity. Trump\u2019s approach has none of these qualities. His goals include nonsense like attempting to annex Canada. He imposes them one day only to call them off the next. And even his choice of targets, according to Lutnick, depends not on any rational criteria but on which countries \u201cmake him unhappy.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets and businesses crave stability and predictability; they react poorly to chaos and political favoritism.\n\nThe administration\u2019s approach to slashing government is another issue. Trump has allowed Elon Musk\u2019s minions at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cancel scores of federal contracts and even stiff businesses that have already performed work for the federal government. Many of these actions might well get reversed in the nation\u2019s courts, but for now, universities and other impacted businesses are instituting hiring freezes and laying off employees. Others \u2014 like former Social Security Commissioner Martin O\u2019Malley \u2014 fear that DOGE cuts to Social Security amid false claims of rampant fraud are risking a \u201ctotal system collapse.\u201d All this uncertainty and fear, in turn, is contributing to increasing consumer pessimism.\n\nThen there is Trump\u2019s open corruption and vengeance politics. He\u2019s attacking multiple law firms that have played a role in his various legal woes. At the same time, he and his family are profiting from everything from cryptocurrency sales to Amazon\u2019s $40 million deal to stream an \u201cunprecedented, behind-the-scenes\u201d documentary about Melania Trump.\n\nAs I have pointed out in the past, the United States is a financial giant not just because it is a resource-rich country. We are \u2014 or were \u2014 considered a stable country as well, where the rule of law is enforced fairly and consistently. Financial markets and businesses crave stability and predictability; they react poorly to chaos and political favoritism. Just as people need some assurance that their job will be there for them tomorrow before they make a big purchase, the same is true for businesses. They can\u2019t plan for the future if they don\u2019t have a secure sense of what their underlying expenses and sales will be \u2014 something that is increasingly impossible in the Trump economy.\n\n\u201cThe problem for the markets is when they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said billionaire investor Marc Lasry last week. \u201cAn economy can\u2019t survive like that.\u201d\n\nLet me reiterate that uncertainty is bad for all of us, not just the financial markets.\n\nThere\u2019s a pervasive myth that Republicans are better for the economy than Democrats. Nothing could be further from the truth. Job growth is higher when a Democrat is in the White House. The S&P 500 performs better under Democratic presidents. Nine out of the last 10 recessions \u2014 including each of the last five \u2014 have begun with a Republican sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nBut many who should know better don\u2019t want to believe the evidence.\n\nIt\u2019s all personal. Even as inequality soared to near-record levels, many of the wealthiest Americans \u2014 from Wall Street to Silicon Valley and everywhere in between \u2014 have insisted they were the true victims, lashing out at the Biden administration and complaining about any regulation or possible tax increase. These supposed financial experts let their greed and pique blind them to the reality that always was and always will be Donald Trump."

            "full_content": "The lure of cheap labor is bad for innovation, productivity, civic solidarity, and national strength, Vice President JD Vance told business leaders at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday.\n\nThe promise of cheap labor is \u201d a drug that too many American firms got addicted to \u2026 [and] globalization\u2019s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it\u2019s been bad for innovation,\u201d Vance told his audience of investors, adding:\n\nBoth our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation.\n\n\u201cReal innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor,\u201d Vance said in a short speech.\n\nThe statement shows how Vance is trying to repair the political bridge between the party\u2019s voters and business leaders that was deliberately demolished by ruthless pro-migration policies pushed by the two Bush presidencies. The two Bush presidencies dramatically expanded legal and illegal migration to inflate the stock market with cheap labor, more consumers, and more renters.\n\n\u201cThere were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization,\u201d Vance said:\n\nThe first is assuming that we can separate the making of things from the design of things. The idea was that rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things. You would open an iPhone box and it would say \u201cDesigned in Cupertino, California.\u201d Now the implication, of course, is that it would be manufactured [in China] or somewhere else. And yeah, some people might lose their jobs in manufacturing, and they could learn to design, or to use a very popular phrase, and \u201clearn to code.\u201d But I think we got it wrong. Turns out that the geographies that do the manufacturing get awfully good at the designing of things. There are network effects, as you all well understand, the firms that design products work with firms that manufacture. They share intellectual property, they share best practices, and they even sometimes share critical employees. Now we assume that other nations would always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end [so] we were squeezed from both ends. Now that was the first conceit of globalization. I think the second is that cheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and it\u2019s a crutch that inhibits innovation. I might even say that it\u2019s a drug that too many American firms got addicted to. Now, if you can make a product more cheaply, it\u2019s far too easy to do that rather than to innovate. And whether we\u2019re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I\u2019d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you\u2019ve seen productivity stagnate. That\u2019s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. Now, one of the debates you hear on the minimum wage, for instance, is that increases in the minimum wage force firms to automate. So a higher wage at McDonald\u2019s means more [service] kiosks. And whatever your views on the wisdom of the minimum wage, I\u2019m not going to comment on that here \u2026 [we think] companies innovating in the absence of cheap labor is a good thing. I think most of you are not worried about getting cheaper and cheaper labor. You\u2019re worried about innovating, about building new things, about the old formulation of technology is doing more with less. You guys are all trying to do more with less every single day. And so I\u2019d ask my friends, both on the tech optimist side and on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of globalization as a failure of innovation. Indeed, I\u2019d say that globalization\u2019s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it\u2019s been bad for innovation. Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. \u2026 Our goal is to incentivize investment in our own borders \u2014 in our own businesses, our own workers, and our own innovation. We don\u2019t want people seeking cheap labor. We want them investing and building right here in the United States of America.\n\nBreitbart News has posted many articles about migration\u2019s harmful impact on productivity and innovation, and how tight labor markets and rising wages pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity.\n\nFor example, the Fortune 500 has increasingly imported foreign white-collar labor to cut costs. But the programs created by Congress and the executive \u2014 such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs \u2014 have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing.\n\nThe damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers.\n\nIn 2024, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that President Joe Biden\u2019s migration policy would reduce productivity growth in the United States.\n\nVance told his listeners that elites\u2019 demand for cheap labor also fractures societies:\n\nI think the populists, when they look at the future, and when they compare it to what\u2019s happened in the past, I think a lot of them see alienation of workers from their jobs, from their communities, from their sense of solidarity. You see the alienation of people from their sense of purpose. And importantly, they see a leadership class that believes welfare can replace a job and an application on a phone can replace a sense of purpose. \u2026 Now, I remember a Silicon Valley dinner in particular, back when I was in \u2014 in my tech days, where my wife and I were sitting around talking to some of the leaders of \u2014 of the important technology firms of the United States \u2026 And I remember one of the tech CEOs who was there that \u2014 you know, CEO \u2014 you would know his name if I mentioned it. He was the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m actually not worried about the loss of purpose when people lose their jobs.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay, well, what do you think is going to replace that sense of purpose?\u201d And he said, \u201cDigital, fully immersive gaming.\u201d\n\nThe same economic and civic problem has occurred in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, where national leaders are inflating the economy with immigrants, dragging down average income and prosperity.\n\nFor example, immigration forces nations to divert investment to housing and consumerism and away from factory automation and high-tech research.\n\nThe economic damage has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees.\n\n\u201cI can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,\u201d BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia.

            "full_content": "\"Maybe America needs to be broken so someone can fix it.\"\n\nAs former Vice President Kamala Harris considers running in California's gubernatorial race, many of her powerful and longtime national supporters, who helped bolster her to national stardom six years ago, tell ABC News they are lukewarm on a potential 2028 presidential run.\n\n\"I think she's done at the top of the ticket.\" said one donor, who like several other donors, spoke with ABC News on the condition of anonymity because they are still actively involved in Democratic party fundraising. He added, \"I think the country will not have moved in a progressive direction during that time, it will have become more conservative.\"\n\nThe donor was one of the over 20 donors that ABC News spoke with from Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who supported Harris as a junior senator, during the most crowded Democratic presidential race in history, and remained unified during her 2024 bid.\n\nThe support Harris spent years cultivating faces deep fissures.\n\nAnother donor, Areva Martin, who has known Harris since college, said Harris has a history of quieting the doubters.\n\n\"She's proven she has staying power. When people think she can't recover she's proven her ability to do so,\" Martin told ABC News.\n\nKamala Harris drops by a phone bank event at the Democratic National Committee headquarters on Election Day November 05, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOthers were noncommittal, feeling it was too early to consider anyone running for president.\n\n\"I don't know if I would get involved at this point even if God were running. ... I think it's going to be tough for any Democrat to raise any money. There is little enthusiasm,\" Democratic fundraiser Michael Kempner told ABC News.\n\nCase for Harris running for governor\n\nNearly every member of Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who spoke with ABC News backed her for a gubernatorial run.\n\nHarris' aides previously told ABC News she will make a decision by the end of summer. Some supporters see a successful Harris bid for governor in 2026 as a dealbreaker to run for president in 2028, because of the short window between a gubernatorial inauguration and a potential presidential launch.\n\nBakari Sellers, former co-chair of Harris' 2020 campaign, said, \"If she wants to run for governor, I don't think the Katie Porter's of the world are formidable. I think if she wants to run for president, she has to ask: is the country ready for her? I don't know the answer to that. \u2026 a lot of things are going to change in the next three and a half years.\"\n\nOthers avoided commenting about a potential 2028 run, citing timing, but expressed confidence in a Harris gubernatorial run.\n\n\"My opinion and my dedication to her hasn't changed one iota. I believe she's one of the most talented, brilliant, kind, empathic people that I have met in all my time in politics,\" lawyer Judith Barnett told ABC News.\n\nThe lifetime Democratic donor who said she has known Harris for nearly a decade added, \"I would think running for governor, running the 5th largest economy in the world, would be a good move. It's not my decision \u2026 it's all hers. But I think it's a wonderful step,\" Barnett said.\n\nAsif Mahmood, who led Asian outreach for Harris' 2019 campaign, said Harris could follow in another Californian's footsteps.\n\n\"Reagan ran for president. He lost, came back to California, served his state as governor, went back and ran for president and won twice,\" said Mahmood, who was also Hillary Clinton's deputy national finance chair.\n\nMultiple donors pointed out that if Harris were to win a gubernatorial race, she'd make history. She'd be the first Asian American woman and the first Black woman to be governor of any state.\n\nKamala Harris speaks at a canvass kickoff event on November 04, 2024 in Moosic, Pennsylvania. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nOnly one donor who spoke with ABC News said he was not enthusiastic about supporting Harris for governor.\n\n\"If she even thinks of running for president, it will be very bad. If she even puts feelers out it will be embarrassing,\" he said, adding, he would need to be convinced to write big checks for her for any race.\n\nHe claimed donors struggled after Harris' presidential loss to get answers from staffers, \"I don't want to deal with her campaign apparatus.\"\n\nDemocrats vs Democrats\n\nSome donors who spoke with ABC News believe the lack of consensus over Harris says more about Democrats than it does about her.\n\n\"The Democratic party is well known for killing their losers and finding someone else,\" said one donor.\n\n\"I think losing to Donald Trump is the cardinal sin of the Democratic party. The left and people that supported her don't appear to be trying to articulate that this loss was narrow and her ideas were popular,\" said one loyalist.\n\n\"It's tough for anyone to come back from a loss and run again. Trump is, of course, an exception. In my opinion, I don't think she would get significant support as a presidential nominee.\" Dr. Manan Trivedi, a donor and former candidate for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district, told ABC News.\n\nThomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Grover Cleveland, Richard Nixon, Trump were all presidential nominees who lost before winning a general election. Grover Cleveland was the only Democrat to accomplish the feat.\n\nSome donors were skeptical of Harris joining that list.\n\n\"If Kamala wanted to be president of the United States, she needed to position herself as the leader of the resistance. Not only has she not done that but no other leader has pushed themselves forward,\" said one donor.\n\nKamala Harris met with Senior White House and Administration officials, January 9, 2025. Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nMontgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija met Harris during her 2010 attorney general run and said he believes Democrats have time to better position themselves for a successful presidential run.\n\n\"I think she has the luxury of not having to dive into the political fray during this time. By focusing on the human impact of what this administration is doing. It could draw on her strength as an empathetic leader. It could make a difference in these interim years,\" Makhija told ABC News.\n\nAnother donor said Democrats need to be strategic.\n\n\"I want to win. I am not supporting a woman, a Black person, or a gay person. I am supporting the non-threatening white dude. Even if a woman were the best candidate, I would have a hard time until it became really clear that there is a real pathway,\" said one female donor.\n\nDemocratic bundler Alex Heckler said he has remained a big fan of Harris' but fears Democrats are playing a defensive game.\n\nWhile he says he's happy with the new party chair, he says, \"Democrats over-correct. Three white men led the votes for party chair - it's ridiculous. We can't help ourselves. I struggle being a Democrat these days.\"\n\n\"Democrats are reactionary - they think two women lost - we can't put a woman up again,\" Heckler said.\n\nActivist Tina Duryea said she's also frustrated with the party.\n\n\"She [Harris] could run on: 'look how miserable everything is now you could have had me' that could be a very powerful message. I don't have a lot of tolerance for people living in fear. Democrats overthink things,\" Duryea told ABC News. She said she's \"100% behind\" any decision Harris makes.\n\nRapidly changing political landscape\n\nLike any voter, donors change their minds about politics. Multiple did during the course of this reporting.\n\nTwo weeks ago, one prominent donor said, \"I don't think she has it in her,\" adding he believed the next democratic nominee \"will be one of the governors.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris accepts the Chairman's Award onstage during the 56th NAACP Image Awards at Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, Calif., Feb. 22, 2025. Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET\n\nBut the donor changed his mind after Harris' recent appearances. \"Putting your heart and soul into an election is devastating. Watching her [Harris] over the last few weeks, she seems to be getting her legs back. She's been out there speaking,\" the donor said.\n\nHe added, \"If the world is falling apart economically and geopolitically and she gets a head start on fundraising, with her name recognition and leadership, she could easily become the frontrunner and win.\"\n\nOthers acknowledged their positions could change.\n\nCalifornia donor Mark Buell said he is watching how California's gubernatorial and the presidential races unfold before he publicly endorses anyone.\n\n\"I've learned my lesson, you have to wait to be able to see the full landscape. \u2026We have many issues in this country. If I have to hold my nose to vote for a Democratic who I don't like but think would win - I would. It's not who my favorite is or who I love.\"\n\nAnother donor cited a possible fundamental change in American democracy, led by Trump's actions.\n\n\"I am very reluctant to back a horse. Because I'm not even sure we're horse racing anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"Are we going to have an election in 2028? When he [Trump] jokes about it, I don't know if he's joking. But I think she would be great. I still think she would have been great,\" donor Mara Cohen told ABC News.\n\nColorado DNC delegate Wanda James expressed frustration watching Harris' narrative flip, arguing it could easily flip back.\n\n\"On Nov.3, we were calling her campaign flawless,\" James told ABC News. \"Maybe America needs to be broken so someone can fix it. I don't know who will arise, maybe it will be someone no one suspected, but if the election was happening tomorrow I would still be with Kamala.\"\n\nLike several other donors, Janni Lehrer-Stein, a longtime Harris donor and disability advocate, said she has seen Harris multiple times since the election, and has not received any indication as to what she plans to do in the future, but said, \"Kamala Harris is going to lead us toward justice and a better life for everyone. That's the reason I'll support her in whatever direction she takes.\""

            "full_content": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is holding his fire \u2026 perpetually. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nA key difference between the first and second Trump administrations is the latter\u2019s aggressive obliteration of the traditional line between executive and legislative authority and responsibilities \u2014 and the congressional-Republican acquiescence to this ongoing power grab. In Trump\u2019s first term, the president\u2019s executive orders were relatively limited and targeted, there was no major effort to rescind spending without congressional authorization, and there was absolutely nothing like DOGE. Much of Trump\u2019s agenda was advanced by straightforward legislative vehicles, and there was sufficient independence remaining in the GOP ranks to make the first of two big budget-reconciliation bills (the so-called Obamacare-repeal legislation) difficult and ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nSo far, there has been a remarkable lack of congressional-Republican pushback to the ongoing Trump-DOGE-OMB seizure of powers reserved for the legislative branch. But this submissiveness has a dual purpose for the president\u2019s faithful servants on Capitol Hill: Yes, it helps them avoid a possible primary challenge backed by Trump and financed by Elon Musk. But it also absolves them of responsibility for executive-branch actions that are unpopular or might be reversed by the courts or by the administration itself.\n\nA good example of the desire of congressional Republicans to back Trump to the hilt while distancing themselves from responsibility occurred shortly after Trump launched his trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China, as the New York Times reported:\n\nHouse Republican leaders on Tuesday quietly moved to shield their members from having to vote on whether to end President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, tucking language into a procedural measure that effectively removed their chamber\u2019s ability to undo the levies.\n\nThe maneuver was a tacit acknowledgment of how politically toxic the issue had become for their party, and another example of how the all-Republican Congress is ceding its power to the executive branch. In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.\n\nAs Mike Brock noted, congressional Republicans created \u201cthe day that never ends\u201d:\n\nThe tariffs themselves are already having real-world consequences \u2014 spooking financial markets and threatening to reignite inflation. Yet rather than engaging with these economic realities or even defending the tariffs on their merits, Republican leaders have chosen simply to avoid the conversation entirely.\n\nThis is not governance; it\u2019s avoidance. Not leadership, but abdication. Not democracy, but its hollow simulation.\n\nBut it might also be smart \u2014 if deceptive and cowardly \u2014 politics. An even better example of intentional GOP abdication was illustrated by the extreme usefulness of lawless DOGE cuts as a way to corral House conservative votes for a budget resolution and then a spending bill that Freedom Caucus types would normally oppose. \u201cVote for our bills and you can count on Elon Musk to obtain the cuts you want, and we won\u2019t stand in the way\u201d was the implicit message from Speaker Mike Johnson to the fiscal ultras whose support he needed in order to pass legislation on a strict party-line vote.\n\nThe underlying question is whether there is any action Trump might take that would force congressional Republicans to speak out rather than deferring to the executive branch while keeping their own hands relatively clean? In a long Politico Magazine profile of Senate Majority Leader John Thune that stressed the South Dakotan\u2019s decency and respect for hallowed congressional and constitutional precedents, Michael Kruse posed that very question to Thune himself \u2026 and couldn\u2019t get a real answer:\n\nI think people understand that it\u2019s not an easy job. I mean, you\u2019re working with a really big personality who has a distinct way of doing things, which kind of keeps you on the edge of your seat. And you have to be adaptable. You have to be somebody who plays the long game and realizes that you do live your life in 24-hour compartments \u2014 it\u2019s a day-to-day thing \u2014 but you try and keep in perspective the long game. And so every day that we get up and do the work here you understand that you\u2019re trying to bend the trajectory of what you\u2019re doing in the direction of freedom, preserving democracy and making the world and this country a better place.\n\nIt\u2019s significant that this mealymouthed rationalization for silence and inaction came from a senator who treated John McCain as his role model, who had a lot of issues with Trump in 2016, who opposed Trump\u2019s 2020 election denial and the conduct of his supporters on January 6, and who didn\u2019t even endorse Trump in 2024 until he had all but locked up the GOP nomination. Even admirers wonder if he\u2019ll ever protest what\u2019s happening:\n\n\u201cI would hope there\u2019s a little inner turmoil,\u201d Mark Salter, a longtime adviser to the late John McCain, told me. \u201cYou are watching the executive branch usurp all the power and authorities given Congress under Article I,\u201d Salter said. \u201cMaybe he thinks, \u2018I\u2019ll preserve my influence, and down the road, when something worse comes along, I\u2019ll be able to stop him from doing it\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s going to get harder to oppose him, not easier.\u201d\n\nSo what will represent the \u201credline\u201d for Republicans like Thune? Open defiance of court orders? DOGE going directly after the most popular entitlement programs? Tariffs and federal layoffs tanking the economy? Constituents cowering in fear of DOGE or ICE or Justice Department avengers? The search for that redline is on."

            "full_content": "Berlin CNN \u2014\n\nThe German chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has won a vote in parliament to allow a huge increase in state borrowing that is set to super-charge the country\u2019s military spending. The victory completes a Damascene conversion in German politics \u2013 using the outgoing parliamentary arithmetic.\n\nAfter a week of wrangling with the Greens, who held out for some concessions from Merz on how the money would be spent, the vote in the recalled parliament Tuesday saw him secure the two-thirds majority needed to change Germany\u2019s constitutional \u201cdebt brake\u201d \u2013 a mechanism to limit government borrowing.\n\nThe policy U-turn is Merz\u2019s attempt to achieve a number of goals: generate fresh winds for an economy stuck in the doldrums, super-charge military spending and inject much-needed cash into Germany\u2019s aging infrastructure.\n\nMerz won the vote on the relevant law by 513 to 207. His victory means any defense spending and certain security-related outlays that exceed 1% of gross domestic product will be exempt from the debt brake. It will also enable usually fiscally conservative Germany to create a \u20ac500 billion ($545 billion) fund for infrastructure.\n\nRobin Winkler, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank, called the debt overhaul \u201ca historic fiscal regime shift, arguably the largest since German reunification.\u201d But he added that the onus was now on the incoming government to deliver the structural reforms needed to turn the stimulus into sustainable economic growth.\n\nBefore the vote, Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at pan-European bank ING, told CNN that changing Germany\u2019s debt brake would also have implications beyond its borders. \u201cGermany, the guardian of fiscal austerity in Europe, is opening up its wallet,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cthis idea of fiscal discipline needed in Europe is quickly fading away.\u201d\n\nThe debt brake, enshrined in the constitution, was brought in by Angela Merkel in her first term as German chancellor, back in 2009. Nations across the world were reeling from the global financial crisis, having spent billions bailing out financial institutions.\n\nThe German policy was to grow in prominence in the years following the eurozone debt crisis.\n\n\u201cThe debt brake was a fantastic instrument to lead by example in Europe: preaching austerity to all the other countries \u2013 Greece, Italy and Spain \u2013 and at the same time showing that Germany was leading the way with these very restrictive fiscal policies,\u201d Brzeski explained.\n\nThere is \u201cno exact number\u201d on what Merz\u2019s government could spend on defense, he noted.\n\nBut one model he provided to CNN, based on Germany spending 3.5% of GDP over the next 10 years, could unlock \u20ac600 billion.\n\nA defense \u2018turning point\u2019\n\nFor a country that has for decades been very self-conscious about its militarized past, the potential increase in defense spending marks a sea change.\n\nMerz seized on his election victory to pass the reform, spurred on by fears sweeping Europe over the Trump administration\u2019s apparent wavering on security commitments to allies.\n\nYet the idea is not Merz\u2019s own. He is giving renewed impetus to a 2022 German security policy change dubbed Zeitenwende \u2013 \u201ca turning point\u201d in English \u2013 initiated by outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz just after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSudha David-Wilp, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank, said Scholz\u2019s implementation of the policy was hindered by his squabbling coalition.\n\nNow, she told CNN, \u201cMerz and (his) coalition need to accelerate this, not because Germany needs to be a military power but because Germany, with its European partners, needs to look at hard security, because it\u2019s a different world.\u201d\n\nThe debt brake also became a straitjacket for the German economy, Brzeski said, describing it as \u201cone of the more structural root causes of the current stagnation\u201d and comparing it to trying to accelerate a car with the handbrake on.\n\n\u201cA debt brake still makes sense if you have a nice, thriving economy,\u201d he said, adding that politicians had realized that, as Germany\u2019s economic growth had slowed, the mechanism was no longer working to the country\u2019s advantage.\n\nThe shadow of US President Donald Trump has also hung over Tuesday\u2019s vote. Speaking as it became clear Merz\u2019s party had come out on top in last month\u2019s federal election, Merz, known for his strong trans-Atlantic values, said his priority was to strengthen Europe as fast as possible \u201cso that step by step we can really achieve independence from the USA.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s comments the previous week, he added, it was clear that \u201cAmericans in this administration are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe law on the debt brake reform now needs to be approved by the upper house of Germany\u2019s parliament, also with a two-thirds majority, which Merz looks to have secured.\n\nAccording to David-Wilp at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, Merz sees a need for Germany to lead on defense in Europe because \u201cthings have really undergone major change since (Trump\u2019s) inauguration.\u201d\n\nDuring a debate Tuesday ahead of the vote, Merz said there had been a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in Germany\u2019s defense policy. Time will tell if more lavish spending will boost the country\u2019s security and fundamentally change its military.\n\nClaudia Otto contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSummary President Trump blames Biden for economic woes despite inheriting a stable economy, according to economists.\n\nMarkets have entered 'extreme fear territory' as consumer confidence plummets amid uncertainty about Trump's policies.\n\nEconomists attribute recent market volatility to Trump's tariff proposals rather than Biden's economic legacy.\n\nRSM has increased its recession probability to 20% from 15%, according to its chief economist.\n\nMany presidential administrations cherry-pick economic data to support their narratives, experts say.\n\nMarkets are on the fritz and investor sentiment has slumped into \u201cextreme fear\u201d territory. Consumer confidence readings have cratered and surveys show a sharp turnabout in Americans\u2019 feelings about their future financial well-being. Any positive reports are described by economists as the \u201ccalm before the storm.\u201d\n\nThe common denominator is pure and utter uncertainty \u2014 particularly about just how President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy actions could shake out, economists say.\n\nHowever, when the topics of the economy, volatile markets, shaken confidence and sudden recession fears have been broached with Trump, he\u2019s hammered on familiar notes: That the Biden administration left him with an economic situation that was \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d a \u201cnightmare,\u201d \u201chorrible,\u201d or \u201cdamaged.\u201d\n\nStill, data aside, the economy didn\u2019t feel great to all Americans who suffered through the highest inflation in decades, and those sour feelings helped send Trump back to the White House for a second term.\n\nSuch claims have become a hair-pull for economists, statisticians, academics and fact-checkers alike: By most gold-standard measures, President Joe Biden handed Trump a booming economy. And, if anything, the economy was ripe for a resurgence in early 2025 under Trump, economists have told CNN.\n\nConsumer confidence readings have declined sharply in recent weeks on fears that President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could drive prices higher. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe economy was bad under Biden and that was reflected in the polls last year; but inflation and every other economic indicator had more or less stabilized when President Trump took office,\u201d Jai Kedia, an economist and research fellow at the Cato Institute, told CNN in an interview.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now, Kedia said, is a tale as old as politics: The blame game.\n\nKedia, who\u2019s a Libertarian, is in the camp of politicians should \u201cleave things alone,\u201d when it comes to the economy.\n\n\u201cThis is true in the Biden administration with the massive spending bills and all of that, which in some part led to inflation; and that\u2019s true now with the tariffs that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Kedia said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to figure out why you would blame the previous administration. The stock market actually went up once Trump was elected, and it\u2019s only in the past month when the administration is playing around with dangerous economic ideas that you see the economy started to swivel back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a direct result of the tariffs and other economic proposals,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are plenty of caveats when it comes to economic data: One month does not make a trend; figures are preliminary and often subject to revision as more detailed information becomes available; reports often represent a snapshot in time and can be influenced by one-off events such as weather; and, above all else, it takes time for situations to evolve and be fully understood.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem across our political spectrum of cherry-picking one month of employment or inflation reports to make general conclusions about the trend,\u201d Kedia said.\n\nTake, for example, Biden taking credit for \u201ccreating\u201d nearly 16 million jobs during his time in office; and then, most recently, Trump touting a slice of the February jobs report: a 10,000-job boost in manufacturing that he credited to his tariff-heavy trade policy and desires to make America a factory superpower.\n\nBoth claims have truthful elements to them, but there are important distinctions to be made: For Biden, he needed to clarify that it took roughly 9.5 million jobs of those to get back to pre-pandemic levels of employment; and for Trump, those gains are preliminary estimates and very well could be reflective of investments put forth under the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to understand what the effects of the tariffs are on manufacturing and the rest of the economy,\u201d Kedia said. \u201cThe markets clearly are telling you where they think this is going.\u201d\n\nThis and other alarm bells are heightening recession fears.\n\nOn-again, off-again tariffs, mass government layoffs, funding cuts and other sweeping policy moves from the Trump administration have spooked investors. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis is not large enough to be a recessionary shock at this point; but it\u2019s going to cause growth to slow,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, RSM US principal and chief economist, said in an interview.\n\nBrusuelas\u2019 firm recently lifted its recession probability to 20% from 15%, or a one in five chance. If the current uncertainty evolves into a large trade shock that\u2019s sustained, RSM would revisit those projections, Brusuelas said.\n\n\u201cIf the shock is caused by a specific trade policy, it\u2019s highly likely that credit or blame \u2014 depending on your point of view regarding the recession \u2014 would fall squarely in the laps of the Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the administration won\u2019t say it\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault. They\u2019ve already laid the predicate on that.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, confidence surveys aren\u2019t always reliable indicators of future economic performance, said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an unprecedented amount of uncertainty, what I call a very thick fog, and we can\u2019t tell whether we\u2019re going north or south right now,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the fog clears up, the confidence will go up. So I would not use business confidence or consumer confidence as an indicator of how well or how poorly the economy is going to do going forward.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The Alma Mater statue at Columbia University. Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe leaders of America\u2019s top universities should have realized long ago that no amount of cowering and capitulation or attempts to hide will save them from the attack being unleashed and orchestrated by the Trump administration. It seems the leaders of these fine institutions do not understand the crude and lawless nature of their opponents or the focused, all-out war on higher education that the White House and its allies have launched.\n\nLike many New Yorkers, I am baffled and dismayed by Columbia University\u2019s meek acceptance of the outrageous, bullying announcement from the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and the U.S. General Services Administration that the White House intends to snatch back $400 million in federal research money based on what the administration called \u201ccontinued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\u201d an alleged violation of civil-rights law. For good measure, the letter warned that \u201cthese cancellations represent the first round of action and additional cancellations are expected to follow.\u201d\n\nBut the threat is plainly illegal. Federal law governing scientific grants specifies that clawbacks of research money can only happen after a voluntary resolution has been attempted and \u201ca full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action\u201d has been filed with the committees in Congress that initially authorized the grants. Importantly, cancellations must be limited to the offending section of the grantee organization, and \u201cno such action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s announcement skipped all the legal requirements, ignoring any attempt at voluntary resolution and basing its action on alleged discrimination at the undergraduate campus that has nothing to do with scientific work happening three miles north at the NewYork-Presbyterian\u2013Columbia research complex. The announcement makes no mention of the mandatory written report or the required notification to Congress. It should have been swiftly and publicly rejected by Columbia\u2019s president and trustees on the day it was received, ideally with language to the effect of \u201cOur lawyers will see you in court.\u201d\n\nInstead, the university immediately raised the white flag. \u201cWe take Columbia\u2019s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cWe remain dedicated to our mission to advance lifesaving research and pledge to work with the federal government to restore Columbia\u2019s federal funding,\u201d a spokesperson told the student-run Spectator publication.\n\nColumbia\u2019s meek public responses, which avoided calling out the plain illegality of the situation, failed to stop or even slow the attack. Within days, the Trump administration informed Columbia that it must change its student disciplinary policies and place its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under \u201cacademic receivership for a minimum of five years\u201d and announced it will begin investigating dozens of other universities for implementing diversity measures that the administration opposes.\n\nThat is how blackmail works. The moment of fearful surrender is precisely when the blackmailer informs his pitiful, groveling victim: \u201cUnfortunately that will no longer do.\u201d And then a new round of humiliation begins with even higher stakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely illegal. We\u2019re challenging that,\u201d Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told me. \u201cThis is a thinly veiled effort to bully the universities every which way. They\u2019re using every tool in their tool kit. They\u2019re going after faculty. They\u2019re going after students. They\u2019re going after grants that have absolutely nothing to do with politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an escalation of a kind that is unheard of,\u201d Joan Scott, a historian, told the Associated Press. \u201cEven during the McCarthy period in the United States, this was not done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not too late for Columbia to change course and start fighting back. The school\u2019s website lists five attorneys among the 22 members of the board of trustees, but at least one of them, former Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson, surely understands enough about Washington politics to warn against the folly of appeasement.\n\nThe Trump administration has been open about its mission of defunding and disabling elite institutions. As Christopher Rufo, an anti-diversity ideologue affiliated with the Manhattan Institute who has advised the Trump administration, recently told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat: \u201cI think that you could put the university sector as a whole into a significant recession. And I think that would be a very salutary thing \u2026 A medium- or long-term goal of mine is to figure out how to adjust the formula of finances from the federal government to the universities in a way that puts them in an existential terror.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that Columbia installed its 13th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, shortly after he had led the historic Allied armies to victory over Nazi tyranny and not long before he became the first supreme commander of NATO and then president of the United States. It\u2019s hard to imagine a leader of that stature giving in to a lawless power grab staged by the likes of Trump, Rufo, and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. Until the leadership of Columbia and other institutions recognize that the White House isn\u2019t really interested in battling antisemitism, or diversity programs, or waste in government, they will get battered and beaten every time.\n\n\u201cInstead of pandering and trying to appease the administration, they actually need to show up for their faculty, for their students, for their mission, which is education,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cEducation does not mean rolling over and censoring people to please some master or some donor. It means fighting for the right to free expression, fighting for the notion that democracy requires free and open debate. And that means people have to be free to express themselves. Columbia will get nowhere by trying to mollify the MAGAs.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Lance King/Getty Images\n\nFor 51 weeks of the year, only diehards like me (go Illini!) think or care about college basketball. While the rest of you may spend your summers outside, near, like, sand or something, fellow hoop heads and I are scouring recruiting rankings or watching grainy video of Lithuanian point guards. It\u2019s a kind of sickness. But for one week, this specific week in March: We\u2019re all a little sick.\n\nThe NCAA Tournament and all its glories \u2014 the brackets, the upsets, the earnest young people on your television painting their faces and screaming into a tuba \u2014 is upon us. Preliminary rounds take place on Tuesday and Wednesday night, and the real enchilada launches around lunchtime on Thursday. (That\u2019s when your brackets are due, so you know.) This is a particularly fascinating tournament happening at an unusually intriguing moment for college basketball, a sport that has largely been usurped by its mean older brother, college football, and yet may just end up in a stronger, more sustainable place. If you\u2019re just tuning in \u2014 and if you\u2019re reading this, you probably are \u2014 here are the biggest story lines heading into this year\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments.\n\nDuke is the favorite again \u2014 but they\u2019re a little less unlikable than usual\n\n\n\n\n\nHating Duke is as grand an NCAA tournament tradition as a buzzer-beater or \u201cOne Shining Moment\u201c: It\u2019s the default mode for every casual sports fan, and with good reason. (In case you need a fresh injection of Duke hate, here is a picture of former Duke guard Grayson Allen, who famously looks exactly like Ted Cruz and is only slightly less hateable.) And while I will never stand in the way of some old-fashioned Duke bile, it should be noted that this year\u2019s version of the Blue Devils isn\u2019t quite as loathsome as some previous vintages. They\u2019ve got three of the top eight projected picks in next year\u2019s NBA Draft, led by certain top overall pick Cooper Flagg, who has been the best player in college basketball this year by a wide margin. While Flagg certainly resembles past hateable Duke players (which is really just another way of saying he\u2019s white), he\u2019s legitimately fun to watch, and his game has earned plaudits from the toughest critics in the world: NBA players. During the Olympics warm-ups last summer, Flagg practiced against Team USA and played so well that Kevin Durant said, \u201cHe looked like a hell of a player. Somebody who\u2019s going to only get better with more experience. Seventeen years old coming in here playing like he\u2019s a vet almost.\u201d Also: He is from Maine. He\u2019s already the best player ever from Maine. I have no idea who would possibly be second. (Can Stephen King hoop?) The main reason to let up a little bit on Duke this year, though? Coach K is gone. Remember: He\u2019s not a basketball coach. He\u2019s a leader who happens to coach basketball. You can still cheer against Duke. But I suspect it won\u2019t quite have the vigor for you that it once did.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Flagg \u2014 the men\u2019s tournament finally has some star power\n\nA common criticism of men\u2019s college basketball in recent years has been its lack of stars: Four of the top six picks in last year never played college basketball at all. But that is not the case this year, largely because of NIL (which stands for \u201cname, image, and likeness,\u201d which basically stands for \u201cthe players are getting paid now\u201d): Players who might have skipped college, or played in the G-League or overseas, have learned that college is a great place to build a brand, sell some jerseys, earn some cash, and show off their stuff to scouts. Other than the Duke guys, there\u2019s Baylor\u2019s V.J. Edgecombe, Texas\u2019s Tre Johnson, Illinois\u2019s Kasparas Jakucionis, Oklahoma\u2019s Jeremiah Fears, Maryland\u2019s Derik Queen, BYU\u2019s Egor Demin, and a whole host of future NBA stars who will be a part of what is considered one of the best drafts in years. Even if you\u2019re one of those pro-basketball snobs who likes to mock the college game, if you want to see the future of the league, you\u2019ll see it in the men\u2019s tournament.\n\nThe hipster pick to win the national title has a brewing headache as a coach\n\nThe hottest team in men\u2019s college basketball down the stretch was Florida, which won its last six games and 12 of its last 13 en route to a tournament championship in the SEC, the best league in the sport this year. But the team\u2019s success wasn\u2019t the biggest news to come out of Gainesville this year. That would be Gators coach Todd Golden, who, according to a blockbuster report in the student-run Independent Florida Alligator when the season started, was accused by an \u201cundefined\u201d number of women, most of them students, of sexual harassment and stalking. The paper talked to two of the women. A sample from its report:\n\nThe first woman, a former UF student, said that Golden stalked her in person, both in his car and on foot, and that this occurred \u201cmore than ten times.\u201d On one occasion, she said she posted her location on her Instagram Story, and Golden messaged her shortly after saying that he was in the area \u201cwaiting for [her].\u201d\n\nShe also said Golden sent unsolicited photos of his genitalia to her. On multiple occasions, the first woman said she received the photos while the team was traveling on the road. The nature of Golden\u2019s alleged stalking became more assertive over time, she said. \u201cAt first, it starts off slow, like, \u2018Oh, wow. That\u2019s odd. This guy is showing us attention,\u2019\u201d the first woman said. \u201cAnd then it becomes, \u2018Wow, he\u2019s kind of crossing a line. No, he didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u2019 Then it\u2019s, \u2018Wait, he\u2019s fully stepping over that line.\u2019 Then it\u2019s, \u2018Wow, there\u2019s a picture of his dick.\u2019 It was a full grooming process with all of us.\u201d\n\n\n\nGolden, who is one of the three highest paid employees by the state of Florida, underwent a Title IX investigation, but the school closed it in January, saying it found \u201cno evidence\u201d he violated the law \u2014 though only because none of what he was accused of \u201coccurred within a university program or activity.\u201d Every men\u2019s NCAA tournament seems to include some sort of story in which a key participant is asked about an ugly scandal every time they step in front of a microphone. This year, that story involves the head coach of a team that may well win the national championship.\n\nSouth Carolina goes for the dynasty\n\nSouth Carolina, led by already legendary coach Dawn Staley, won last year\u2019s women\u2019s national championship, their second in three years and their third in the last seven tournaments. But one thing they haven\u2019t done is win two in a row \u2014 widely considered the true mark of any women\u2019s basketball dynasty. Winning multiple titles is far more difficult than it used to be, largely because of the dramatic steps forward the game has made over the past decade; there\u2019s much more talent now, and it\u2019s much more diffuse. The age of Connecticut winning four in a row is long over. But the Gamecocks are ranked No. 2 in the country and are in fact the Vegas favorite to win the whole thing. They\u2019ll have no better chance than this.\n\nPaige Bueckers tries to win her first title \u2026\n\n\u2026 In Connecticut history \u2014 and maybe all of women\u2019s college basketball history. And while she has been great, and is expected to be the first pick in this year\u2019s WNBA Draft, her career has been riddled with injuries and is even considered a letdown for one obvious reason: She has never won a title at Connecticut. The last, best Connecticut recruit before her was the legendary Breanna Stewart who, during her four years at Connecticut, won, uh, four. Bueckers is an incredible player with a long career ahead of her. But if she\u2019s unable to win a title for Connecticut, she\u2019ll inevitably, and surely unfairly, be remembered as a disappointment.\n\nCollege basketball is extremely healthy\n\nWomen\u2019s college basketball continues to explode in popularity; that we have gone this far without mentioning USC\u2019s JuJu Watkins is a sign of just how many compelling characters there are in the sport right now. But it should be noted that men\u2019s college basketball, thought by many (including me) to be facing existential peril just a year or two ago, has had a resurgent season. That\u2019s thanks largely to NIL and the transfer portal, which have made the sport attractive given some of the best players in the world in a way it had never been before. (The irony being that these were supposed to be the things killing the sport.) The tournament is always intoxicating, but the story lines, and the characters, in this year\u2019s brackets are unusually vivid and compelling. We die-hards freaks who care about this stuff all the time are glad you\u2019re here. You might just find some stuff that\u2019ll make you want to stick around."

Reilly, Erik Ortiz, Lawrence Hurley and Allan Smith\n\nThe federal judge at odds with the White House over its immigration enforcement and now the target of impeachment calls driven by President Donald Trump is a bipartisan appointee whose three-decade career in Washington, D.C., has included cases that have favored Trump.\n\nJames Boasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia since 2023, drew Trump\u2019s ire after he temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s effort to carry out migrant deportations by plane over the weekend under a rarely used wartime law.\n\nIn an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News, Trump mentioned impeaching Boasberg, whom he slighted as a \u201clocal judge.\u201d Trump earlier pressed for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment in a social media post and branded him a \u201cradical left lunatic, a troublemaker and agitator.\u201d\n\nThose who know Boasberg and his record insist he is anything but.\n\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush nominated Boasberg as an associate judge of the D.C. Superior Court. In 2011, President Barack Obama selected him to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and he was confirmed by the Senate in a 96-0 vote.\n\nA Washington attorney who frequently appeared before Boasberg, 62, called him an \u201cextremely conscientious\u201d judge who was \u201cvery much down the center\u201d and committed to getting things right.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s known among lawyers and his colleagues to be a brilliant judge,\u201d the lawyer said, speaking anonymously to avoid being seen as pandering to the judge.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nRelated: Judge warns of possible \u2018consequences\u2019 after DOJ push back on questions about deportation flights, Gary Grumbach, Megan Lebowitz and Dareh Gregorian\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWhat the JFK files do \u2013 and don't \u2013 reveal\n\nBy Andrea Mitchell\n\nScholars and conspiracy theorists have spent the last 24 hours going through unannotated PDFs, including some illegible handwritten notes from the FBI and the CIA, about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nPrompted in part by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson\u2019s and his own affinity for the Kennedy assassination, Trump signed an executive order on his fourth day in office to release as many as 80,000 pages of documents from the JFK files in the National Archives, unredacted, a process that began Tuesday evening. During his first visit this week to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which Trump has taken over as chair, he told a reporter, \u201cYou got a lot of reading.\u201d\n\nWhat has been delivered so far has fallen far short of the promise. In the pages that have been released, many of which involved grand jury testimony and tax filings, information was still redacted. None of the documents were catalogued or annotated. And much of what the pages contained was already known from other sources.\n\nThe documents did include surveillance reports on Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s trips to the Soviet Union and Finland, his months spent in Mexico City leading up to the assassination and his anger at Kennedy when he was denied a visa to Cuba, where he wanted to defect.\n\nAnd there is fascinating new material about a covert CIA operation in New York City during the Cold War to open as many as a half-million letters and packages a month to and from the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nWill the release of the JFK files ultimately resolve more than 60 years of doubts about the Warren Report\u2019s conclusion that Oswald acted alone? It\u2019s not likely.\n\nExperts like the University of Virginia\u2019s Larry Sabato said the CIA withheld other documents from the National Archives that weren\u2019t subject to the Trump-ordered release. Other materials, including FBI surveillance recordings of Oswald, have been destroyed.\n\n\u201cI believe Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots. I think all the evidence points in that direction.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants while refusing to reveal their identities or the evidence against them, prompting complaints from the migrants\u2019 families and from critics who say the administration is trampling on civil liberties.\n\nThe administration says its invocation of a rarely used wartime authority to speed up deportations serves to protect Americans from the \u201cextraordinary threat\u201d posed by suspected gang members who the president has designated as foreign terrorists.\n\nBut administration officials have provided little information that could allow outsiders to independently assess its claims that scores of immigrants who were deported from the country last weekend are affiliated with violent gangs or have extensive criminal records.\n\nSome relatives of the presumed deported migrants, meanwhile, have described a murky and ham-fisted process that disappeared people they say have no ties to organized crime, leaving them isolated from loved ones and legal advocates.\n\nAsked Wednesday by a reporter why the administration wouldn\u2019t share basic information about the detainees, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would not \u201creveal operational details about a counter-terrorism operation,\u201d but added it has \u201cthe highest degree of confidence in our ICE agents.\u201d\n\nYet earlier in that same briefing, Leavitt touted the capture in Mexico of Francisco Javier Rom\u00e1n-Bardales, an alleged senior member of MS-13 who is expected to be delivered to the United States to face charges that include conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists.\n\nThe weekend deportations were roundly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups who accused the administration of acting outside its authority.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said Trump\u2019s administration was \u201cdeporting immigrants without due process, based solely on their nationality.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourts determine whether people have broken the law,\u201d the senator said on X. \u201cNot a President acting solo\u2026 and not immigration agents cherry-picking who gets imprisoned or deported.\u201d\n\nIn a declaration filed in federal court earlier this week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said agents \u201ccarefully vetted\u201d the gang affiliations of each of the 261 deportees and provided broad descriptions of crimes that several of them have been arrested for or convicted of in the United States and abroad.\n\nBut in that same declaration, ICE Acting Field Office Director Robert L. Cerna acknowledged that many of the deportees \u201cdo not have criminal records in the United States.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is because they have only been in the United States for a short period of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat,\u201d Cerna wrote in the declaration, saying the dearth of information about them instead \u201cactually highlights the risk they pose. \u2026 It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\u201d\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request asking them to provide identifying information about some of the migrants described in that declaration. But the governments of both the United States and El Salvador have released videos that depict some of them. The mother of one of the presumed deportees told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that she recognized her son in media released by the Salvadoran government and denied he belonged to any gang.\n\nIn what it described as an effort at transparency, the Trump administration provided a breakdown of the 261 immigrants who were deported to a prison in El Salvador under an agreement with the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele. The administration said 137 of those immigrants were deported pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law which grants the president broad authority to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation during wartime.\n\nThe invocation of that law set up an ongoing showdown between the executive and judicial branches that could plunge the United States into a constitutional crisis if the Trump administration decides to openly defy a court order. Trump has said in recent interviews that he wouldn\u2019t do so.\n\nA judge over the weekend temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s ability to invoke that law to quickly deport migrants, causing Trump to suggest that judge should be impeached. Trump\u2019s statements about the judge in turn caused Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare rebuke of the president.\n\nAnother 101 of the immigrants were Venezuelans who were being expelled under regular immigration laws, officials said. And the other 23 were members of MS-13, another gang.\n\nTrump has suggested that the United States is being invaded by foreign criminal organizations including Tren de Aragua, whose members he has designated as foreign terrorists.\n\nThe administration has faced other questions about whether it has overstated the risks posed by some deportees. Senior Trump administration officials previously said that the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay would be reserved for the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d but court declarations from administration officials would later reveal dozens of people held at the base were considered low-to-medium risk.\n\nCNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report."

The scrub goes well beyond just the removal of images from the Pentagon\u2019s visual database, known as DVIDS, and includes articles from across more than 1,000 websites hosted by the department.\n\nThe Pentagon previously said in a memo last month that it would be removing news and feature articles promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) content.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said in a statement Wednesday that the Defense Department was \u201cpleased by the rapid compliance\u201d across the Pentagon with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms.\n\n\u201cIn the rare cases that content is removed \u2013 either deliberately or by mistake \u2013 that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content so it recognizes our heroes for their dedicated service alongside their fellow Americans, period.\u201d\n\nBut dozens of the articles either flagged for removal or removed already \u2014 but still accessible via the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback machine \u2014 and reviewed by CNN have no ostensible connection to DEI programs; race theory; gender ideology or identity-based programs.\n\nAt least half a dozen articles already removed are about the Holocaust and now have the word \u201cDEI\u201d in their URL.\n\nThose include an article about Holocaust survivor Kitty Saks, which remembers the Holocaust as \u201cthe state-sponsored, systemic persecution and annihilation of European Jewry\u201d; an article about Holocaust Remembrance Week; and an article titled \u201cA Cadet\u2019s Perspective: Holocaust Days of Remembrance.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, told CNN that \u201cwe are concerned by reports that the Department of Defense has removed Holocaust-related content, including survivor stories, under the label of \u2018DEI.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHonoring the memory of the Holocaust and those who survived is not a matter of political ideology \u2014 it is a moral imperative and a vital component of education, remembrance, and the fight against antisemitism,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cThe history of the Holocaust, including the liberation of the camps, also reflects the bravery and sacrifice of Allied soldiers \u2014 a legacy that should be preserved, not erased. We urge the DoD to reverse this decision and preserve these vital historical records.\u201d\n\nThis photo from the US Air Force shows Kitty Saks, a Holocaust survivor, displaying the star she wore during the Holocaust to distinguish her Jewish faith in her home in Norfolk, Virginia, in April 2016. An article about Saks posted to a US Air Force website has been removed as part of the Pentagon's effort to remove \"news and feature articles promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) content.\" This photo is still available on the military's Defense Visual Information Distribution Service. Airman 1st Class Kaylee Dubois/US Air Force/DVIDS\n\nArticles related to September 11 remembrance, including service members reflecting on their service and where they were that day, have also been removed. So have articles about cancer awareness, including those related to Breast Cancer Awareness month and colon cancer awareness.\n\nOne such article authored by an Air Force Surgeon General titled, \u201cA healthy lifestyle lowers your risk of getting breast cancer,\u201d was removed and now has \u201cDEI\u201d in its URL.\n\nSeveral articles about sexual assault have also been removed and now have \u201cDEI\u201d in their URL, including \u201cApril is Sexual Assault Awareness Month\u201d and \u201cA call to action \u2013 Three ways to combat sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThis webpage, which previously hosted an article titled, \"Sexual Assault Response Coordinator focused on victim care,\" has been removed and replaced with a \"Page Not Found\" message. From US Air Force Homestead Air Reserve Base\n\nArticles about suicide prevention have been purged, too, including ones titled: \u201cVA releases veteran suicide statistics by state\u201d; \u201cSuicide prevention alliance focuses on troops, veterans\u201d; and \u201cSuicide Prevention Resources That Can Help.\u201d The latter two articles now feature \u201cDEI\u201d in their URLs.\n\nThe content either removed or flagged for removal also includes thousands of articles about contributions made to the military over the years by women, LGBTQ people, people of color and historical figures like Jackie Robinson, who served in the US military during World War II.\n\nMuch of the content has been scrubbed not by individual units, but by an automated script run by DoD\u2019s public web administrators, according to an email explaining the process that was obtained by CNN and three defense officials familiar with the matter. That appears to align with Hegseth\u2019s February 27 memo, which said that DoD\u2019s media arm, Defense Media Activity, \u201cwill support systematic content removal\u201d from across the Pentagon\u2019s many platforms.\n\nThat automated process has led to \u201ca high level of irresponsible collateral damage,\u201d one of the defense officials said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the scope and the carelessness of \u2018unpublishing\u2019 that\u2019s happened,\u201d the official said.\n\nAnother of the defense officials said that the Pentagon understands that the process needs a significant course-correction and is now undergoing a more thorough review of what has been purged to determine if it should be republished.\n\n\u201cBecause of these series of events, the department recognizes that this needs to be a more deliberative process involving human beings to ensure that a thorough review of content is completed,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis may take more time than originally planned.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff delivered the letter to the president of the United Arab Emirates Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan while he was in Abu Dhabi last week, the source said. The UAE later gave the letter to the Iranians.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump made it clear to Ayatollah Khamenei that he wanted to resolve the dispute over Iran\u2019s nuclear program diplomatically \u2013 and very soon \u2013 and if this was not possible, there would be other ways to resolve the dispute,\u201d a spokesman for the National Security Council Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN.\n\nAxios was the first to report on the contents of the letter.\n\nTrump also discussed a potential nuclear deal with Iran during his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, according to a White House readout of the call.\n\nThe readout stated that Trump and Putin \u201cspoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts. They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel,\u201d the readout continued.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump told Fox News that there \u201care two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I\u2019m not looking to hurt Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I hope you\u2019re going to negotiate, because it\u2019s going to be a lot better for Iran,\u2019 and I think they want to get that letter \u2013 the alternative is we have to do something, because you can\u2019t let them have a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump added.\n\nIt is unclear how the US would respond if Iran fails to enter direct talks regarding its nuclear program. However, senior US officials have not ruled out potential military action, whether through the US or Israel, on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in the future.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Trump withdrew from the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and ordered a US-led strike on Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, leading to further backlash from Tehran.\n\nTrump, in his second term, has returned to his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Iran, in an effort to isolate the country economically and diplomatically.\n\nKhamenei recently said calls for negotiations by \u201cbully states\u201d are aimed at dominating others, not resolving issues.\n\n\u201cThe insistence on the part of some bully states on negotiations is not to resolve issues, but to dominate and impose their own expectations,\u201d Khamenei said this month, as cited by Iranian state media outlets."

The researchers have also lost access to all critical resources, like satellite imaging, needed to collect evidence of war crimes.\n\nThe database included information not only on the abduction of the Ukrainian children, but on other Russian war crimes as well: attacks on energy infrastructure, attacks on civilian infrastructure, and destruction of cultural sites, the source said.\n\nThe database was specifically structured to pull together relevant elements for prosecution of war crimes, the source said. It is unclear who has access to the database, what will happen to the critical evidence it holds, and whether it will be able to be shared with the entities like the European Union law enforcement agency Europol.\n\nAccording to the letter from House lawmakers, Yale\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) \u2013 which had been conducting research for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory \u2013 \u201ccompiled three reports, sourced from satellite imagery and biometric data, tracking identities and locations of over 30,000 children from Ukraine at dozens of locations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis data is absolutely crucial to Ukraine\u2019s efforts to return their children home,\u201d the lawmakers said in the letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Wednesday.\n\nThe importance of returning \u201cthe forcibly transferred Ukrainian children\u201d was a key topic in the meeting between top US and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah earlier this month, according to a joint statement after the meeting. In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Wednesday, President Donald Trump asked \u201cabout the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted,\u201d according to a statement about the call. \u201cPresident Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s letter, led by Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, noted that the evidence was being preserved \u201cto be shared with Europol and the government of Ukraine to secure their return.\u201d\n\n\u201cYale HRL\u2019s funding has been terminated and the status of the secure evidence repository is unknown. This vital resource cannot be lost,\u201d it said.\n\nThe lawmakers said they have \u201creason to believe that the data from the repository has been permanently deleted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf true, this would have devastating consequences,\u201d wrote the 17 lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.\n\nBruce and another State Department spokesperson said the data had not been deleted.\n\n\u201cThe State Department does not hold the data for the Conflict Observatory. The data resides on a platform owned by MITRE as part of the program,\u201d the unnamed spokesperson said, referring questions to the non-profit organization MITRE.\n\n\u201cTo the best of MITRE\u2019s knowledge and belief, the research data that was compiled has not been deleted and is currently maintained by a former partner on this contract. Department of State has been made aware of data disposition,\u201d MITRE told CNN."

            "full_content": "TORONTO -- China executed an unspecified number of Canadians earlier this year, Canada's government said Wednesday. Such executions of Westerners are relatively rare.\n\nCanada's Global Affairs office declined to say how many people or give names. Beijing's embassy in Ottawa said the executions were due to drug crimes but declined to provide details. The embassy noted that China does not recognize dual citizenship.\n\n\u201cCanada repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere,\u201d Global Affairs spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said in a statement.\n\nMacLeod said they continue to provide consular assistance to families and requested that media respect their privacy. She said Ottawa continues to advocate for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian who was sentenced to death for drug smuggling.\n\n\u201cChina always impose severe penalties on drug-related crimes,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said. \u201cThe facts of the crimes committed by the Canadian nationals involved in the cases are clear, and the evidence is solid and sufficient.\u201d\n\nChina is believed to execute more prisoners each year than the rest of the world combined, though the total is a state secret. Executions are traditionally carried out by gunshot, though lethal injections have been introduced in recent years.\n\nThe embassy spokesperson said Beijing \u201cfully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned,\" and urged Canada's government to \u201cstop making irresponsible remarks.\u201d\n\nThe two countries have some tensions. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports earlier this month, after Canada imposed duties in October on Chinese-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminum products. The tariffs add to global trade tensions amid rounds of tariff announcements by the United States, China, Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cChina is sending us a message that we have to take steps if we want to see an improvement in the relationship,\u201d said a former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques.\n\nChina is Canada\u2019s second largest trading partner, but relations been bad since Canadian authorities in 2018 arrested a former Huawei executive who the U.S. had charged with fraud.\n\nChina jailed two Canadians shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, on a U.S. extradition request. They were sent back to Canada in 2021, the same day Meng returned to China after reaching a deal with U.S. authorities in her case.\n\nMany countries called China\u2019s action \u201chostage politics,\u201d while China described the charges against Huawei and Meng as a politically motivated attempt to hold back China\u2019s economic and technological development."

            "full_content": "Come together \u2026 over me! Photo: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen you think about it, J.D. Vance has one of the tougher jobs in American politics: being the faithful understudy to the greatest narcissist ever to hold the presidency. Not only must he support the Sun King through thick and through thin, he must also avoid stealing any of the limelight from the jealous god who lifted him to the Senate with a crucial endorsement and then to his current position as heir apparent. Vance\u2019s role as initiator in the Oval Office mugging of Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a job well done; the subtext of the whole incident was the Ukrainian president\u2019s lack of gratitude to Donald Trump.\n\nWhat is apparently Vance\u2019s next major chore for his benefactor is even more crucial, and better yet, isn\u2019t likely to attract too many flattering headlines: He\u2019s appointed himself the healer of the MAGA movement\u2019s breach between \u201cpopulists\u201d and the billionaire tech bros who helped finance the Trump-Vance campaign and are now dictating a vast number of public policies.\n\nAs Vance himself suggested in a \u201cunity\u201d speech he delivered during a conference organized by the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, he is \u201ca proud member of both tribes.\u201d After all, he came to national notoriety as the embodiment of the struggling white working class via his Hillbilly Elegy memoir, but then became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and beneficiary of Silicon Valley reactionary pioneer Peter Thiel, who blazed the path to MAGA prominence now trod by Elon Musk and so many others. He\u2019ll need both \u201cwings\u201d of the movement if he wants to succeed Trump as MAGA chieftain and president. And he can also do his boss a solid by quieting some of the infighting that bubbles beneath the surface of Team Trump\u2019s aggressive pursuit of its agenda.\n\nThe most notable public indication of the rift occurred last December, when a spat broke out between populist social-media figure Laura Loomer and DOGE co-founder Vivek Ramaswamy over the obscure but highly symbolic issue of H1-B visas, which are issued to attract highly skilled immigrants, particularly in the technology field. Ramaswamy inflamed the dispute by arguing that H1-Bs were made necessary by the inferior quality of American labor. But then his buddy and DOGE rival Musk stepped in and escalated matters as only he could do in a response to a tweet from a Loomer ally:\n\nThe reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.\n\n\n\nTake a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot\u2026 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 28, 2024\n\nThen Steve Bannon, the OG populist of MAGA-land, counter-escalated, as my colleague Chas Danner noted at the time:\n\nBannon, posting on right-wing X competitor Gettr, screencapped Musk\u2019s tweet and added, \u201cSomeone please notify \u2018Child Protective Services\u2019 \u2014 need to do a \u2018wellness check\u2019 on this toddler.\u201d\n\nBannon later told an Italian newspaper: \u201cHe is a truly evil guy, a very bad guy. I made it my personal thing to take this guy down.\u201d\n\nAs things threatened to spin out of control on the very brink of Trump\u2019s triumphal return to power, Trump signaled agreement with Musk and Ramaswamy on H1-B visas, and the \u201cMAGA civil war\u201d died down. But given the new administration\u2019s assault on nearly every form of legal as well as illegal immigration, the issue may not have gone away forever.\n\nAt the conference, as Politico reported, Vance asked populists and tech bros to keep their eyes on the prize: their common enemies.\n\nBoth our working people, our populists and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy\u201d \u2014 namely \u201c40 years of failed economic policies\u201d that enabled globalization \u2014 and the same goal: a \u201cgreat American industrial renaissance\u201d that uses innovation to boost worker productivity and drives wage gains.\n\nAs the New York Times noted, the veep argued Trump\u2019s agenda would scratch backs on both sides of the populist/tech-bro barricades. \u201cWe can only win by doing what we always did,\u201d he said. \u201cProtecting our workers and supporting our innovators, and doing both of those things at the same time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s easier said than done. Much of what the \u201cinnovators\u201d are trying to accomplish via DOGE and legislation in Congress involves their triune goals of deep tax cuts, deregulation, and slashing federal spending, including popular services and benefits. Yes, \u201cworkers\u201d may be cut in on some of the bonanza via tax breaks on tips, overtime work, and Social Security benefits. And everyone in MAGA-land can celebrate the pain of \u201cdeep state\u201d bureaucrats and woke university administrators. But ultimately the tech-bro vision of a nation largely run like a corporation by their own selves, deploying AI and discarding excess labor as inefficient, isn\u2019t compatible with any kind of \u201cpopulism.\u201d And conversely, the protectionism and nativism beloved of right-wing populists everywhere and at every time is not really compatible with the so-called innovators\u2019 thirst for free-flowing capital and inexpensive labor.\n\nThe other problem with Vance\u2019s plan to keep the two MAGA wings yoked to the same team is that tensions will likely intensify if, as seems likely, Trump\u2019s agenda becomes increasingly unpopular among the general public. How much political capital will populists want to expend on maximizing high-end tax cuts or slashing their own federal benefits? How hard will tech bros fight for high tariffs that upset their Wall Street colleagues and allies? Will populists go to the wall to defend Elon Musk, who considers beneficiaries of wildly popular entitlement programs \u201cthe parasite class\u201d? How long with tech bros hide their contempt for blue-collar workers as anything other than cannon fodder in their war with government and any sense of collective responsibility?\n\nVance has a tough row to hoe in keeping these people together, but it\u2019s a job he does need to undertake if he wants to inherit a winning coalition in 2028."

            "full_content": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy speaks at a press conference at the Department of Transportation on March 11, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Photo: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration once again has the MTA in its sights.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy wrote a letter to MTA chairman and CEO Janno Lieber, directing him to share the agency\u2019s plans to address crime and public safety on its system. The missive came with a threat. Duffy warned Lieber to respond promptly or risk the federal government withholding funds from the MTA.\n\nIn the letter, Duffy said that the agency \u201cmust ensure a safe and clean environment, reduce crime and fare evasion, and maintain a safe operating system\u201d for its riders, noting that there\u2019ve been several high-profile incidents on the subway. The Transportation secretary then requested that the MTA provide its plans to reduce crime and specific concerns such as transit-workers assaults, fare evasion, and subway surfing and statistics related to those incidents. He also asked for the MTA to detail the funds allocated to those measures.\n\nDuffy said the agency must respond by a March 31 deadline to \u201cavoid further [Federal Transit Administration] enforcement actions up to and including redirecting or withholding funding.\u201d\n\nThe MTA\u2019s letter closely resembles ones sent by the department to Washington, D.C., mayor Muriel Bowser as well as the CEOs of Amtrak and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, or WMATA, the main transit agency in D.C. In those messages, Duffy similarly requested risk assessments and plans to reduce crime and protect riders and transit workers.\n\nMuch of the information that Duffy is requesting is already publicly available through the NYPD, which publishes transit-crime reports, as well as through the MTA, which shares recordings and associated documents from its board meetings and publicizes its funding data. Recent statistics don\u2019t appear to support Duffy\u2019s contention of a transit system out of control. Earlier this month, the NYPD reported a 15 percent decrease in subway crime in February compared to the previous year. That figure follows a reported steep 36.4 percent drop in January.\n\nThe agency relies heavily on federal funding. The MTA previously unveiled its four-year $68 million capital plan, which anticipates $14 billion of that total coming from federal money and grants, per the Daily News.\n\nJohn McCarthy, MTA\u2019s chief of policy and external relations, said in a statement that the agency is ready to discuss its crime-reduction efforts with the federal government. \u201cThe good news is numbers are moving in the right direction: Crime is down 40 percent compared to the same period in 2020 right before the pandemic, and so far in 2025 there are fewer daily major crimes in transit than any non-pandemic year ever. Moreover, in the second half of last year subway-fare evasion was down 25 percent after increasing dramatically during COVID,\u201d he said, per CBS News.\n\nThis warning from Duffy is just the latest in the Trump administration\u2019s focus on the MTA. In February, the Transportation Department officially revoked federal approval for New York City\u2019s congestion-pricing program, setting a March 21 deadline for the tolling to end. However, the MTA immediately challenged the government\u2019s move in court with Governor Kathy Hochul making it clear that congestion pricing will continue until the matter is heard. \u201cThe cameras are staying on,\u201d she said."

            "full_content": "Brazilian Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro, announced on Tuesday that he will seek political asylum in the United States.\n\nBolsonaro, who has been in the U.S. since February, made the announcement in an interview with CNN Brasil. He said that he will request asylum on the grounds that he is the target of a persecution campaign led by Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Minister Alexandre de Moraes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a flight back to Brazil. I have to apply for political asylum to the U.S. government,\u201d Bolsonaro told the outlet.\n\n\u201cBrazil is no longer a democracy. It\u2019s not possible for a parliamentarian to lose his passport for what he says. Where is parliamentary immunity?\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not going to subject myself to this and remain under the thumb of Alexandre de Moraes. I\u2019m taking my leave to represent the interests of my constituents, those who voted for me.\u201d\n\nIn late February, a group of legislators from the ruling leftist Workers\u2019 Party (PT) formally requested that local authorities investigate Bolsonaro and seize his passport for allegedly committing \u201ccrimes against sovereignty\u201d and criticizing the STF alongside U.S. congressmen. The leftists accused Bolsonaro at the time of allegedly \u201cconspiring\u201d with U.S. legislators against the Brazilian judiciary.\n\nThe group\u2019s accusations came shortly after the House Judiciary Committee passed the \u201cNo Censors on our Shores Act,\u201d a piece of legislation that aims to codify into law provisions to bar or deport foreign government officials from the United States if they engage in official acts that violate the First Amendment rights of Americans.\n\nHours before his conversation with CNN Brasil, Eduardo Bolsonaro announced through a video on his personal X account that he would take an unpaid leave of absence from Congress to dedicate himself to seeking \u201cthe appropriate sanctions for those who violate human rights,\u201d specifically mentioning de Moraes.\n\n\u201cHere, in the United States of America, I will focus on seeking justice and the proper punishments for Alexandre de Moraes and his FBI destachment [sic] who blindly follow his illegal orders like Gestapo,\u201d Bolsonaro said in the video. \u201cYou, jellyfish man, small and vain, are not used to dealing with men of conviction.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought you could blackmail me with the benefits and privileges of the politics, but you couldn\u2019t have been more wrong,\u201d the congressman continued. \u201cThe best parliamentarians, those truly called, are not caricatures clinging to bureaucrats\u2019 titles. I ponder and resign to the law of despondence to stay strong to my mission.\u201d\n\nReferring to the request to have his passport seized, Bolsonaro asserted that everyone in Brazil \u201cknows\u201d that de Moraes is \u201ccapable of doing anything, even when it\u2019s clearly illegal or unconstitutional.\u201d He said that if de Moraes wants to seize his passport \u201cor even arrest me so that I can no longer report his crimes in the United States, then this is precisely where I will stay and work harder than ever.\u201d\n\nHours after Bolsonaro posted the video, Brazil\u2019s top court justice ruled to deny the request filed by the Workers\u2019 Party lawmakers on the grounds that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office \u2014 the Brazilian authority exclusively responsible for bringing charges or requesting that an investigation be closed \u2014 was against seizing the congressman\u2019s passport. Brazilian Prosecutor General Paulo Gonet argued that the complaint filed by the leftists did not contain the minimum elements to justify opening an investigation.\n\nIn an interview with the Brazilian outlet Revista Oeste on Tuesday, Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 the conservative former president of Brazil \u2014 said that he would rather see his son free in the U.S. than persecuted in his native country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather he was free in the United States than being threatened here in Brazil. And what we try to do, he will have my full support. He can continue,\u201d Bolsonaro stated. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not in charge of him anymore \u2014 he\u2019s 42, 43 years old \u2014 but he\u2019s doing an excellent job there and will continue to do an excellent job for us here in Brazil.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the federal deputy who received the most votes in the history of Brazil is forced to choose between exile or prison, this country can no longer be called a democracy,\u201d Bolsonaro said in a separate statement posted to his social media. \u201cWhen the law gives way to persecution, what we have is open tyranny \u2013 and now the whole world is paying attention.\u201d\n\nFormer President Bolsonaro was formally charged in February with allegedly plotting to poison current radical leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and stage a \u201ccoup\u201d following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. De Moraes, alongside other members of Brazil\u2019s top court, will rule on March 25 to determine if Bolsonaro will stand trial. On Sunday, Jair Bolsonaro claimed that he had no plans to flee Brazil to avoid a possible arrest ordered by the STF.\n\nBrazilian lawmakers may take a leave of absence of up to 120 days (four months) per legislative session without losing their mandate. CNN Brasil reported on Wednesday morning that Eduardo Bolsonaro\u2019s seat in the Brazilian House of Representatives will be occupied by Missionary Jos\u00e9 Ol\u00edmpio of the conservative Liberal Party (PL) once Bolsonaro is absent for more than 120 days.\n\nChristian K.

            "full_content": "Photo: Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times/Redux\n\nFor the first time in two decades, it is impossible to predict who the next Democratic nominee for president might be. Three straight election cycles produced three flawed nominees who were firmly backed by their predecessors. Hillary Clinton was Barack Obama\u2019s preferred successor, and led in just about every single poll over her theoretical and literal competition. Joe Biden seized the nomination four years later, thanks in part to Obama\u2019s 11th-hour intervention to force several competitive center-left candidates, including Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, out of the primary ahead of Super Tuesday. In 2024, following Biden\u2019s implosion, Kamala Harris became the first Democratic nominee in more than a half-century to achieve that status without winning a vote in any of the primaries.\n\nNow it\u2019s all blown open. This makes some Democrats nervous. The party is bereft of a single leader and seems adrift, struggling to respond to Trump\u2019s assaults on the federal bureaucracy and the civil rights of legal residents. The party itself, in most polling, is widely unpopular, and no single course of action feels especially satisfying. Many Democrats wanted Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to refuse to help Republicans keep the government open. His decision to pass a continuing resolution with GOP support has enraged many elected Democrats and activists, especially on the left. But Schumer understood the alternative was no better: Trump and Elon Musk might have reveled in a shutdown, using it as a pretext to purge enormous numbers of government workers. Ken Martin, the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, doesn\u2019t seem like the sort of inspirational figure capable of leading the party out of the wilderness.\n\nBut the state of play isn\u2019t as grim as it looks. The shadow primary underway for 2028 is exactly what Democrats need: a robust contest over ideology and ideas that will be waged in the public square. The best Democrat will win. It was under these conditions that Barack Obama, still in his first term in national office, ascended to the presidency. Since then, for a variety of reasons, Democrats have been allergic to such competition.\n\nIt will be the most public and natural way to define what the future of the Democratic Party might look like. There will be no single interest group or power broker who can boost one candidate to victory at the expense of the rest of the field. Centrist, progressive, populist, or something else entirely \u2014 all ideological factions will get the open playing field. When George W. Bush defeated John Kerry in 2004, there were very few pundits calling for the Democratic Party to nominate a Black former law professor who was strongly opposed to the Iraq War. The primary sorted that out. Now, Democrats will get that opportunity again.\n\nThere\u2019s a long roster of governors, senators, members of Congress, and celebrities who can take the plunge. A short list includes Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, Maryland governor Wes Moore, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, and California governor Gavin Newsom. Senator Christopher Murphy of Connecticut and Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley congressman, seem likely to announce. For Democrats hungry for wealthy, famous outsiders, billionaire Mark Cuban and Stephen A. Smith, the ESPN commentator, could be viable. Pete Buttigieg will probably run again. Both Harris and her old running mate, Tim Walz, might be in the mix. For those nostalgic for bruising centrists, Rahm Emmanuel is floating a trial balloon.\n\nTim Walz and Rahm Emmanuel are very different kinds of Democrats, as are Ro Khanna and Andy Beshear. Democratic voters will get to decide, fully, what the future of their party will look like. It will not be a sham primary like 2024, when it was left to Dean Phillips to wage a hopeless campaign against Biden, or even 2016, when Clinton had hoovered up so much institutional backing that only Bernie Sanders, a septuagenarian from Vermont, could wage a viable campaign. This will be much more wide open. Republicans, in 2015 and 2016, did not quite imagine their party would be remade in the image of Trump \u2014 that is the messy side of democracy, after all, the outside agent who proves more popular than the institutional insiders. But a fear of a Democratic Trump isn\u2019t an excuse to avoid competition. All of this is healthy.\n\nIf Harris, for example, wants to be the nominee once more, let her get battle-tested with a long primary through the early voting states. Primaries are vital for shaping candidates: They learn, like Obama once did, to charm voters on an intimate level and sharpen their arguments for why they should lead the most powerful nation on Earth. Considering the stakes for 2028, when the Democratic nominee is likely to be pitted against J.D. Vance or another Trump-aligned Republican, the party can\u2019t afford to trot out another middling contender who will dodge the media and fail to make a coherent case for themselves. In the meantime, the 2028 primary will allow the eventual nominee to emerge organically and excite, on a grassroots level, an electorate that is going to be deeply weary of Trump.\n\nOne question hanging over the primary that Martin at the DNC will have to resolve is which states vote first. In 2024, Biden reengineered the primary calendar to drop the Iowa caucuses from the start of voting and make South Carolina, not New Hampshire, the very first state to vote. This enraged Democrats in the Granite State who have touted their first-in-the-nation status for decades. Biden boosted South Carolina as a favor to his close ally, Jim Clyburn, and as a way to ensure a primary threat against him was blunted. There was also a social-justice thrust for backing South Carolina, since the state\u2019s Democratic electorate is largely Black. The trouble with keeping South Carolina at the front of the calendar is the state\u2019s actual conservatism: If Black voters lean left, South Carolina itself hasn\u2019t backed a Democrat in a general election since Jimmy Carter. Labor unions were also uncomfortable with the South Carolina pick because the state itself is fiercely anti-union.\n\nEither way, Martin will be free to make the decision without interference from any of the Democratic grandees of the recent past, whether it be Biden, Obama, the Clintons, or Harris. The older generation will be unable to dominate the future affairs of the party. This is how it should be."

            "full_content": "Believe it or not, the president and the chief justice aren\u2019t on the same page when it comes to the powers of the judiciary. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThanks to the abject subservience of Republicans in Congress and the powerlessness of Democrats, it\u2019s been obvious for a while that the federal courts represent the only challenge to the Trump agenda of mass firings and terminations of federal programs, mass deportations of immigrants, and other radical steps beyond the traditional scope of presidential powers. Thus, unsurprisingly, MAGA world is full of talk about impeaching the judges getting in their way. Elon Musk led the way, as Democracy Docket noted earlier this month:\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk in recent weeks has raged in a blizzard of social media posts at federal judges who have ruled against his efforts to disembowel the government and executive orders issued by President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis evil judge must be fired!\u201d he said last month on his social media platform while sharing a photograph of a judge. \u201cThe only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,\u201d he said in another post last week.\n\nCongressional Republicans, of course, have leapt onto the crazy train, as the New York Times observed:\n\nHouse Republicans have filed articles of impeachment against federal judges whom they portrayed as impediments to Mr. Trump, accusing them of acting corruptly in thwarting the administration.\n\n\u201cIf these partisan judges want to be politicians, they should resign and run for office,\u201d said Representative Eli Crane, Republican of Arizona, in filing articles of impeachment against Judge Paul A. Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The judge, who was placed on the bench by President Barack Obama in 2011, had temporarily barred those working for Mr. Musk\u2019s government review team from accessing sensitive Treasury Department records. \u2026\n\nSenator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said in a social media post that \u201ccorrupt judges should be impeached and removed\u201d after earlier suggesting that rulings against the administration smacked of a \u2018judicial coup.\u201d\n\nAnd now, Trump himself has lost his mind over D.C. District Court Judge James Boasberg\u2019s attempted interference with his administration\u2019s deportation of Venezuelans. Initially the Justice Department just asked the court of appeals that supervises Boasberg to reassign the case to another judge. But its boss in the White House wants him removed from the bench entirely, as he demanded in an unhinged Truth Social post:\n\nThis \u201ccan no one rid me of this meddlesome judge?\u201d cry of anguish drew an immediate response from Trump\u2019s faithful servants in Congress, as The Hill reported: \u201cRep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) introduced a resolution to impeach U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who over the weekend ordered the Trump administration to halt deportations of Venezuelans whom it said were gang members.\u201d\n\nThere was enough smoke here that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts felt constrained to advise the world in a March 18 statement that impeaching federal judges because you don\u2019t like their rulings is not appropriate:\n\nFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\n\nThe contrast in tone between the president and the chief justice did not go unnoticed by attorney Ken White at Bluesky:\n\nTrump: the streets will run like rivers with the blood of my enemies. Their heads on spikes will adorn Congress and every federal building and court.\n\nChief Justice Roberts: Actually the GSA is in charge of federal court decorations in consultation with the judicial counsel\n\nBut more to the point, any impeachment drive aimed at federal judges who annoy Trump isn\u2019t going to go very far, at least under the current U.S. Constitution. It would take every bit of Trump leverage available to get articles of impeachment aimed at a judge through the closely divided U.S. House. And as Politico reports, House GOP leaders view the idea as an annoying \u201cdistraction,\u201d even though they dare not denounce it publicly:\n\n[P]rivately there is dread inside Johnson\u2019s leadership circle about the prospect of having to pursue messy, certain-to-fail impeachments that could ultimately backfire on the GOP\u2019s razor-thin majority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d said a senior House Republican aide. \u201cThere aren\u2019t the votes.\u201d\n\nBut the bigger reason it isn\u2019t happening involves the Senate: As Democrats learned after impeaching Trump himself twice, getting the two-thirds vote necessary for a conviction (and removal from office) in the Senate against the wishes of one of the two major parties is well-nigh impossible. Perhaps some of the machers of Team Trump don\u2019t understand that:\n\nThis is a judicial coup.\n\n\n\nWe need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore rule of the people. https://t.co/arUq1FApRq \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 19, 2025\n\nIt\u2019s 67 senators to convict, and that\u2019s on impeachment articles first passed by the House.\n\nIgnorance aside, what\u2019s the point of all the impeaching judges talk? It\u2019s probably designed to intimidate judges who may fear for their lives if not for their lifetime appointments, while giving MAGA yahoos a big if not exactly new enemy to deplore. There is, after all, an ancient history in this country of populist politicians of both the left and the right fulminating against the unelected tyrants of the judiciary. The more alarming possibility, however, is that Trump, Musk, and congressional Republicans are laying the groundwork for a future refusal to obey court orders. Then we\u2019ll have the constitutional crisis that has always loomed over the reign of a president who believes he embodies the nation and stands above all laws."

            "full_content": "Istanbul \u2014 Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.\n\nThe state-run Anadolu news agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.\n\nAuthorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.\n\nRiot police officers stand guard as supporters of the Mayor of Istanbul demonstrate against his detention over a corruption probe in Istanbul, Turkey, March 19, 2025. YASIN AKGUL/AFP/Getty\n\nDespite the ban, a live feed on the Anka News Agency's X account appeared to show protesters clashing with riot police at Istanbul University. One sign read: \"The university will not comply.\" No violence was immediately reported from the demonstrations.\n\nPrivate television network NTV said two Istanbul district mayors were among those detained.\n\nCritics note that the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year, and amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.\n\n\"We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\" Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video posted on social media.\n\nGermany criticized the arrests Wednesday, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer describing them as \"a serious setback for democracy.\"\n\nInternet watchdog Netblocks said Wednesday that its live metrics indicated Turkey was restricting access to X, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms.\n\nErdogan, a populist with what opponents say are increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years and is now the longest-serving leader in the Turkish republic's history. His current term runs until 2028, but he has indicated he'd like to serve longer \u2014 something he could achieve with the help of a friendly parliament.\n\nImamoglu was arrested as police searched his home, but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was confiscated. His wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television network that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken around 7:30 a.m.\n\nThe Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index dropped by 7% over news of his arrest, triggering a temporary halt to trading to prevent panic selling and stabilize the market. The Turkish lira lost some 7% of its value against the dollar.\n\nAnadolu, the news agency, said that Ekrem Imamoglu and several others were suspected of extortion, money laundering and irregularities concerning tenders and procurements, among other crimes.\n\nImamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the report said. The PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency within Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.\n\nEarlier this month, in a move lauded by the U.S., the PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire with Turkey's government, following a call from the group's long-jailed leader for it to lay down arms entirely.\n\n\"An attempted coup against our next president\"\n\nA day earlier, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying him from running in the next presidential race \u2014 a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.\n\nThe mayor's party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was widely expected to be chosen as its candidate in future presidential elections. The national ballot is currently scheduled for 2028, but the vote is expected to be brought forward.\n\nDespite all the arrests Wednesday, CHP party chairman Ozgur Ozel told the opposition-aligned Halik TV channel that its primary would go ahead as planned. Ozel called Imamoglu's detention \"an attempted coup against our next president.\"\n\nIn a social media post written in English, Imamoglu said: \"The will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts. I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens\" of Turkey.\n\nIstanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the Republican People's Party's (CHP) presidential primary candidate, addresses the CHP leadership and parliamentarians to outline his roadmap and strategies during 2028 presidential candidate election meeting, Feb. 27, 2025 in Ankara, Turkey. SERDAR OZSOY/Getty\n\nTurkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.\n\nThe dawn raid on Imamoglu's home and his arrest was a \"disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\" Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.\n\nAs he was being arrested, Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.\n\n\"They think they can silence us and prevent us from defending and supporting Ekrem Imamoglu,\" Ongun said. \"I entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot defeat the nation.\"\n\nPolice also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.\n\nIn nullifying Imamoglu's diploma, the university cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. Imamoglu said he would challenge the decision.\n\nImamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.\n\nHe is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.\n\nImamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019 in a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The president's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.\n\nThe challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party."

Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n\nOnce again, it comes down to John Roberts and Donald Trump.\n\nIt was Chief Justice Roberts, of course, who wrote last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision giving then-candidate Trump substantial immunity from criminal prosecution. But in recent weeks, it also was Roberts who steered the court in its calibrated approach to litigation arising from President Trump\u2019s orders overhauling government \u2013 refusing to give administration lawyers the quick endorsement they sought.\n\nSince 2017, when Trump began his first presidential term, Roberts has been both an enabler and a restraint on Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nAfter weeks of silence to Trump\u2019s rants against the judiciary, Roberts was likely provoked on Tuesday by a heated post referring to a federal judge currently handling a migrant deportation case as \u201ccrooked.\u201d Trump declared the judge \u201cshould be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d\n\nSoon after, Roberts issued a statement: \u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\u201d\n\nFor US district court judges, currently on the front lines of the Trump litigation, Roberts\u2019 defense was heartening, if overdue.\n\nFor retired Justice Stephen Breyer, the statement met the moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s informative. It\u2019s short. It doesn\u2019t blame anyone or praise anyone. It says if you don\u2019t like what the judge holds, appeal,\u201d Breyer told CNN, repeating, \u201cAppeal.\u201d\n\nAs the top leaders of the judicial and executive branches, Roberts and Trump have now had two dramatic clashes. Roberts\u2019 Tuesday statement recalled a similar rebuke of Trump in 2018.\n\nMore broadly, the episode offered a reminder of the roles the two leaders \u2013 Roberts, age 70 and appointed for life, and Trump, age 78 and beginning a second term \u2013 continue to play in each other\u2019s sphere and the public eye.\n\nRead Biskupic\u2019s full analysis here."

            "full_content": "Tesla, whose pioneering electric vehicles were once a symbol of forward-thinking sustainability, increasingly finds itself the target of public furor.\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.\n\nThere has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.\n\nIn Mr. Trump's first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.\n\n\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They're rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"\n\nMusk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.\n\nString of attacks\n\nThe attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\n\n\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.\n\nA number of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.\n\nAn Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.\n\nFour Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.\n\nIn Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building's front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.\n\n\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some Tesla owners in conservative-leaning states are also facing acts of vandalism, including one Texas man whose Tesla was recently keyed while parked at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\n\"I just bought it because it was an electric car,\" Dallas resident Jeff Nguyen told CBS News Texas. \"This one is pretty fun to drive. It has really just nothing to do with politics or anything like that.\"\n\nTesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn't have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.\n\nMore recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.\n\nMusk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Mr. Trump's adviser.\n\nTesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump's election but has since shed all those gains and this year has tumbled 44%, prompting expressions of concern from Wall Street analysts. Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.\n\nPresident Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"\n\n\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\n\nThe progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \"Musk Or Us\" protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \"it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\"\n\nSome Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle's new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \"I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\" or \"I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\"\n\nPrices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla's most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.\n\n\"We're coming after you\"\n\nThe White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Mr. Trump's political interests. Mr. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \"domestic terror,\" and he has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \"going to go through hell.\"\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said she'd opened an investigation \"to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\"\n\n\"If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\" Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"\n\nColin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.\n\n\"It's not the type of act that I would prioritize,\" Clarke said. \"Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\"\n\nTheresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.\n\n\"Hate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that's fine and dandy, it's your choice,\" she said. \"It doesn't justify ruining somebody's property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There's other ways to get your voice heard that's more effective.\"\n\nSomeone recently slapped a \"no Elon\" sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn't intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.\n\n\"I love my car. It's the safest car,\" Ramsdell said. \"I'm not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\""

They waged war on American energy, and in particular on Texas oil and gas,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"That war on American energy ended on January 20th,\" he added, referring to Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S APPROVAL RATING MATCHES HIS ALL-TIME HIGH, NEW POLL FINDS\n\n\"I think we have a mandate coming out of the election, a mandate to secure the border and mandate to unleash American energy, a mandate to extend the 2017 tax cuts and a mandate to fight for small businesses and jobs,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe we're going to do all of that working hand-in-hand with President Trump,\" he explained, adding, \"It's been an incredible first 50 days. We've got a lot more work to do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are pushing hard on the message that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2013 which include 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and a sweeping 25 percent tariff on aluminum and steel from around the world \u2013 are behind the high prices Americans are seeing in stores and gas stations.\n\nSenator Jeff Merkley, D-WA, believes that Trump is intentionally creating chaos to assert more control over the federal government and country.\n\n\"The Trump recession is on its way,\" Merkley predicted.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US 'SUBSIDIZES' ITS '51ST STATE,' CANADA\n\n\"He's firing people left and right with no thought about what works and doesn't,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"It's not about efficiency; it's about tearing down and replacing professionals with lackeys.\"\n\n\"Trump is driving us into a recession,\" he continued. \"He is doing it deliberately, cultivating complete chaos in everything he does. These tariffs are on, these tariffs are off, stock market is diving, people don't know where and how to invest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-WA, suggested that; \"Trump could stop being so irresponsible about the economy and make sure we\u2019re driving costs down instead of up and stop the trade wars with indiscriminate sweeping tariffs.\"\n\nThough Americans continue to face high prices, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said the country is \"in a period of transition\" in which Trump is \"implementing the formula that we know works.\"\n\n\"Look at President Trump\u2019s results in his first term,\" said Leavitt. \"If people are looking for certainty, look at the record of this president, that\u2019s why the American people re-elected him back to this office.\"\n\nMR. WONDERFUL TALKS 'EXCITEMENT' AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY UNDER TRUMP: AMERICA IS IN A 'NEW PHASE'\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-MA, however, said that Trump \"has to avoid his indiscriminate ham-handed tariffs that are absolutely frightening the markets and frightening small businesses all across our country.\"\n\nHe also bashed the changes brought about by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"He has to just stop with his indiscriminate cuts to programs, which actually provide the economic incentive for the creation of jobs in our society,\" he said.\n\nAsked what can be done to avoid a recession, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-WA, answered simply: \"Don\u2019t have tariffs.\"\n\nGOP LAWMAKER SAYS HE DOESN\u2019T THINK TRUMP TARIFFS WILL \u2018PLUNGE\u2019 US ECONOMY INTO RECESSION\n\nSen. John Hickenlooper, D-CO, said that \"we better get cracking\" to reverse course.\n\n\"I think we should do less tariffs. I think we need to recognize that government plays a role in the economy, but I certainly hope that we can make positive steps to make sure we don't get a recession, the last thing anybody needs,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking with Fox News Digital at a healthcare protest just outside the Capitol building, \"Squad\" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, refused to answer whether the U.S. was heading into a recession, instead insisting \"we should talk about Medicaid.\"\n\n\"Medicaid is one of the most important things,\" said Tlaib. \"It's actually very American. Most American thing you can ever like support because people don't plan to get sick. We got to protect Medicaid.\"\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sen. John Husted, R-OH, told Fox News Digital that Trump\u2019s \"early aggressive approaches\" will \"cause a little disruption, but in the end, I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll get through those.\"\n\nLARA TRUMP: SHIFTING THE STATUS QUO FOR THE ECONOMY TAKES A MULTI-FRONT EFFORT\n\n\"The Biden administration did put us in a terrible box with their policies on immigration, the runaway government spending that led to inflation, their anti-energy policies that really made the cost of energy inputs in every product higher. The president's trying to unravel that,\" said Husted. \"That will lead to some stability going forward, that will help create jobs and get the American economy moving forward.\"\n\nFreshman Sen. Jim Justice, R-WV, meanwhile, said he does not think the U.S. is recession-bound.\n\n\"I really don't think we're headed into a recession. I don't think that at all,\" he said. \"[But] the Senate stands ready to work with President Trump in every way [and] I surely stand ready to work with him on everything.\"\n\nCome what may, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, said that the best way to avoid a recession is to \"implement the president\u2019s agenda\" and help working families.\n\n\"Under Joe Biden, their wages went down, the prices went up,\" he said. \"We need to pass tax relief for working families and get more of their hard-earned money, put it back into their pockets. It's vital.\"\n\nFORBES CHAIRMAN LAYS OUT TAX PLAN FOR 'GOLD ON THE HORIZON'\n\n\"What can we do?\" he continued. \"Open up American energy production, we can get fair and equal trade deals, we've got to get wages up for our people, we've got to get manufacturing back into this country.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The president is doing both of those things. He's going to stop the trade cheating. He's going to get prices down,\" he said. \"I mean, the president knows what to do. He did it in the first term. He gave us the best economy in my lifetime, his lifetime. So, we've got to go full throttle on that.\""

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Associated Press\n\nJoe Biden has always kept a tight circle. Only a few could ever claim to be his right-hand man. There was Ted Kaufman, the early campaign volunteer who became Biden\u2019s senatorial chief of staff; John DiEleuterio, the college friend who went to work as his state director in Wilmington. Plus Jill Biden, of course, and Joe\u2019s sister, Valerie, his right-hand women.\n\nLess remarked upon, over the decades, are the dozens of us who have served in a related but different capacity: as uncredited stand-ins for Joe Biden\u2019s literal right hand via autopen.\n\nLast week, the Heritage Foundation released a (since disputed) report claiming that the Biden White House used an autopen to sign preemptive pardons during its final days. These included, allegedly, the pardons granted to members of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack. On Friday, President Donald Trump took to Truth Social with a dark suspicion: \u201cThe person who was the real President during the Biden years was the person who controlled the Autopen!\u201d That figure, he\u2019d go on to intimate without evidence, was not Biden, who was too checked out; in Trump\u2019s view, this made Biden\u2019s pardons null and void.\n\nFrom there, it seems, we\u2019ve entered a now-familiar cycle: First, Trumpland makes a claim about Biden\u2019s executive functioning or lack thereof; Biden sources then deny the claim. But then, too, a few anonymous \u201cBiden sources\u201d reportedly go rogue to hint that perhaps there\u2019s something there: in this case, that a \u201ca key aide to the then-president may have made unilateral determinations on what to auto-sign.\u201d A few months after that \u2014 we\u2019re not there yet with the autopen \u2014 perhaps a former administration staffer echoes those hints on a podcast, or a panel, setting themselves up for a turncoat book deal down the road.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m willing to break my silence.\n\nIn 2006, I began a summer internship in then-Senator Biden\u2019s Delaware headquarters. A 16-year-old politics nerd from Wilmington and a foreign-policy buff, I was awed by Biden\u2019s stature as the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee. I was welcomed by DiEleuterio \u2014 a lovely man \u2014 and the front-desk admin gave me a tour. The grandest room in the suite was Biden\u2019s office; he wasn\u2019t in that week, she said, but he might be later in the summer, in which case we\u2019d meet. The work was menial: logging calls, opening mail. But most days contained at least one moment of magic: the autopen.\n\nOn the desk, in a back room, the device looked charmingly analog. There was no screen, no \u201cinterface\u201d: You\u2019d just load a pen or Sharpie into the loop at the end of its arm and let it trace its way. On my end, it took \u2014 well, not skill, but care to line the paper up below. Or misalign: I decided that the signature oughtn\u2019t run too parallel to the bottom edge of the page; there should be a gentle, friendly skew. Once engaged, the device would move slowly \u2014 at an uncanny human pace \u2014 along the ghostly path of Joe\u2019s right hand. The slash of his J, the curves of his B, a jagged e that shocked me every time: These are the strokes I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nThen, Joe\u2019s final coup de grace, this little dot he\u2019d add above the last few letters of his surname. Ostensibly meant to crown the i but falling chicly behind, it reminded me of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s beauty mark.\n\nWhen I think back to the work that I did on the autopen that summer, it was all pretty anodyne stuff. There were wedding congratulations and birthday wishes, those kinds of salutations: nice messages that people might want to frame someday as a family heirloom. That\u2019s why we signed them in Sharpie.\n\nWas there more than that? Perhaps some polite letters addressed to government agencies on Delawareans\u2019 behalf? Maybe, but you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\n\nThese past few days have been hard. Yes, I agree with all the legal experts out there, who say that the Biden administration\u2019s autopen use stands as perfectly legal and sound. But at the same time, when I see the New York Post call Joe Biden \u201cAutopen Joe,\u201d I get this pang of guilt because \u2026 well, that\u2019s how I think of him, too; like that\u2019s how I best know Joe.\n\nI never did meet the senator that summer. He never showed, either, at the \u201cJoe Biden high-school youth day\u201d I once attended down in Dover. And I\u2019ve never quite managed to catch him since.\n\nAm I upset by this? Surprised? No: Biden has rarely been the kind of omnipresent, glad-handing politician you might expect a small state to produce. And on a personal level, we Delawareans understand why his clan turned inward after the 1972 death of his first wife and daughter. But in addition to that, there\u2019s a cultural aspect, the way that \u201cDelawareness\u201d has long been characterized by negations and evasions: our good little corporate secrecy haven, neither North nor South.\n\nI do wonder, though: Did the rest of the country know to expect such a ghost? Did they know to read Biden\u2019s presidency as that of a quintessential \u201cDelaware Man,\u201d shot through with blankness? People expected more expansiveness of vision from his presidency, and boldness, too, but he always had this institutionalist streak. He is a company man from the Company State, accustomed to tracing preset paths, like choosing to run for a second term in the first place. He could be called worse than Autopen Joe.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.\n\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu\u2019s close aide, Murat Ongun.\n\nAuthorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.\n\nCritics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.\n\nThe arrest came during a search of Imamoglu\u2019s home, but it was not immediately clear if police confiscated anything at the site.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television station that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken at around 7:30 a.m. local time (11:30 p.m. ET).\n\nSilencing the opposition\n\nA day earlier, a university in Istanbul invalidated Imamoglu\u2019s diploma, effectively disqualifying the popular opposition figure from running in the next presidential race. Having a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen for its candidate in future presidential elections. Turkey\u2019s next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but early elections are likely.\n\nWith all the arrests on Wednesday, it was unlikely that vote would be held.\n\n\u201cWe are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\u201d Imamoglu said earlier in he day in a video message posted on social media. He accused the government of \u201cusurping the will\u201d of the people.\n\nMayor Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul on Oct. 31, 2024. Yasin Akgul / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nIn a social media post on English, Imamoglu said: \u201cThe will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts. I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens of (Turkey.)\u201d\n\nCHP\u2019s chairman, Ozgur Ozel, denounced Imamoglu\u2019s detention as a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is a power in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are facing an attempted coup against our next president.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.\n\n\u201cThe dawn raid and detention of the mayor of the country\u2019s largest city for political motives is a disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\u201d Tulay Hatimogullari, the party\u2019s co-chairwoman, wrote on X.\n\nAs he was being arrested, Ongun, Imamoglu\u2019s aide, posted on X about his detention, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.\n\n\u201cThey think they can silence us and prevent us from defending and supporting Ekrem Imamoglu,\u201d Ongun said. \u201cI entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot be defeat the nation.\u201d\n\nSeparately, police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.\n\nMeanwhile, internet-access advocacy group netblocks.org reported on Wednesday that access has been restricted in Turkey to popular social media platforms.\n\nIn nullifying Imamoglu\u2019s diploma, Istanbul University cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. Imamoglu said he would challenge the decision.\n\nLegal obstacles\n\nThe opposition leader faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.\n\nImamoglu is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.\n\nHe was elected mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in March 2019 in a historic blow to Erdo\u011fan and the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.\n\nThe challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdo\u011fan\u2019s governing party."

I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens of (Turkey.)\"\n\nCHP's chairman, Ozgur Ozel, denounced Imamoglu's detention as a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is a power in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,\u201d he said. \"We are facing an attempted coup against our next president.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.\n\n\u201cThe dawn raid and detention of the mayor of the country\u2019s largest city for political motives is a disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\u201d Tulay Hatimogullari, the party\u2019s co-chairwoman, wrote on X.\n\nAs he was being arrested, Ongun, Imamoglu's aide, posted on X about his detention, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.\n\n\u201cThey think they can silence us and prevent us from defending and supporting Ekrem Imamoglu,\u201d Ongun said. \u201cI entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot be defeat the nation.\u201d\n\nSeparately, police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.\n\nMeanwhile, internet-access advocacy group netblocks.org reported on Wednesday that access has been restricted in Turkey to popular social media platforms.\n\nIn nullifying Imamoglu\u2019s diploma, Istanbul University cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. Imamoglu said he would challenge the decision.\n\nThe opposition leader faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.\n\nImamoglu is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.\n\nHe was elected mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in March 2019 in a historic blow to Erdogan and the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.\n\nThe challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan\u2019s governing party.\n\n___\n\nFraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

This potential policy change may significantly impact Afghan visa holders who have been awaiting relocation to the United States,\u201d the group\u2019s notice said.\n\nThe International Refugee Admissions Project (IRAP) also spoke out against reports of a new travel ban, saying in a news release Friday that many of their clients \u201chave been waiting years for their visas to be processed and remain in extremely dangerous circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cA new travel ban would put their lives at risk by denying them the opportunity to reach safety. Even a temporary suspension will result in immediate and lasting harm for refugees and their families,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not yet know the full scope of who could be impacted, reports indicate that Afghan refugees targeted by the Taliban, including Special Immigrant Visa holders and others who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, could all be subjected to this unlawful ban,\u201d it continued. \u201cIt is shameful that the Trump administration is abandoning America\u2019s promise to protect Afghan allies and other forcibly displaced people around the world.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Angelica Franganillo Diaz and Kit Maher contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "MIAMI \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s threats of tariffs and sanctions to Russia as leverage to negotiate a ceasefire with Ukraine may be a welcome pivot that draws some attention away from the administration\u2019s recent support for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt may also move the focus away from the flak that Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 known for his hard-line policies against Russia and its backing of communist and socialist countries such as Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua \u2014 has been taking as the country\u2019s top diplomat.\n\nAfter Trump and Vice President JD Vance excoriated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a heated televised exchange from the Oval Office, and following Trump\u2019s assertions that Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 started the war, the Cuban American secretary of state has been criticized by Americans who condemn Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as well as Russia\u2019s longstanding involvement with some Latin American countries.\n\nOne letter to the editor in the Miami Herald, his hometown newspaper, questioned how Rubio can \u201csleep at night\" now that he\u2019s \u201canxious to partner with Russia, which recently sent oil to Havana to keep that socialist state\u2019s engine running.\u201d Another letter lambasted Rubio for \u201csitting in the Oval Office as his tangerine-tinted Caudillo (strongman) paid tribute to and openly embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fidel Castro once did the same with Nikita Kruschev in 1961.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, the State Department referred NBC News to recent remarks Rubio made on ABC News, Fox News and CNN, in which he\u2019s insisted that Trump\u2019s goal is to get Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement and an end to a war that has gone on for three years and cost thousands of civilian lives.\n\n\u201cAll the president is trying to do here is figure out if there\u2019s a path towards peace. We have to engage both sides, the Russians and the Ukrainians. And we asked the Ukrainians not to sabotage it,\u201d Rubio told Fox News following Trump\u2019s exchange with Zelensky at the White House.\n\nThe role of secretaries of state is to carry out their president\u2019s foreign policy agenda. But the White House\u2019s Russia policy stands in contrast to Rubio\u2019s. A foreign policy hawk who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, Rubio has been a staunch opponent of the Kremlin and a defender of Ukraine, and has often criticized Russia for its involvement with other countries.\n\nAfter Russian warships visited Cuba last summer, then Sen. Rubio, along with fellow Florida Sen. Rick Scott, introduced a resolution condemning Cuba\u2019s government, stating that \u201cthe world is bearing witness to the multiple ways the Castro/D\u00edaz-Canel regime has served as a puppet for Communist China, Iran, and most recently Russia.\u201d\n\nLike Rubio, many Cubans as well as exiles from Venezuela and Nicaragua see Russia not only as an aggressor against Ukraine, but as a regime with strong alliances to the governments they fled.\n\nFor Anamely Ramos, a well-known Chicago-based activist and art historian who came from Cuba three years ago, the Trump administration\u2019s recent overtures toward Russia worry her.\n\nShe said it\u2019s a delicate topic for many Cubans because they don\u2019t have all the information yet, but it\u2019s worse to \u201cremain silent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy role, as a Cuban and defender of human rights is to insist on certain demands with Cuba policy in mind, regardless of which party is in power,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cThe softening with Russia affects us and, as activists, we cannot take this out of our sight, not even for a second.\u201d\n\nAfter the 1959 revolution, Cuba became a major ally of the Soviet Union and depended on them for subsidies and military support. The 1962 Cuban missile crisis \u2014 when the Soviet Union placed missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles from U.S. soil \u2014 brought the two superpowers to the brink of nuclear conflict. Russia has continued aiding Cuba, most recently with oil shipments as the island is mired in economic crisis, and it\u2019s also helped the leftist authoritarian governments of Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nSome pro-democracy activists in the U.S. don\u2019t take issue with the administration\u2019s Russia policy.\n\n\u201cTrump is trying to end a war where there has been great loss of life on both sides,\u201d said Ernesto Ackerman, president of the group Independent Venezuelan-American Citizens, who is a Trump supporter. \u201cWhat he wants is to achieve peace between these two countries,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers wanted to make clear they supported Rubio, but were worried about the government\u2019s recent overtures toward Russia.\n\nCarolina Barrero, who moves between Madrid, Washington, D.C., Miami and New York as the director of the organization Ciudadan\u00eda y Libertad (Citizenship and Freedom), said for Cubans like her it\u2019s an \u201chonor\u201d to have Marco Rubio serve as secretary of state and they want him in that role. But she said she\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about the strengthening alliance between the U.S. and Russia.\n\n\u201cMost Cubans are conscious of who Vladimir Putin is and the threat he represents because of the history we have had,\u201d Barrero said.\n\nThe Trump administration has toughened its policies toward various Latin American countries, too: it revoked a license that allowed Chevron to pump oil in Venezuela, returned Cuba to the state sponsors of terrorism list, slapped tariffs on Mexico and threatened to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama Canal.\n\nOn the other hand, the administration ceased offensive cyber operations against Russia and ended efforts to seize assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\n\u201cIt looks a little suspicious and the secretary of state has a hard time explaining why,\u201d said Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University.\n\nIf Rubio has presidential aspirations, he needs to make the best of the current situation, according to Gamarra.\n\n\u201cImagine a situation where Rubio is able to preside over a peace process. That almost guarantees Rubio a huge political bump,\u201d he said."

In today\u2019s edition, \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker digs into a topsy-turvy week on tariffs, Trump administration officials\u2019 warnings of economic pain ahead \u2014 and how voters might respond. Plus, Sahil Kapur explains why Medicaid has emerged as a major sticking point in Republicans\u2019 budget plans.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nHow will voters react to Trump\u2019s twists and turns on tariffs?\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nIt\u2019s been a volatile week for President Donald Trump\u2019s economic and trade policies, with twists and turns on tariffs dominating the headlines \u2014 and raising new questions about how voters will react.\n\nTrump knows well that the economy and concerns about high prices helped propel him to the Oval Office.\n\nHere\u2019s what he told me back in December: \u201cI won on the border, and I won on groceries. \u2026 When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\u201d\n\nBut there are already some signs that Americans are concerned that Trump is not prioritizing the issue. A CBS News/YouGov poll released earlier this week found that 80% of Americans believe inflation should be a high priority for the administration, but just 29% say Trump is prioritizing the issue \u201ca lot.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has acknowledged that there could be some economic pain ahead.\n\nTrump noted in his address to Congress this week that \u201cthere will be a little disturbance\u201d when tariffs take effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC this morning that there will be a \u201cdetox period\u201d as the economy adjusts to less government spending. And Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox News this week that as a result of tariffs, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a short period of time where there will be some higher prices on certain products.\u201d\n\nMy colleague Peter Alexander asked Trump earlier today how long Americans should expect things to cost more. The president said in part, \u201cThere could be some disturbance, a little bit of a disturbance.\u201d Trump also acknowledged there could be more tariff shifts to come, noting, \u201cThere will always be changes and adjustments.\u201d\n\nSo how much time will voters give Trump to bring prices down? And how might they react if prices actually go up?\n\nWe\u2019ll delve into the next steps for Trump\u2019s economic agenda and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday, with Lutnick and Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.\n\nThe latest on the economy:\n\nTrump suggested he may implement tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber, the latest broadside by his administration in the brewing trade war between the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, falling short of expectations as employers in a range of industries continued making hires, while the federal government slashed its workforce by 10,000.\n\nThe S&P 500 regained some ground on Friday, but the index still posted its worst week in several months as the salvo of trade policy actions unnerved investors, CNBC reports.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nAside from tariffs, it was another busy day at the White House, with Trump making news on issues ranging from foreign policy to education.\n\nHere are the toplines:\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Mailbag: What does the future hold for Medicaid?\n\nThank you to everyone who emailed us with questions this week! Several of you wrote in to ask about the future of Medicaid as Republicans consider a budget proposal to advance Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nHere\u2019s senior national political correspondent Sahil Kapur to explain why the program has emerged as a major focus and could be on the chopping block:\n\nMedicaid has rapidly become one of the biggest flashpoints of Trump\u2019s presidency. The simple reason is that Republicans have approved a budget plan that would necessitate significant cuts to the program in order to meet their targets. Don\u2019t take my word for it. That\u2019s according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe math is simple: The House Republican budget to advance Trump\u2019s agenda requires the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut spending by $880 billion. But when you set aside Medicare and Medicaid, the entire jurisdiction of the committee totals $581 billion. The GOP is deeply leery of cutting Medicare, given the politics with older voters, but Medicaid has been in the party\u2019s crosshairs for years. It\u2019s less sacred to them. In fact, Republican lawmakers have openly told us they want to include cuts to Medicaid spending in their big party-line bill.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where it gets more interesting. Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, say they want to root out fraud and waste in the program. But there\u2019s no reason to think they can find hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid fraud. Nobody can cite evidence of that, including the speaker\u2019s office when I asked them to show their math. If the GOP wants to meet its targets, they will have to take actions that risk political blowback.\n\nThere\u2019s another option: They could wave the white flag on that deficit-reduction target and rewrite the budget. But in the wafer-thin House GOP majority, that number was the product of concessions made to conservative hard-liners who demanded sharp spending cuts as the price of their vote.\n\nBottom line: There\u2019s no easy way out here, and the future of Medicaid is hazy at the moment.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83d\udc40 Shutdown watch : Democrats blasted a stopgap funding bill, which has not been released yet, that Republicans plan to bring to floor next week to avert a government shutdown.

            "full_content": "A Hispanic Trump backer who is regretting his vote after a horrific encounter with ICE. Photo: NBC News4\n\nA local Washington, D.C., TV news reporter has a story that we are almost certainly going to hear often once the Trump administration\u2019s mass-deportation initiative intensifies:\n\nA naturalized Hispanic man says he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who were looking for another person on a deportation order, and now the man is questioning his vote for President Donald Trump. \u2026\n\n[Jensy] Machado said he was driving to work Wednesday with two other men when he was stopped by ICE agents on Lomond Drive in Manassas, a short distance from his home. He said he was confused by what was happening, why agents surrounded the pickup truck.\n\n\u201cAnd they just got out of the car with the guns in their hands and say, turn off the car, give me the keys, open the window, you know,\u201d Machado told Telemundo 44\u2019s Rosbelis Quino\u00f1ez, who first reported his story. \u201cEverything was really fast.\u201d \u2026\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me for any ID,\u201d Machado said. \u201cI was telling the officer, if I can give him ID, but he said just keep my hands up, not moving. After that, he told me to get out of the car and put the handcuffs on me. And then he went to me and said how did I get into this country and if I was waiting for a court date or if I have any case. And I told him I was an American citizen, and he looked at his other partner like, you know, smiling, like saying, can you believe this guy? Because he asked the other guy, \u2018Do you believe him?\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out the ICE agents had erroneously been given this American citizen\u2019s address, but since he looked Hispanic, they figured they\u2019d act and ask questions later. He was released after finally being allowed to show his driver\u2019s license, but \u201cthe two men with him were taken into custody. He does not know why.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion he reached isn\u2019t surprising: \u201cI voted for Trump last election, but, because I thought it was going to be the things, you know, like \u2026 just go against criminals, not every Hispanic-looking, like, that they will assume that we are all illegals.\u201d\n\nIf this happened with trained ICE agents, it\u2019s going to happen a lot more often when local law enforcement officers are pulled into the mass-deportation effort. At that point, the big and much-discussed improvements Republicans made among Hispanic voters in 2024 could begin melting away in the heat of widespread ethnic profiling.\n\nBut the possibility of buyer\u2019s remorse among Trump voters isn\u2019t limited to Hispanic voters who didn\u2019t believe the rabid hostility of Republicans toward illegal immigrants might affect them. After a campaign that so very successfully divided Americans into an aggrieved and deserving \u201cus\u201d battling an privileged and undeserving \u201cthem,\u201d it\u2019s going to become apparent that the line between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d isn\u2019t so clear and can be shifted as quickly as a DOGE raid on a federal agency.\n\nFor example, exit polls showed military veterans favoring Trump over Kamala Harris by a 65 percent to 34 percent margin, and Trump made an even more conspicuous display than ever of his alleged super-patriotism and love for those wearing the country\u2019s uniform. But these pro-Trump voters probably weren\u2019t expecting the administration to instantly fire thousands of veterans who have previously been given a preference in federal hiring, or to demand that the Veterans Administration dismiss 80,000 workers engaged in providing veterans with health care and other benefits.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised not to touch Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, which likely reassured seniors (representing 28 percent of the 2024 electorate) that his attacks on \u201cthe deep state\u201d wouldn\u2019t affect them personally. But now Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE is massively reducing the administrative staff required to ensure Social Security and related benefits can be accessed smoothly, and it\u2019s very clear Trump\u2019s congressional Republican allies cannot implement his budgetary plans without major \u201csavings\u201d from Medicaid. Those who voted for Trump may feel deceived or betrayed.\n\nTrump did conspicuously well among self-identified Catholic voters in 2024. Almost immediately, the new administration picked a nasty fight with Catholic bishops over the services the church provides to undocumented immigrants and its insistence on treating them with dignity. At least some Catholic Trump voters may realize that immigrants aren\u2019t the only targets of MAGA rage.\n\nAbove all, millions of Americans voted for Trump at least in part because they were concerned about grocery and gasoline prices and believed his promises that he\u2019d act quickly to reduce them to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, his economic policies have focused on imposing broad-based tariffs sure to raise consumer prices while inviting retaliation that could blight the lives of many producers of American goods and services (notably farmers).\n\nAll these potential developments are worth watching closely as Trump\u2019s agenda unfolds and begins stimulating a public backlash. At present, Americans are split right down the middle on the 47th president\u2019s job performance with a steady downward trend since his inauguration. For the most part, the country is divided precisely as it was on Election Day. But with every day that passes, memories of Joe Biden\u2019s or Kamala Harris\u2019s shortcomings will fade and Donald Trump will be vulnerable to the unhappiness of Americans about their government and conditions of life. It won\u2019t take that many 2024 Trump voters deciding they made a mistake to tilt the balance of public opinion decisively against him. Even if the president himself no longer cares about popularity (and his ego probably requires that he imagine himself as revered), his Republican allies, particularly in the U.S. House with its fragile GOP majority, probably do. They know voters who feel betrayed tend to be highly motivated to make their anger known at the ballot box."

            "full_content": "Elon Musk with Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump famously deploys a confusing and borderline incoherent style of discourse that he assures us is deliberate: He calls it \u201cthe weave,\u201d which my colleague Margaret Hartmann defines as a \u201cfree association word salad.\u201d Aficionados of Trump\u2019s rhetoric have probably noticed that \u201cthe weave\u201d gets more impenetrable when he is asked to address difficult subjects like his position on abortion. Language aside, the 47th president also sometimes sows deliberate confusion about his position on highly controversial issues. That\u2019s important to keep in mind when trying to understand his most recent statements about Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE and its power to ravage and remake the federal government.\n\nAmid public protests and private complaints from members of Congress about the chaos and errors surrounding DOGE\u2019s \u201cgo fast and break things\u201d assault on federal employees and programs, Trump held a Cabinet meeting that, according to the New York Times\ufeff, produced heated interchanges between Musk and at least two department heads (Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy). What Trump did to resolve these disputes is much less clear. Politico suggests the president laid down the law:\n\nPresident Donald Trump convened his Cabinet in person on Thursday to deliver a message: You\u2019re in charge of your departments, not Elon Musk.\n\nAccording to two administration officials, Trump told top members of his administration that Musk was empowered to make recommendations to the departments but not to issue unilateral decisions on staffing and policy.\n\nThe president\u2019s message represents the first significant move to narrow Musk\u2019s mandate. According to Trump\u2019s new guidance, DOGE and its staff should play an advisory role \u2014 but Cabinet secretaries should make final decisions on personnel, policy and the pacing of implementation.\n\nIf true, that would be a major development. But Trump did the functional equivalent of the weave in a subsequent Truth Social post:\n\nThe Golden Age of America has just begun! Over the past six weeks, our Administration has delivered on promises like no Administration before it, always putting America First! DOGE has been an incredible success, and now that we have my Cabinet in place, I have instructed the Secretaries and Leadership to work with DOGE on Cost Cutting measures and Staffing. As the Secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various Departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go. We say the \u201cscalpel\u201d rather than the \u201chatchet.\u201d The combination of them, Elon, DOGE, and other great people will be able to do things at a historic level. We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one. It\u2019s very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it\u2019s also important to keep the best and most productive people. We\u2019re going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done. The relationships between everybody in that room are extraordinary. They all want to get to the exact same place, which is, simply, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nAll one big happy team, right? Actually, it looks more like Trump will \u201crein in\u201d Musk only if his appointees do what DOGE tells them to do. After the Cabinet meeting, Trump told reporters \u201che wanted cuts, and that Musk would remain a power center: \u2018If they can cut, it\u2019s better. And if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u2019\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound to me like a definitive brushback pitch aimed at Musk\u2019s head.\n\nWhat may actually be going on is an effort to regularize DOGE\u2019s activities legally by treating them not as decision-makers but as advisers to both the president and to agency heads. Multiple federal judges have signaled that DOGE has no authority beyond a very general executive order from Trump to intervene in agency personnel and policy decisions. Indeed, one judge halted the peremptory firing of probationary employees by the DOGE-dominated Office of Personnel Management as having exceeded that entity\u2019s powers. So masking DOGE actions by channeling them through individual agency heads could be the play, creating the impression Musk is on a leash without diminishing his authority in any meaningful way.\n\nIn view of Trump\u2019s famous mob-boss management style, suffused with paranoia and incessant demands for personal loyalty, he may have also been subtly reminding Musk that his authority flows entirely from the Oval Office and can be withheld if he gets too big for his britches. But barring further clarification, it\u2019s likely that DOGE personnel will operate as extremely powerful commissars throughout the federal bureaucracy, manipulating the formal decision-makers to act in accordance with Musk\u2019s vision of a radically diminished, MAGA-compliant, and AI-driven workforce. It would be na\u00efve to assume the Trump-Musk partnership that helped create the 47th presidency is at any sort of an end or has even achieved a sustainable balance of power. These are two very complicated and dangerous men."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Walt Disney Pictures, Getty Images\n\nThese days, there are a lot of extremely alarming headlines featuring Donald Trump. At first glance, \u201cTrump\u2019s Own Declaration of Independence\u201d doesn\u2019t seem like one of them. The Atlantic headline published on March 6 sounds like a metaphor that could refer to anything from Trump\u2019s attempt to distance himself from alleged co-president Elon Musk to Canada-related tensions with King Charles III.\n\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s a story about Trump trying to seize the literal Declaration of Independence because it would look cool in his office.\n\nTrump \u201casked advisers in recent days about moving the Declaration of Independence into the Oval Office, according to people familiar with the conversations who requested anonymity to describe the planning,\u201d Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer report.\n\nIt seems even sycophantic Trump staffers were dismayed by his desire to remove the original copy of America\u2019s founding document from public view \u2014 just so it could be displayed alongside his Diet Coke button and framed mug shot in the Oval Office:\n\nTrump\u2019s request alarmed some of his aides, who immediately recognized both the implausibility and the expense of moving the original document. Displayed in the rotunda at the National Archives Building, in Washington, D.C., it is perhaps the most treasured historical document in the U.S. government\u2019s possession. The original is behind heavy glass in an oxygen-free, argon-filled case that can retract into the wall at night for security. Because of light damage to the faded animal-skin parchment, the room is kept dimly lit; restrictions have been placed on how often the doors can even be opened.\n\nTrump eventually decided to leave the original Declaration of Independence at the National Archives:\n\n\u2026 To the relief of aides, subsequent discussions appear to have focused on the possibility of moving one of the historical copies of the document, not the original. \u201cPresident Trump strongly believes that significant and historic documents that celebrate American history should be shared and put on display,\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung told us in an email.\n\nIndeed, it appears Trump has commandeered one of several historic copies of the Declaration in the government\u2019s possession. Trump tweeted photos of his new office decor on March 17 (the post was later deleted with no explanation). The White House didn\u2019t say which copy Trump is using.\n\n\u201cThe Nationals Archives delivered the Declaration of Independence to the White House at the President\u2019s request. It is displayed in the Oval Office where it will be carefully protected and preserved,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump put a framed version of the Declaration of Independence on the wall in the Oval Office. pic.twitter.com/zUYD9C8kUd \u2014 ALX \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@alx) March 17, 2025\n\nThough The Atlantic said, \u201cIt is unclear where Trump first got the idea to add a Declaration to the Oval Office\u2019s d\u00e9cor,\u201d I think we all know the likely genesis of this scheme:\n\nAs Trump, who\u2019s a bit of a cinephile, likely recalls, in the 2004 film National Treasure Nicolas Cage steals the Declaration of Independence because he thinks there\u2019s a map on the back written in invisible ink. So if Trump returns his copy of the Declaration with lemon juice all over it, we\u2019ll have our confirmation. In the meantime, let\u2019s just hope he doesn\u2019t destroy too much of the White House while hunting for the presidents\u2019 Book of Secrets.\n\nThis post was updated after Trump added a copy of the Declaration to the Oval Office."

The work of DOGE at the agency so far, the lawsuit says, mirrors how other foreign aid agencies have been dismantled by the Trump administration.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan for the African Development Foundation snapped into action almost immediately, with DOGE staffers meeting with the foundation\u2019s leadership within days of Trump\u2019s February 21 executive order. The Trump administration then told a board member, Ward Brehm, he was being removed from his position, and a new acting chair would be in charge.\n\nStaffers with the Department of Government Efficiency enter the offices of the U.S. African Development Foundation in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times/Redux\n\nFaced with the overhaul, the board held an emergency meeting on Monday to push back, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington this week. The board decided Trump\u2019s appointee, Peter Marocco \u2014 the de-facto acting leader of USAID, another agency Trump has targeted \u2014 was not lawfully in the job, and they alerted Congress, the removed board member Ward Brehm\u2019s lawsuit said.\n\nMarocco still showed up at the fund\u2019s headquarters with staffers of the Department of Government Efficiency on Wednesday afternoon. They \u201cwere denied access to those offices,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cMarocco and his colleagues threatened to return to the offices with United States Marshals and Secret Service.\u201d\n\nYet Marocco did get into the building on Thursday with the backing of federal law enforcement, Brehm\u2019s attorneys also said in court papers. Staffers from DOGE also attempted to get access to the foundation\u2019s computer systems and personnel files on Thursday, the court papers said.\n\n\u201cMarocco and DOGE showed up with U.S. Marshals and forced their way into USADF,\u201d Brehm\u2019s lawyers wrote about the events of Thursday. \u201cAt the very moment that this motion is being finalized, Marocco and DOGE are demanding\u2014based on Marocco\u2019s illusory authority\u2014immediate access to USADF\u2019s computer systems.\u201d\n\nA White House official, however, defended the right of Marocco and his team to enter the building.\n\n\u201cEntitled, rogue bureaucrats have no authority to defy executive orders by the President of the United States or physically bar his representatives from entering the agencies they run,\u201d Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, said on Friday.\n\nKelly noted that Trump\u2019s previous order had reduced the foundation, as part of the executive branch, to its \u201cstatutory minimum.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times published photos on Thursday of DOGE workers in an elevator at the foundation\u2019s offices and US Marshals walking down a hallway past the foundation\u2019s reception desk.\n\nA spokesperson for USADF said Friday the agency\u2019s locks were changed and staffers couldn\u2019t access the offices, adding that DOGE staffers have not been able to access USADF systems yet. The spokesperson claimed the agency\u2019s X account was banned or shut down on Thursday, which they described as \u201ca concerning development for the agency\u2019s right to free speech.\u201d\n\nWhile the lawsuit, filed by lawyers from the left-leaning group Democracy Forward, contests Brehm\u2019s removal from the leadership post, it also argues that it fears the Trump administration is attempting to shutter the fund\u2019s work by ending its foreign development grants and taking over its software systems.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to use every tool available to protect USADF and fight back against the Trump-Musk overreach,\u201d Skye Perryman, the head of Democracy Forward, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the African Development Foundation\u2019s board must be approved by the Senate. The Foundation was created specifically by an act of Congress 45 years ago, the lawsuit notes.\n\nFederal judge Richard Leon of the DC District Court on Thursday said that from now until a least a court hearing next Tuesday, Brehm can\u2019t be removed from the board and Marocco can\u2019t be appointed to it.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the convicted crypto fraudster who is serving 25 years in prison, is breaking his silence about his life behind bars in a new interview with Tucker Carlson.\n\nOne major point of interest about Bankman-Fried has been about whether he has befriended disgraced rapper Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is serving time in the same Brooklyn detention center on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges. Combs has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBankman-Fried told Carlson that Diddy is \u201ckind to people in the unit,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201cbeen kind to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a soul crushing place for the world in general, and what we see are just the people that are around us on the inside rather than who we are on the outside,\u201d Bankman-Fried told Carlson in the roughly 40-minute interview posted on X.\n\nCarlson said that he and Diddy are \u201ctwo of the most famous prisoners in the world,\u201d but Bankman-Fried won\u2019t tell the rapper that it was his 33rd birthday this week. \u201cSomeone else might, but I\u2019m not,\u201d he said.\n\nLiving with a celebrity is one of the more interesting aspects of Bankman-Fried\u2019s life, he said. That changed last year after he was found guilty for defrauding customers and investors in his failed crypto exchange FTX. His sentence of 25 years was about half of what prosecutors had asked for, but still put him at the high end for sentence length in prominent white-collar fraud cases.\n\nBankman-Fried said he\u2019s made some friends, but said prison was a \u201cweird environment\u201d because it\u2019s a \u201ccombination of a few other high profile cases and then a lot of \u2026 ex-gangsters, alleged ex-gangsters.\u201d Many of them are \u201csurprisingly good at chess,\u201d he learned.\n\nHe\u2019s also shifted his political stance. Once a donor to former President Joe Biden, Bankman-Fried said he\u2019s moved right and started donating to Republicans \u201cprivately\u201d as much as he was to Democrats in late 2022. He said his politics changed after spending a lot of time in Washington, DC, during the Biden era and was \u201creally, really shocked by what I saw \u2014 not in a good direction \u2014 from the administration.\u201d\n\nTucker Carlson and Sam Bankman-Fried. From Tucker Carlson/X\n\nCarlson followed up that it\u2019s \u201csort of weird\u201d to ask Bankman-Fried if crypto regulation is moving in a \u201cgood direction,\u201d but said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t resist.\u201d\n\nHis response? \u201cHopefully \u2026 Changing the guard helps. But financial regulators \u2014 they\u2019re big, giant bureaucracies in the federal government \u2014 they\u2019re not used to changing overnight. They have been playing a big, obstructive role for a decade in crypto.\u201d\n\nAs for Bankman-Fried\u2019s wealth, once worth around $15 billion, has all but diminished. In addition to the prison sentence, he also ordered a forfeiture of $11 billion.\n\n\u201cThe company that I used to own \u2026 had nothing intervened, today it would have about $15 billion of liabilities and about $93 billion of assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer should be, in theory, yes, there was enough money to pay everyone back in kind. But that\u2019s not how things worked out. Instead, it all got roiled up in a bankruptcy.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nEvery big consumer tech cycle has its free-trial era. In 1999, in a few cities, it was the magic of at-cost same-day delivery from Kozmo, which lost money on every order in a bid for growth. Through the 2000s, it was the rise of powerful search engines and social networks with relatively few ads. In the 2010s, the VC-backed lose-money-to-make-money strategy returned to the physical world, with services like Uber (and a hundred Uber-fors) hemorrhaging money on underpriced taxis, food delivery, and DTC goods in a multibillion-dollar experiment in customer acquisition memorialized as a fleeting \u201cmillennial lifestyle subsidy.\u201d As with just about everything else, after 2020, things, you know, got a little hazy for a while \u2014 although you might argue that low interest rates produced so many examples of unsustainably priced services and goods that it\u2019s hard to pick just one.\n\nCompanies do this, and investors allow it, because it sometimes works. In the process, early adopters can reap small but real benefits from strategic underpricing. Kozmo was beloved by its tiny customer base but collapsed into a punch line; Amazon, its money-losing contemporary, is one of the largest companies in the world. Most free (and ad-free) social-media apps failed, but a few of them became so dominant that they can now add as much friction and advertising to their products as they want, making longtime users nostalgic for how they used to be. A lot of Uber-type businesses failed, but Uber made it through. Rides cost more because Uber needs to charge more and can, even if longtime riders remember paying $15 for what\u2019s now a $50 ride.\n\nIn 2025, we\u2019re somewhere in the front half of a historically massive tech-investment cycle in and around AI, and the pattern is showing signs of repeating. An \u201cinteresting situation has returned where free-to-access AI is very close to the frontier,\u201d writes Wharton professor and AI evangelist Ethan Mollick. There are nearly as many pricing strategies in AI as there are AI products to pay for \u2014 subscriptions, ads, metered usage, and combinations of all three \u2014 and the products themselves are complicated, tiered, and broadly unfamiliar. Still, if you\u2019re looking for it, you can see the outline of a familiar situation: OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and smaller firms like Anthropic are losing massive amounts of money by giving away their AI products or selling them at a loss. \u201cWe are in the era of $5 Uber rides anywhere across San Francisco but for LLMs,\u201d wrote early OpenAI engineer Andrej Karpathy in response to Mollick, \u201cweee.\u201d Chatbots are free, programming assistance is cheap, and attention-grabbing, money-losing AI toys are everywhere. AI is in its free(ish) trial era.\n\nThe sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is strongest at companies that have done this sort of thing before. Meta is slotting chatbots and AI-powered tools into virtually all of its products in an attempt to amass \u2014 re-amass? \u2014 as many users as possible. As with acquired products like Instagram and WhatsApp, attempts to turn a profit are delayed but inevitable. There are \u201cpretty clear monetization opportunities here over time, including paid recommendations and including a premium offering,\u201d the company\u2019s finance chief said in January. (That\u2019s ads and subscriptions, in plain English.) Google charges developers for access to its models and also sells subscriptions to Gemini, but the company is installing free AI features in virtually all of its popular products, including Android, Search, Gmail, and Docs. OpenAI\u2019s confusing and constantly changing pricing currently gives unpaid users limited access to near-cutting-edge models and unlimited access to its basic ChatGPT and Search functions, with more powerful models, and more features, tiered at $20 and $200 per month, a price at which the company still loses money, according to CEO Sam Altman:\n\ninsane thing: we are currently losing money on openai pro subscriptions!\n\n\n\npeople use it much more than we expected. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) January 6, 2025\n\nAltman is projecting confidence by making a joke out of this and has made no secret of the fact that OpenAI is losing a lot of money to grow. And the trend Mollick is referring to \u2014 in just a few disorienting years, the industry has alternated directionally between moving more AI tools behind paywalls and just making everything free by default \u2014 might not last. In July of last year, Altman was talking about \u201cintelligence too cheap to meter,\u201d a phrase popularized in debates about nuclear power. (To some extent, competition between AI firms can be understood as a battle to control the next version of the omnibox, the universal computer interface that has made Google hundreds of billions of dollars; in this more familiar territory, providing services for free, or very cheaply, is a necessary part of the plan.) This week, after some major pivots in how these companies develop and deploy models, and somewhat to Altman\u2019s own surprise, he\u2019s floating ideas like this:\n\nan idea for paid plans: your $20 plus subscription converts to credits you can use across features like deep research, o1, gpt-4.5, sora, etc.\n\n\n\nno fixed limits per feature and you choose what you want; if you run out of credits you can buy more.\n\n\n\nwhat do you think? good/bad? \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) March 4, 2025\n\nAs familiar as some of this is, there\u2019s a lot about this cycle that isn\u2019t. Unlike, say, food delivery, the cost of serving even relatively recent AI models has tended to drop quickly and precipitously, while the cost of creating new ones has continued \u2014 with an occasional trillion-dollar caveat \u2014 to go up. (You can run freely available models that would have been considered cutting-edge just a year ago on a hardy PC.)\n\nAlso unlike Uber or Seamless or even Facebook \u2014 but perhaps a bit more like Amazon \u2014 the quality of the product on offer is tied, at least in theory, not just to scale but to massive up-front and ongoing material investment (for Amazon, in logistics infrastructure; for OpenAI, in GPUs). The actual costs of providing an Uber ride have been relatively stable for the life of the company, and higher current prices are just closer to the actual cost of hiring a person with a car to drive you somewhere, plus whatever Uber needs to add to cover its other operations and turn a profit. Uber was undercharging, and now it\u2019s not. OpenAI is undercharging, too, and one day it might not \u2014 the free trial might come to an end, and its mainstream product might be filled with ads or cost more to use \u2014 but it could also be a fundamentally different product, with different capabilities and value to its customers. Karpathy\u2019s suggestion is perhaps a bit narrower than that. Now, pretty much anyone can play with the latest AI tools. Soon, in part because of new models that require a lot of computing power not just to train but to use, this might not be true. This dovetails with recent reporting that OpenAI is considering much higher price tiers for its next generation of AI \u201cagents\u201d:\n\nOpenAI executives have told some investors it planned to sell low-end agents at a cost of $2,000 per month to \u201chigh-income knowledge workers\u201d; mid-tier agents for software development costing possibly $10,000 a month; and high-end agents, acting as PhD-level research agents, which could cost $20,000 per month, according to a person who\u2019s spoken with executives.\n\nOpenAI is claiming that it sees a path to creating tools to match these prices, and some others in the industry do as well \u2014 in other words, this is the lawyered, quantified, pitch-deck version of looser public discussions about AGI, the exhilarating and/or terrifying (and fundamentally fuzzy) prospect of which has pulled hundreds of billions of dollars into AI investment.\n\nAccording to the Information, though, it\u2019s monetizing ChatGPT, not suddenly vaporizing a significant percent of knowledge work, that\u2019s core to the company\u2019s actual plans, at least for the next couple of years:\n\nOverall, OpenAI told investors it expects revenue to more than triple this year, from $3.7 billion to more than $12.5 billion \u2026 By 2026, OpenAI expects revenue to hit $28 billion. It expects most of its revenue in 2025 and 2026 to come from ChatGPT, with the rest of its sales coming from software developer tools and AI agents.\n\nWhether OpenAI can scale its technology to \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d or meaningfully deploy its agents \u201cinto the workforce\u201d are fascinating questions that the company enjoys drawing attention to, but in its most optimistic projections \u2014 again, regarding products it has not yet built for customers it has not yet identified \u2014 this sort of stuff represents up to a quarter of its revenues \u201cin the long run.\u201d In the meantime, OpenAI intends to figure out how to make money from its one popular product that actually exists. For most people who use ChatGPT, it\u2019s a novel tool that can answer questions, help with homework, and search the web through an interface that is, in 2025, unusually uncluttered and clean. It\u2019s also something they use for free, with increasing awareness of multiple free and comparable alternatives. They\u2019re enjoying the AI trial period, and despite broad uncertainty about the future of the underlying technology, when it comes to the tools they\u2019re already using, they have a pretty good sense of what comes next."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nA grassroots movement\u2019s call for Americans not to shop at major chains for 24 hours in an \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d last week went viral \u2014 and now, its organizer is launching a weeklong boycott against Amazon that starts Friday.\n\nJohn Schwarz, the 57-year-old founder of The People\u2019s Union USA, is calling on Americans to boycott Amazon and its companies, including Zappos, Ring, Whole Foods, Twitch and Prime Video, for one week.\n\nThe Amazon boycott is about \u201csending a message loud enough to shake up the system\u201d and rattle the company, Schwarz said Thursday on his Instagram account.\n\n\u201cAmazon is one of the biggest, wealthiest, most powerful corporations in the world,\u201d he said in a video. \u201cIt crushes small businesses. It exploits its workers. It fights against unions while raking in billions. It could make a positive difference in the world, but it chooses not to.\u201d\n\nSchwarz is leveraging the attention from the wider \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d on February 28. He told CNN in an interview last week that he hadn\u2019t expect much traction for his post, which was viewed millions of times. Celebrities like Stephen King and Bette Midler encouraged participation, and reporters wrote and aired TV pieces about it.\n\nOn The People\u2019s Union USA\u2019s website, Schwarz calls the group \u201ca grassroots movement dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform,\u201d adding that the \u201cgoal is to unite Americans against the corruption and greed that has kept us struggling for decades.\u201d\n\nBlackout\u2019s impact\n\nSchwarz\u2019s boycott call last week gained strength online because it has captured the visceral public anger with the American economy, corporations and politics.\n\nStill, the \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d effort is relatively uncoordinated and nebulous. Experts on consumer boycotts and corporate strategy are dubious that it will make a dent in the bottom lines of the massive companies that it targets, let alone the vast US economy.\n\nLast week\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t make much of an impact to those corporations\u2019 bottom lines, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that uses phone location data to track store visits.\n\nThe firm said that \u201cmany retailers experienced year-over-year declines in weekly visits throughout February 2025,\u201d but attributed this to \u201cpost-holiday spending pullbacks, decreased consumer confidence, economic and tariff uncertainty, and unseasonably cold weather\u201d\n\nAs a result, Placer.ai said, the February 28 event\u2019s \u201cspecific impact is difficult to isolate, as most retailers saw year-over-year declines in line with recent weekly trends.\u201d\n\nAmazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment."

            "full_content": "Photo: Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nEvery six hours or so, it seems, some federal judge blocks or unblocks or reblocks some action taken by Elon Musk, DOGE, and the Trump administration: mass firings of government employees, billions of dollars in frozen funding, near-dissolution of an entire government agency, targeted dismissals of departmental leaders and internal watchdogs, emails demanding that federal workers list five accomplishments or else risk either \u201cresignation,\u201d being \u201csemi-fired,\u201d or nothing at all, depending on the day.\n\nWhenever one judge greenlights some DOGE gambit, another court moments later slaps a temporary pause on some other cost-cutting measure. Don\u2019t worry; if you\u2019re confused, that just means you\u2019re paying attention.\n\nHow, then, can we understand these dozens of legal disputes as they play out across our federal courts? There\u2019s no magic decoder ring here, no unifying field theory that explains or predicts the decisions as some coherent whole. But it\u2019s not total chaos. (Not in the courts, at least; the executive branch is a tad disheveled at the moment.) We can largely understand the judicial rulings we\u2019ve seen so far, and those that lie ahead, by applying three basic principles.\n\n1.\n\nEyes glaze when we talk about legalistic formalities like \u201cstanding\u201d (does the plaintiff have a dog in the fight?) or \u201cjurisdiction\u201d (can this court hear this case now?). But technicalities can turn outcomes, with massive consequences. For example, many of Trump\u2019s attempts to challenge the 2020 election failed because the plaintiffs lacked standing \u2014 meaning they had no direct, tangible stake in the matter. And the abortion medication mifepristone remains widely available because the Supreme Court in 2023 rejected a challenge by anti-abortion medical associations based on lack of standing.\n\nSimilarly, some legal challenges to Musk and DOGE have failed because of technical (but fatal) defects. One federal judge, John Bates (a George W. Bush appointee), noted that \u201cthe Court harbors concerns about defendants\u2019 alleged conduct\u201d \u2014 but temporarily rejected a challenge by labor unions seeking to deny DOGE access to sensitive data because the plaintiffs lacked standing. (A labor union is no substitute for an aggrieved employee and is too far removed from the dispute, the judge found.) Another federal judge in Washington, D.C., the Obama-nominated Christopher Cooper, declined to temporarily block DOGE from firing probationary employees because the law requires certain federal workers first to contest adverse employment actions through administrative hearings. Thus, the judge found, the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Keep these threshold questions in mind as we move ahead. The bar is low, but if challengers can\u2019t clear it, they\u2019re cooked.\n\n2.\n\nTo this point, virtually all the cases filed against Musk and DOGE have sought emergency relief \u2014 typically a \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d from a court that somebody must stop doing something. But plaintiffs in these cases bear a heavy burden. They must show, even before the case has gotten into fact-specific discovery, that if the disputed action is not blocked, they will suffer \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an uphill climb. Two Obama-nominated D.C. federal judges \u2014 Randy Moss (not the wide receiver) and Tanya Chutkan (the one and same who presided over the Trump January 6 prosecution, plainly no fan of the president) \u2014 rejected challenges to DOGE actions because the plaintiffs could not meet this requirement. Judge Chutkan stressed that the party seeking the \u201cextraordinary\u201d remedy of a restraining order must show some injury that is \u201cboth certain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond remediation, and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.\u201d\n\nDespite these setbacks, the majority of challenges to Musk and DOGE have met with early success. We\u2019ve seen judges across the country temporarily block the Trump administration from accessing private data, withholding federal funding, and firing certain executive branch employees. But these wins are temporary; it\u2019s been only 46 days since Trump took office, after all. (I know.) The larger disputes on the merits still lie ahead, and they raise fundamental questions that could shift the foundations of our government.\n\nWhich brings us to our third and final principle:\n\n3.\n\nTake, for example, Trump\u2019s firing of 17 inspectors general. Some have sued because, under a law passed by Congress in 2022, the president must first provide 30 days\u2019 notice to Congress and a \u201csubstantive rationale\u201d for any such termination. Trump characteristically skipped the formalities and just straight-up canned them \u2014 no notice provided, no reasons given. Similarly, Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, an official in charge of a whistleblower agency, for no particular reason other than he wanted the guy gone. But a law provides that that official can be fired only for performance-related issues.\n\nThese might seem like easy cases at first glance. \u201cThe law\u201d \u2014 actual statutes passed by Congress \u2014 says the president must do certain things before he can fire certain employees, and the president did not do those things. Hence the president broke \u201cthe law\u201d and the employees should win \u2014 right?\n\nNow we\u2019ve come to the crux. The Trump administration maintains broadly that these laws are unconstitutional incursions on the executive branch by Congress and therefore violate separation-of-powers principles. All due respect to the esteemed gentlemen and women up on the Hill, but you simply can\u2019t tell the president what to do inside the executive branch, the argument goes.\n\nIndeed, conservatives \u2014 and we\u2019ve got six of them on the Supreme Court at the moment \u2014 typically view executive-branch power expansively, and the president\u2019s power within that branch as absolute, or near-absolute. Take, for example, last summer\u2019s criminal-immunity ruling, in which the Court\u2019s conservative majority granted the president astonishingly broad protections against prosecution based on a sweeping view of executive authority. Indeed, according to the \u201cunitary executive theory\u201d popularized in the Federalist Society and other conservative strongholds, the president not only leads the executive branch \u2014 he is the executive branch unto himself.\n\nPut it this way. Which five justices do you see ruling that Congress can micromanage how the president handles his business within the executive branch that he was elected to lead? Jon Stewart \u2014 no conservative (and, yes, I will cite him for serious legal propositions when he cuts to the heart of the matter) \u2014 isn\u2019t buying it. He mocked the technocratic argument against the president\u2019s power to run his own branch of government: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what? Oh, apparently, you can fire them [inspectors general], but you have to give them 30 days\u2019 notice. Oh, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re upset about? \u2018No! You can do it \u2014 but not in that font!\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest that all the legal challenges to Trump, Musk, and DOGE will fail. Congress (and plaintiffs) stand on stronger constitutional footing in the funding-freeze cases given the Constitution\u2019s explicit grant of the power to tax and spend to the legislative branch. Indeed, on Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s effort to withhold $2 billion in foreign aid that had already been allocated by Congress. The decision was largely procedural, but the practical result, as the four dissenting conservatives noted, is that the disputed money almost certainly will be paid out.\n\nUltimately, these lawsuits \u2014 the ones that clear our aforementioned technical barriers \u2014 are about far more than whether the president can fire one particular official or whether a certain pot of money must be spent. As they move through the courts, these cases will test and reshape our constitutional balance of powers. And while the Supreme Court won\u2019t take up every matter, when it does, the smart money is on executive power. Prepare for the ground to shift.\n\nThis article will also appear in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nOne week after Elon Musk held court before the cameras during President Donald Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting, many of the Senate-confirmed leaders of government departments and agencies reconvened in the Cabinet Room on Thursday for a different kind of discussion.\n\nDuring a nearly 90-minute meeting \u2013 this time, without any cameras \u2013 Trump delivered a clear message as Musk, one of the most influential members of his administration, sat nearby.\n\nThe president told his agency heads that while Musk\u2019s effort to slash the size and spending of the federal government has his full support, they are the ones, not Musk, who are in charge of staffing at their respective agencies.\n\n\u201cKeep all the people you want, everybody that you need,\u201d Trump told his Cabinet, as he recounted to reporters later in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI want them to do the best job they can,\u201d the president went on. \u201cWhere we have good people, that\u2019s precious, that\u2019s very important, and we want them to keep the good people.\u201d\n\nThe meeting on Thursday, which Trump said would be repeated every two weeks, was among the first examples of the president acting to rein in Musk\u2019s broad powers. Instead of a proverbial chainsaw, which Musk held up during a high-profile appearance last month, Trump said the administration would be wielding a \u201cscalpel\u201d to make cuts going forward.\n\nMusk is still expected to make recommendations on the agencies\u2019 cuts. And Trump made clear that if his department heads weren\u2019t making sufficient reductions, the tech billionaire would intervene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be watching them, and Elon and the group are going to be watching them, and if they can cut, it\u2019s better,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, Trump told his team, it\u2019s the Senate-confirmed Cabinet members who have the final say.\n\nA White House official described the meeting as a check-in after Trump\u2019s address to Congress, where he laid out the work his administration has done over the last six weeks. Aside from the Department of Government Efficiency, aides said, the Cabinet also conferred on national security issues and top priorities. At least six Cabinet members were not present, with many traveling outside of Washington this week for official duties.\n\nBut it was Trump\u2019s directive on cuts going forward that appeared the most consequential and provided the most clarification to date on the power dynamics of the second Trump term. Staffing has been one of the foremost concerns for agency heads, some of whom complained last week that their departments were undermanned, according to a person familiar with what transpired in the first Cabinet meeting after reporters left the room.\n\n\u201cVery productive meeting,\u201d Musk posted on X, replying to photographs the White House posted on social media that showed images of the closed-door meeting. After wearing a black hat and t-shirt to the first Cabinet meeting, Musk wore a suit and tie Thursday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune sent an unmistakable signal this week that members of the Cabinet should take the lead in making hiring and firing decisions at their own agencies, telling CNN: \u201cThey are going to be better attuned to the individual programs.\u201d\n\nOver the last several weeks, quiet grumbles have emerged from atop agencies as they contended with Musk\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal government.\n\nAfter Musk issued a directive to all federal employees to recount their workweeks or risk termination, several agency heads advised their own workforces to ignore the request until they could sort out the demand.\n\nLater, a second email request was sent \u2013 this time from individual agencies, providing the departments more control over their own personnel.\n\nThe closed-door meeting on Thursday, which was not included on the president\u2019s daily public schedule, also stood in stark contrast to the marquee moment earlier this week when Musk rose to his feet in the House chamber and was repeatedly lauded by Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nWhile the richest man in the world basked in applause from Republicans in that prime-time moment, he has also been increasingly working behind the scenes to try and soften the rough edges from some of the more controversial decisions from his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nFor weeks, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has been paying close attention to a rising wave of criticism and complaints about Musk from Republicans and business leaders. Wiles has a cordial and businesslike relationship with Musk, people familiar with their dynamic say, and he accepted her suggestion to extend his hand and be more available to members of Congress.\n\nWiles ducked out of the first Cabinet meeting last week a bit early \u2013 a pre-planned exit, long after Musk had finished speaking \u2013 to attend a lunch with Senate Republicans. She listened to feedback, acknowledged how she understood some of their angst and explained the nuts and bolts of how the president and Musk work.\n\n\u201cMusk is working directly with the president and the president then works with the Cabinet secretaries,\u201d Wiles said, according to an account from Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, who was at the lunch.\n\nSeveral attendees said they wanted to learn more and hear directly from Musk. A day later, 22 Republican senators came to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House to meet with Musk. They listened as Musk explained the cuts he was making and posed for a photograph with him after the meeting.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota called on Musk to better explain how DOGE would fix mistakes they make.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of cases, where they are carte blanche making significant cuts, how do we go about making sure that that message gets back and it gets corrected as quickly as possible?\u201d Rounds said.\n\nHe said Wiles \u201coffered to be the contact when she\u2019s been in front of us,\u201d but noted \u201cshe\u2019s just one person,\u201d so a formal process was needed.\n\nThis week, Musk, who has also become one of the biggest political benefactors for Republicans, held forth in back-to-back meetings with members of the House and Senate on Wednesday.\n\nHe distanced himself and his team from the widespread firings across the federal government and placed blame on department heads, GOP lawmakers said.\n\n\u201cHe just said that they trusted the departments to, you know, instead of using a cudgel to use a scalpel to get rid of people that are unproductive,\u201d said Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point.\u201d\n\nTo any senators with questions, Musk offered his personal cell phone number. But hours later, as he spoke to House members, he urged them to consult the DOGE website.\n\n\u201cHow can I get ahold of you? He said there\u2019s a web site for that,\u201d Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, told CNN. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t give us his number.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

An ice hockey game between the two countries last month quickly turned into a geopolitical event as players on both sides threw fists.\n\nOthers, like Palmateer, have boycotted US products \u2013 not always an easy task in a country that has been economically tied to its southern neighbor for decades, with trade exceeding $760 billion last year.\n\nGraham Palmateer, owner of Toronto pizzeria Gram\u2019s Pizza, is among Canadians boycotting US goods in the wake of the tariffs. Courtesy\n\nTrump\u2019s targeting of Canada has given rise to a rare moment of unity in a country that just months ago was facing a political crisis as the public\u2019s frustrations over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s leadership reached boiling point, prompting the longtime leader to announce his resignation.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have fueled a surge in Canadian patriotism and disrupted the country\u2019s politics in an election year, giving a surprising boost to the floundering ruling Liberal Party and forcing opposition Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre \u2013 long considered a shoo-in for Canada\u2019s next prime minister \u2013 to rethink his messaging.\n\n\u201cWe, as Canadians, we don\u2019t go out and try to create fights,\u201d said Torontonian Dylan Lobo, who runs online directory Made in Canada, which has seen a surge in traffic in recent months as Canadians look to support domestic brands in response to Trump\u2019s threats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an attack on Canada,\u201d he said.\n\nCanadians boycott US products\n\nAfter months of warnings, Trump on Tuesday slapped 25% tariffs on nearly all Canadian goods, sending markets plummeting and driving Canada-US relations to a new low.\n\nAlmost immediately, Canadian leader Trudeau responded with matching tariffs on 30 billion Canadian dollars ($20.8 billion) worth of American goods, with potentially more to come.\n\n\u201cCanadians are reasonable and we are polite but we will not back down from a fight \u2014 not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at stake,\u201d Trudeau said Tuesday.\n\nTrump said he told Trudeau on a Wednesday telephone call that the Canadian leader hadn\u2019t done enough to curb fentanyl crossing the border \u2014 despite the minuscule amount that arrives in the US from its northern neighbor. Trump suggested after the call \u2014 which he said \u201cended in a \u2018somewhat\u2019 friendly manner\u201d \u2014 that the outgoing Trudeau could be using the tariff issue to \u201cstay in power.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, the US president announced brief reprieves from the tariffs for automakers, and for goods that fall under the North American free trade agreement negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nBut for many, the two months of back-and-forth with Trump on tariffs have irreparably damaged ties.\n\n\u201cThe relationship has been changed forever,\u201d British Columbia Premier David Eby told reporters this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got friends, family and relationships that have gone back for generations across the border. We love our American family members,\u201d he added. But Canadians \u201cwill never again put ourselves in the position of being so dependent on the United States.\u201d\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump\u2019s repeated threats against Canada \u2013 punctuated by him mockingly referring to Trudeau as \u201cgovernor\u201d \u2013 have struck a nerve in the country, America\u2019s longtime friend and ally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol on Tuesday. Win McNamee/Pool/AP\n\n\u201cI can tell you that Canadians right now are upset, we\u2019re angry, we\u2019re dismayed,\u201d said John Liedtke, from Windsor, Ontario, which neighbors the US city of Detroit.\n\n\u201cI know of people who have said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to step foot on that side of the border again,\u2019\u201d he told CNN.\n\nNikki Gauthier, a retired nurse living in St. Catharine\u2019s, Ontario, said she felt anger \u201cright off the bat,\u201d when she heard about the \u201cunkind and unwarranted\u201d US tariffs.\n\nGauthier said she canceled her subscription with US tech giant Amazon in favor of the Chinese online marketplace Temu, and has been carefully inspecting product labels in the grocery store and prioritizing Canadian products when she can.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no Canadian lettuce, I\u2019ll look for Mexican lettuce,\u201d she said.\n\nCanadian officials responded swiftly to Trump\u2019s move, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford directing workers at the province\u2019s government-run liquor retailors to remove all US products \u2013 from California chardonnay to Jack Daniel\u2019s whisky \u2013 from the shelves. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario is one of the world\u2019s largest wholesalers and sells about $1 billion worth of US liquor per year, according to Ford.\n\nFord told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday his province is implementing a 25% tariff on electricity exports to 1.5 million Americans\u2019 homes in Minnesota, Michigan and New York next week.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Canadians have fought Trump tariffs. Seven years ago, during his first term as president, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all foreign steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports while in the middle of negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\n\"Made in Canada\" stickers displayed next to price tags of maple syrup at Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, on Tuesday.

He said he\u2019s gone from receiving four to five submissions for new businesses a day to nearly 5,000 in the past few weeks, with the site\u2019s daily traffic jumping tenfold from previous years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never witnessed such a large response from the community,\u201d said Lobo, who runs the site solo as a \u201cpassion project.\u201d\n\nPalmeteer, the Toronto pizza shop owner, said making the switch from US products \u2013 including dropping American retailer Costco as a supplier \u2013 has been relatively easy, and has been met with resounding support from his community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen Canadians united about much,\u201d Palmateer said. \u201cThis seems to be something pretty much everybody is on the same page about.\u201d\n\nAs Canadians\u2019 opinion of the US and its leader has plunged, their perception of their own country has improved, said David Coletto, CEO of Canadian polling and research firm Abacus Data.\n\nIn a recent survey, the number of Canadians who said they think the country is headed in the right direction hit a two-year high, up to 30% from just 19% when Trudeau resigned in January, Coletto said.\n\nPatriotism \u2013 traditionally less overt in Canada than in the US \u2013 is on the rise. The Canadian flag, which had in recent years become associated with 2022\u2019s right-wing \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d protests opposing Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, has been rebranded as a symbol of national pride and resistance to Trump.\n\nCanadian flagmaker Flags Unlimited\u2019s sales have doubled from a year ago, the company\u2019s owner told CNN affiliate CBC News.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a news conference on US tariffs in Ottawa on Tuesday. Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press/AP\n\nTariffs fuel surge in support for Liberals\n\nTrump\u2019s targeting of Canada was \u201ca shock to the Canadian psyche that just completely reoriented the way that people were seeing things,\u201d Coletto said \u2013 so much so that it could influence the outcome of the country\u2019s next federal election.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s replacement as Liberal leader and prime minister will be picked next week.\n\nAmong those running are former Liberal finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement with the first Trump administration, and former central bank governor Mark Carney.\n\nUnder Canadian law, the next general election must be held before October, but it is likely to be called sooner.\n\nSupport for the Liberals has bounced back in recent weeks after years of decline, with recent polls showing the Conservatives\u2019 long-held lead could be narrowing.\n\nTensions with the US have shaped what Canadians are looking for in their next leader, Coletto said.\n\n\u201cWe went from an environment where the public was so much looking for a change in government, to one where a growing number of people are looking to hire somebody to replace the prime minister who can help handle the effects of Trump\u2019s decision on our country,\u201d Coletto said.\n\nPoilievre, leader of the Conservatives, has distanced himself from Trump and refocused his message from one about Canada\u2019s internal struggles to a \u201cCanada first\u201d patriotism pitch.\n\nMade in Canada owner Lobo said he\u2019s received hundreds of thousands of emails from Canadians across the political spectrum who are angry about Trump\u2019s policies \u2013 and from Americans and Europeans who want to support Canada.\n\nCelebrities have jumped on the bandwagon, too.\n\nCanadian actor Mike Myers, portraying Elon Musk on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last weekend, wore a t-shirt with the slogan \u201cCanada is not for sale.\u201d\n\nAs the credits rolled, he shared another message for Canadians. He flexed his arm and mouthed: \u201cElbows up,\u201d an ice hockey term signaling it\u2019s time to fight."

            "full_content": "When Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, declared bankruptcy in 2019, it had no debt and was worth more than a billion dollars.\n\nHow is this possible? Well Purdue was facing trillions in claims over its role in the opioid crisis, which has killed more than 800,000 Americans.\n\nPurdue, and its wealthy owners, members of the Sackler family, wanted a bankruptcy settlement to resolve thousands of lawsuits.\n\nThat massive settlement is now on the table, but after five years the legal battle goes on. The Sacklers continue to own Purdue Pharma \u2013 and, to this day, not a single victim has received any compensation.\n\nRyan Hampton: Bankruptcy's not about justice. That's what I learned in this process.\n\nCecilia Vega: What is it about?\n\nRyan Hampton: It's about money. It's about money. It's about who gets paid the most and who gets paid out in what order.\n\nRyan Hampton is one of the 140,000 people who filed a claim against Purdue, saying they or someone they love were harmed by its opioids.\n\nRyan Hampton: I received an absurd amount of medication-- from the doctors that I was seeing.\n\nRyan Hampton 60 Minutes\n\nHampton was 23 years old when he says he was prescribed OxyContin in 2003 for a knee injury.\n\nA one-time White House intern, Hampton says he quickly became addicted to the powerful opioid, lost his job working on political campaigns and became homeless.\n\nCecilia Vega: You lost a lot. You lost your home. You lost friends through all this.\n\nRyan Hampton: I lost my dignity. I lost my self-worth. I can remember many times on the streets and thinking, \"If this is all my life is, as long as I am able to get my fix, then I'm completely fine with it.\"\n\nWith treatment, Hampton overcame his addiction 10 years ago and began speaking out against Purdue and the Sacklers.\n\nHe was appointed by the Justice Department in 2019 to represent the financial interests of victims. For two years, he served on a committee of creditors in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case.\n\nAs part of that case, in 2020, seven Sacklers \u2013 all former Purdue board members or employees \u2013 were deposed.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): And the top-selling opioid at Purdue Pharma was OxyContin, correct?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler (during deposition): Yes.\n\nDr. Richard Sackler is a former president of Purdue who, in 2001, helped turn OxyContin into what was at the time the most prescribed brand-name narcotic for pain in the United States. In his deposition, he described the drug's benefits and was asked about its deadly risks.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Now, higher dose OxyContin was more expensive, but it was also more dangerous. Is that accurate?\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Objection. You may answer.\n\nDr. Richard Sackler (during deposition): It wasn't more dangerous for the patient than any other pill.\n\nDavid Sackler, Richard's son, helped manage the family's wealth, and also served on Purdue's board of directors.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): What responsibility does Purdue have to the hundreds of thousands of patients who are prescribed Purdue opioids and got OUD?\n\nOUD is opioid use disorder or addiction.\n\nDavid Sackler (during deposition): What responsibility does it have to them? These were-- these were defined risks on the label, and while we feel terrible for them, I think we've taken a dramatic amount of responsibility for them\u2026\n\nThis past January, the Sacklers and Purdue agreed to pay up to $7.4 billion to settle the bankruptcy case-- potentially one of the largest opioid settlements ever.\n\nAnd while that sounds like a lot, there are 140,000 claims alleging harm \u2013 and just about 10% of the total amount will go to victims.\n\nClaiming nearly 90% are creditors including: 48 states, thousands of hospitals, insurance companies, and top pharmacy chains \u2014 all of which say they too paid a price in the opioid epidemic.\n\nRyan Hampton: It felt like every major company under the Sun-- was coming for a part of Purdue.\n\nCecilia Vega: Billions of dollars, in some cases.\n\nRyan Hampton: Billions-- billions of dollars.\n\nCecilia Vega: Is this just a money grab?\n\nRyan Hampton: It is a money grab, you know? CVS-- they have a pretty massive claim in the bankruptcy. CVS was charged by the Department of Justice for knowingly filling-- suspicious opioid prescriptions-- as late as last year.\n\nCecilia Vega: You were on the inside. You were privy to a lot of information that had never been seen publicly. What did you learn that was most surprising?\n\nRyan Hampton: The most surprising fact for me was that victims were not first in line, but last in line-- because there were larger corporate and government interests that wanted to get paid first.\n\nCourt records show that lawyers, mediators and others have already pocketed nearly $1 billion paid by Purdue.\n\nForty one firms have so far been paid more money than victims are expected to get in the $7.4 billion deal, with senior lawyers representing the company charging as much as $2,645 an hour.\n\nRyan Hampton: It's sickening.\n\nCecilia Vega: Do you not see this as something that could help families? This could be the only recourse they have.\n\nRyan Hampton: Absolutely. But do I think they're getting a fair shake? Do I think that they're getting anywhere near what they're owed, it-- knowing that you can't put a price tag to that? No way.\n\nCecilia Vega: Is your sense that a lot of those folks might actually not receive payment?\n\nRyan Hampton: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: That's a kick in the gut.\n\nRyan Hampton: It is a kick in the gut.\n\nTo have a valid claim, many victims will need to show proof of a Purdue opioid prescription.\n\nThat means there are families who do not expect to get a dime in the settlement \u2013 like Pete Jackson and Emily Walden.\n\nEmily Walden 60 Minutes\n\nEmily Walden: I've talked to a lot of parents. I know a lot of people that have filed claims. And nobody wants their blood money. But do they have a right to it? Did they pay for a funeral? Did they pay for treatment due to the actions of that company and the Sacklers? Should they get that money back? Absolutely.\n\nWalden says her son, TJ, became addicted to opioids after taking OxyContin as a teen. He was 21 and in the Kentucky National Guard when he overdosed 13 years ago.\n\nTJ's death certificate lists \"oxycodone\" \u2013 the active ingredient in OxyContin and other prescription opioids \u2013 as a factor. But in the bankruptcy case, that may not be enough proof.\n\nEmily Walden: If it's on their death certificate, they should have a claim. That's not right.\n\nCecilia Vega: Why should someone who wasn't taking this drug as it was prescribed be eligible for any kind of compensation at all?\n\nEmily Walden: They knew they were making massive profits on putting these on the street. They knew that. Why would they not be held liable for that? You knew it was being diverted. And you let it go.\n\nPete Jackson's daughter, Emily, was 18 and days away from starting college in Illinois when she died in 2006.\n\nHer family says she took OxyContin for the first time while drinking at a sleepover with cousins.\n\nCecilia Vega: You've compared OxyContin to leaving a loaded gun on the table.\n\nPete Jackson: Emily was blindsided. She didn't know that one pill could kill you.\n\nCecilia Vega: One pill?\n\nPete Jackson: One pill.\n\nPete Jackson 60 Minutes\n\nJackson blames the death of his daughter \u2013 and countless others \u2013 on the way Purdue and the Sacklers marketed OxyContin, pumping up sales despite reports of widespread abuse.\n\nCecilia Vega: What would you want to hear from the Sacklers?\n\nEmily Walden: I don't want to hear anything. I wanna hear the jail cell door slam.\n\nCecilia Vega: What does justice look like to you?\n\nPete Jackson: Justice would look like a full trial of the Sacklers and Purdue. A criminal trial first and foremost.\n\nBut that is increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn the bankruptcy depositions, Marianna Sackler, Richard Sackler's daughter, claimed not to know whether Purdue's opioids have harmed anyone. Her job was to help Purdue market and sell OxyContin.\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): Many people have been harmed by opioids. I don't know that many people have been harmed by the opioids that Purdue sold.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Do you suspect that people have been harmed by opioids that Purdue sold?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): I don't know.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): So if I understand correctly, people have been killed by opioids, but you don't know whether any of them were sold by Purdue?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): Yes.\n\nPurdue the company has pleaded guilty to four felonies over three decades -- including that Purdue lied about OxyContin as less addictive and less prone to abuse than other pain medications, like in this promotional video:\n\nPromotional video: Less than 1% of patients taking opioids actually become addicted.\n\nBut to this day, no member of the Sackler family or Purdue employee has ever faced felony charges.\n\nRick Mountcastle 60 Minutes\n\nRick Mountcastle: Companies are not driverless cars. If a company commits a crime, that means there are people, executives, who have used the company or caused the company to commit that crime.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Rick Mountcastle led the four-year investigation that resulted in Purdue's 2007 guilty plea. His team reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents.\n\nCecilia Vega: You were ready to charge three top Purdue executives with felonies.\n\nRick Mountcastle: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: You were hoping they would roll on--\n\nRick Mountcastle: Absolutely.\n\nCecilia Vega: --their bosses?\n\nRick Mountcastle: Yeah. Were not only hoping, but we-- we figured it was a-- probably a good possibility.\n\nTheir bosses were members of the Sackler family, who for decades held a majority on Purdue's board of directors. But Mountcastle says the felony charges were blocked by his superiors at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nInstead, the three executives: Purdue's top lawyer Howard Udell, medical director Paul Goldenheim and President Michael Friedman, pleaded guilty to misdemeanors but denied having any knowledge of Purdue's crimes.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): [D]id the Sackler Family scapegoat these three executives?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler: (during deposition): Quite the contrary. We were very loyal to them.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): You were so loyal that you paid them millions of dollars in bonuses after they pled guilty to criminal charges?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler: (during deposition): We did make termination payments to each of them. I don't remember the amounts.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Would it surprise you to know that the amounts were $5 million to Howard Udell and $3 million to Michael Friedman?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler: (during deposition): No, it would not surprise me.\n\nRick Mountcastle: Decisions are being made, not based on the facts and what's in the best interest of the American people; these are decisions that are me-- being made based on politics and personal gain.\n\nCecilia Vega: You spent more than 30 years as a federal prosecutor. Where does--\n\nRick Mountcastle: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: --all of this leave your faith in the Justice Department?\n\nRick Mountcastle: I-- I-- I am greatly disappointed in the Justice Department because everything that the department has done since 2007 to today has been to protect the billionaires, the Sackler family.\n\nThe Sacklers maintain their innocence and have agreed to settle claims in the bankruptcy not as an admission of guilt \u2013 but to end years of litigation. The family will also give up ownership of Purdue, but their vast wealth remains.\n\nIn the years leading up to the bankruptcy, the Sacklers took about $11 billion out of Purdue, more than 70% of the company's total assets.\n\n60 Minutes asked to interview members of Richard Sackler's family but did not hear back on that request.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Do you have any-- experience any guilt from living off the proceeds, at least in part, of the sale of OxyContin?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): No.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Do you believe that Purdue bears any responsibility for the opioid crisis in this country?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): No.\n\nPurdue Pharma told us in a statement that they are \"hard at work\" on finalizing the settlement and delivering billions to fight the opioid crisis \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nPrior to 60 Minutes' March 9, 2025 broadcast, which featured correspondent Cecilia Vega's report on the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case, we reached out to Purdue Pharma for comment on our story, \"The Settlement.\" The company responded to 60 Minutes with the following statement:\n\n\"We are gratified to have reached a new agreement with virtually all of the private and governmental stakeholders in these cases. The terms of the settlements are the product of intense work with our creditors, with a single-minded focus on delivering billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver overdose rescue medicines that will save lives. We are now hard at work fully documenting these settlements, including in a new Plan of Reorganization, which we look forward to presenting to the bankruptcy court. We are working to emerge as a public benefit company \u2013 100% devoted to improving the lives of Americans \u2013 as soon as possible.\"\n\nProduced by Natalie Jimenez Peel.

            "full_content": "President Trump is casting aside those who might stand in his way and among the first to go were at least 20 leaders of federal offices that were created by Congress to hold administrations accountable. You may not know it but, after Watergate, Congress set up a system to audit the executive branch and ensure the rights of federal workers. Those offices became known as watchdogs. Congress has guarded their independence from politics so that no president can use these powerful auditors to punish enemies or hide their own fiascos. But now, for the first time in 44 years, President Trump has fired these officials en masse. One of them is Hampton Dellinger, who has a warning about what America is losing as it's firing the watchdogs.\n\nHampton Dellinger: Going forward you're always gonna have now a person in my position who's gonna be dependent on the President's good graces. That is not how Congress set up the position, that's not how it's been for the past 50 years. But that independence, that protection is gone.\n\nScott Pelley: And the message that sends to the watchdog agencies in general is what?\n\nHampton Dellinger: I don't think we have watchdog agencies anymore. The inspector generals are gone. The head of the Office of Government Ethics is gone. I'm gone. The independent watchdogs who are working on behalf of the American taxpayers, on behalf of military veterans, they've been pushed out.\n\nBefore Hampton Dellinger was pushed out, he was head of the Office of Special Counsel\u2014no relation to the office of the same name that prosecuted President Trump. Dellinger's office is where federal workers can bring employment complaints. And where so called \"whistleblowers,\" government employees, can report wrongdoing.\n\nScott Pelley: So if a person sees fraud, for example, in the Department of Defense, and they're afraid of telling their supervisor because they think there will be retaliation, they go to you?\n\nHampton Dellinger: They can. And that was a decision not by me, but by Congress, that employees in the Executive Branch who are seeing something going wrong inside of an agency need a safe place to go that's still in the Executive Branch but that is outside of the agency.\n\nHampton Dellinger 60 Minutes\n\nAnd it works. A recent report said whistleblowers helped Office of the Special Counsel find $110 million that was owed to veterans and uncovered the overprescription of opioids at a VA clinic.\n\nDellinger is a Democrat, appointed by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHampton Dellinger: My job though was not partisan at all. And my track record I will stand on as someone who has played it by the book. I'm not looking to promote a president's agenda or thwart it. I'm just trying to make sure the laws are followed.\n\nScott Pelley: And you filed cases against the Biden administration?\n\nHampton Dellinger: Time, and time, and time again.\n\nDellinger's present term was supposed to run into 2029.\n\nScott Pelley: What was the first moment that you learned that you had been fired?\n\nHampton Dellinger: A Friday evening, when I got an email from someone I didn't know purporting to be with the White House who said, \"You've been terminated. Thank you for your service.\" And, of course, that email is just flatly inconsistent with the law, which says I can only be terminated for a very good reason. They didn't have a very good reason. They had no reason.\n\nScott Pelley: Nothing?\n\nHampton Dellinger: Nothing.\n\nThe law says there has to be a reason, specifically one of three, neglect, inefficiency or malfeasance. The termination email said none of that. So, Dellinger sued to keep his job.\n\nHampton Dellinger: I think every American respects the presidency. But I knew that this order, this directive, was unlawful. And ultimately we are a nation of laws. The only reason we have a president is because we have a supreme rule book, the United States Constitution. So as much as we all want the president to succeed it's gotta be within the framework of the law.\n\nBut the law may have been ignored just four days into Trump's term when he fired 17 inspectors general, all at once, without cause. The inspectors general or \"IGs\" for short, were auditors of top departments including defense, veterans affairs, and foreign aid at the U.S. Agency for International Development. Paul Martin was inspector general there.\n\nPaul Martin 60 Minutes\n\nPaul Martin: Over the years and over the decades, we've been independent, apolitical, nonpartisan watchdogs in our agency with the goal of improving the functioning of that agency, to save money, and to look out for the taxpayers.\n\nMartin policed billions in foreign aid spending. Trump shut down USAID early and in haste. In the chaos of mass firings emergency aid stopped moving. So, Martin did his job, writing an alert that warned that half a billion dollars in food aid might spoil or be stolen.\n\nPaul Martin: We issued the alert on a Monday. On Tuesday, I was terminated.\n\nScott Pelley: What did that tell you?\n\nPaul Martin: That someone read our report.\n\nScott Pelley: Have you ever been fired by a president before?\n\nPaul Martin: I have not been fired by a president before.\n\nScott Pelley: But some people watching these events say, \"Doesn't the president always bring in his own team?\"\n\nPaul Martin: He may bring his own team in, but there's been an agreement between Congress and administrations over the last 45 years that inspector generals are different. They're chosen to be apolitical, nonpartisan oversight officials in each government agency. And that has been respected from administration to administration.\n\nPaul Martin started in IG offices 25 years ago under Bill Clinton. He was inspector general for NASA in Trump's first term and then Biden's.\n\nPaul Martin: I have worked over more than six presidents, and I have never had a concern that issuing an audit or an investigation even with what would be perceived as negative findings could impact my employment.\n\nScott Pelley: In these first weeks of the Trump Administration what is happening to these oversight offices?\n\nAndrew Bakaj: They're being dismantled and effectively being destroyed.\n\nAndrew Bakaj is a former CIA officer and a lawyer who has written federal regulations protecting whistleblowers.\n\nDavid Kligerman: Now it feels like an intentional dismantling. They are going after the things that somebody who knows how to dismantle the system goes after and that's maybe perhaps the scariest part.\n\nDavid Kligerman and Andrew Bakaj 60 Minutes\n\nDavid Kligerman is a former State Department attorney. Together, they represent whistleblowers for the nonprofit group Whistleblower Aid. Whistleblower Aid represented a client in the first Trump impeachment.\n\nScott Pelley: What is the purpose of firing a Hampton Dellinger or the inspectors general?\n\nAndrew Bakaj: It's, in my opinion, to prevent the truth from coming out. The entire purpose of having a Hampton Dellinger or the IG system is to ensure that there's transparency within government.\n\nDavid Kligerman: This is removing the umpires. This is just taking the umpires out of the game. There's no place to go. If you can't go to the Special Counsel or they effectively neuter it, then there's nowhere for you to go. This is a very, very big deal.\n\nBut not a big deal according to the president. He told reporters on Air Force One that firing the watchdogs is\u2014quote\u2014 \"a very standard thing to do.\" He's wrong. No president has fired the heads of the watchdog offices, en masse, in 44 years\u2014that was Reagan when the offices were brand new\u2014and he rehired a third of them.\n\nScott Pelley: And the reason you were given for being fired was what?\n\nCathy Harris: Oh, no reason. The president gave no reason.\n\nWhy fire Cathy Harris? Possibly because she's on the federal board that hears appeals of fired federal workers-- the very people the Trump administration has been laying off by the tens of thousands. If she left, their avenue of appeal could be blocked at least temporarily. Harris is also fighting for her own job. For now, a judge has reinstated her.\n\nCathy Harris: I swore an oath to the Constitution when I took this job that I would fulfill my term through March 2028. And I believe very deeply in the civil service and in public service. And I just couldn't look myself in the mirror and walk away from this. I'm here to fight.\n\nCathy Harris fights for fired workers, often after receiving their cases from the office of Hampton Dellinger. In his final days on the job, Dellinger worked to restore employment of workers whom, he says, were fired by Trump, illegally.\n\nCathy Harris 60 Minutes\n\nHampton Dellinger: So much is lost. You're losing talent. You're losing experience. You're losing integrity. You're losing tens of thousands of military veterans who served our country in uniform, who put their lives on the line for America, and who came back enjoying the federal civilian work force. But putting aside all the losses, at the end of the day, it has to be done the right way. If you're gonna fire federal employees, you've gotta do it lawfully. And that's my concern, that these mass firings aren't necessarily in accordance with the law.\n\nIn February, Dellinger took on the case of 5,000 fired employees of the Agriculture Department. He passed their case to Cathy Harris and her appeals board. Harris stopped the firing, at least temporarily. The Trump administration is still in court to get Harris removed.\n\nCathy Harris: But you've gotta be able to be in this job and do what it takes to uphold the law and not be afraid. Not be afraid you're gonna be fired at any moment if you make a decision that somebody doesn't like.\n\nPaul Martin: I think the message to inspector generals is that the oversight of these programs, particularly if they're negative findings, is not welcome anymore.\n\nA message loud and clear now, according to former USAID inspector general Paul Martin.\n\nPaul Martin: It's not welcome in the administration, this administration, and it's not welcome in this current Congress.\n\nScott Pelley: What should Congress be doing?\n\nPaul Martin: Congress created the inspector generals and relied on, for the past 45 years, their findings, and their audits, and investigations to conduct aggressive oversight of any administration's programs. Since the firing of the inspector generals, there has been a deafening silence in Congress as far as pushing back.\n\nScott Pelley: Why are they not speaking?\n\nPaul Martin: Unclear.\n\nMartin worries that independence lost, might never be regained.\n\nPaul Martin: I'm afraid that we've moved on to-- an era in which every administration will come in and assume that they're going to replace all the inspector generals with people of their choice, that the secretary of treasury or the attorney general will get to pick his or her inspector general. And that will turn the independent IG system on its head.\n\nScott Pelley: If your office is beholden to the president, what is lost?\n\nHampton Dellinger: Independence, accountability, a safe place for federal government employee whistleblowers to come to and know that they'll be respected and protected. That's gone.\n\nOther watchdogs are suing to challenge the president's power but Hampton Dellinger is out. Last week, an order from an appeals court removed him. He told us that taking his fight to the Supreme Court would take months or a year\u2014and by then his whistleblower office would be devastated.\n\nScott Pelley: The Trump administration argued to the court that it needed to, quote, \"Put an end to Dellinger's rogue use of executive authority over the President's objections.\" What's your response to that?\n\nHampton Dellinger: If wanting the rules to be followed is the new definition of going rogue, then call me by that name. I don't think I was going rogue. I think I was being a good American who believes in the rule of law. That's all I was trying to do is make sure the laws are being followed.\n\nProduced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate producer, Alex Ortiz. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim.

            "full_content": "TORONTO \u2014 Former central banker Mark Carney will become Canada\u2019s next prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and annexation threat, and a federal election looms.\n\nCarney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote.\n\nCarney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.\n\nThe surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.\u201cWe have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,\u201d Carney said.\n\nAfter decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.\n\nCarney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.\n\nThe other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.\n\nCarney is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month."

            "full_content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) admitted to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk that the Democrats have taken wildly unpopular positions on certain issues \u2014 such as men competing in women\u2019s sports \u2014 but will continue maintaining such losing stances as a matter of \u201cprinciple.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind losing. Sometimes you lose on principle,\u201d the California governor told Kirk during Thursday\u2019s episode of the This Is Gavin Newsom podcast.\n\nListen:\n\nNewsom was specifically referring to his unwillingness to agree with Kirk that men should not compete in women\u2019s sports, arguing that for him it is a matter of \u201cprinciple,\u201d not politics.\n\n\u201cI deeply am mindful of the politics of this, which are very unhelpful personally, and unhelpful more broadly and professionally to the Democratic Party and our brand,\u201d Newsom added. \u201cThe Democratic Party brand has just been crushed.\u201d\n\nKirk replied, \u201cYour self-awareness is helpful to know because it is deeply unpopular, and I think that is an ascendant political force that is not going away.\u201d\n\nEarlier in their conversation, Kirk had urged Newsom to \u201cstep up\u201d and say \u201cno\u201d to male athletes participating in female sports, to which the California governor replied by admitting he \u201ccompletely agrees\u201d with the TPUSA founder \u201con the issue of fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply unfair,\u201d Newsom said, adding that, nonetheless, he cannot take the stance that biological men should not participate in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThe governor explained his position:\n\nOn the issue of fairness, I completely agree. So that\u2019s easy to call out \u2014 the unfairness of that. There\u2019s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide and have anxiety and depression. And the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well. So, both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue? But at the same time deal with the unfairness?\n\n\u201cYou asked a good-faith question: how do Democrats get out of the wilderness,\u201d Kirk acknowledged, before reminding Newsom that the left\u2019s stance on this topic is still wildly unpopular, stating, \u201cThis one is an 80/20 issue.\u201d\n\nNewsom conceded, replying, \u201cI agree with you, we\u2019re getting crushed on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in my own friend cohort, people say, \u2018What the hell is going on? Why aren\u2019t you calling this out? When did this happen?'\u201d the governor noted before reiterating that he cannot bring himself to change his stance on the matter.\n\nKirk informed Newsom, \u201cYou guys are giving us an 80/20 issue that is just permeating the country, and it\u2019s such an affront to our senses,\u201d to which the governor replied, \u201cI don\u2019t disagree.\u201d\n\nThe TPUSA founder went on to explain to Newsom that the difference between liberals and conservatives is, \u201cYou guys will tend to view an incident through an \u2018oppress or oppressed\u2019 lens,\u201d and \u201cwe, as conservatives, tend to view things through right or wrong, or just or unjust.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the country is going far more in our direction and away from your direction\u201d Kirk said. \u201cBecause the problem with \u2018oppress or oppressed\u2019 is eventually, you run out of oppressors, and you start creating them out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

We don't need cars from Canada. We don't need energy from Canada. We don't need anything from Canada.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And acknowledges the possibility of economic disruption.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There could be some disturbance, a little bit of disturbance.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The administration says it hopes the tariffs will pressure Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into the U.S.\n\nWe will ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem if it's working and we will get the latest on the president's mass deportation mission.\n\nCanada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, will also be here. We will ask her about the costs and consequences of the growing trade war.\n\nPlus, with just days to go before a possible government shutdown, lawmakers unveil a new bill to avoid it. We will hear from the co-chairs of the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi.\n\nFinally, Russia expert Fiona Hill, who served as a top National Security Council official during the first Trump administration, joins us to discuss Trump's diplomatic pivot on Ukraine.\n\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nWe begin this morning with the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem.\n\nMadam Secretary, good to have you in person. Thank you for joining us.\n\nKRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Yes, good morning. Thank you for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dive right into this trade war.\n\nThe justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75 percent in the past six months.\n\nDoesn't that show the existing system is working?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office.\n\nAnd I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is, how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels?\n\nYou've seen the president name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada just recently is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here.\n\nHe pointed to CBP data that showed a 97 percent drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, we're\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is the data accurate?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The data is getting better. And I would say, in the conversations that I have had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action.\n\nSo this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system, so that we know, when someone crosses that northern border, who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with.\n\nWe also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens.\n\nPresident Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction. But, boy, every day, people in this country are dying of overdoses. And I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be \u2013 if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do presumably to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary said on another network: \"If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it,\" meaning the president, \"they will stay on until he's comfortable.\n\nIs it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, I have had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do. So they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them.\n\nIf they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business. And he meant it when he ran to be president of the United States again and since he's taken office that he will put America first.\n\nAnd every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country, and where Americans can look forward to the future.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal? This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying this really is about fentanyl?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It really is about fentanyl. It really is.\n\nAnd I think the president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation.\n\nI think a lot of people don't understand the strategy\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing.\n\nThey are bringing this in, not just to make money. They're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you.Border crossings, they're at a 25-year low.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 U.S. military personnel working at the border now. That number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month.\n\nHow long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense.\n\nBut, also, we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the attorney general's office. You know, we're working every day with the secretary of state. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure. And we see all-time record lows of encounters. Our Border Patrol is doing fantastic work.\n\nBut we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country, where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore.\n\nAmericans have to live by the law. So do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to \u2013 excuse me \u2013 migration.\n\nThe administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children, in ICE detention centers. Bush did it. Obama did it. Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained.\n\nBut, remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a Web site where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't have a choice in this. You know that.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They \u2013 if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family.\n\nAnd we need to remember that when Americans break the law, and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It's that President Biden didn't follow the law.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You won't\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: He didn't follow the law, in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.\n\nAnd so, today, we're \u2013 we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan. They have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan. That was going to be another expansion of this team.\n\nThey have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law. And, if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: al Qaeda you want the number of deportations to tick up?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I do, absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: People, remember, they have an option to go home on their own.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that. And if they don't, and they end up coming into our enforcement opportunities that we have in front of us, you know, they may never get the chance to come back. So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you have a capacity issue right now in terms of just beds to put people in when you detain them. Are you going to open up military facilities like Fort Bliss?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: There is, yes, a plan to use the facilities at Fort Bliss for detention facilities.\n\nBut, also, we need to remember to ask \u2013 Congress needs to continue through with funding that this administration has asked for. You know, we clearly have a C.R. discussion in front of us this week. We have a reconciliation discussion. That reconciliation bill needs to happen. We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that \u2013 that we have.\n\nAnd even \u2013 everywhere I have been in this country out there, looking at what President Trump has done on immigration and border enforcement, the people that I meet are saying, thank you. Thank you for getting these terrorists out of the country. He has deported\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Terrorists?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 in just one month\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you deported terrorists?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 22 known and \u2013 terrorists on the terrorist watch list are out of this country now.\n\nWe have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month, and\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which have been redefined as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, 281 specific TDA members, which we know are the worst of the worst, have been taken out of this country.\n\nSo, everyone that has a story like Laken Riley's family or Jocelyn's family, they're extremely grateful that that won't be perpetuated amongst other families in other states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You said that you have found leakers within DHS and you're going to prosecute them.\n\nBack on February 9, you tweeted: \"The FBI is so corrupt.We will work with any and every agency to stop leaks.\"\n\nWere you wrong then to blame the FBI if the leaks were from within DHS?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: No, I think there's leakers all over throughout this government. I think that everybody needs to be\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What did they leak?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think these \u2013 in DHS specifically, these two were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and exposed law enforcement to vulnerabilities, to those ops being jeopardized, to where their lives would be in danger.\n\nSo they will be prosecuted, and they could face up to 10 years in federal prison because they did that. Anyone who is leaking information outside of \u2013 of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you're going to continue these polygraphing\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 of employees?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The authorities that I have under the Department of Homeland Security are broad and extensive. And I plan to use every single one of them to make sure that we're following the law, that we are following the procedures in place to keep people safe, and that we're making sure we're following through on what President Trump has promised, that he's going to make America safe again.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you for your time today.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Thank you for having me.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Canadian officials are warning of retaliation against the U.S. over President Trump's tariff threats.\n\nSenior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe has the latest from Ottawa.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Well, Margaret, President Trump is now threatening tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber exports, even as he holds off on the broader tariffs on goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement until at least early April.\n\nThis has mostly been a war of words so far, rather than a war over the wallet, but that's going to change in the coming day, as Ontario is now threatening to tariff electricity it wires to Minnesota, Michigan and New York.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nDOUG FORD (Premier of Ontario, Canada): I'm going to put a 25 percent tariff on the electricity, the 1.5 million homes and businesses, as of Monday, until President Trump drops these tariffs.\n\nHe has to understand that he can't attack our country economically and expect us to roll over.\n\n(End VT)\n\nED O'KEEFE: It's not entirely clear how the cost of those tariffs would be passed on to American households.\n\nNow, we're here in Ottawa today because, amid the tariff war, there's also a Canadian transfer of power under way. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January he would be stepping down after nearly a decade. His ruling Liberal Party today anoints his successor.\n\nIt's a race between Mark Carney, an economist and the former head of the Banks of Canada and Britain, and Chrystia Freeland, a former Trudeau deputy. Whoever wins the race, Margaret, becomes prime minister and has to deal with President Trump and the tariff war.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Ed O'Keefe in Ottawa.\n\nWe're joined now by Canada's ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman.\n\nAmbassador, it's good to have you here.\n\nKIRSTEN HILLMAN (Canadian Ambassador to the United States): Thanks for having me, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the homeland security secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow-through on fentanyl.\n\nDoes that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I hope so.\n\nI mean, it \u2013 I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources. We have given our law enforcement new powers. And we have responded to the requests of the Trump administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China.\n\nWe've had some really, really good discussions. So we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know, fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days, we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States.\n\nSo we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal or just because President Trump believes in them?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are \u2013 we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border.\n\nThere are other tariffs that have been discussed, and the president has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and, you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said Friday he may put tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Monday or Tuesday. Here's what he said. Take a listen:\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250 percent. Nobody ever talks about that, 250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore.\n\nWe're going to be \u2013 they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. And that's what reciprocal means.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On another network, the commerce secretary said, no, that's actually on hold until April 2.\n\nIt's confusing for us to follow this along. Is the clarity with the two governments any better?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, we are in active discussions with Secretary Lutnick. And those discussions are heading towards April 2.\n\nAnd that, I think, is \u2013 we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And, you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question.\n\nThe president \u2013 the president does have a variety of concerns and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives. But, really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues, like, for example, lumber. Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free.\n\nOn dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So, what's more, I think, productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But Canada does put a tariff as high as 241 percent on dairy imports, but it's a sliding scale that only kicks in at a certain level, and that's under the free trade deal.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: And it's like the United States. In agriculture, the United States is the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: In sugar and dairy, you allow a certain amount of product in, and then, after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports. And we do the same to protect our farmers and families and, you know, small family farms that \u2013 that need to be sure that they can have a bit of the market.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, there was this 50-minute phone call Wednesday with the vice president, the commerce secretary and President Trump with your prime minister, Justin Trudeau.\n\nAfterwards, the president posted that Trudeau was unable to tell him when the election was taking place, which made him curious, like \u2013 quote \u2013 \"What's going on here? I then realized he's trying to use this issue to stay in power.\"\n\nDo you think this is, like, a personal issue here? Do you think it'll change when your leadership changes?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: It's hard for me to \u2013 hard for me to say.\n\nI think that the prime minister and the president, Prime Minister Trudeau and the president, they've done big things together, right? They did renegotiate NAFTA together.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They have a history together.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Right. They have a long history. They did good things together. They managed our 6,000 \u2013 practically 6,000-mile border during COVID very successfully, in my opinion.\n\nSo it's a long relationship, and has many \u2013 has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in, in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's prime minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it will stop the vows from the president to talk about threatening to annex Canada?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, I guess what I can\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What is that?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: I \u2013 I \u2013 yes, I \u2013 I'm \u2013 I'm not sure what that is.\n\nWhat I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But, more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors, you know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in L.A., but obviously 9/11.\n\nYou've come to our aid over the years so many times. And we feel \u2013 Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack. And that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society. I think our new prime minister, when that person comes in, will prioritize trying to have a good and \u2013 and healthy and productive relationship with the president.\n\nI am sure that that's going to be possible. Relationships go both ways, but I know that, on our side, that's going to be a priority.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for joining us.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Thanks.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to another front in President Trump's trade war, and that's China.\n\nForeign correspondent Anna Coren is in Beijing with the latest.\n\nANNA COREN: A tone of defiance from Beijing this week, with China preparing for a protracted trade war with the United States, which it maintains will have no winners.\n\nIt announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products and targeted 25 American companies in response to the now 20 percent blanket tariffs President Trump placed on all Chinese goods.\n\nIn a press conference on the sidelines of the National People's Congress, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the country would fight back, despite economic challenges at home. And without naming President Trump, he accused the U.S. of being duplicitous in its relationship with China, saying:\n\n(Begin VT)\n\n(FOREIGN MINISTER WANG YI SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\n\n(End VT)\n\nANNA COREN: \"No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while maintaining good relations with China on the other.\"\n\nWell, earlier this week, his ministry used particularly aggressive language, stating: \"If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight until the end.\"\n\nWhile there's no doubt a trade war will hurt China's economy, it's had six years to prepare for this since a trade war began in 2018. And, Margaret, despite being open to negotiations, its decision to opt for defiance, rather than flattery, is a sign China won't back down.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Anna Coren in Beijing.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including an interview with the bipartisan co-chairs of the Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi, plus the latest on President Trump's push for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi, represents a district that went for President Trump.\n\nSo, you all have to find the middle. And that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place.\n\nBut I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick.\n\nThere is this potential government shutdown looming March the 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines or do you need Democratic votes?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it, like most bills. There's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we've got to make an accurate decision.\n\nI will say, you know, Tom and I are friends. We came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill.\n\nThe construct in this country is, if you get 218 votes, you get everything. If you get 217 votes, you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n\nSo, the reason that we do what we do is we want two-party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning, over the next 24 hours, what's in it and what's not in it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi, because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter that Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Everything's very fractured. Everything's very divisive. And to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together.\n\nIn the case of this CR, there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiation. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes and then people start negotiating.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Awhile, meaning we could be staring down a shutdown March 14th?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this. But it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We never want to shut the government down. It's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislator's funding off if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So, people need to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way.\n\nThen it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So, it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide, who's going to get blamed for this thing?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And wouldn't it be better if we all just worked together to try and find common ground the way we -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And I will add, Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down, surveillance teams get shut down. It is massive implications that most people don't realize. You never ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen. And it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who - now a congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over directives. He had been supportive of bureau leaders who resisted turning over the nations of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January the 6th, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the bureau. It was the best job I ever had in my life, and most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that worked there. They're a tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. At 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable. So -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked - she went at the FBI. The FBI director was -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, there have been conflicts at the top. I want - I want to differentiate. So, there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like - people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point.\n\nThe FBI needs to be completely nonpartisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in, so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms. And things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted, and I think, in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: About the firing for the political (INAUDIBLE)?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: On past - Director - Director Patel worked on our committee.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that - that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, obviously, we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well after he did his executive order to say, no, asylum applications are between the ports of entry. But we need to make it permanent law. And Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So, we need to secure the border, we need to fix the broken asylum system and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The two of you together?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I - I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Lutrell (ph) from Texas, very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this.\n\nNow Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus are taking those efforts and others and trying - and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about, you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: OK, but we -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Like, you're talking about really hard, substantive things.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, what's going to happen is the - Homeland Security is going to need money.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're - they're spending money like crazy and the CR is not going to fix the problem. And at some -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's going to go to reconciliation, party line vote, right?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: If - you can't fix everything through reconciliation. And you're going to need - and you can't - certainly can't fix asylum and you certainly can't fix the dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There is going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is, we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And if I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came into this country through other places, Italy, Ireland.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My father was born in Italy.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And for Brian (ph) Fitzpatrick, Irish as well.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And, you know, that's the - that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries, is, we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran. Everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage.\n\nSo, we can combine border security and the rule of law with being - bringing the best and brightest people into this country and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. And that's what America is about.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody. Everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: There's no, why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that doesn't know what they're talking about.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's an entire political campaign, why don't you just.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Right. Right. Which doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Just sit across from each other and say, well, I think this, well I think that, well how about this, well how about that, and you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Compromise is not a dirty word. And we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway, you guys are no good because you're one of those - no, you're on of those.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: It's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine and its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded U.S. Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence, and military support from Ukraine, advances strategic interests or helps make America great.\n\nCan you explain that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this, we're going to get a briefing - a full briefing on this, this coming week. But I will say this, key in on what's not being said here. What kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So, what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over the horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Possibly. But, second, we -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Maxar technologies cannot (INAUDIBLE).\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the U.K., to give you one example. There's no restriction on the U.K. sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So, what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, this that this an escalate to de- escalate tactic by the administration to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that. And I get asked, well, what does that mean?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Vladimir - what victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine. That he wishes he did not do that. And that's really going to be the test here, right, because if we reward dictators from invading sovereign, freedom-loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this plant that, if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelenskyy was elected by 73 percent of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election as dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelenskyy is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the secretary of state, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of, Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the U.S. Congress who ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's not - it's not a threat. What this is, is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II. When we had - when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world saying it's not our problem, we don't want to provoke, we don't want to escalate. And a problem that could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history where we had to send our young - our youth in our country to fight on Omaha beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history.\n\nThese dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. And World War II, freedom won over dictatorship. They want to relitigate that. So, we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this, just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova and think about Poland.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're all next. And we have to stand up against this.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that. He's telegraphed this punch.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, President Trump says, oh, it's all different when he's in charge.\n\nBut, Congressman, I need to ask you, before you go, because of the districts and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent, earlier this week we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes. We - we communicate -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because some have gotten quite heated recently.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No, I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with their constituents. And there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the - what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium, the protesters shows up, they hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups.\n\nSo, there's - it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different depending on - on where they're at.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that. Later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is, it was a strategic mistake on the part - on our behalf as well because instead of talking about Social Security cuts, and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts, and talking about the things that the president said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that makes no sense whatsoever, we, instead, focus too much time on disruptive behavior.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Was - was that message from Democratic leadership not clear then?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Let's not make the story about us, let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And we squandered that opportunity.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you, gentlemen -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: For doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You bet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine following the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence sharing and military equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones.\n\nFor more now, we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings and during the first Trump administration she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council.\n\nGood to have you back.\n\nFIONA HILL (Senior Fellow, Brookings and Fromer National Security Council Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs): Yes, thanks, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS. We also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine.\n\nWhat's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?\n\nFIONA HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks, and it's also not just blindsided but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies, like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the U.K., have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So, even if there is, you know, some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact.\n\nAnd, frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two-way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the U.K., Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence freely?\n\nFIONA HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it will be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this. Because if you're bundling together intelligence, then effectively the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our five eyes allies, for example, or with other allies, particularly in the midst of basically a conflict that is, as we've heard, you know, over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard because he's not just affecting Ukraine, again, it's having knock-on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt. Here's what he said.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's - I think he wants to get it stopped and settled, and I think he's hitting them harder than - than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?\n\nFIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yes, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the Resolute Desk. I mean,n I think that's what you can take away from this. He accurately -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president and when he says things?\n\nFIONA HILL: That's - I think you should. Yes. I mean, he's the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine - the Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelenskyy, that he sees them on the back foot as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards was the line. He kept using that.\n\nFIONA HILL: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. And when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine, he said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was, like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose, you got their attention.\"\n\nIt's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?\n\nFIONA HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office in front of all the cameras to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message.\n\nAnd I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should not only be speaking in your native language. And I think that a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that - I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points. But there's one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your - your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden. And President Trump immediately dismissed all of that and basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, or the commitments that were made because they were weak and it wasn't me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because it was not me.\n\nFIONA HILL: And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, what he learned there, was that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment. And that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand.\n\nAnd I think in the future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nFIONA HILL: Although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side on the United States side could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nFIONA HILL: So, my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters, that's what they're there for.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters?\n\nFIONA HILL: That's absolutely right, your own government's interpreters, no (ph), because you actually asked that question, who's interpreters were used and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.\n\nFIONA HILL: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent. An umbrella. That's - does that mean the transatlantic alliance is gone?\n\nFIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of a kind of a one-sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States.\n\nI was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nFIONA HILL: And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.\n\nFIONA HILL: But we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.\n\nFIONA HILL: That's correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of a security guarantee that was not delivered on.\n\nFIONA HILL: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, thank you.\n\nWe'll be back.\n\nFIONA HILL: Thanks.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for today. Thank you for watching. Until next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)"

Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi represents a district that went for President Trump. So you all have to find the middle and that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place. But I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, there is this potential government shutdown looming March 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines, or do you need Democratic votes?\n\nREP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday, compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it. Like most bills, there's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we got to make an aggregated decision. I will say, you know, Tom and I are friends, we came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill- the construct in this country is if you get 218 votes, you get everything, and if you get 217 votes you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So the reason that we do what we do is we want two party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning over the next 24 hours what's in it and what's not in it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi? Because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter, Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?\n\nREP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy. Everything's very fractured, everything's very divisive, and to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together. In the case of the CR there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiated. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while, and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes. And then people start negotiating.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A while, meaning we could be staring down to shut down March 14?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week. We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this, but it's- it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad? We never want to shut the government down. That's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislators' funding off, if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So people need to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way. Then it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide who's going to get blamed for this thing. And wouldn't it be better if we all just work together to try and find common ground the way- this is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process. And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: And I will add Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down. Surveillance teams get shut down. It has massive implications that most people don't realize. You never, ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen, and it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who- now turned Congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over a directive. He had been supportive of Bureau leaders who resisted turning over the names of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January 6, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the Bureau. It's the best job I ever had in my life, and the most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that work there. They are tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. In 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable, so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked- she went at the FBI- the FBI director--\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: -- Well, there are problems at the top. I want to differentiate. So there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like- people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point. The FBI needs to be completely non-partisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in- so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.\n\nREP. TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms and things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted. And I think in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politicization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: -- Absolutely, absolutely--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- About the firings of the--\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: -- Director Patel he worked on our committee. He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that- that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Well, obviously we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well, after he did his executive order to say no asylum applications in between the ports of entry. But we need to make a permanent law, and Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So we need to secure the border. We need to fix the broken asylum system, and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though? The two of you together?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Luttrell from Texas. Very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges, and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this. Now, Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus, are taking those efforts and others and trying- and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about- you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: -- Okay, but we--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN:-- you're talking about really hard, substantive thing--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Well what's going to happen is the Homeland Security is going to need money. They're spending money like crazy, and the CR is not going to fix the problem and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But that's going to go to reconciliation, a party line vote, right?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: You can't fix everything through reconciliation, and you're going to need- and you can't- certainly can't fix asylum, and you can't- certainly can't fix the Dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There's going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, Dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: If I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came in to this country through other places, Italy, Ireland--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: -- My father was born in Italy. And for Brennan and Fitzpatrick I got Irish as well.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK : You know, that's the- that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries. It's- we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran, everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage. So we can combine border security and the rule of law with being- bringing the best and brightest people into this country, and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. That's what America is about.\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody, everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just? There's no why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --That's an entire political campaign--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: --Right\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why don't you just\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Which doesn't make sense. And so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues, to sit across from each other say, well, I think this, well, I think that. Well, how about this? Well, how about that? And you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle. Compromise is not a dirty word, and we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway. You guys are no good because you're one of those. No you're one of those. That's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded US Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence and military support from Ukraine advances strategic interests or helps make America great. Can you explain that?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this. We're going to get a briefing, a full briefing, on this, this coming week, but I will say this key in on what's not being said here, what kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over-the-horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Possibly, but second--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Maxar technology--\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the UK. To give you one example, there's no restriction on the UK sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, is that this is an escalate to de-escalate tactic by the administration, to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that, and I get asked, well, what does that mean? Yep. Vladimir. What victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine, that he wishes he did not do that, and that's really going to be the test here, right? Because if we reward dictators for invading sovereign, freedom loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this planet that if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit, as co-chair of the Ukrainian caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelensky was elected by 73% of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election that's dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelensky is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the Secretary of State, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the US Congress who are ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: It's not a threat. What this is is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II, when we had- when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world, saying it's not our problem. We don't want to provoke. We don't want to escalate, and a problem that could have been could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history, where we had to send our young, our youth in our country, to fight on Omaha Beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history. These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. In World War II freedom won over dictatorships. They want to relitigate that. So we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.\n\nREP. SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova, and think about Poland, right? They're all next, and we have to stand up against this.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that he's telegraphed this punch.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN\n\nRight, well, President Trump says that it's all different when he's in charge, but Congressman, I need to ask you before you go because of the district and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent. Earlier this week, we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, we, we--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Because some of them have gotten quite heated recently.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No. I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with our constituents, and there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium. The protesters show up. They hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups. So there's- it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different, depending on- on where they're at.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is it was a strategic mistake on the on our behalf as well. Because instead of talking about Social Security cuts and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts and talking about the things that the President said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that make no sense whatsoever. We instead focus too much time on disruptive behavior and the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the US House of Representatives--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Was the message from Democratic leadership not clear, then?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: --I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message, let's not make the story about us. Let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it. And we squandered that opportunity. All right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen for doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well."

CBS News\n\nNoem, who was confirmed and sworn in as DHS secretary in late January, touted the administration's work on the border so far, saying \"we've seen incredible progress\" since Mr. Trump took office. She noted that the progress can be built upon, including by working with the Mexican government to \"make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border, and make sure we're going after these cartels.\"\n\nThe DHS secretary argued that due to the Trump administration's tariffs, imposed last week and later delayed on Canada and Mexico, \"we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.\"\n\nNoem stressed that the tariffs are about stopping fentanyl from entering the country, saying Mr. Trump is committed to making the country safer.\n\n\"The president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well, but this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation,\" Noem said.\n\nNoem also announced Sunday that Todd Lyons will be serving as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who she said has a long history with border czar Tom Homan. Madison Sheahan will serve deputy secretary, she said.\n\nAmid the administration's effort to crackdown on illegal immigration and pledge to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history, illegal border crossings fell to a 25-year low last month. Asked whether she plans to keep the 6,000 military personnel at the southern border, Noem said they'll remain \"until that border is completely secure, and we see all time record lows of encounters.\"\n\n\"Our border patrol is doing fantastic work, but we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore,\" Noem said. \"This is President Donald Trump's country where we have a border, where we have laws and it applies equally to everybody.\"\n\nStill, the administration faces a capacity issue, with a limited number of beds for detainees. Noem said there is a plan to use a military facility at Fort Bliss in Texas for detentions, while urging that the administration needs Congress to approve more funding for the operations.\n\n\"We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that we have,\" Noem said."

You know what I\u2019ll just say to the American people here is that the Republicans, Trump in particular, he\u2019s trying to make this about safety, but it\u2019s not about safety and security of our kids. You know, I\u2019ve got a seven year old and a nine year old. You know, if it was about safety and security, then maybe we would have seen Trump and the Republicans do something about the 330 school shootings that we had last year, which I\u2019m terrified of having two elementary school kids, or about the 1 in 5 kids in this that goes to school hungry and isn\u2019t able to have enough food in their stomachs to be able to get through the day.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo it\u2019s not about safety and security.

So that\u2019s something that I just really wanted to make clear. This is not about safety and security, it\u2019s all about the politics.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN"

Even if you don't, now there's \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the musical, an exuberant blast from the past \u2013 old Cuban music for a new audience. The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.\n\nJustin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"\n\nA scene from the Broadway musical \"Buena Vista Social Club.\" CBS News\n\nThe true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.\n\n\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"\n\nI asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"\n\nWorld Circuit/Nonesuch\n\nThe unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.\n\n\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"\n\n\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"\n\nSinger-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"\n\nFrom the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)\n\nThe play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.\n\nMarco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAs the Pentagon and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency set their sights on climate-related programs at the Defense Department, officials and experts are warning that slashing them could put US troops and military operations at risk, both in the near and long term.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior Pentagon officials have pointed to climate programs as a prime example of wasteful spending in the military. Hegseth told reporters in Germany in February that the Pentagon is \u201cnot in the business of climate change.\u201d\n\nActing Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Salesses also made it clear that funding would be cut in a statement last month, saying the Pentagon will \u201ccease unnecessary spending that set our military back under the previous administration, including through so-called \u2018climate change\u2019 and other woke programs.\u201d\n\nBut some officials and experts argue such thinking is short-sighted.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re stuck on the word \u2018climate\u2019 and not seeing the operational impacts,\u201d one US official said, adding that the cuts will pose \u201creadiness issues all around.\u201d\n\nIn response to multiple questions from CNN about military readiness as it relates to climate programs and the cutting of funding to research and other efforts, Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot said the Defense Department \u201cis working closely with DOGE to identify efficiencies and savings across the department on behalf of taxpayers while we restore the warrior ethos and refocus our military on its core mission of deterring, fighting and winning wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate zealotry and other woke chimeras of the Left are not part of that core mission,\u201d Ullyot said.\n\nDr. Ravi Chaudhary, former assistant secretary of the Air Force for energy, installations and environment, told CNN that climate programs are not just important to giving the US military an edge on adversaries like China, but they also help keep service members and their families safe.\n\n\u201cInaction at this point will put our readiness and the lives of our troops and their families at greater risk,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, officials who spoke to CNN pointed to a number of programs within the Defense Department that could technically be tagged as climate-related but have real operational impacts on the military.\n\nMaking military installations more resilient to extreme weather events, for example, could save the Pentagon billions in the long term as wildfires and hurricanes become more common and more intense. In 2019, the Air Force requested $5 billion to rebuild two major bases after hurricanes and flooding caused severe damage.\n\nIn this October 2018 photo, a soldier stands guard at the damaged entrance to Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida, in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael. David Goldman/AP/File\n\nExtreme weather also impacts the ability of service members to train \u2013 one Senate aide familiar with the discussions around climate programs in the Pentagon told CNN there has been an increase of \u201cblack flag\u201d training days, meaning troops cannot train because it\u2019s too hot outside.\n\nChaudhary pointed to an array of other issues caused by changes in climate: Wildfires delaying launch cadences at Space Force bases in the US; melting permafrost in Alaska impacting US runways in the Arctic; building natural and artificial reefs around US installations to protect bases from storm surges; and energy efficiency efforts by the Air Force to reduce drag on US aircraft and save millions on fuel.\n\nWill Rogers, the former senior climate adviser to the secretary of the Army who is now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, also warned the rhetoric coming from senior officials disparaging climate-related efforts could have a \u201cparalyzing effect on critical modernization efforts\u201d related to climate, the impact of which could be felt \u201cfor years.\u201d\n\nOpportunities for China\n\nOutside of protecting US military installations and personnel, sources also warned that ignoring climate issues could damage the US\u2019 national security interests abroad.\n\nChaudhary and the Senate aide both pointed to China\u2019s willingness to fill any gaps left by the US, particularly with Pacific island nations that often consider climate change one of the most pressing threats facing their existence. A former senior Pentagon official told CNN that climate change is a top priority for many Pacific islands \u2013 many of which the US will depend on for facilities such as airplane runways and ports in the scenario of conflict with China. And if the US is unwilling to help those countries with climate resiliency, China will be more than happy to step in, the former senior official warned.\n\nRogers said that concern exists not only in the Pacific, but also in the Horn of Africa and Central and South America.\n\n\u201cIf we say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not interested in climate change,\u2019 our adversaries or near peer competitors \u2013 whatever you want to call them \u2013 are more than happy to slide into [partners\u2019 and allies\u2019] DMs and offer funding at our detriment,\u201d the Senate aide said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just efforts being directly carried out by the Defense Department at risk; Pentagon leadership has also narrowed in on funding for academic research related to climate change and security issues abroad.\n\nIn a video posted on X last week, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell named programs that Musk\u2019s DOGE had identified as wasteful spending within the Degense Depatment.\n\n\u201cHow about this one: $1.6 million to the University of Florida to study social and institutional detriments of vulnerability in resilience to climate hazards in African Sahel,\u201d Parnell said in the video. \u201cYou see folks \u2013 this stuff is not a core function of our military. This is not what we do, this is a distraction from our core mission.\u201d\n\nThe project in question \u2013 more accurately called Social and Institutional Determinants of Vulnerability and Resilience to Climate Hazards in the African Sahel \u2013 does study climate change. But it specifically focuses on how people in the African Sahel could respond, and the risks it could pose not only to their population but also to the security of nations around them.\n\nGirls carry water on their bicycles at a dispensary in Nedogo village near Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in the African Sahel region, in February 2018. Luc Gnago/Rueters\n\n\u201cOur project was attempting to understand how people are responding and with what consequences, right? I mean, if people starve, that\u2019s really bad, obviously \u2026 but if you\u2019re the US government and thinking in totally narrow self-interested terms, it\u2019s also bad if people join radical groups because they are desperate, or migrate en masse to other areas and put pressure on refugee camps and borders or governments,\u201d said Leonardo Villal\u00f3n, the lead investigator of the project and founder of the University of Florida\u2019s Sahel Research Group.\n\n\u2018No communication\u2019\n\n\u201cThere was absolutely no question, no communication, no nothing about it ahead of time,\u201d Villal\u00f3n said. \u201cSo had someone reached out and said could you please explain to us what you\u2019re doing and why this is worth doing, I would have happily spoken to anybody.\u201d\n\nVillal\u00f3n added that despite Parnell\u2019s insinuation that the Pentagon was saving $1.6 million by cutting the program, the majority of their grant had already been spent over the last few years as he and his team conducted research, traveling to the countries they were studying \u2013 which included Senegal, Niger, Chad and Mauritania \u2013 conducting interviews and surveys.\n\n\u201cIn our case,\u201d he said, \u201cthey saved no more than $200,000.\u201d\n\nThe funding was provided under the Minerva Research Initiative, a Defense Department program launched in 2008 that provides academic grants to further social science research on topics \u201cof strategic importance to the US national security policy,\u201d its website previously said. As of Friday, the Minerva Research Initiative\u2019s website was offline.\n\nVillal\u00f3n told CNN last week that multiple other climate-related research initiatives had their funding cut off. A Defense Department news release Friday afternoon said the Pentagon was \u201cscrapping its social science research portfolio,\u201d including research focused on \u201cglobal migration patterns, climate change impacts, and social trends.\u201d The release said the Defense Department expects to save \u201cmore than $30 million in the first year through the discontinuation of 91 studies.\u201d\n\nUltimately, that research is meant to help the Pentagon get ahead of major events that could have serious security side effects, Villal\u00f3n said.\n\n\u201cWe live in a very interconnected world, and the US, like everybody else, has an interest in preventing areas of significant instability and suffering that have repercussions for the rest of the world. \u2026 What we\u2019re trying to do is understand the situations in these places on the premise that a not knowing about it is going to come back and bite us, frankly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have learned that elsewhere in the world \u2013 whether it\u2019s in Central America, Afghanistan, or other places \u2013 we don\u2019t gain by not understanding other parts of the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIgnorance is not a solution.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Editor\u2019s Note:This analysis was originally published in CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in America newsletter. Read past issues and subscribe here.\n\nJD Vance is a different kind of vice president.\n\nHe\u2019s not the Machiavellian master of Washington who works in the shadows \u2013 like Dick Cheney. Neither is he the safe pair of foreign policy hands \u2013 like a George H.W. Bush or Joe Biden.\n\nThe youthful Vance seems instead to have fashioned himself as the personification of his boss Donald Trump\u2019s most extreme social media posts. His provocation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week ignited a diplomatic crisis. He relished traveling to Munich to insult America\u2019s European allies. And Vance was front-page news in Britain after saying Ukraine needed better security guarantees than those offered by \u201csome random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d Vance later said it was \u201cabsurdly dishonest\u201d to say he was talking about Britain and France \u2013 but those were the only allies to publicly volunteer for a Ukraine peace force.\n\nVance knows which way the wind is blowing in the Republican Party. That\u2019s why he ditched his contempt for the President \u2013 after reportedly wondering in 2016 whether Trump might be America\u2019s Hitler. Now, in a party that worships its leader, the vice president is one of the president\u2019s most prominent public admirers.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the infamous Oval Office clash with Trump and Vance in Washington, DC, on February 28. Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nBut Vance is a fascinating character. He rose from a hard scrabble upbringing in the Appalachians to the Ivy League. He\u2019s exceedingly smart \u2013 one reason why his political positioning is often taken as evidence of nefarious calculation. Vance, who briefly served as an Ohio senator, despises traditional media and Washington elites so he\u2019s a natural fit with Trump\u2019s populism. He\u2019s also a US Marine veteran \u2013 so he ought to know better about the contribution of US allies to the war on terror. And he got rich in Silicon Valley and has an in with the big tech barons who\u2019ve moved sharply to the right and embraced Trump in his second term.\n\nThe vice president made his name with \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d a memoir about his childhood in deprived areas of Ohio and Kentucky. The 2016 book explained how deindustrialization fostered poverty and drug addiction and an eventual political backlash against globalized free trade policies. It became a kind of handbook for understanding Trump supporters in his first term.\n\nGiven that background, it\u2019s not surprising that Vance produced the campaign\u2019s most eloquent arguments for an America First economic policy. At 40, he\u2019s a potential heir to Trump \u2013 although the president amusingly refused to anoint him in a recent Fox News interview, unwilling to think about ceding his throne so soon.\n\nVance is the epitome of what many Europeans disdain about America. An isolationist, he sees no vital national interest in Ukraine. His bluntness and hint of smugness irk many foreigners, as does his support for Europe\u2019s far-right \u2013 including Germany\u2019s extremist AfD. A day before confronting Zelensky in the Oval Office, he rebuked Keir Starmer over free speech in the UK \u2013 although the British PM shut him down.\n\nSince Vance is young, ambitious, ideological, and has an apparent chip on his shoulder about establishment intellectuals, there\u2019s one vice president he does remind us of \u2013 Richard Nixon.\n\nWhen Nixon joined Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s ticket in 1952, he\u2019d spent about enough time in the Senate to have a cup of coffee \u2013 just like Vance. And like his 21st century successor, he was a new breed of GOP ideologue \u2013 while the current VP upbraids \u201cwoke\u201d liberals, Nixon hounded supposed communists living in the United States. And like Vance, Nixon had his eye on higher things. His ambitions and penchant for the dark side of politics sometimes caused tensions with his more experienced boss \u2013 a possible omen for the relationship between Trump and Vance.\n\nA tight-lipped outgoing President Harry Truman stands at left as Richard Nixon, right, raises his right hand to be sworn in as vice president of the United States by Sen. William Knowland of California on January 20, 1953, in Washington, DC. WF/AP\n\nNixon used his eight-year vice presidency as a crash course in global affairs that was key to his success as a statesman after he finally won the big job in 1968. Vance however seems unlikely to emulate Nixon\u2019s long global odysseys \u2013 he has political interests back home.\n\nBut don\u2019t underestimate Vance. He\u2019s risen high and fast. But will hubris lead him to fly too close to the sun?\n\nCanadians are about to get a new prime minister\n\nThe Liberal Party will elect a successor to its unpopular leader Justin Trudeau on Sunday and that person will quickly replace him as prime minister. The favorite is Mark Carney \u2013 the former governor of the banks of Canada and England. Former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, whose resignation was instrumental in Trudeau\u2019s fall, hopes to beat him to the top job.\n\nSuddenly, the Liberal leadership looks worth having. Trump\u2019s trade blitzkrieg and demands for Canada to become the 51st state have transformed politics north of the border. Trudeau\u2019s party once looked doomed to defeat by Pierre Poilievre\u2019s Conservative Party in an election due by the fall. But Poilievre\u2019s Trumpy themes left him exposed and Liberal\u2019s deficit in the polls has evaporated.\n\nThe big question now is what is next? Carney doesn\u2019t currently have a seat in parliament, so will have to seek one at the earliest opportunity in a by-election if he becomes PM.\n\nBut might he take a gamble and try to exploit an explosion of patriotism and antipathy towards Trump by calling a snap general election? If he were to lose, he\u2019d become a political punchline. But fortune favors the brave \u2013 and this may be the Liberals\u2019 only chance of a shock rebound."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUsha Vance is a private person in a very public job.\n\nWith her husband JD Vance\u2019s rapid political elevation to President Donald Trump\u2019s second-in-command, she stepped away from a successful legal career and into an unelected and ceremonial role that comes with no manual, an automatic global platform, and plenty of scrutiny from the American public and the media.\n\nShe faces her first test this weekend. After not speaking publicly or participating in any media interviews in the seven weeks of the Trump administration, Usha Vance is embarking on her first major solo trip as second lady, leading the US delegation to the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Turin, Italy, where she is joining athletes, coaches, families and fans in cheering on Team USA. She attended the opening ceremony on Saturday.\n\nShe\u2019s already joined the vice president for a high-stakes trip to Europe, appearing by his side in France and Germany and joining him for meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And behind the scenes, a source familiar told CNN, the second lady is assembling a small team of staff, transitioning her three children to life at the Naval Observatory, and settling into the role, for which she will have her own platform and responsibilities.\n\nWhat those will be, however, remains a mystery.\n\nAs the 39-year-old former Supreme Court clerk contemplates the platform and impact she hopes to have, Vance is described by people who know her as thoughtful, whip-smart and decisive. She is also extremely guarded. CNN reached out to dozens of friends, colleagues and family members; none agreed to speak on the record about her.\n\nWhile JD Vance has emerged as the president\u2019s attack dog \u2014 his interjections, for example, escalated Trump\u2019s Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 his wife has largely stayed under the radar.\n\nBut being a top figurehead in a new administration alongside first lady Melania Trump, who has taken her own approach to the spousal role, is a delicate dynamic she\u2019ll have to navigate.\n\nUsha Vance has appeared with the first lady at major events such as the inauguration and the president\u2019s address to Congress, but it is unclear whether they have substantively engaged, as Melania Trump spent four weeks away from Washington at the start of the new administration.\n\nAsked by Fox News during the campaign whether she had spoken with the first lady about the role, Vance sidestepped the question, saying she had received advice \u201cfrom various friends who found themselves unexpectedly in the spotlight, or, you know, honestly, just faced crises or other situations that really changed their plans for their lives.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for the first lady and second lady did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on their relationship.\n\nWho is Usha Vance?\n\nVance is the youngest second lady to hold the role since the Truman administration and the first to raise school-age children at the Naval Observatory since the Clinton era.\n\nBorn and raised in San Diego by parents who emigrated from India, Vance is also the first person of color to be second lady.\n\n\u201cThat JD and I could meet at all \u2014 let alone, fall in love and marry \u2014 is a testament to this great country,\u201d she said in remarks to the Republican National Convention in July, saying that her husband \u201capproached our differences with curiosity and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nVance attended Yale University, where she majored in history and spent her time outside the classroom tutoring local students, volunteering with the homeless and studying ballet. She spent a year after graduation teaching in China, then earned a prestigious Gates Scholarship to Cambridge University to pursue a master\u2019s in philosophy.\n\nBut it was back at Yale where she met JD Vance, a fellow law school classmate.\n\nRepublican Senate candidate JD Vance, left, hugs his wife Usha Vance, as he prepares to speak to supporters during an election night watch party on May 3, 2022, in Cincinnati. Aaron Doster/AP\n\n\u201cWe were friends first, because \u2014 I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with JD? He was then, as now, the most interesting person I knew. A working-class guy who had overcome childhood traumas that I could barely fathom,\u201d she said during her RNC speech.\n\nAfter their 2013 graduation, the Vances married in June 2014, and JD Vance\u2019s bestselling memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d was published two years later.\n\nLike her husband, Usha Vance appears to have made her own political shift. According to public records, she was a registered Democrat from 2010 until 2014, but clerked for then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 2014 to 2015, and then for conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts from 2017 to 2018.\n\nPressed on her husband\u2019s previous comments disparaging Trump and asked how she felt about the GOP nominee during an August Fox News interview, Vance expressed muted support.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t feel that the ticket, the Trump-Vance ticket, was able to do some real good for the country, then I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she told host Ainsley Earhardt.\n\nIn the spotlight\n\nWhen her husband was selected as Trump\u2019s running mate, Vance resigned from her law firm, where she worked on complex civil litigation, and became a frequent presence at his side on the campaign trail. A noted bookworm, Vance was often observed with her latest read in hand, telling NBC News that she was reading the epic \u201cThe Iliad\u201d to keep up with her oldest son, who was \u201cobsessed with mythology.\u201d\n\nThe Vances\u2019 three small children, Ewan, 7, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3, have also often been along for the ride, including on their February trip to Europe.\n\n\u201cGiving them a stable, normal, happy life and upbringing is something that is the most important thing to us,\u201d Usha Vance told Earhardt during the campaign.\n\nVance has described her advisory role to her husband as the truth-teller.\n\n\u201cI just think he deserves to have someone in his life who hears it straight from him,\u201d she said in the Fox News interview, later adding, \u201cHe treats everything I say with a lot of seriousness and respect. And that becomes a part of the way that he thinks about things.\u201d\n\nUsha Vance speaks on the third day of the Republican National Convention on July 17, 2024, in Milwaukee. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nFor his part, JD Vance credits his wife with encouraging his authenticity.\n\n\u201cThe best advice she gave me when it came to politics is \u2018Don\u2019t let them filter you.\u2019 And in politics, you know, you got consultants, and you got media professionals, you\u2019ve got pollsters, you\u2019ve got a lot of people who try to tell you what to say or how to behave or you know what to do. And Usha just said, \u2018Just be yourself. Be authentic,\u2019\u201d he said during a recent appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nTaking her advice, the vice president joked, has its limits.\n\n\u201cOne piece of advice she gave me, like, a week ago, was \u2018You should be nicer on social media.\u2019 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll take that advice,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nAn \u2018unnatural, natural relationship\u2019\n\nUsha Vance has yet to unveil any key priorities, and speaking to NBC News days before the election, offered scant clues about her interests or goals for her work as second lady.\n\n\u201cThis is such an intense and busy experience that I have not given a ton of thought to my own roles and responsibilities. It\u2019s just something that I\u2019ve never really \u2014 it\u2019s not something I\u2019m terribly familiar with,\u201d Vance told NBC at the time.\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd so I thought, what would I do? See what happens on November 5, and collect some information myself and take it from there. There are certainly things I\u2019m interested in, but I don\u2019t really know how that all fits into this role.\u201d\n\nHer most recent predecessors have approached the amorphous role in different ways. As second lady, Jill Biden kept her job as a teacher, but found ways to support education and military families, launching the \u201cJoining Forces\u201d initiative alongside then-first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nKaren Pence took an active role amplifying an initiative on art therapy, and also continued to work, teaching elementary art at a nearby school.\n\nJD Vance, Vice President Kamala Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Usha Vance arrive for inauguration ceremonies at the White House on January 20, 2025. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff made history as the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president, finding his voice in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel as he sought to speak out against rising antisemitism. During the presidential transition, Emhoff and Vance \u2014 both of whom left legal careers to support their spouses as vice president \u2014 spoke by phone for about 45 minutes.\n\nVance will also have to navigate the \u201cunnatural, natural relationship\u201d between first and second ladies, according to Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist and author who has chronicled America\u2019s first families.\n\n\u201cPresidents and vice presidents and first and second ladies are going to naturally be put together as a foursome \u2014 but it\u2019s completely unnatural. The two spouses are different people with different backgrounds, and in some cases, don\u2019t like each other,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThat was the case for Karen Pence and Melania Trump, Bennett reported in her 2019 biography of the first lady, \u201cFree, Melania.\u201d\n\n\u201cKaren Pence and Melania Trump never really got off on the right foot and stayed that way,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThe difficult dynamic between the two was on display as they traveled together. Pence was not invited to sit in the first lady\u2019s cabin on her plane, seated instead with staff. And more recently, four years after Donald Trump\u2019s supporters called for Mike Pence to be hanged at the US Capitol, Karen Pence kept her head down as both Trumps arrived at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter, declining to exchange pleasantries.\n\nVance, Bennett said, \u201cis very different from Melania Trump in terms of background, career and stage of life. It\u2019s going to be interesting to watch how they work together.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Barry Williams/New York Daily New/TNS/Getty Images\n\nOn her first day as a candidate for mayor, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams signaled she\u2019s not necessarily going to play nice with the seven men already competing for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cThere are people that have truths that have yet to be told,\u201d she said, somewhat ominously, when I asked if she believed any of her rivals had issues that should disqualify them as candidates. \u201cI am not here to judge anyone, but I am here to make sure that all that sexual misconduct and all of that is not a thing that we carry into the future, but something that we will look upon the past not to repeat,\u201d she told me.\n\nThat was an unmistakable reference to the three candidates for mayor \u2014 ex-governor Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Eric Adams, and ex-comptroller Scott Stringer \u2014 who have been sued in civil court for sexual harassment or sexual assault in recent years. All three strenuously deny the allegations, and Cuomo and Stringer have countersued their accusers for defamation, leaving voters with a batch of incomplete court cases to sort through.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s rationale for running \u2014 she plans to campaign simply as Adrienne to avoid being confused with the mayor \u2014 is that the city is in dire straits.\n\n\u201cCity Hall has been shaken. We have a president in Washington right now that is just spewing chaos all over the nation. New York has a target on its back. I cannot sit back and do nothing about it,\u201d she told me.\n\nOn a policy level, she is promising a straightforward expansion of affordable housing stock, building on legislation she shepherded through the council that makes it easier to get projects zoned and financed. She also plans to approach public safety at the precinct level, building trust between cops and communities, and is committed to dramatically expanding services and facilities for homeless and mentally ill New Yorkers.\n\nPolitically, Adrienne\u2019s arrival is the surest sign yet that Eric Adams is losing the battle for Black voters, who supplied his base and margin of victory in 2021. Back then, Adams had the support of 43 percent of Black voters in the closing days of the Democratic primary \u2014 by far the strongest backing of any ethnic or racial group for any candidate that year. It helped that the other Black hopefuls in the crowded field that year \u2014 Maya Wiley, Ray McGuire, and Diane Morales \u2014 were first-time candidates struggling to build name recognition.\n\nFour years later, Eric Adams faces a much tougher situation. Two of his Black challengers, state senator Zellnor Myrie and Adrienne Adams \u2014 are experienced campaigners, and so is Cuomo, an ex-governor who has always been popular with Black voters. Other Black political leaders, embarrassed by Adams\u2019s legal problems and exhausted by the unprecedented level of resignations of top commissioners and City Hall aides, are actively seeking alternatives, despite pointed, dismissive references by Adams to Black critics as \u201cNegroes.\u201d (\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d he spat at his enemies at a recent Black History Month commemoration.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not just political leaders who are done with supporting Adams. The latest Quinnipiac University poll shows that 60 percent of Black voters disapprove of his performance, while 24 percent approve.\n\nThat high level of discontent is echoed by Myrie, who represents Adams\u2019s former district in Brooklyn and is now running against the mayor. \u201cThere is a particular sensitivity Black New Yorkers have watching Eric Adams be embarrassed on national television by Trump\u2019s border czar,\u201d Myrie told the New York Times, referring to a disastrous Fox News appearance in which Tom Holman, the Trump official leading the mass-deportation effrontery, openly threatened Adams that he would show up at City Hall and \u201cbe up his butt\u201d if the city did not cooperate on immigration matters. The interview, said Myrie, caused \u201cshame that the second Black mayor in our city\u2019s history can so obviously be played for a fool for the country to see, disappointment in his lack of integrity in this moment and pain knowing how far back this sets Black leadership.\u201d\n\nAnother crack in the dam came when former state comptroller H. Carl McCall, who in the 1990s became the first Black candidate ever elected statewide, publicly came out for Cuomo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard from Eric since I endorsed him almost four years ago. But he simply is not up to the job now,\u201d McCall told me. \u201cHe\u2019s in trouble, and he\u2019s trying to stay out of jail, and he\u2019s made this terrible agreement with the president. We don\u2019t even know what the agreement is, but we do know that the president is going to enforce the agreement.\u201d\n\nMcCall also dismissed the argument that his contentious 2002 primary fight against Cuomo contained racial overtones.\n\n\u201cAndrew might not make as many friends as we would like to see, but he gets things done,\u201d said McCall. \u201cI was in a position where I could dispel this idea that because Andrew Cuomo ran against me, that Black folks shouldn\u2019t support him. I wanted to take that silly race issue off the table. That should not be what we look at. We should look at what kind of leadership do we need now [and] who can provide that leadership.\u201d\n\nAnother ex-supporter of Adams, former Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr., has switched to Cuomo as well. Multiple Black members of the State Legislature, including state Senator Jamal Bailey and Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn, who double as Democratic chairs of the Bronx and Brooklyn, respectively, are said to be eyeing a switch to Cuomo.\n\nA key power broker, Representative Gregory Meeks, who doubles as chair of the Queens Democratic Party, is a longtime backer of Adrienne Adams who may swing the county organization behind her. (\u201cHe has always supported everything that I do,\u201d Adrienne told me.) Attorney General Letitia James, a powerful ally, is also helping to line up endorsements and donations.\n\nA successful run by Adrienne would make history twice over. She would become the city\u2019s first woman mayor and also break the pattern of every council speaker in the city\u2019s modern history running for higher office and falling short. Ex-speaker Peter Vallone ran unsuccessful races for governor and mayor, Gifford Miller and Christine Quinn, ran for mayor, Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito tried for public advocate and for congress, and Cory Johnson lost a bid for comptroller.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we are talking to those voters that may not necessarily know the work of the council, may not necessarily know who Adrienne Adams is,\u201d she said. \u201cOur campaign is Adrienne for the people because that is the philosophy that I live by. I am a wife, mother, grandmother, the first to be those things [as speaker]. And I expect to expand all of that when I win this race.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Beijing, China CNN \u2014\n\nAs US President Donald Trump ratcheted up economic pressure on China over the past week, Beijing sent back its own message: Its rise won\u2019t be interrupted.\n\nA major political meeting taking place in the capital was the ideal backdrop for Beijing to respond. The \u201ctwo sessions\u201d gathering of China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature and its top political advisory body is where the government reveals its plans and sets the tone for the year ahead.\n\nThe top item on its priority list? Boosting consumer demand to ensure China doesn\u2019t need to rely on exports to power its vast but slowing economy. And the next: driving forward leader Xi Jinping\u2019s bid to transform the country into a technological superpower, by ramping up investment and enlisting the private sector.\n\nBeijing is making these moves as it prepares for what could be a protracted economic showdown with the United States. Trump doubled additional tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% on Tuesday and has threatened more to come \u2013 as well as tighter controls on American investment in China.\n\n\u201cWe can prevail over any difficulty in pursuing development,\u201d China\u2019s No. 2 official Li Qiang told thousands of delegates seated in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People at the opening meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress Wednesday. The \u201cgiant ship of China\u2019s economy\u201d will \u201csail steadily toward the future,\u201d he said.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesperson was more direct when asked about trade frictions on Tuesday: \u201cIf the US insists on waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will fight till the end,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMembers of China's political advisory body, known as the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attend a meeting on March 4. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\nAnd while Beijing\u2019s priorities \u2013 and rhetoric \u2013 may echo those of years past, this time they are coming from a country that is starting to regain its swagger after being battered by its own Covid restrictions, a property sector crisis and by a tech war with the US.\n\n\u201cConfidence\u201d has been an unofficial buzzword of the weeklong event, which ends Tuesday. It was used nearly a dozen times during a press conference held by China\u2019s economic tsars on Thursday, splashed across state media coverage and included in a pointed reminder \u2013 that \u201cconfidence builds strength\u201d\u2013 during the closing lines of Li\u2019s nationally broadcast speech.\n\nThat optimism might be more aspiration than reality. Many in China are looking to the future with uncertainty. They\u2019re more willing to save than spend, while young people are struggling to find jobs and feeling unsure whether their lives will be better than those of their parents.\n\nBut unlike last year, the country is entering 2025 buoyed by the market-moving successes of Chinese firms and technology. And while Trump\u2019s return has Beijing concerned about economic risks, it\u2019s also eyeing opportunity for its own rise.\n\n\u201cBy the end of Trump\u2019s second term, America\u2019s global standing and credibility image will have gone down,\u201d People\u2019s Liberation Army Sen. Col. (ret) Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, told CNN. \u201cAnd as American strength declines, China, of course, will look more important.\u201d\n\nAn electric vehicle by Chinese manufacturer BYD is loaded on a ship in the southeastern Chinese port city of Guangzhou last month. Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConfidence boost\n\nThis mood isn\u2019t just percolating in the halls of power.\n\nOn the streets of the capital, gleaming homegrown electric vehicles weave through traffic, including those from carmaker BYD, which now goes toe-to-toe with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla for global sales \u2013 a reminder of China\u2019s successful push to become a leader in green tech.\n\nThen there\u2019s the box office record-smashing animation \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d and the breakout success of privately owned Chinese AI firm DeepSeek. Its large language model shocked Silicon Valley and upended Western assumptions about the costs associated with AI.\n\nIn Beijing this week, \u201cyou can ask DeepSeek\u201d has been a playful and proud punchline in casual conversation.\n\n\u201cLast year, people may have been impacted by the US narrative that China is declining, that China has peaked,\u201d said Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cWe still have many difficulties. We still have many problems, of course, but it\u2019s not that we\u2019ve reached peak China.\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s focus on economic rivalry with Beijing as he rolls out tariffs on US trade partners appears to some as a mark of how far China has come. On a recent weekday afternoon in downtown Beijing, some passersby interviewed by CNN pointed to competition with the US as a sign of their country\u2019s growing strength.\n\n\u201cChina is developing quickly now and that\u2019s attracted international attention, especially from the United States,\u201d but that may not be a bad thing, said a medical graduate student surnamed Xia. \u201cTrump\u2019s increase on tariffs is competition \u2026 (and) if there\u2019s no competition maybe China\u2019s independent development is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nSecurity personnel stand outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing as China's \"Two Sessions\" gets underway. Tingshu Wang/Reuters\n\nHigh stakes rivalry\n\nBut even as Chinese officials seek to project confidence, international observers say the economic stimulus measures announced this week show Beijing is girding itself for major challenges to come.\n\nPremier Li alluded to that in his opening address. \u201cThe external environment is becoming more complex and severe, which may have a greater impact on the country\u2019s trade, science and technology and other fields,\u201d he said.\n\nChina doesn\u2019t want to deal with that volatility while also grappling with a weak economy at home. That\u2019s one reason why it\u2019s trying to boost consumption and spur growth, setting an ambitious expansion target of \u201caround 5%\u201d this year. Beijing is also aware that trade frictions mean the economy needs to rely less on exports.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that Beijing has thought through the scenarios of Trade War 2.0, but whatever happens, it is clear that China\u2019s growth will have to rely more on domestic demand,\u201d said Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University Singapore and former World Bank country director for China, in a note.\n\nStill, some analysts say Beijing\u2019s initiatives are short on details and much less aggressive than needed to rev up the economy and boost consumer confidence.\n\n\u201cIt adds up to a sense by the leadership that they want to refocus on growth and development, but still a desire to do only as much as necessary in terms of stimulus to get there,\u201d said Michael Hirson, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Center for China Analysis.\n\nXi may also be balancing this goal with another concern: a need to save some firepower to support the economy if China faces \u201ca nasty four years dealing with Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nA humanoid robot entertains the crowd at a robotics exhibition in eastern China's Nanjing last month.

That\u2019s another key part of the government\u2019s 2025 agenda \u2013 and a long-term objective of Xi, who unlike US presidents is not subject to term limits on his leadership.\n\nBeijing is pushing for innovations in AI, robotics, 6G and quantum computing, announcing a state-backed fund to support tech innovation and even welcoming foreign enterprises \u2013 in a significant tone shift for Xi \u2013 to play a role.\n\nChina is still smarting from the first Trump administration\u2019s campaign to keep its tech champion Huawei out of global mobile networks and from the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to convince allies to join it in cutting Chinese access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nLast month, Washington said it was considering expanding restrictions on US investment in sensitive technologies in China.\n\nBut Beijing this week has also touted its confidence in advancing no matter the barriers.\n\n\u201cBe it space science or chip making, unjustified external suppression has never stopped,\u201d Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters Friday. \u201cBut where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing an ever-expanding horizon for China to become a science and technology powerhouse,\u201d he said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, pictured here in the White House's oval office, has made tariffs a cornerstone of his economic policy. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump threat?\n\nHow much Trump\u2019s policies will challenge China remains an open and urgent question for Beijing.\n\nThe US president has refrained so far from slapping Chinese imports with the blanket 60% or more tariffs that he had threatened on the campaign trail.\n\nHe\u2019s been focused elsewhere, including on unleashing sweeping changes to US global leadership by decimating US foreign assistance, threatening to take control of other countries\u2019 sovereign territory, and upending US alliances in Europe, while pulling closer to Russia at the expense of Ukraine.\n\nThere are potential risks for Beijing in that shake-up. For example, if a Washington-Moscow rapprochement pulls Xi away from Russian President Vladimir Putin, his closest ally, or if an American dial-down of security in Europe allows it to ramp up attention on Asia.\n\nBut Chinese diplomats have also been taking advantage of the changes to play up their country as a responsible and stable global leader, despite criticisms of Beijing\u2019s own aggressive behavior in Asia.\n\n\u201cA big country should honor its international obligations and fulfill its due responsibilities. It should not put selfish interests before principles, still less should it wield the power to bully the weak,\u201d Wang, the foreign minister, said on Friday in response to a question from CNN on Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy. China \u201cresolutely opposes power politics and hegemony,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen it comes to tariffs, observers say Beijing is trying to moderate its response, holding out for a potential meeting between Xi and Trump or perhaps even a deal that could avert an escalating trade war.\n\nA tanker carrying liquefied natural gas sails into a port eastern China's Shandong province last month. FeatureChina/AP\n\nWhile China immediately retaliated against two sets of US tariffs this year, including with levies on US energy and key agricultural goods, it has remained measured in its reprisals.\n\nThe country\u2019s deficit with the US means it will have less room to hit back if a trade war escalates, but Beijing is expected to be calculating other measures like export controls that it could use for leverage.\n\nAnd the view from some parts is that even if tariffs cause the Chinese economy short-term pain, it will be the US which loses in the long run. China is still an indispensable part of global supply chains. It\u2019s also better prepared to weather this trade war than the last one, because it\u2019s sending goods to more markets globally now, data show.\n\n\u201cIf you play (imposing tariffs) with a peer competitor, it actually would not work that well compared to if you\u2019re doing this with small countries or medium powers,\u201d said Zhou in Beijing, who is also the author of the forthcoming book \u201cShould the World Fear China?\u201d.\n\nChina, he said, wants cooperation not friction.\n\n\u201cBut since the US is still the stronger side in this relationship, (it will) decide which kind of relationship this is \u2026 so China has to say \u2018OK \u2013 if this has to be to be one of competition, then we must dare to fight,\u2019\u201d he said."

            "full_content": "Alberta, Canada, Premier Danielle Smith of the United Conservative Party told Breitbart News Saturday on Sirius XM that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set Canada back in negotiations with America during his first meeting with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSmith joined Breitbart News Washington bureau chief Matthew Boyle for a segment on the program where they discussed tariffs and the upcoming Canadian prime minister election.\n\nWhen Boyle asked Smith how she thinks Trudeau has handled negotiations with President Donald Trump, she suggested Canada \u201cgot into a ditch\u201d in the leaders\u2019 initial Mar-a-Lago meeting. Trudeau and Trump met at Trump\u2019s luxurious resort in Palm Beach, Florida, in November following the election.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, I think we got into a ditch with the very first meeting in Mar-a-Lago. I\u2019ve seen the president reference many times since then the exchange\u2013I think two blunders: One was the on the issue of NATO,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know the American president expects for all of the trade partners to reach their two percent NATO commitment, and Canada still hasn\u2019t committed to doing that until 2032, so I think that was one problem. And then, yes\u2026 he said that tariffs would result in Canada collapsing, and I think that was the wrong message to convey because it made us sound very, very weak.\u201d\n\nSmith added that Canada\u2019s dependence on trade with the United States is \u201cmutually beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, we are definitely dependent on U.S. trade\u2026 We certainly have more dependence on U.S. trade than in any other market, but it\u2019s mutually beneficial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wish that we\u2019d been able to convey earlier on just how much the Americans benefit from being able to buy cheap and discounted raw materials and intermediate products so they can do the value added to create American jobs and also keep prices lower for consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the partnership that we have. And Canada, in exchange, also becomes the principal buyer of American-produced products. We\u2019re your biggest customers,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I think that we started off on the wrong foot, and now we\u2019ve been trying to get that information out because we really should maintain this tariff-free relationship between our two countries. Our industries are so integrated, and it\u2019s good for both partners.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nTrump signed an executive order Thursday delaying until April 2 the 25-percent tariffs he is imposing on Canada and Mexico. Canadian energy products will face a smaller ten-percent additional tariff when they go into effect next month.\n\nWhen asked whether Trudeau was attempting to use the back and forth with Trump as a means to stay in power, considering he is on the brink of removal, Smith said, \u201cNo, Trudeau\u2019s gone tomorrow.\u201d\n\nShe said to expect \u201ca new prime minister within the next couple of days.\u201d The new prime minister will be tasked with setting an election for the next prime minister and will have \u201cthe latitude to go as long as October before they call an election if they can continue to get support in our legislature.\u201d\n\nShe said the Liberal Party\u2019s Chrystia Freeland or Mark Carney are the likeliest to succeed Trudeau, so one of them would set a date for an election for prime minister. The Liberal Party will hold a vote for their new leader on Sunday.\n\nSmith also contended that the tariff war is harming conservatives\u2019 chances in the upcoming election that will be set by Trudeau\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cAre the Canadian people ready to go back the other way here and go away from the liberal side that we\u2019ve seen under Trudeau and whoever replaces him?\u201d Boyle asked Smith.\n\nHe noted in his question that a conservative prime minister would likely have a better working relationship with Trump than a liberal prime minister.\n\n\u201cBefore the tariff war, I would say yes. I mean, Pierre Poilievre is the name of the Conservative Party leader, and he was miles ahead of Justin Trudeau. But because of what we see as unjust and unfair tariffs, it\u2019s actually caused an increase in the support for the liberals,\u201d Smith responded. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s what I fear, is that the longer this dispute goes on, politicians posture, and it seems to be benefiting the Liberals right now. So I would hope that we could put things on pause is what I\u2019ve told administration officials. Let\u2019s just put things on pause so we can get through an election.\u201d\n\nShe told Boyle that Poilievre, as prime minister, would open the door to a number of opportunities between Canada and the United States.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have the best person at the table make the argument\u2026 and I think that\u2019s Pierre Poilievre, and I do agree with you that\u2026 if we do have Pierre as our prime minister, then I think that there\u2019s a number of things that we could do together,\u201d Smith detailed. \u201cPierre believes in development. He believes in low-cost energy. He believes that we need to have low taxes, doesn\u2019t believe in any of the woke stuff that we\u2019ve seen taking over our politics for the last five years.\n\n\u201cSo I would think that there\u2019d be, there\u2019s probably still always going to be areas that are skirmishes or disputes about particular industries when it comes to the border, but I would say, on balance, the perspective that Pierre would bring would be very much in sync with, I think\u2026the new direction in America,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019d have a really great relationship for the period of time they\u2019re both in.\u201d"
