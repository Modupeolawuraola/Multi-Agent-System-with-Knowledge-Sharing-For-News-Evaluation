            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court appeared sympathetic Wednesday to a series of programs geared toward expanding high-speed internet in rural and poor communities, despite a challenge from a conservative group claiming funding for that effort violates separation of powers principles.\n\nAfter nearly three hours of argument, several of the court\u2019s conservatives \u2013 along with all of its liberals \u2013 raised concerns about a ruling that could upend the way other federal agencies function, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIf the court upholds the structure of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s funding for the programs, it would represent a departure from its trend in recent years of significantly limiting the power of agencies to act without explicit approval from Congress.\n\n\u201cThese are the services that all the rest of us take for granted that you can\u2019t take for granted in rural North Dakota,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, said in summarizing her reading of the law. \u201cAnd what this program says is that rural North Dakota citizens should also get what all the rest of us have long had.\u201d\n\nCongress created the Universal Service Fund in 1996 to pay for efforts to expand broadband and phone service in rural and low-income urban parts of the country. Telecommunications companies contribute billions to that fund \u2013 a cost that is passed on to consumers \u2013 to pay for programs like E-Rate, which lowers the cost of high-speed internet for libraries and schools.\n\n\u2018We have a tax that\u2019s unlike any other tax this court has approved\u2019\n\nA conservative \u201cconsumer awareness group\u201d challenged that fund as an unconstitutional \u201cdelegation\u201d of the power of Congress to levy taxes. What\u2019s worse, the group argues, a private entity calculates the amount of money that must be contributed. The Supreme Court has not invoked the nondelegation doctrine \u2013 or the idea that Congress cannot delegate its authority \u2013 since the 1930s. It has, for decades, permitted delegations under certain conditions.\n\nConservative groups have argued the federal agencies have perverted separation-of-powers principles, allowing government agencies to take the lead on difficult choices they say should be left to lawmakers. In this case, they said, it has also allowed Congress to escape paying a political price for taxes.\n\nSeveral of the court\u2019s conservatives, including Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, pressed hard on the idea that there was little accountability for the way the government has structured the program.\n\n\u201cThis just a straight up tax without any numerical limit, any cap,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cWe have a tax that\u2019s unlike any other tax this court has approved.\u201d\n\nBut other conservatives, including Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 both key votes \u2013 seemed skeptical that putting a cap on how much the fund could raise would solve the problems critics have raised.\n\n\u201cYour position would say that a solution to the problem \u2026 could be a trillion-dollar cap,\u201d Kavanaugh said.\n\nThat number, he said, \u201ccould be very high. And then the question is: What exactly are we accomplishing?\u201d\n\nThe law allows the FCC to raise a \u201csufficient\u201d amount of money to accomplish the broad goal of universal access to telecommunications.\n\n\u201cWe would be saying, I think, if we agree with you, \u2018sufficient\u2019 is not good enough but a \u2018trillion dollar\u2019 is, and I think a lot of people would say, \u2018that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u201d Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe unusual politics of the case created a striking dynamic during the arguments Wednesday in which the court\u2019s liberal wing appeared to be siding with the attorney representing the Trump administration, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris.\n\n\u201cThe easiest parts of an argument are where you just have to say \u2018yes\u2019 to everything,\u201d Kagan quipped with Harris after she delivered a series of affirmative answers to Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nHarris faced much tougher questioning from the most stalwart conservative justices.\n\nThe Biden administration appealed a ruling from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down the funding mechanism. Under Trump, the Justice Department continued the case, warning the court in a brief that \u201cCongress has relied on this court\u2019s longstanding\u201d approach to the issue to enact legislation authorizing agencies to police unfair competition, oversee the securities industry and ensure the safety of food and drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority has in recent years hacked away at the power of federal agencies to act on their own, most recently in a 6-3 decision last year that overturned a 1984 precedent requiring courts to give deference to agency regulations in many circumstances. Federal agency power expanded dramatically after the New Deal, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, and courts had veered too far from exercising independent judgment about whether an agency had violated the law.\n\nThat decision came on the heels of a blockbuster ruling in 2022 that embraced the so-called major questions doctrine, which bars an agency from issuing a rule with major economic or political impacts absent explicit approval from Congress.\n\nA decision is expected in June."

            "full_content": "The following is a joint investigation by the Breitbart News Foundation (BNF) and the Government Accountability Institute (GAI).\n\nFrom a single brick building on North Eustis Street, a web of pro-Beijing nonprofits and businesses collaborate with the Overseas Chinese Service Center of Minnesota (Minnesota OCSC), which works directly with China\u2019s United Front Work Department. The Breitbart News Foundation\u2019s joint investigation with the Government Accountability Institute blew the lid off of this network in Part I of this series.\n\nIn Part II of this investigation, we reveal that a still-active University of Minnesota email account of former professor Dr. Bingwen Yan is listed on official Chinese Communist Party (CCP) websites as the contact for the Overseas Chinese Service Center of Minnesota. Yan is no longer a professor at the University of Minnesota, but any communications that have been taking place on that email address in the roughly ten tears since he was could prove useful to any investigation of whether the CCP is operating another \u201cpolice station\u201d in Minnesota.\n\nAs recently as last year, the FBI busted a united front operation in Manhattan, describing it as a \u201csecret, illegal police station.\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has introduced the Expel Illegal Chinese Police Act, which would, among other things, revoke the visas of Chinese government and CCP personnel operating police stations and other illicit outfits in the United States. Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA) has introduced a companion bill in the House, which would, among other things, impose sanctions, asset freezes, and visa restrictions on the individuals and entities operating the Chinese police stations. Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI), who is chairman of the House Select Committee on the CCP, is one of the sponsors of Hinson\u2019s bill.\n\nDr. Bingwen Yan is the \u201cperson in charge\u201d of the Minnesota OCSC, and he has entrenched himself in Minnesota politics, donating to figures like Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and holding events where he has been prominently photographed with politicians. The former University of Minnesota professor is a scientist with multiple patents and is the founder of the Alliance of Minnesota Chinese Organizations (AMCO). During a 2017 ceremony, Yan officially became a CCP-appointed Consular Protection Liaison Officer, which deputized him to provide \u201csecurity services\u201d locally. Then in 2018, he attended a Ministry of Public Security training on \u201ccross-border remote justice services,\u201d linking him to CCP overseas operations.\n\nYang Shaowen, China\u2019s Deputy Director of the International Cooperation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, told Xinhua reporters that persons with the title of Police Liaison Officer have a dual identity as both diplomats and police officers. \u201cPolice Liaison Officer\u201d is a title that is often used by the CCP interchangeably with the \u201cConsular Protection Liaison Officer\u201d title that was conferred upon Yan, and at times it appears to be synonymous with \u201cpolice chief.\u201d\n\nThe official email address listed on official Chinese government websites as the point of contact for the Minnesota OCSC is none other than Dr. Bingwen Yan\u2019s University of Minnesota email address created more than a decade ago when he was a professor there: yanxx030@umn.edu.\n\nSee an archive of a website listing Yan\u2019s University of Minnesota email address here and screen grabs from it below:\n\nThis begs the obvious question: Has a U.S. taxpayer-funded public university email address been used to conduct CCP activity in the United States?\n\nThis is not the first time the University of Minnesota and China\u2019s United Front have been connected. A Chinese spy arrested in Taiwan in 1980 said she had been recruited into the CCP\u2019s United Front in 1977 while studying for a master\u2019s degree in microphotography at the University of Minnesota. And two of the engines of United Front work\u2014the Confucius Institutes and the widely-banned Chinese company Huawei\u2014had strong partnerships with the University of Minnesota for years until the university abruptly ended both programs in 2019 after federal criticism. The University of Minnesota also has an extensive partnership with Sun Yat-sen University, which is linked to Beijing\u2019s nuclear weapons program. The Washington Free Beacon reported that Sun Yat-sen has funneled over $3 Million to the University of Minnesota. Despite being flagged by U.S. authorities, the partnership continues.\n\nYet another \u201cred\u201d flag is that a Chinese company called Huitian (Beijing) International Logistics Co., Ltd registered its U.S. branch (HTL International Corporation) at the same official address as the Minnesota Overseas Chinese Service Center: \u201c1399 N Eustis St.\u201d\n\nHTL\u2019s website describes itself as one of the only comprehensive transport and logistics companies that is PRC-certified to ship Class 1 dangerous goods, such as explosives. It\u2019s also one of only two Chinese entities that has authority to conduct their own quality checks on import/exports of commodities passing through Chinese customs. Many of HTL\u2019s \u201cStrategic Partners\u201d are state-owned entities that have been banned in the U.S. for working with China\u2019s military. Three of these companies\u2014China Three Gorges Corp, Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and the AVIC Group\u2014are still currently listed as investment assets of the Minnesota State Board of Investment, the state agency that manages retirement funds.\n\nA 2023 report released by the U.S. Secretary of Defense describes how China\u2019s military has been actively integrating with Chinese transport companies by embedding military personnel within \u201ccivilian transportation companies (air, road, and sea) to plan and manage military transportation.\u201d\n\nSerious questions remain about the Minnesota OCSC\u2019s connections in Minnesota. Some of those answers may lie in the email traffic on a domain belonging to a public university in America\u2019s heartland.\n\nIn December 2024, the FBI announced that a Chinese-American in Brooklyn pled guilty in court for \u201chis role in audaciously establishing an undeclared police station in the heart of New York City [at the direction of MPS] and attempting to conceal the effort when approached by FBI New York.\u201d\n\nThere is arguably more smoke in Minnesota than there was in New York City when the FBI\u2019s investigation of that \u201cpolice station\u201d was started.\n\nSeamus Bruner is the Vice President and Executive Director, Research and Jedd McFatter is a Senior Research Fellow at Peter Schweizer\u2019s Government Accountability Institute.

Plus, Andrea Mitchell explains how the episode underscores a stark departure from previous administrations on national security and intelligence matters.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nWashington grapples with growing group chat fallout\n\nThe fallout from a group chat in which Trump administration officials discussed sensitive military plans that inadvertently included a journalist continued to dominate Washington on Wednesday.\n\nHere\u2019s our team\u2019s latest reporting:\n\nChat transcript released: The Atlantic published a full transcript of the messages, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth specified types of U.S. military aircraft and the timing of recent airstrikes against Houthi militias in Yemen. The texts did not include information about specific targets.\n\nTrump officials react: National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard said the leaked group text chat was a mistake but reiterated her claim that no classified information was shared on the chain as she testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe both claimed no classified material was shared in the chat.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt forcefully pushed back against The Atlantic\u2019s latest report at a briefing.\n\n\u201cWe have said all along that no classified material was sent on this messaging thread,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were no locations, no sources or methods revealed, and there were certainly no war plans discussed.\u201d\n\nFormer officials react: Information about an upcoming U.S. military attack on an adversary is typically considered classified, according to at least four former national security and intelligence officials who handled legal matters.\n\nThe former officials did not know anything specific about the status of the information in the Signal chat, but they said it would be difficult to imagine a scenario in which details of military operations would not be treated as secret and damaging if they were disclosed.\n\nLawmakers react: The incident has provoked intense criticism from Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have called for the resignations of Hegseth and Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz.\n\nSens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, respectively, said they would request an \u201cexpedited\u201d inspector general\u2019s report into the matter. Wicker also said he would ask for a classified briefing from the administration for committee members.\n\nAsked directly whether he believes the information discussed in the chat is \u2014 or should be \u2014 classified, Wicker replied: \u201cThe information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\u201d\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a retired Air Force general, has rebutted the administration\u2019s assertion that the text chain did not include \u201cclassified\u201d material or any \u201cwar plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House is in denial that this was not classified or sensitive data,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cThey should just own up to it and preserve credibility.\u201d\n\nExplainer: Signal isn\u2019t infallible, despite being one of the most secure encrypted chat apps, by Kevin Collier\n\nSignal chat highlights a sharp departure from the norm in U.S. national security\n\nAnalysis by Andrea Mitchell\n\nThere is nothing normal about it. For most national security experts outside the Trump orbit, the full text messages The Atlantic published only reinforce their outrage about discussing the Houthi operation on Signal, a commercially available app the Pentagon recently warned is being actively targeted by \u201cRussia-aligned threat groups.\u201d\n\nWidespread anger and incredulity about all this were amplified by the distinctions Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the top intelligence officials are making between \u201cwar\u201d plans and \u201cattack\u201d plans.\u201d That also extended to National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s testimony that the information in the texts was not classified.\n\nBut the Trump team\u2019s treatment of intelligence in this instance raises broader questions. Why were these conversations taking place by text instead of in the Situation Room \u2014 which is equipped to securely bring in members of the team not on site? Or in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (or SCIFs) the government sets up for national security Cabinet members in their homes? Wouldn\u2019t that create a better environment for deeper discussions about such an important military operation \u2014 the new administration\u2019s largest to date to try to protect international shipping in a critical seaway from Houthi terrorists?\n\nWhere was the discussion about possible Iranian reaction or how to notify the Israelis? Whether to engage the Europeans? Perhaps if they had been face to face, rather than texting, there would have been less posturing, such as Vice President JD Vance\u2019s criticism on the text chain that the Europeans \u2014 whom he also slammed in a speech last month in Munich \u2014 should do their part to protect international trade from Houthi attacks. Hegseth chimed in, writing, \u201cVP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It\u2019s PATHETIC.\u201d The message has fueled growing anger among European leaders at the administration.\n\nWhat is also striking is the team\u2019s virtual high-fiving via emojis \u2014 a fist bump, a flame, a flexed bicep. Meanwhile, when Gabbard was asked at a congressional hearing Wednesday about her repost on her personal X account of a Russia state media contributor, she said, \u201cI maintain my First Amendment rights to be able to express my own personal views on different issues.\u201d\n\nIt all underscores how this is a significant departure from the way previous administrations from both parties have handled national security and intelligence issues.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump said he was imposing a 25% tariff on all automobiles coming into the United States.\n\nA federal appeals court denied the administration\u2019s bid to lift a judge\u2019s order banning it from using Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people alleged to be Venezuelan gang members.\n\nTrump signed a sweeping executive order attempting a major overhaul of American elections, requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote.\n\nFederal employees across several government agencies filed a class action complaint against the Trump administration, claiming it unlawfully fired employees for DEI activities.\n\nIn remarks at a Women\u2019s History Month event at the White House, Trump said he would be known as the \u201cfertilization president.\u201d\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2696\ufe0f In the courts: The Supreme Court upheld a Biden administration effort to regulate \u201cghost gun\u201d kits that allow people to easily obtain parts needed to assemble firearms from online sellers.

That turned out to be national security adviser Michael Waltz, a top adviser to the president.\n\n\"Two days later\u2014Thursday\u2014at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group,\" Goldberg wrote. \"It was called the 'Houthi PC small group.'\"\n\nWaltz launched the group's conversation, saying, according to The Atlantic: \"Team \u2013 establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours.\"\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz speaks with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 11, 2025. Saul Loeb / AP\n\nAs national security adviser, Waltz is a presidential appointee and does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nPresident Trump told NBC he still has confidence in Waltz, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"\n\nWaltz said he took \"full responsibility\" and that he \"built\" the Signal chat group, but he also said he did not have Goldberg's contact information and he didn't know how Goldberg got into the chat. Goldberg said he received a Signal request from a user identified as \"Michael Waltz.\" And soon after, a screenshot Goldberg provided said, \"Michael Waltz added you to the group.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic. Neither the White House nor Hegseth has disputed the authenticity of Hegseth's communication, but they have insisted it doesn't constitute \"war plans.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to give a television interview outside the White House on March 21, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein / AP\n\nAs the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance\n\nVice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"\n\nSince The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance speaks at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico during a tour March 26, 2025, in Quantico, Va. Rod Lamkey / AP\n\nAs vice president, Vance is not only second in line to the presidency, but a key adviser on virtually all matters of domestic and foreign policy to the president.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"\n\nJohn Ratcliffe appears for his Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 15, 2025. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nIn his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"\n\n\"TG\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard\n\nA user called \"TG\" in the Signal chat appears to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, The Atlantic reported. In congressional testimony this week, Gabbard did not deny that she was in the message chain, but she said she was \"not directly involved\" in the part of the chat that discussed attack plans.\n\nAs the director of national intelligence, Gabbard is a Cabinet-level head of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks during a Senate Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 25, 2025, Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nGabbard testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, where she said Signal came pre-installed on government devices.\n\nSpecial envoy Steve Witkoff\n\nThe name Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, also appears in the chat.\n\nWitkoff was in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin during part of the period leading up to the attack.\n\nSources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Witkoff didn't have his personal device or government phone with him in Moscow, and that he was given access to a \"classified protected server\" by the U.S. government and was \"very careful\" about his communications while in Russia.\n\nIn his own social media post Wednesday, Witkoff said he had \"no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"\n\nWitkoff had little communication in the chat.\n\nScott B.\n\nScott B. appears to be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to The Atlantic. The Scott B. account designated someone from the Treasury Department to be his point of contact for matters related to the strike. The Treasury Department oversees things like sanctions.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles\n\nThe name of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles is a contact in the Signal group, although the screenshots The Atlantic published don't include contributions from Wiles' name.\n\nAs the White House chief of staff, Wiles is responsible for managing the president's senior staff as well as overseeing the execution of his agenda.\n\n\"MAR\" \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio\n\nThe name \"MAR\" appears twice in the contacts list. The Atlantic points out the secretary of state's full name is Marco Antonio Rubio, and \"MAR\" chimed in on behalf of the State Department.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio confirmed his presence in the chat, saying he only contributed twice.\n\n\"I can speak to myself for my presence on it \u2014 I think my role on it was just speaking for my role,\" Rubio said. \"I contributed to it twice. I identified my point of contact, which is my chief of staff. And then later on, I think three hours after the White House's official announcements have been made, I congratulated the members of the team.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio at a news conference in Jamaica on March 26, 2025. Nathan Howard / AP\n\nIn the chain, \"MAR\" designates Mike Needham, Rubio's counselor and chief of staff, to be the State Department's point of contact. Needham's account does not converse in the chat.\n\nDeputy national security adviser Alex Wong\n\nAlex Wong is Waltz' deputy. In his initial messages, Waltz said Wong was \"pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency chief of staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning.\"\n\nJoe Kent\n\nMr. Trump tapped former Green Beret Joe Kent to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, and Kent's name appears in the Signal chat. In the chat, Gabbard designated Kent to be the point of contact for her Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nOthers\n\nOthers included in the Signal chat are identified as Brian, who referred to himself in the chat as \"Brian McCormack for NSC,\" Walker Barrett, Jacob and \"SM,\" who Goldberg reported he believed to be Trump adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Mike Needham's account conversed in the Signal chat, but that account did not. The report has been updated."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA divided federal appeals court has maintained a temporary block on President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to use the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n\nThe DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled 2-1 on Wednesday that a pair of lower-court orders blocking Trump\u2019s use of the sweeping wartime authority can stand while a legal challenge to the president\u2019s invocation of the law plays out.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg\u2019s orders blocking use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations has been at the center of an escalating political and legal controversy since they were issued on the evening of March 15. Two flights of people being deported under the act took off during an emergency hearing and did not turn around, leading to ongoing questions of whether Boasberg\u2019s court order was intentionally ignored.\n\nSince then, the Justice Department and Boasberg have gone back and forth over DOJ\u2019s refusal to provide more information about the flights, and Trump suggested Boasberg should be impeached. That led to a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives the president tremendous authority to target and remove undocumented immigrants, to speed up the deportations of migrants the government has accused of being members of the gang, Tren de Aragua. The law is designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so.\n\nWednesday\u2019s appeals court ruling was unsigned. But Judges Patricia Millett, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Karen Henderson, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, wrote lengthy opinions explaining why they agreed with the court\u2019s decision.\n\nHenderson leaned into the argument that allowing Trump to use the law \u2013 even as the case proceeded \u2013 \u201crisks exiling plaintiffs to a land that is not their country of origin\u201d where they could face torture in notorious prisons.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Photographer with exclusive access to El Salvador prison explains what he witnessed 03:38 - Source: CNN Photographer with exclusive access to El Salvador prison explains what he witnessed 03:38\n\n\u201cIndeed, at oral argument before this Court, the government in no uncertain terms conveyed that \u2013 were the injunction lifted \u2013 it would immediately begin deporting plaintiffs without notice,\u201d Henderson wrote. \u201cPlaintiffs allege that the government has renditioned innocent foreign nationals in its pursuit against TdA. For example, one plaintiff alleges that he suffered brutal torture with \u2018electric shocks and suffocation\u2019 for demonstrating against the Venezuelan regime.\u201d\n\nJudge Justin Walker, who was named to the bench by Trump during his first term, dissented, focusing on a technical issue he raised during the oral arguments in the case. Walker said the claims filed by those deported needed to go to a court in Texas rather than in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Trump administration, he said, had shown \u201cthat the district court\u2019s orders threaten irreparable harm to delicate negotiations with foreign powers on matters concerning national security.\u201d\n\nAnd that harm, Walker said, \u201cplus the asserted public interest in swiftly removing dangerous aliens,\u201d outweighs the plaintiffs\u2019 desire to file the suit in Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed Boasberg\u2019s orders during a very early stage of the litigation, and it\u2019s likely that the case will arrive back at the DC Circuit in coming weeks after the judge issues a more thorough decision on the merits of Trump\u2019s use of the wartime law for these deportations.\n\nMillett seemed especially focused on the case\u2019s posture as she explained why she wanted to keep the orders at issue intact.\n\n\u201cThe district court has been handling this matter with great expedition and circumspection, and its orders do nothing more than freeze the status quo until weighty and unprecedented legal issues can be addressed through a soon-forthcoming preliminary injunction proceeding,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSiding with the administration at this juncture, Millett said, would \u201cmoot the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims by immediately removing them beyond the reach of their lawyers or the court.\u201d\n\nMillett was also critical of the Trump administration\u2019s argument that it did not violate Boasberg\u2019s order from the bench earlier this month to immediately turn around any planes carrying migrants being deported under the Alien Enemies Act. DOJ attorneys have told Boasberg that his oral command \u201cdid not amount to a binding injunction\u201d and that a written order he issued shortly after the proceedings is the controlling ruling in the matter.\n\nThat written order contained no such language about the planes and instead just said the administration was enjoined from removing the migrants subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation invoking the law while the judge\u2019s temporary restraining orders remained in effect.\n\n\u201cI leave the merits of that argument for the district court to resolve in the first instance,\u201d Millett wrote. \u201cBut the one thing that is not tolerable is for the government to seek from this court a stay of an order that the government at the very same time is telling the district court is not an order with which compliance was ever required.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeads the government wins, tails the district court loses is no way to obtain the exceptional relief of a TRO stay,\u201d she added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s John Fritze contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "The very patriotic Lauren Boebert. Photo: Angelina Katsanis/POLITICO/AP Photo\n\nJust when you thought jingoistic gestures couldn\u2019t get much dumber than Trump\u2019s designs on Canada and Greenland, Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert outdid her idol by suggesting that plans are underway to rename the District of Columbia \u201cthe District of America.\u201d\n\nBoebert was annoyed at Democrats for mocking Trump\u2019s determination to rename the international body of water known as the \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d for 400 years as the Gulf of America, as the Hill reported:\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) urged lawmakers to stop making fun of President Trump\u2019s decision to rename the Gulf of America, suggesting the nation\u2019s capital could undergo the same change.\n\n\u201cI would caution my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to refrain from making jokes about the Gulf of America because next up may be the District of America that we are working on,\u201d Boebert said during a Tuesday hearing for the House Natural Resources Committee.\n\nPerhaps this was an idle threat. But then again, MAGA interest in remaking the nation\u2019s capital is well established, as Trump himself noted during his recent address to Department of Justice employees:\n\nWe\u2019re cleaning up this great capital, and we\u2019re not going to have crime and we\u2019re not going to stand for crime, and we\u2019re going to take the graffiti down and we\u2019re already taken to tents down there. \u2026 We\u2019re working with the administration, and if the administration can\u2019t do the job \u2026 we\u2019re gonna have to take it back and run it through the federal government.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, exactly what problem Boebert and other Trump loyalists might have with the old name of the capital, first established as the \u201cTerritory of Columbia\u201d by George Washington\u2019s own handpicked commissioners. \u201cColumbia\u201d had already become a female symbol of the country, a predecessor to \u201cLady Liberty\u201d and a ubiquitous presence in the patriotic literature of the 19th century.\n\nIllustration: Frances Adams Halsted and V. Aderente/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe Columbia name was derived, of course, from Christopher Columbus, thought at the time to be the discoverer of America. Perhaps Boebert has \u201cwoke\u201d concerns about Columbus\u2019s murderous treatment of the Indigenous Americans he encountered? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nIt is interesting, however, that Boebert\u2019s big idea was articulated at a hearing over legislation sponsored by her frenemy Marjorie Taylor Greene to codify in law Trump\u2019s Gulf of America executive order (originally introduced even before the 47th president took office). Greene once famously referred to her former friend and ideological colleague Boebert as \u201ca little bitch\u201d for horning in on her legislative plans. So perhaps the Coloradan is returning the favor by one-upping her on renaming places. Come to think of it, \u201cColorado\u201d sounds as foreign as \u201cMexico.\u201d Maybe Trumpiana or Magarado would work better? Don\u2019t laugh \u2026"

After all, the claim that Democrats have systematically rigged elections is one of the great foundational myths of the MAGA movement, speciously refuting any electoral setback Trump or his minions might experience and providing a sinister rationale for the supposed \u201copen borders\u201d policies of the Biden administration (you know, the really stupid but persistent belief that migrants were being herded across the border by Democrats and then immediately registered to vote).\n\nAs it happens, Trump\u2019s 96th executive order of 2025 finally addressed the bugaboo of phantom election fraud and arrogated to the president powers held jointly by the states (which operate federal elections) and by Congress (which has explicit constitutional powers to regulate federal elections). Congress has in turn delegated some of its regulatory functions to an independent bipartisan agency it created after the 2000 presidential-election fiasco, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which helps states purchase election technology and also provides a form that can be used anywhere in the country to register for federal elections. The president\u2019s powers in this area have traditionally been understood as strictly limited to enforcing congressional voting-rights statutes and basic constitutional rights that touch on the right to vote.\n\nNone of this precedent deterred Trump. He\u2019s ordering the EAC to begin pushing for (and reflecting in its own voter-registration system) documentary verification of citizenship, and he\u2019s enlisting federal agencies (including, rather ominously, DOGE) in policing voter rolls to expose and prohibit alleged noncitizen voting. In effect, this is an imposition by executive action of the SAVE Act that Trump and congressional Republicans pushed last year to dramatize their entirely undocumented contention that noncitizen voting was widespread. But while the evil it purports to address appears to be imaginary (or so limited as to be insignificant in the outcome of actual elections), and the requirement redundant (noncitizen voting is already illegal), the evil it would impose via burdensome paperwork requirements that will keep a lot of older and poorer citizens from exercising their right to vote is very real, as the Center for American Progress explained:\n\n[T]he legislation would require the vast majority of Americans to rely on a passport or birth certificate to prove their citizenship. While this may sound easy for many Americans, the reality is that more than 140 million American citizens do not possess a passport and as many as 69 million women who have taken their spouse\u2019s name do not have a birth certificate matching their legal name.\n\nBecause documentation would need to be presented in person, the legislation would, in practice, prevent Americans from being able to register to vote by mail; end voter registration drives nationwide; and eliminate online voter registration overnight \u2014 a service 42 states rely on. Americans would need to appear in person, with original documentation, to even simply update their voter registration information for a change of address or change in party affiliation.\n\nAs election-law expert Rick Hasen wrote after reviewing the Trump EO: \u201cThe aim here is voter suppression pure and simple.\u201d\n\nBut the order goes further, instructing the Department of Justice to enforce a congressionally established national Election Day by interfering with state mail-ballot systems. 18 states currently allow mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted subsequently (usually by a fixed deadline shortly after Election Day). Trump and other Republicans have regularly claimed without any evidence that post-election receipt of ballots filled out, sealed and mailed by Election Day is inherently fraudulent. Trump\u2019s order itself says: \u201cThis is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd.\u201d It\u2019s not like that at all, since under the systems he is attacking, the voter relinquishes control of the ballot the moment he puts it in the mail or places it in a drop-box. It\u2019s absolutely no different than voting in person before or on Election Day.\n\nTrump\u2019s motive for going after this aspect of state election administration is unclear. It could stem from research evidence that the last-cast mail ballots tend to skew Democratic (the so-called \u201cblue shift\u201d phenomenon). Or it could represent a first step toward Trump\u2019s often-stated intention to return the country to a system of in-person voting on Election Day, period.\n\nAs with so many other executive orders expanding presidential powers into previously unimagined areas of governance, this one will be subjected to judicial scrutiny. But it represents a potentially alarming signal that the administration\u2019s smash-and-grab tactics of doing as much damage as possible before the inevitable voter backlash will eventually give way to measures designed to reduce the odds that voters will have the power to stop it all."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.\n\nEarlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.\n\nWicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, left, and Sen. Jack Reed at a hearing on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, left, and Sen. Jack Reed at a hearing on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nWicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.\n\nSeparately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ordered the administration officials who were part of the Signal chat to preserve all messages exchanged on the platform from March 11 to March 15 \u2014 the time frame during which the app was used to discuss the strikes in Yemen.\n\nThe order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg represented agreement between the Justice Department and American Oversight, a watchdog group that had sued and claimed officials failed to follow federal recordkeeping laws. Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a declaration from a top lawyer at the Treasury Department who said the messages had been preserved.\n\n\"We're committed to preserving what the agencies have,\" Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer, told Boasberg.\n\nShe said the department is working with the agencies to determine the records they have and ensure they are maintained as required by law.\n\nThe judge, who has faced attacks by the president over his decision in a separate case, told the parties that the government is \"moving toward implementing what the plaintiffs seek.\"\n\n\"What I see here is a real chance to reach common ground on a number of the issues raised,\" Boasberg said.\n\nThe Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.\n\nWicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.\n\n\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.\n\nThe Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"\n\n\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"\n\nand contributed to this report."

It seems the national security adviser\u2019s goal was to declare that he was taking responsibility for the debacle, while actually shifting the blame to the editor of The Atlantic and (even more nonsensically) Democrats and the Biden administration. Instead, Waltz basically delivered a live reenactment of the \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to find the guy who did this\u201d meme, minus the hot-dog costume.\n\nWaltz kicked off the interview by announcing he\u2019s \u201cnot a conspiracy theorist\u201d and immediately floating a vague conspiracy theory about how Goldberg wound up in the chat.\n\n\u201cOf all the people out there, somehow this guy who has lied about the president, who has lied to Gold Star families, lied to their attorneys and gone to Russia hoax, gone to all kinds of lengths to lie and smear the president of the United States, and he\u2019s the one that somehow gets on somebody\u2019s contact and then gets sucked into your group?\u201d Waltz said.\n\nLaura Ingraham: \"How did a Trump-hating editor of The Atlantic end up on your Signal chat?\"\n\n\n\nMike Waltz: \"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but of all the people out there, somehow this guy...he's the one that somehow gets on somebody's contact and then gets sucked into the group? pic.twitter.com/TP6HXTWPtQ \u2014 The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) March 25, 2025\n\nSo, Ingraham asked, was Waltz suggesting someone on his team added Goldberg?\n\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, yes. We\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it. We have \u2014 I just talked to Elon on the way here. We\u2019ve got the best technical minds looking at how this happened.\u201d\n\nA moment later, Elon Musk\u2019s crack team of investigators got a huge lead when Waltz conceded that he\u2019s the guy who added the journalist to the chat.\n\n\u201cLook, a staffer wasn\u2019t responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cI take full responsibility. I built the group and my job is to make sure everything is coordinated.\u201d\n\nSo Waltz was communicating with Goldberg and accidentally added him to the group text, just as we all suspected? If only it were that simple!\n\n\u201cI can tell you for 100 percent, I don\u2019t know this guy,\u201d Waltz said. \u201cI know him by his horrible reputation, and he really is the bottom scum of journalists, and I know him in the sense that he hates the president. But I don\u2019t text him, he wasn\u2019t on my phone, and we\u2019re going to figure out how this happened.\u201d\n\nMike Waltz on the Signal chat leak:\n\n\n\n\u201cI just talked to @elonmusk... we\u2019ve got the best technical minds looking at how this happened. I don\u2019t know this guy\u2014he\u2019s the bottom scum of journalists.\u201d pic.twitter.com/1TqToWQOZZ \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 25, 2025\n\nThe national security adviser then fleshed out his conspiracy theory, suggesting that Goldberg might have catfished him, on the off chance that Waltz would invite him to a high-level text thread about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\n\u201cHave you ever had somebody\u2019s contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else\u2019s number there?\u201d he asked Ingraham. \u201cSo of course I didn\u2019t see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else. Now whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical means is something we\u2019re trying to figure out.\u201d\n\nSo who broached U. S. national security via a duplicitous contact card? That\u2019s a question for the boys at DOGE, not the national security adviser:\n\nINGRAHAM: But how did it end up in your phone?\n\nWALTZ: Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out.\n\nINGRAHAM: But, that\u2019s a pretty big problem \u2026 that\u2019s disturbing.\n\nWALTZ: That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got the best technical minds, right?\n\nFinally, Ingraham \u2014 who asked surprisingly tough questions for a woman who recently nodded along as Donald Trump claimed gold paint doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 pressed Waltz again on whether he knows Goldberg.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Waltz said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup. I do now. Knew him by reputation for lying about the president over and over and over again. What I can tell you for certain \u2014 certainly wasn\u2019t reaching out or talking to him at all. Why would I?\u201d\n\nThen Waltz called Goldberg \u201cvile,\u201d accusing him once again of being a rampant liar.\n\nWaltz asks you this: What kind of person would publicly lie to the American people? Think about that for one second.\n\nMichael Waltz claimed that he\u2019s \u201cnever met, don\u2019t know, never communicated with\u201d Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a photo of Waltz standing next to Goldberg during a 2021 event at the French Embassy.\n\n\n\nThe event Waltz attended\u2014a Q&A with a French filmmaker\u2014was moderated by Goldberg. pic.twitter.com/eTqOY7xnTl \u2014 Anna Bower (@AnnaBower) March 26, 2025\n\nHere\u2019s Waltz\u2019s full interview with Ingraham:"

Eight blue states sued and a federal judge in Boston issued an order temporarily blocking the administration from freezing the funding. A federal appeals court declined to overturn that order.\n\nThe administration, in its request for an emergency intervention, claimed that it was ending the funding to the states\u2019 programs as part of Trump\u2019s crackdown on DEI initiatives. Officials sent a brief form notice to the grant awardees and did not provide specific evidence that their programs were engaged in any DEI practices.\n\nThe case is the latest where judges have reversed Trump moves to withhold federal funding already promised to various grant programs. It is also one of several lawsuits touching on the president\u2019s anti-DEI gambits. The federal district court has set a hearing in the case for Friday.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency appeals rising from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, ordered the states that sued to response by Friday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

Photo: James Hughes/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\nDuring a raucous city-election season 60 years ago, nearly everybody in New York agreed on two things: The city was going to hell in a handbasket, and something needed to be done about it. \u201cI\u2019m running a campaign that calls for change because change is needed,\u201d liberal Republican congressman John Lindsay thundered in a debate against his Democratic opponent, comptroller Abe Beame. \u201cThere is one murder in this city every 14 hours, one rape every six hours, one theft every three minutes \u2026 100,000 middle-income families have left New York City, 18,000 jobs a year. The city is near bankruptcy. There is no long-range fiscal planning and no program planning. And the administration of which Mr. Beame has been part and parcel has to shoulder the responsibility for this.\u201d\n\nIt was true. Before becoming comptroller, Beame had been a top finance official in the three-term Democratic mayoralty of Robert Wagner, which had run its course and done little to tame, trim or transform a sprawling, sluggish, patronage-infested municipal bureaucracy. A third candidate in the race, conservative William F. Buckley, dubbed Lindsay a \u201cflamboyant idealist\u201d as a put-down, but Lindsay won by promising to apply strong medicine to agencies that clearly needed to be merged, eliminated, or overhauled. As columnist Murray Kempton put it, \u201cHe is fresh and everyone else is tired.\u201d\n\nNew Yorkers picked the tall, good-looking WASP from the East Side and assigned him the mission of curing not just the visible and all-too-familiar urban problems of poverty, discrimination, troubled schools, and violent crime. Voters had also lost faith in the ability of political leaders and a sluggish, unresponsive bureaucracy to turn things around. A major, multipart investigative series on the city\u2019s problems by the Herald-Tribune newspaper in 1965 opened with the memorable words: \u201cNew York is the greatest city in the world \u2014 and everything is wrong with it.\u201d\n\nIn New York\u2019s list of memorable, clearly consequential mayors like La Guardia, Koch, and Bloomberg, Lindsay is often given short shrift. Aside from a loop in Central Park and the newly refurbished East River Park, no major public buildings, parks, or structures bear the name of the mayor who brought New York air-conditioned subways; created the nation\u2019s first 9-1-1 emergency call system; and signed the Rent Stabilization Act, which remains the city\u2019s most important affordable-housing measure to this day. Those of us who lived in the city at the time are more likely to associate Lindsay with the many labor strikes and street riots that happened on his watch, along with a notoriously botched response to a blizzard in 1966 that left 42 people dead.\n\nBut Lindsay\u2019s two tumultuous terms provide important lessons for this year\u2019s crop of City Hall hopefuls in how to attack, and perhaps even slay, the stubborn dragons that are once again threatening to devour Gotham. (My three-part documentary series and panel discussion about the Lindsay years are online at You Decide, my podcast).\n\nThe first and most important lesson: Think big and swing for the fences. Shortly after his inauguration, Lindsay decreed the city\u2019s bureaucracy a \u201cpile of old rusty junk\u201d and moved to consolidate 50 agencies into ten \u201csuperagencies,\u201d forcing mergers by executive order when the City Council refused to go along. He created the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the Health and Hospitals Corporation and the nation\u2019s first municipal Department of Environmental Protection and successfully pushed for the merger of the New York City Transit Authority with the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority to create the modern MTA. Importantly, Lindsay also established the 59 community planning boards that give citizens a voice in how development takes place as an alternative to the political clubhouses that controlled many neighborhoods.\n\nNot every Lindsay reorganization was successful \u2014 a poorly conceived effort to simultaneously decentralize and desegregate city schools led to a paralyzing teachers\u2019 strike \u2014 but today\u2019s mayoral candidates should emulate Lindsay\u2019s creativity and willingness to redraw the city\u2019s org chart when necessary. Should the Department of Correction be merged with Probation? Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg temporarily had both departments run by a single commissioner; perhaps the move should be permanent. Should the Rikers Island jail complex be placed under control of a federal court monitor? Mayor Adams fought against the takeover at every turn, even as the number of suicides, overdoses, and other deaths of people in custody on his watch has climbed to 37.\n\nDo we need a separate, specialized agency tasked solely with addressing the complex needs of seriously mentally ill New Yorkers? And what about the idea, recently floated by Vital City, of empowering a single agency \u2014 not necessarily the NYPD \u2014 to be in charge of subway safety? If things in New York are as bad as today\u2019s candidates keep telling us they are, they should be thinking in big, broad strokes, not just doing a little tinkering here and there.\n\nThe other big Lindsay lesson is his ability to attract and inspire men and women of extraordinary talents, many of them dubbed \u201cwhiz kids,\u201d in their 20s and early 30s, whom the 44-year-old mayor entrusted with enormous power and responsibility.\n\nSeveral of these well-chosen aides went on to extraordinary careers as elected officials, including H. Carl McCall (state senator and state comptroller); Ronnie Eldrige (City Council); Elizabeth Holtzman (congress, district attorney and city comptroller); and Lindsay\u2019s human-rights commissioner, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has been the elected delegate to Congress from Washington, D.C., since 1991. Many of the whiz kids went on to run major institutions: Lindsay\u2019s chief of staff, Peter Goldmark, became the president of the Rockefeller Foundation and executive director of the Port Authority; another chief of staff, Steve Isenberg, became chairman of Newsday; press secretary Bob Laird became op-ed editor of the Daily News; and First Deputy Mayor Dick Aurelio launched NY1, the nation\u2019s first 24-hour all-news cable channel. Jay Kriegel and Sid Davidoff became the kind of behind-the-scenes fixers who spent decades nurturing, connecting, and representing all manner of public and private institutions.\n\nLindsay\u2019s bench wasn\u2019t just built on luck or Ivy-League personal connections. According to Goldmark, top hires went through an exhaustive gauntlet of interviews and background checks to assess who was hungry, smart, honest, and willing to work long hours, a process he learned from Fred Hayes, a budget expert Lindsay poached from the Johnson administration.\n\n\u201cIt was fun to be with them because they were energetic and they had a lot of ideas, and they were doing things and they loved their work,\u201d Holtzman told me. \u201cThey admired the mayor, and they all thought they were doing God\u2019s work in the city\u201d\n\n\u201cI think all of us must have felt at some point some nagging feelings that maybe we weren\u2019t old enough, wide enough, broad enough, deep enough. But hell, we were in it. We were going to give it all we got, and he trusted us,\u201d Isenberg later recalled. \u201cYou went to work every day with the most wonderful illusion you can ever have: That you could make a difference for the city.\u201d\n\nThat kind of energy, idealism, and reform spirit has been lacking in the Democratic primary campaign so far. But with just under 90 days to go, it\u2019s not too late for us all to demand that the candidates talk about major structural changes rather than small adjustments and that they promise to find the very best people to run the city\u2019s agencies and turn them loose to do God\u2019s work in a city that, 60 years after Lindsay, is in crisis once again."

Photo: Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump-administration officials denied that they had shared sensitive material about an ongoing military operation in a Signal group chat that mistakenly included The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\n\u201cThere was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national security, said while testifying before Congress.\n\nBut on Wednesday, The Atlantic followed up on its bombshell report, publishing the detailed plans that were shared to the text chain, which involved a planned strike against the Houthis in Yemen. The magazine redacted only the name of a CIA operative named in the text chain by CIA director John Ratcliffe. In the texts, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the series of events with specific time stamps and descriptions of the fighter jets that would be used in the operation:\n\n\u201cTEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.\n\n1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)\n\n1345: \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)\n\n1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)\n\n1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 targets)\n\n1536: F-18 2nd Strike Starts \u2013 also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.\n\nMORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)\n\nWe are currently clean on OPSEC\n\nGodspeed to our Warriors.\n\nThe planned attack commenced shortly after the messages were sent. Despite the staggering level of detail reportedly shared by Hegseth, the White House landed on a new target for its spin: The Atlantic\u2019s headline. Rather than address the content of the Hegseth text, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to the publication\u2019s use of the term attack plans in its latest report, suggesting it was walking back its earlier contention that officials shared \u201cwar plans\u201d in the group chat.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT \u2018war plans.\u2019 This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\u201d she said on social media.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who Goldberg says invited him to the Signal chat, echoed Leavitt\u2019s words in his own post. \u201cNo locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.\u201d\n\nHegseth also blasted The Atlantic\u2019s report, suggesting that the publication\u2019s reveal was far less damning than it claimed:\n\nSo, let\u2019s me get this straight. The Atlantic released the so-called \u201cwar plans\u201d and those \u201cplans\u201d include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information.\n\n\n\nThose are some really shitty war plans.\n\n\n\nThis only proves\u2026 \u2014 Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) March 26, 2025\n\nThe published text seems to conflict with the congressional testimony of top Trump national security officials who asserted under oath that specific details of the military operation weren\u2019t shared. During an exchange with Arizona senator Mark Kelly, Gabbard was asked if there was any mention of any weapon or weapon system being used in the operation in the chat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall specific names of systems or weapons being used,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s publication of the text has prompted calls for Hegseth\u2019s resignation from congressional Democrats. Kelly, a Navy combat veteran and former astronaut, said Hegseth should step down, writing, \u201cThe Signal incident is what happens when you have the most unqualified Secretary of Defense we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Pat Ryan, a New York congressman who served as an Army intelligence officer, said the details that the Defense Secretary shared would\u2019ve clearly been considered classified information. \u201cHegseth is blatantly lying (or is somehow even more clueless & incompetent than we all thought). He must resign, IMMEDIATELY. And should lawyer up,\u201d he wrote on social media.\n\nThe Signal group chat is set to receive even more scrutiny. Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, told reporters Wednesday that the panel will be asking the Trump administration to expedite an inspector general investigation into the text messages."

            "full_content": "Summary The Supreme Court upheld Biden-era regulations requiring background checks and serial numbers for ghost gun kits.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the 7-2 majority opinion that included both liberal and conservative justices.\n\nPolice submissions of ghost guns recovered at crime scenes for tracing increased from 1,600 in 2017 to 19,000 by 2021.\n\nGorsuch noted technologies like 3D printing have dramatically changed how guns are made and sold.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas dissented, arguing the law should be read more narrowly regarding weapon-parts kits.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld Biden-era federal regulations on \u201cghost guns,\u201d mail-order kits that allow people to build untraceable weapons at home \u2013 handing gun control groups a rare win at the conservative high court.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority that included both liberal and conservative justices in one of the most closely watched Supreme Court cases of the year.\n\n\u201cPerhaps a half hour of work is required before anyone can fire a shot,\u201d Gorsuch wrote. \u201cBut even as sold, the kit comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious. Really, the kit\u2019s name says it all: \u2018Buy Build Shoot.\u2019\n\nIndividuals who had purchased the weapons and several manufacturers challenged regulations created by the Biden administration in 2022 that require ghost gun makers to include serial numbers on the kits and perform background checks on people who purchase them.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives created the new regulations as police say the untraceable weapons are turning up much more frequently at crime scenes. In 2017, police submitted about 1,600 ghost guns recovered at crime scenes for tracing. Four years later, the number had grown to more than 19,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration will handle the issue going forward. Trump signed an order on February 7 requiring the Attorney General to review gun regulations imposed during the Biden administration.\n\nGorsuch cites technological advances\n\nGorsuch noted in his opinion that the way Americans think about guns has changed dramatically since 1968 when Congress approved the Gun Control Act.\n\n\u201cRecent years, however, have witnessed profound changes in how guns are made and sold,\u201d Gorsuch wrote.\n\nIn 1968, the milling equipment and materials needed to make a gun at home were far too expensive for most individuals.\n\n\u201cWith the introduction of new technologies like 3D printing and reinforced polymers, that is no longer true,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cToday, companies are able to make and sell weapon parts kits that individuals can assemble into functional firearms in their own homes.\u201d\n\nMajority has moved to the right on gun laws\n\nAsked for comment on the decision, a Justice Department spokesperson said the administration would \u201ccontinue to support and defend the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court case didn\u2019t involve the Second Amendment, though, and the Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a question about whether the Trump administration stands by the ATF regulation.\n\nThough not a Second Amendment dispute, the case put guns on the high court\u2019s docket at a time when its 6-3 conservative majority has tacked to the right on gun laws.\n\nLast year, the conservative justices court struck down a ban on bump stocks, devices that convert semi-automatic rifles into a weapons that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute, for instance.\n\nBut there had been signs that some members of the court\u2019s conservative majority saw this case differently than the one dealing with bump stocks. Even before the arguments were heard, the justices had hinted their thoughts by siding with the Biden administration on its emergency docket. On a 5-4 vote, the court allowed the regulation to remain in place while the litigation continued.\n\nThe 1968 law requires manufacturers and dealers to run background checks, keep sales records and include serial numbers on firearms. The ATF concluded during the Biden administration that the law covers the kits, which the agency said can quickly be built into functioning firearms. The rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of the kits but instead requires serial numbers and background checks on purchasers.\n\nGhost guns are kits that a user can purchase online to assemble a fully functional firearm at home. Critics say they are attractive to people who are otherwise prohibited from buying firearms because of the lack of requirement for background checks and serial numbers.\n\n\u201cGhost guns are the gun industry\u2019s way of skirting commonsense gun laws and arming dangerous people without background checks,\u201d said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center. \u201cWe are thrilled that the Supreme Court has upheld the ATF rule that treats ghost guns as what they are: guns.\u201d\n\nIn his dissent Wednesday, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the majority \u201cblesses the Government\u2019s overreach.\u201d Thomas said he reads the federal law at issue in a much narrower way that does not cover \u201cthe unfinished frames and receivers contained in weapon-parts kits.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one. But, it did not. I would adhere to the words Congress enacted,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nThe Firearms Policy Coalition, one of the gun rights groups that challenged the ATF rule, said it was disappointed with the court\u2019s \u201cmisguided decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is only one battle in a multi-generational war over the scope of government and pre-existing right to keep and bear arms,\u201d the group said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe Supreme Court cynically built up a falsework to shore up the ATF\u2019s improper rule in spite of the text and history of the statutes.\u201d\n\nDuring oral arguments in October, several of the court\u2019s conservatives and all of its liberals appeared skeptical of the notion that the kits were geared toward a tradition of gunsmithing hobbyists. Chief Justice John Roberts, in particular, brushed off the idea that building the kind of gun kits at issue was equivalent to someone working on a classic car. In other words, he seemed to say, the kits aren\u2019t designed with hobbyists in mind.\n\n\u201cDrilling a hole or two, I would think, doesn\u2019t give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends,\u201d Roberts said to the lawyer representing the kit manufacturers. \u201cMy understanding is that it\u2019s not terribly difficult for someone to do this.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy groups and five companies that manufacture the kits sued, arguing that the regulation wasn\u2019t permitted by the law. The kits aren\u2019t weapons, they said, but rather parts. A US district court in Texas threw out the rule and the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nThe information Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat of top Trump national security officials was highly classified at the time he wrote it, especially because the operation had not even started yet, according to a US defense official familiar with the operation and another source who was briefed on it afterward.\n\nThe updates Hegseth was giving in the Signal chat were the kind of real-time play-by-play that a commander would be giving to the president in a highly classified setting as the operation unfolded.\n\n\u201cThese are operational plans that are highly classified in order to protect the service members,\u201d the defense official said.\n\nA third source familiar with the matter said they saw documents sent within the Pentagon about the operation, which were marked classified and included the same information Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat about specific weapons platforms and timing.\n\n\u201cIt was classified when it was shared below the principal level,\u201d this person said.\n\nThe Atlantic on Wednesday published additional text messages from the Signal group chat, underscoring a massive breach in operational security as specific sensitive information about the Houthi attack was shared in the chat before it was carried out.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his team have repeatedly sought to downplay the sensitivity of the information shared in the Signal group in the aftermath of The Atlantic\u2019s bombshell story on Monday. While they denied there was a \u201cwar plan\u201d shared, the text messages published Wednesday offer an extremely detailed description of the coming strike, including the airplanes and drones used.\n\n\u201cIt is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court martialed for this,\u201d the defense official added. \u201cWe don\u2019t provide that level of information on unclassified systems, in order to protect the lives and safety of the servicemembers carrying out these strikes. If we did, it would be wholly irresponsible. My most junior analysts know not to do this.\u201d\n\nA former senior US military commander said the information shared would allow adversaries to evacuate targeted areas ranging from command and control centers, to communication sites and firing positions. Moreover, it would allow them to mass anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons to overwhelm US pilots.\n\n\u201cUntil the strike goes it\u2019s absolutely classified as the lives of our pilots depend on secrecy,\u201d the former commander said.\n\nThe messages also rebut the claim from Hegseth and other Trump administration officials that war plans were not discussed on the chain. In a message sent at 11:44 a.m. ET and published by The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg and Shane Harris, Hegseth shares operational details about the strikes: \u201cWeather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,\u201d Hegseth wrote.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said on Wednesday that he and the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Jack Reed, are formally asking the administration for an Inspector General report on the Signal chat for the committee to review and a classified briefing from a senior official.\n\nWicker said the information in the chat was \u201cof such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\u201d\n\nTop US officials have said the information shared in the text messages was not classified.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe, who was one of the participants in the group chat, acknowledged on Tuesday that \u201cpre-decisional strike deliberation should be conducted through classified channels.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesman Sean Parnell acknowledged on Wednesday that Hegseth shared information on the US military\u2019s strikes on Yemen while the operation was underway.\n\n\u201cThese additional Signal chat messages confirm there were no classified materials or war plans shared. The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway and had already been briefed through official channels. The American people see through the Atlantic\u2019s pathetic attempts to distract from President Trump\u2019s national security agenda,\u201d Parnell said in a statement.\n\nDetailed plans shared\n\nHegseth goes on to share the plans in extraordinary detail, according to The Atlantic:\n\n1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)\u201d\n\n\u201c1345: \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)\u201d\n\n\u201c1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)\u201d\n\n\u201c1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 targets)\u201d\n\n\u201c1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts \u2013 also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.\u201d\n\nThat information, according to The Atlantic, was received \u201ctwo hours before the scheduled start of the bombing of Houthi positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this information \u2014 particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen \u2014 had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face,\u201d Goldberg and Harris wrote.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz later texted to confirm that the target was in a building that collapsed and the strike was successful.\n\n\u201cThe first target \u2013 their top missile guy \u2013 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend\u2019s building and it\u2019s now collapsed,\u201d Waltz wrote at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nAnd later in the day, Hegseth confirmed to the group that more strikes were coming.\n\n\u201cGreat job all. More strikes ongoing for hours tonight, and will provide full initial report tomorrow. But on time, on target, and good readouts so far,\u201d he said.\n\nThe release of the messages appeared to undercut Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s testimony on Tuesday, where she said it was to her knowledge that weapons packages, targets and timing weren\u2019t part of the conversations in the Signal chat.\n\nGabbard on Wednesday doubled down on the administration\u2019s insistence that no classified information was shared in the now-infamous chat.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the president, National Security Advisor stated, no classified information was shared,\u201d Gabbard told the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cThere were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared. This was a standard update to the national security cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region.\u201d\n\nShe also said Hegseth was ultimately responsible for deciding what in that conversation should or should not have been classified: \u201cUltimately, the Secretary of Defense holds the authority to classify or declassify.\u201d\n\nGoldberg said on Wednesday the magazine decided to redact a sensitive piece of information out of their follow-up article.\n\n\u201cWe did redact one piece of information because we felt, on our own, that we felt it was best to do. And the CIA asked us, but, you know, at a certain point, the administration is saying that there\u2019s nothing classified or secret or sensitive in these so at a certain point, I just felt, you know, let our readers decide for themselves,\u201d he said on MSNBC of the decision to publish the rest of the information.\n\nTrump and White House downplay sensitivity\n\nTrump distanced himself from the Signal chat when asked Wednesday afternoon if he still believes that the information shared was not classified, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure, you have to ask the various people involved,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump also said Waltz had assumed responsibility for the error, but he shrugged off any culpability on the part of Hegseth, who sent the timeline of the planned attack before it was underway.\n\n\u201cHow do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,\u201d Trump said, sounding surprised a reporter would raise the issue. Earlier, the White House said Trump had looked at Hegseth\u2019s messages that were included in the text chain published by The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a witch-hunt,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMoments after The Atlantic published the text messages, the White House continued to push back and seek to discredit Goldberg\u2019s reporting, though the National Security Council has verified the authenticity of the text thread.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT \u2018war plans.\u2019 This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post to social media.\n\nLeavitt is also pushing back against concerns that Steve Witkoff, the president\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, who was on the group chat, was receiving the texts while in Moscow. Witkoff, she said, \u201cwas provided a secure line of communication by the U.S. Government, and it was the only phone he had in his possession while in Moscow,\u201d going on to shift blame to the media.\n\nGoldberg criticized Leavitt\u2019s response to the news during his MSNBC appearance and said \u201cshe\u2019s just playing some sort of weird semantic game.\u201d\n\nCNN military analyst retired Col. Cedric Leighton said the details have \u201call the elements of a war plan, and what that means is, all of these elements mean that this stuff is classified. Full stop. There is no question this is classified.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto, Michael Williams, Morgan Rimmer, Ted Barrett and Kit Maher contributed reporting."

            "full_content": "Photo: Kenny Holston/The New York Times/Redux\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton used a private email server while she was secretary of State, she became the subject of a yearslong Justice Department investigation that culminated with a public announcement by the FBI director that she had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d but would not be indicted. When Donald Trump took dozens of classified documents to his gilded ballroom (and bathroom) at Mar-A-Lago, he got indicted and might have ended up in prison if he hadn\u2019t won the 2024 election. And when it emerged that Joe Biden kept classified documents at his private home and office, DoJ (under Biden himself) appointed a special counsel who concluded Biden had \u201cwillfully retained and disclosed classified materials\u201d but, on balance, should not be charged.\n\nYet when our nation\u2019s top defense and national security officials group-chatted in the widely available Signal app about the operational details of an imminent military strike in plain view of a national journalist? Nothing.\n\nThis will be the new normal. Under the halting, distracted leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Justice Department has made no mention thus far of the Signal scandal, which dominated headlines all week. It\u2019s certain that Bondi and everyone else in DoJ leadership knows what happened. Yet I feel confident predicting that the Justice Department won\u2019t lift a finger to investigate this mess.\n\nEven now, at the start of this story, the end is already plain. Nobody\u2019s getting indicted or even meaningfully investigated by the Justice Department. There\u2019s my bold prediction. If I\u2019m wrong \u2014 if DoJ does open up an actual criminal investigation here (ass-covering window dressing doesn\u2019t count) \u2014 then throw this article back in my face and have a laugh.\n\nI\u2019m not going to be that former-prosecutor guy who reads a couple of stories in the press and declares definitively that it\u2019s the crime of the century and we need immediate indictments. Typically, as here, when a story breaks, we know some key facts but don\u2019t yet have all the necessary details. And real-world prosecution is more complex than a simple paint-by-numbers approach in which we tick off the legal elements and declare the case proved. Prosecutors need to exercise discretion beyond the technical requirements and to consider the practical prospects and impact of a criminal charge.\n\nSo it\u2019s a bit much to declare right now that people ought to be indicted. But there\u2019s more than enough in the public record to justify \u2014 to require, even \u2014 the opening of a criminal investigation to dig down and gather the necessary facts.\n\nWe know Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally invited to join a high-level Signal group chat between the vice-president, the Defense secretary, the secretary of State, the national security adviser, and others about sensitive military and national security operations. Based on Goldberg\u2019s reporting alone, prosecutors should consider the federal law that criminalizes mishandling of sensitive government information.\n\nThat law gives us three primary elements that must be proved to support a criminal charge.\n\nFirst, the information must \u201crelat[e] to the national defense.\u201d Goldberg is careful in his article not to disclose sensitive operational details, but he reveals that the Signal text chain contained information about planning for a then-imminent military attack on the Houthi militia in Yemen. After the story broke, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sputtered furiously that he had not texted \u201cwar plans\u201d to anybody, but that clever (if not very smart) attempt at wordplay fails on its face. Hegseth is either outright lying \u2014 the National Security Council has confirmed the authenticity of the texts reported in Goldberg\u2019s article \u2014 or he\u2019s playing a lawyerly game in which he secretly assigns some highly specific, inapplicable definition to a term (war plans) and then maintains that whatever happened doesn\u2019t meet his special criteria for it. (Perhaps in his view it\u2019s not a \u201cwar plan\u201d without a declared war. Who knows?) The fact is the texts related in detail to the targets, weapons, and sequencing of a military strike \u2014 which eventually happened precisely as the participants had discussed it. We can check this box easily.\n\nSecond, the information must have been \u201cremoved from its proper place of custody.\u201d Again, this looks straightforward. A Signal group text (with a journalist attached) is plainly not the \u201cproper place of custody\u201d for any classified information, never mind for specific military attack plans. I recently connected with an 82-year-old on a work project; when I asked how he would like to stay in touch, he casually replied, \u201cOh, just text me on Signal.\u201d This isn\u2019t exactly ironclad legal canon, but generally speaking, if an 82-year-old and I (who, for years, would find the CNN webpage by Googling \u201cCNN\u201d and then clicking the top search result) are using Signal to chat, then it\u2019s not sufficiently secure for the highest levels of the U.S. military and national security apparatus.\n\nThe third requirement is the trickiest: that a person acted with \u201cgross negligence.\u201d Most criminal statutes require some level of intentionality, but this is the rare federal law that creates a crime based on, essentially, outrageous sloppiness. Here\u2019s where we need more information: How did the Signal text chain start? For how long was it operational? Were the participants using government-issued or private phones? Did anybody express misgivings about the security risk, or was anybody so warned? Why did the participants choose to communicate through the same means as a pack of old college buddies in a fantasy-football league?\n\nThe reality is we\u2019ll likely never learn the answers to these key questions. Or more precisely, DoJ will never learn. I expect journalists will continue to pursue the story and develop even more information. It\u2019s a perfect see-no-evil approach for Bondi and her brass. If they never open a case and never take a look, they\u2019ll never have all the facts needed to make a potentially difficult prosecutorial call. Blissful ignorance can have its virtues in regular life, but it\u2019s not an ideal touchstone for the United States Department of Justice.\n\nBondi is to be forgiven here because heaven knows her attention has been focused on other pressing matters of state: releasing binders full of pointless documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein; pursuing law firms that have the gall to represent interests the president finds \u201cvexatious\u201d; publicly fawning over Elon Musk and DOGE and vowing to chase their tormentors to the ends of the earth; throwing out the Eric Adams indictment because he has promised to be a good, compliant mayor; and hosting pep rallies at which the president casually refers to prosecutors as \u201chorrible people,\u201d \u201cscum,\u201d \u201cderanged,\u201d and \u201cthugs.\u201d How can one attorney general manage all that and still have time to assign a pressing national security investigation to the Justice Department\u2019s own National Security Division?\n\nSo whether or not anyone in the Signal group-chat crew ought to be indicted, I can say this much without hesitation: Somebody needs to take a look. And I can say this even more confidently: Nobody will."

Maybe between messages they yank their X feeds for a fresh batch of notifications, start crafting their next tweets, or Google their own names. At some point, their phones go back into their pockets. In a narrow but undeniable way, the government is a bunch of people in a group chat now, just like everything else.\n\nPeace Through Strength, every single day. pic.twitter.com/3HmVZv2HSb \u2014 Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) March 15, 2025\n\nChatting is as old as networked computing, but the total dominance of the group text is a product of the smartphone era. In 2009, WhatsApp was a cheaper alternative to SMS; by 2014, it was worth $16 billion to Facebook. Now, the chat, rather than the feed, is the standard structure of internet sociality. In the mid-aughts, work-chat platforms like Campfire were a niche product for software developers and early remote workers. Today, hundreds of millions of people work, and modulate their performance of work, in chat windows. Bartenders are being asked to keep up with their Slack messages. A lot of cultural and media phenomena are chat stories in disguise, smuggling side channels that are sometimes more significant than their subjects: Streaming is chat; podcasts can be chat; Substack is sort of chat; \u201cinfluencers\u201d are chat; porn is chat; \u201cReddit is back\u201d is also a story about Discord. Zoomers chat one way while boomers WhatsApp another. The tech industry\u2019s next big thing is automated chat.\n\nThe rise of chat \u2014 and, specifically, the group chat \u2013 was a ground-up phenomenon. In the context of social media, it was a way to reestablish privacy and control as well as a way to reassert human group dynamics, good and bad, collaborative and exclusionary, but more familiar than algorithmic. In workplaces, it was an obvious, if ultimately sort of complicated, progression from email. That backchannel culture would seep into the broader culture was inevitable. Still, it\u2019s something to behold.\n\nWhat\u2019s somewhat newer is the arrival of the group chat as a site of elite coordination. Once you start looking for it, though, you see it everywhere. Last year, in the New York Times, Sophie Haigney noted their frequent appearances in major news stories, including the Dominion lawsuits in which Fox News hosts talked election denial, the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. More recently, they\u2019ve been implicated in Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s trans purge at the NSA (Gabbard was also a member of \u201cHouthi PC small group\u201d), the successful campaign to punish Columbia student protesters organized in part by influential group-chatting alums, and, more recently, Elon Musk\u2019s government-dismantling task force. According to The Wall Street Journal, an early staffer claimed, \u201cWithin 2 minutes of talking to the final interviewer for DOGE, [I was asked] if I wanted to join. I said \u2018yes.\u2019 Then he said \u2018cool\u2019 and I was in multiple Signal groups.\u201d Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bragged in January that the \u201cDOGE team is using Slack, which is very exciting.\u201d\n\nThe main story here is obviously what Trump officials were talking about (conducting lethal military operations) and how they were talking about it (just as they do in public, with maximum focus on and deference to Trump). But seeing them chat is still wild. It also makes Trump-administration dynamics extremely legible to chat-brained civilians, as John Ganz points out at Unpopular Front. \u201cStephen Miller is the voice of the president in this chat and everyone immediately defers to him,\u201d he writes, while Pete Hegseth is \u201cclearly the least respected member of the chat.\u201d I\u2019d add that Vance \u2014 the person in the group most likely to be simmering in a bunch of weird group chats of his own and probably the only one here to have seen the inside of a Discord channel \u2014 is a recognizable type as well: the tedious and insecure debater that everyone knows how to humor and ignore.\n\nI was admin of this gc. There were no high schoolers lol. Most of the participants were 20-somethings who worked in politics or media and Vance would occasionally pop in to update us on his campaign, thank us for our support, answer questions, or clown one of us, like in the\u2026 \u2014 Michael Foster (@realmfoster) April 4, 2024\n\n2011\u2019s Osama bin Laden Situation Room photo was instantly iconic. But it was also, with a bit of distance, sort of deflating, all the legitimizing ceremony and process of the state, the might of the military, and the dark alluring myths of the special forces rendered as a bunch of officials, including the president, crowded into a too-small room to watch TV. In 2025, we once again encounter the American empire in all its majesty: a bunch of Fox News personalities giving themselves text neck \u2014 and giving one another emoji props \u2014 as they repeat talking points in a group text in front of a bunch of people they secretly hate."

            "full_content": "A year or so before the most recent election of Donald Trump, I read a newly-released book that, while little-noticed upon publication, opened a window on the new era of America politics, outlining virtually every issue that Trump would raise on his march to the presidency while detailing the powerful structural and institutional obstacles he would face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a time of cowardice on racial issues, the book was forthright, noting that America\u2019s black political leadership has been \u201ccourted, coddled and fawned upon by the press as no other assemblage of politicians in history. Even today it is kowtowed to by the Democratic Party in a manner and approaching the servile.\u201d The book attacked the hypocrisy of \u201cupper-middle class bureaucrats and judges\u201d who mouthed politically correct slogans while sending their children to schools far away from minorities.\n\nIt noted the moral bankruptcy of current civil rights leaders and how they advocate for discrimination against whites rather than equal treatment: \u201cEqual rights have been replaced by the demand for equal reward,\u201d the author noted, blasting the left\u2019s misuse of the 14th amendment as \u201cgrounds for upholding executive action discriminating against white males.\u201d\n\nBut the author also understood that the challenges conservatives faced were structural, driven by an iron triangle of media, bureaucracy, and the courts: \u201cMore and more,\u201d the author declared, \u201cwe are governed by an unelected oligarchy of bureaucrats, judges and press guided by their own ideology and insulated from the electorate.\u201d\n\nHe called out the radicalism of the left, blaming their demands for absolute fealty to the party line as \u201cless characteristic of pressure groups in a democracy than of the militant wing of the Chinese Communist party\u201d [during the Cultural Revolution].\n\nAnticipating DOGE, he noted the corruption of the liberal deep state and the malicious motives of its progenitors: \u201cIt was designed that way\u2026 The leviathan welfare state is\u2026 a pyramid to ambition masquerading as altruism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he understood that mass firings were necessary because dismissing a few bureaucrats would not stop systemic resistance to Trump: \u201cbureaucracy [is] crawling with potential martyrs who would salivate over the chance to win prestige, publicity, plaudits and guaranteed careers this most liberal of cities provides automatically to those who managed to get themselves fired for zealotry.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd crucially, the author understood the necessity of wiping out the NGO empire behind much of the corruption, encouraging the business community to \u201cattack the loopholes of the left, [and] the big foundations and to demand and know why it is that corporate taxes are going to subsidize tax free public policy institutes and \u2018public interest law firms\u2019 which use their privileged positions as a base from which to launch assaults on business.\u201d He understood that rather than reflecting the public interest, these firms represented \u201conly their own ideology. They are among the nation's new unelected elite determining the course of this country. . .\u201d\n\nFinally, he called for an assertive foreign policy based on the national interest against the wishes of liberal intellectuals who believe that \u201cregardless of who is elected to office its own perception of what is moral and immoral should prevail over any asserted pragmatic national interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhile clear-eyed about the structural challenges facing any conservative president, the author saw, as Trump sees, the left\u2019s fundamental weakness: \u201ca great gulf in America between the upper middle class progressives and the average citizen,\u201d and he called the leftist establishment \u201csoft at its core. [They are] intellectuals who have no hold on the political allegiance of the working or middle class. Much of the esteem in which academics were once held was erased by their squalid performance when confronted by the militants of the student left in the last decade.\u201d\n\nAnd he understood the necessity, for any right-wing strategy to be successful, of capturing the White House:\n\nonly the president has a podium of sufficient elevation, a microphone of adequate power, to give America's attention on the issues the national press ignores. Only the White House has the discipline and resources to conduct siege warfare against the bureaucracy. Only the president can transform the Supreme Court justices who will slam shut the book belatedly on this unfortunate era of government by decree, and the presidency remains the only repository of national power and authority remotely within the reach of the right.\n\nThe book made clear that success required a candidate to break from party constraints and run on an \u201cindependent conservative ticket for president running free of and against the establishments both national parties. The objective would not only be the capture of the presidency but the realignment of the nation's political parties.\u201d\n\nThe problem with the book, as some readers may have guessed, is not that it was wrong, but that it was far too early. Every passage and phrase quoted above does not actually come from a \u201cnewly-released\u201d book, but from Conservatives Votes, Liberal Victories: Why the Right has Failed, the now largely-forgotten first book written by a then little-known, 36-year-old ex-senior staffer of the Nixon administration, Patrick Buchanan. The book was published 50 years ago, long before Buchanan was a household name, and even longer before he would launch several presidential campaigns that would strike fear in the hearts of the GOP establishment.\n\nReading such an acute diagnosis of our political ailments today from an author writing a half century ago is exhilarating, but also terrifying, because it highlights a few discomfiting facts: First, the problems we face were seen by clear-eyed conservatives such as Buchanan decades ago. Second, we\u2019ve made almost no fundamental progress over the last half century in tackling them. It also makes clear that anyone who is pushing any version of a return to \u201ctraditional conservatism\u201d from the MAGA agenda is at best a dupe of the liberals and at worst a cowardly or malicious actor, willfully ignorant of a half century of political and policy failure, and afraid to take the difficult steps that Buchanan outlined decades ago and that Trump and his team are actually undertaking now.\n\nIn other words, for several decades there were figures on the right who knew what needed to be done. Either we just didn\u2019t listen to them\u2014or those who did lacked the power or the will to turn that knowledge into action.\n\nThat is why President Trump is the perfect actor for this political moment. Because what Trump has in spades is exactly the sort of iron will and unquenchable desire for victory that previous GOP leaders have lacked. That was why the voters chose him.\n\nWhile there are always new insights to be gained as we face new situations, Buchanan\u2019s book shows that what we fundamentally have lacked are not insights but men and women with the courage to put those insights into action. That means we need to make sure the administration selects personnel, nominates judges, and forges alliances with congressional leaders not solely on the basis of their having the boldest and most brilliant ideas (though of course good ideas are important!) but based on their willingness to be maximally disagreeable in the fight against the leftist leviathan\u2014even when the leviathan turns up the heat to uncomfortable levels.\n\nIn our current political moment, the primary value that writers and policy analysts can provide is not some brilliant new intellectual synthesis, but steady and unflinching encouragement that will help fortify the wills of Trump and his administration, and to let them know that when they are being attacked most brutally, that is likely the surest sign they are doing a good job.\n\nBuchanan outlined the problem a half century ago\u2014Trump has arrived to provide our first chance at a real solution.\n\nAs for the rest of us who wish to help him, what is required is not mere cleverness\u2014but something rarer and much more important: courage."
