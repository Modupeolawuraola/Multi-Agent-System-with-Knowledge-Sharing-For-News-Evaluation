            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nTwo federal judges in separate rulings late Friday froze parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting the law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, both firms linked to the Robert Mueller investigation Trump has sought to punish.\n\nThere have now been direct and separate rebukes by three judges of the Trump administration\u2019s retaliatory policies toward law firms. All three judges have said core constitutional protections are likely violated by the orders \u2013 for people and companies to choose their own attorneys and for firms to be shielded from political retribution because of their speech.\n\nThe temporary restraining order in the Jenner & Block case, announced by Judge John Bates at the end of a hastily scheduled Friday hearing, pauses parts of the order instructing agencies to terminate contracts with the firm and its clients, as well as the order\u2019s directives seeking to limit the firm\u2019s access to federal officials and buildings.\n\nBates said those directives, as well as another he paused aiming to crack down on former Jenner employees being hired for government jobs, were likely unconstitutional because they retaliated against protected speech and were a form of view point discrimination. Language in Trump order\u2019s expressing his desire to sanction the firm for pro bono work for causes the president disagrees with was \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201ctroubling,\u201d Bates said.\n\nThe Jenner & Block hearing began minutes after a different judge in the same courthouse heard a similar request from WilmerHale, which was also targeted by Trump in an executive order issued this week.\n\nJudge Richard Leon issued his order late Friday blocking parts of Trump\u2019s executive order that denied attorneys for the law firm WilmerHale access to federal buildings and retaliated against firm clients with government contracts.\n\nThe measures in the executive order are \u201cthreatening plaintiffs\u2019 very existence,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, and that is qualified as a constitutional harm,\u201d the judge wrote Friday night, a few hours after the hearing.\n\nLeon declined to step into the White House decision to suspend firm lawyers\u2019 security clearances, saying those types of decisions are made by the executive branch.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the court\u2019s swift action to preserve our clients\u2019 right to counsel and acknowledgement of the unconstitutional nature of the executive order and its chilling effect on the legal system. The court\u2019s decision to block key provisions of the order vindicates our and our clients\u2019 foundational First Amendment rights,\u201d the firm said in a statement Friday night.\n\nIn his executive orders, Trump also said he was taking aim at Jenner & Block and WilmerHale because of their work on political causes he disagreed with and because of their ties to the Mueller probe, as both firms previously or currently employed veterans of that investigation.\n\nLeon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, expressed concern at various points in the earlier hearing about how the president\u2019s order could cause some clients to go elsewhere for legal representation if they had concerns with how effectively WilmerHale\u2019s attorneys could provide legal services.\n\nTrump\u2019s order directs federal agencies to suspend the security clearances and access to federal buildings of lawyers for the law firm and to curtail hiring people from the firm. Additionally, it directs agencies to review any contracts they may have with the firm and make efforts to terminate them.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that uncertainty have a chilling effect?\u201d Leon asked DOJ attorney Richard Lawson at one point, adding that the order was \u201clike a sword of Damocles hanging over (the firm\u2019s) head.\u201d\n\nLeon seemed particularly concerned with a section of the executive order that barred the firm from entering government buildings.\n\n\u201cThis is a government building. The Supreme Court is a government building,\u201d Leon pointed out.\n\nWhen Lawson said he couldn\u2019t speak to whether prospective clients of WilmerHale would worry about whether their lawyers could enter courthouses, the judge appeared incredulous.\n\n\u201cHave you practiced law? Have you had clients?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen use your common sense.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, a third judge in the courthouse issued an order temporarily blocking another executive order from Trump that went after the law firm Perkins Coie.\n\nIn court on Friday, Clement told Leon that those three cases \u201care some of the most important cases for the First Amendment and for the rule of law,\u201d adding later that barring certain law firms \u201cis not the tradition in our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf lawyers are looking over their shoulder to decide if they should take the case or if they do, deciding \u2018How do I argue this? Do I walk on eggshells \u2026 or defend my client zealously?\u2019\u201d Clement said.\n\nThis story and headline been upd\ufeffated with additional reporting."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Friday! In today\u2019s edition, we take you behind the scenes of President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden move to withdraw Elise Stefanik\u2019s U.N. ambassador nomination. Plus, Kristen Welker writes that the Signal chat controversy highlights a key dynamic of Trump 2.0.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nInside Trump's shock decision to pull the plug on Elise Stefanik's nomination\n\nBy Garrett Haake, Melanie Zanona and Bridget Bowman\n\nAt a White House event honoring Women\u2019s History Month on Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump took six minutes out of his speech to personally recognize many of the Republican women who were gathered in the audience.\n\nBut one person in attendance that he did not mention was Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who was, at the time, Trump\u2019s nominee to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nThe omission, which several GOP lawmakers took notice of at the time, was all the more conspicuous given that Stefanik\u2019s name was included on the list of women in Trump\u2019s prepared remarks, according to a White House official.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear whether Trump purposely chose to skip Stefanik\u2019s name, less than 24 hours later, the president delivered another public blow to the congresswoman. He announced that he was withdrawing Stefanik\u2019s nomination for the ambassadorship, citing concerns over Republicans\u2019 razor-thin House majority and the prospect of a special election to fill her seat.\n\nThe sudden implosion of Stefanik\u2019s nomination came as a surprise to many Republicans on Capitol Hill, especially given that she sailed out of the committee process earlier this year and would have likely garnered bipartisan support on the Senate floor. Plus, the trickiness of the House GOP\u2019s narrow margins is hardly a new dynamic, with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., warning Trump almost immediately after the November election against plucking members from the House for the new administration.\n\nBut over the last few months, there had been growing anxiety inside the GOP and the White House about the difficulties of governing as they try to pass Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy agenda \u2014 a sentiment that was only further compounded by a special House election next week in Florida.\n\nTrump and Stefanik have spoken multiple times since the announcement, according to a Republican source familiar with the conversations, and the president heaped praise on her from the Oval Office Friday.\n\n\u201cShe is phenomenal, number one. She is a friend of mine. \u2026 But she\u2019s very popular in her district. And I didn\u2019t want to take a chance,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a slim margin. We don\u2019t want to take any chances. We don\u2019t want to experiment.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican leaders are now scrambling to create a new spot on the team for Stefanik, who gave up her No. 4 leadership post in anticipation of her ambassadorship. Those discussions are still underway, according to a GOP leadership source, but anything they come up with will not carry the same weight or power as Stefanik\u2019s previous post, which was an elected leadership position that came with additional staff and resources.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nTrump turns to Supreme Court as judges push back on the administration's view of presidential power\n\nBy Dareh Gregorian and Gary Grumbach\n\nThe Justice Department has now submitted multiple filings with the Supreme Court that accused federal judges of abusing their constitutional powers, while lower courts criticized the Trump administration\u2019s expansive view of presidential power.\n\nThe administration asked the high court to intervene in three cases it argues are hampering President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, including one where it\u2019s been ordered to rehire thousands of dismissed federal workers.\n\nThe latest filing, on Friday, focuses on the administration\u2019s complaints about a judge who temporarily halted deportations under Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th century wartime law. Attorneys argued that the judge overstepped his authority, and complained about the overall number of temporary restraining orders imposed by federal judges as a result of legal challenges to Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda.\n\nThe third case where the administration sought Supreme Court intervention involves hundreds of millions of dollars in education grants that were abruptly canceled by Trump officials. After a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Education Department to temporarily make the payments while the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit proceeds, the administration petitioned the Supreme Court in a filing that argued the justices should \u201cput a swift end to federal district courts\u2019 unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of Executive Branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nVice President JD Vance sharply criticized Denmark and other European allies during his visit to Greenland, as the Trump administration continues to push U.S. ownership of the semi-autonomous territory.\n\nTrump had his first phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, calling it \u201cproductive\u201d in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump called on the House to immediately consider Senate-passed legislation that would \u201cfix\u201d language in the recently passed government spending measure that addresses funding for Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump pardoned Nikola Corp. founder Trevor Milton, for his 2022 conviction of federal crimes related to defrauding investors with false claims about the success of the electric and hydrogen-powered truck maker.\n\nTrump signed an executive order taking aim at the Smithsonian and its museums, education and research centers.\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nTeam Trump\u2019s response to the group chat leak underscores a central tenet of his new administration\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nThe question continues to grip Washington: Will there be any accountability for the stunning realization that senior Trump administration officials sent sensitive military information on a text chain, made public after they accidentally added a journalist?\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg disclosed the revelation Monday that he had been inadvertently added to what appeared to be a small group of high-level Trump officials discussing impending military strikes in Yemen, a discussion the National Security Council has said \u201cappears to be authentic.\u201d\n\nThe White House has closed ranks from the top on down. President Donald Trump and top Cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi have either attacked Goldberg or Democrats. And while national security adviser Michael Walz said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the journalist ending up on the chain, he took to Fox News to not just call Goldberg \u201cscum,\u201d but question whether he \u201cdeliberately\u201d found his way onto the private chat.\n\nAll together, they\u2019re refusing to concede an inch, or acknowledge what appears to many to be a clear mistake \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 by Trump\u2019s national security team.\n\nTrump built his brand as a businessman on a simple phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d And during his first term, he was more than willing to cut ties with Cabinet officials and other key aides who waded into controversy.\n\nBut the decision to dig in embodies this central tenet of Trump\u2019s second term: No matter what hand they draw, Trump and his allies relish the fight.\n\nIt\u2019s why former Trump adviser Steve Bannon argued to me that he views the efforts to investigate the incident as nothing but an attack on Hegseth.\n\n\u201cThey are coming for Pete Hegseth \u2014 they\u2019ve been coming for him since the very first day of his confirmation hearing. All this is a second confirmation hearing of Pete Hegseth. And the MAGA base is 110% backing Hegseth,\u201d Bannon said.\n\n\u201cRight now, the administration should have a \u2018no scalps\u2019 policy,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s why I hope you\u2019ll tune into this Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where we\u2019ll speak exclusively to Goldberg, The Atlantic editor-in-chief at the center of the story. I\u2019ll also hear from Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who leveled fiery criticism at key Trump officials at this week\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate.\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Mailbag: How to decipher early vote numbers\n\nThanks to everyone who emailed us this week! One reader wrote in to ask about the early voting numbers in Florida ahead of next week\u2019s special House elections. (As Bridget Bowman reported, Republicans are nervous about early turnout among Democrats in two solidly red districts.)\n\n\u201cHow usual is it to have election authorities to release reports of parties\u2019 early returns? And is it meaningful, as in, predictive?\u201d\n\nTo answer that, we turned to senior politics editor Scott Bland. Here\u2019s his response:\n\nData on who votes is public record, and keeping track of early turnout by party (in states where voters register with a party) has become a big part of campaigns in recent years. Campaigns and outside groups use this data to make sure, among other things, that they\u2019re targeting their appeals to people who haven\u2019t already voted.\n\nSo the release of this data is very normal. (In fact, NBC News had a tracker in 2024 looking at the early vote before the general election.) The key question is how predictive this data can be, and the unsatisfying answer is that it\u2019s very hard to glean predictive insights from early vote data. Currently, Republicans and Republican-leaning voters tend to turn out more heavily on Election Day, while Democrats and Democratic leaning voters tend to turn out more heavily in early voting. But since we can never know exactly how many people will turn out on Election Day before it happens, it\u2019s hard to know what early turnout means ahead of time.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83e\udda1 Badger State bash: Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, said he would seek a court order to block Elon Musk from awarding million-dollar prizes to people at a weekend event ahead of next week's pivotal state Supreme Court race.

            "full_content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Taxpayer-funded staffers in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 office have been making fundraising calls to state lobbyists, asking them to commit to raise money for a DeSantis-aligned political committee as Casey DeSantis considers a campaign for governor, according to five sources who either received the calls or have direct knowledge of them.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office and the staffers said to have been on the calls denied that they happened. And Casey DeSantis, the governor\u2019s wife, has not yet decided if she will run to succeed him in 2026. But she has openly hinted at the idea, which has increasingly become a point of political intrigue in the state \u2014 and prompted DeSantis\u2019 political operation to try to slow the fundraising pace of Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., who has already announced his bid for governor and received President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a no-brainer for most of us. Of course we will give. He\u2019s the governor,\u201d said one person who said they received a call. Like the others who received or were told about the calls, the person spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity in order to freely discuss the conversations without fear of retribution.\n\n\u201cI mean, my kid has to eat,\u201d the person continued.\n\nWhen asked about the calls, DeSantis\u2019 communications director Bryan Griffin said, \u201cThis is completely untrue and I strongly caution you against publishing such potentially defamatory allegations.\u201d\n\nHe did not respond to follow-up questions about what information he disputed.\n\nNBC News reported earlier this month that DeSantis\u2019 political team was calling state lobbyists and asking them to not give to Donalds, according to seven people familiar with that effort. But over the past week, those efforts have included specific requests for lobbyists to give or raise money for a DeSantis-aligned political committee, which would be able to support Casey DeSantis if she were to run.\n\nAnd unlike the calls previously reported by NBC News, recent calls came from taxpayer-funded staffers in the governor\u2019s office, as opposed to political operatives.\n\nThe calls, four sources told NBC News, were made by the governor\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Anastasios Kamoutsas, and legislative affairs director Peter Cuderman. (The fifth source said they were aware of the calls but did not say who in DeSantis\u2019 office made them.) At least some of the calls were made during what would be considered traditional business hours.\n\nKamoutsas wrote in an email to NBC News: \u201cYou have a bad source, this is false.\u201d Cuderman, also reached by email, wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not sure where the misinformation originated, but such claims are entirely false.\u201d\n\nGiven the degree of control the Florida governor\u2019s office has over how state funds are spent, the use of state employees to help in the raising of campaign money \u2014 whether those people have a formal or informal campaign role \u2014 raises ethical questions about the intermingling of official government business and political efforts. Raising political cash is generally handled by political and campaign staffers who aren\u2019t officially involved in governmental functions.\n\nBut it is not unheard of from the DeSantis political team. During Ron DeSantis\u2019 2024 presidential bid, his then-chief of staff, James Uthmeier, organized a group of top administration officials to try to raise money from state lobbyists. It was seen as unprecedented at the time and caught off-guard many state lobbyists, who generally help finance state-level races but do not regularly give to federal campaigns.\n\nAt the time, Ben Wilcox, co-founder of the nonpartisan government watchdog group Integrity Florida, said using taxpayer-funded staff for political fundraising is out of the ordinary.\n\n\u201cCandidates who are also public officials are supposed to draw a bright line between their campaign and public office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sure looks bad to the taxpaying public.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s election code does prevent a political candidate from using \u201cthe services of any state, county, municipal, or district officer or employee during work hours.\u201d But government employees could volunteer on campaigns during their hours off work.\n\nThis round of calls is going out in the middle of Florida\u2019s two-month legislative session, the period of time when lawmakers meet in Tallahassee to pass legislation and the annual state budget. The process concludes with the governor having veto authority over legislation and line-item veto authority over the state budget, giving Ron DeSantis an ultra-fine degree of control over whether certain projects or initiatives get state funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the calls included them listing our priorities or anything,\u201d said another lobbyist who said they received one of the phone calls. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty clear that that stuff is being watched, and this time the calls were, if you were, coming from inside the house.\u201d\n\nRon DeSantis\u2019 political power over Florida\u2019s political ecosystem, which was once seen as endless, is also now waning. When he ran for president, he was overwhelmingly popular among Republicans in Florida and beyond, and he had significant power over the party, which gave him more sway to earn contributions.\n\nBut now, the governor\u2019s 2024 presidential aspirations are in the rearview mirror, he is a lame duck, and he is engaged in protracted fights with members of his own party who lead the state legislature for the first time in his two terms. That decreased profile, coupled with the fundraising appeals to lobbyists, is breeding annoyance among some who are getting the calls.\n\n\u201cIt seems once again we are supposed to be the political piggy bank,\u201d said another who received one of the calls. \u201cThe same people are the ones who keep being asked to give, and now some of that goodwill just does not exist.\u201d\n\nFederal super PACs that supported her husband\u2019s run for president still have roughly $5 million in the bank, according to campaign finance filings \u2014 money that could give Casey DeSantis an early boost if she decides to run for governor.\n\nBut beyond the shot in the arm Donalds got from an early Trump endorsement, he has quickly stashed away roughly $5 million in his own state political committee, boosted by $1.5 million in transfers from his congressional campaign account and an aligned super PAC, according to campaign finance filings.\n\nIn addition, Donalds has a May fundraiser scheduled at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThere is some hope among DeSantis supporters that Trump may give a dual endorsement, or at the very least not lean in hard publicly supporting Donalds beyond the endorsement, but the fundraiser itself will be a key tell.\n\n\u201cIf Trump is not there, or it\u2019s just a regular event, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d said a veteran Florida GOP fundraiser. \u201cBut if he is there, and gives remarks and praises Byron in front of a room like that, it\u2019s clear where things are headed.\u201d"

Photo: Faith Ninivaggi/Reuters\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Tufts University doctoral student, was leaving her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, on Tuesday to join friends in breaking her Ramadan fast when she was arrested by ICE agents. Video of the agents in masks accosting Ozturk on the street generated a new wave of public outrage just two weeks after the Trump administration sought to deport other pro-Palestinian activists holding green cards and visas.\n\nBy most accounts, Ozturk was not a prominent activist on campus, which has prompted questions as to why she was arrested. Her most significant foray into politics appears to be a jointly written March 2024 op-ed in the student newspaper that urged the university to engage with a student-led push for Tufts to divest from Israel. But the editorial was enough for Ozturk to be highlighted by Canary Mission, a website dedicated to calling out people and organizations it accuses of taking part in antisemitic or anti-Israel behavior by compiling and publishing detailed dossiers on them. (Canary Mission did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nDays after Ozturk\u2019s arrest, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the U.S. had revoked her student visa, linking her case to the administration\u2019s ongoing crackdown on student activism and implying she is a protester. \u201cWe gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. If we\u2019ve given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we\u2019re going to take it away,\u201d he told reporters during a press conference.\n\nOzturk\u2019s lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, has filed a petition in court alongside the ACLU, seeking her immediate release. \u201cR\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s experience is shocking, cruel, and unconstitutional. For nearly 24 hours, we could not locate her, and despite a court order to prevent the government from taking her out of Massachusetts, we finally learned the Trump administration had shipped her to Louisiana,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cCriticizing U.S. foreign policy and human-rights violations is neither illegal nor grounds for detention. The government must immediately release R\u00fcmeysa to continue her studies and rejoin her community.\u201d\n\nSeveral other more prominent activists detained by the Trump administration are similarly profiled on the site. Canary Mission lists Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent resident arrested earlier this month, accusing him of leading \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d protests on campus \u2014 the same rationale the U.S. has used to begin his deportation proceedings. Also featured is Mapheze Saleh, the Palestinian American wife of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University graduate student who was detained. Suri\u2019s lawyer has argued that his client has no criminal record and that his arrest was due to his father-in-law being a former adviser to a Hamas leader, according to the New York Times.\n\nCanary Mission emerged in 2015 with a focus on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement to document \u201cindividuals and organizations that promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews on North American college campuses and beyond.\u201d But the site quickly gained prominence with the rise of on-campus protests after the October 7 attacks on Israel, as it trained its focus on student activists demonstrating against the conflict in Gaza. The group behind the site has been accused of conflating pro-Palestinian activism with hate speech and for doxxing the people it highlights. On Canary Mission, Ozturk\u2019s profile includes a photo of her as well as a description of the region where she lives. The page also features screenshots of the op-ed and her LinkedIn page as well as descriptions of college courses she was slated to teach this year.\n\nAttempts to determine who funds and leads Canary Mission have been notably murky. In 2018, The Forward reported that the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco had donated $100,000 to the cause through its foundation via an Israeli charity called Megamot Shalom. The \u200b\u200bJewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles ended its grants to Megamot Shalom after its ties to Canary Mission were reported. The Nation reports that the charity is run by Jonathan Bash, a British-born resident of Jerusalem who has denied a connection with the organization.\n\nCanary Mission\u2019s work has also been used to detain students in Israel. Lara Alqasem, a Palestinian American graduate student, was barred from entering the country to study at a local university in 2018 because of her past work with the University of Florida\u2019s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. Alqasem\u2019s attorneys said the government\u2019s file on their client was largely based on her profile on Canary Mission\u2019s website, according to the Times. She would later win an appeal to stay in the country.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump is extending his efforts to influence American cultural and artistic institutions to the Smithsonian Institution \u2013 a sprawling organization that encompasses the National Zoo and a collection of museums that anchor tourism in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIn an executive order signed Thursday night, Trump put Vice President JD Vance in charge of stopping government spending on \u201cexhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.\u201d Vance serves on the Smithsonian\u2019s Board of Regents.\n\n\u201cOnce widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\u201d the order reads. \u201cThis shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\u201d\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum complex, including 21 museums and the National Zoo. Nearly 17 million people visited Smithsonian properties last year, according to the museum\u2019s website. Admission at nearly all the museums is free.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Smithsonian Institution for comment.\n\nThe order appears crafted in part to direct the museums to soften or distort forthright discussions about the history and impact of racism in the United States and follows similar orders that seek to exert the president\u2019s will over law firms and educational institutions.\n\nIt also follows his aggressive push to take over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where last month he gutted the board of trustees and was then elected chairman of a newly constituted board.\n\nTrump promised to make the center \u201cgreat\u201d and eliminate programs he doesn\u2019t support, including drag shows.\n\nEarlier this month, the president also signed an order directing the Institution of Museum and Library Services, among several other government entities, to be \u201celiminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\u201d The IMLS supports museums and libraries in all 50 states.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas spoke out against the order on Thursday, saying in an X post, \u201cFirst Trump removes any reference of diversity from the present \u2014 now he\u2019s trying to remove it from our history. Let me be PERFECTLY clear\u2014 you cannot erase our past and you cannot stop us from fulfilling our future.\u201d\n\nIn his order, Trump specifically targeted the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum as carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate.\n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture, the order said, \u201chas proclaimed that \u2018hard work,\u2019 \u2018individualism,\u2019 and \u2018the nuclear family\u2019 are aspects of \u2018White culture.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat portion of the order appears to refer to an educational resource for discussing race released by the museum in 2020, which the museum almost immediately removed and apologized for.\n\nTrump visited the museum during his first term in 2017, just months after it opened to the public, where he vowed to unite a \u201cdivided country\u201d and pledged to do \u201ceverything I can to continue that promise of freedom for African Americans and for every American.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the order may affect the museum\u2019s sprawling exhibits which includes frank discussion about the history of slavery in the Americas.\n\nThe order also criticizes a sculpture exhibit of the Smithsonian American Art Museum examining \u201cthe ways in which sculpture has shaped and reflected attitudes and understandings about race in the United States\u201d and a planned exhibit at the forthcoming American Women\u2019s History Museum which the order said celebrated the contributions of transgender athletes.\n\nThe order further directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to \u201cprovide sufficient funding\u201d to revitalize Independence Hall National Historic Park in Philadelphia, which briefly served as the seat of the federal government and is where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were debated, in preparation for the 250th anniversary of the declaration\u2019s adoption next July 4.\n\nIt also directs Burgum to determine whether any statues or memorials in the Department of the Interior\u2019s jurisdiction have been \u201cremoved or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history\u201d since Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nThough that time period includes the last year of Trump\u2019s first term, it also encompasses the period where several monuments celebrating Confederate officers, conquistadors and colonialists were removed throughout the United States as part of the racial reckoning and public outcry against George Floyd\u2019s murder in the summer of 2020.\n\nBurgum is also directed to ensure memorials \u201cdo not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times),\u201d an edict that could be interpreted to direct the removal of references to slave-owning among America\u2019s earliest Founding Fathers."

            "full_content": "NEW YORK -- Dana White squeezed in a recent workout in New York \u2014 ahead of the launch of his new boxing promotion, just after he struck a YouTube deal for Power Slap, days ahead of the next major UFC pay-per-view card and around the time he celebrated making the cover of Forbes \u2014 when his phone buzzed in the gym from one of his closest confidants, the president.\n\nHours before President Donald Trump addressed Congress, he texted White congratulations on becoming the latest cover boy for the business magazine that labeled the UFC CEO the \u201cPopulist Capitalist.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship dates to UFC\u2019s infancy in White\u2019s reign as he reorganized the company and led its rise into national prominence. Their alliance has yielded dividends for both parties \u2014 White stumped for Trump at Republican conventions while men who soak up fight nights threw their support behind Trump in the elections. It\u2019s that kinship that prompted Trump to text White after the cover was released and even take Forbes to task for publishing the president\u2019s name in the sub-headline.\n\n\u201cYou deserve the cover without having absolutely nothing to do with Trump,\u201d White said, as he read the text exchange to The Associated Press. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be mentioned in the scheme of your tremendous success, so much as mentioned.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but perhaps it's telling that Trump's rise politically mirrors that of UFC's ascendance under White, two men whose style has served as a siren song for a segment of the population yearning for a return to the so-called traditional definition of a virile man, not just in the ring, but in life.\n\nKyle Kusz, a University of Rhode Island professor and author of \u201cRevolt of the White Athlete: Race, Media and the Emergence of Extreme Athletes in America,\u201d said Trump smartly latched onto UFC because White has posited the company as a safe space for \u201cmanly men.\"\n\n\u201cIt kind of embodies the brutal, fight-to-the-finish way of being a man,\u201d Kusz said. \u201cIt seems open to all sorts of men across different social categories, whether that\u2019s class, whether that\u2019s ethnicity, whether that\u2019s race. It\u2019s also open to women who are willing to be all-in on that way of thinking. Trump is cultivating that way of being to essentially train the population to fight for his reign.\u201d\n\nWhite was grateful in his text reply to Trump, writing, \u201cWhen they mention tribal business model, it\u2019s really about loyalty and friendship, which is something people these days know nothing about. You and I are the poster boys for loyalty. Thank you for the kind words, Mr. President. But I have no problem being mentioned with you in any shape or form.\"\n\nYes, that\u2019s right, White calls his long-time friend and former business associate from the days when Boardwalk cards at Trump Taj Mahal lifted UFC into relevancy, Mr. President.\n\n\u201cI called him Don before he became President,\u201d White said, laughing. \u201cNow that he became President, I call him Mr. President.\u201d\n\nNow, White, already the king of combat sports, may soon be called the final boss in boxing.\n\nTKO Group, the company that already houses WWE and UFC, entered into a partnership with Saudi Arabian businessmen to form the new, yet unnamed boxing venture that could provide the jolt of cash, infrastructure, and organized leadership the sport needs. TKO will serve as managing partner and run the day-to-day operations of the promotion expected to run its first card next year, but details are scarce beyond the initial announcement.\n\nThe league needs a name \u2014 TKO is literally the low-hanging fruit there for the taking \u2014 a roster and a rights deal.\n\nGiven the business acumen of the parties involved, and the hefty Saudi bankroll, those issues seem easily solvable and White\u2019s input might be enough to prop boxing out of its niche status and into a mainstream sports player. Boxing retreated from the public sports consciousness in part because White and UFC exploited its inherent messiness to create a more coherent fight organization.\n\nIt was WWE president and TKO board member Nick Khan who introduced White to Turki Alalshikh, chairman of the Saudi General Entertainment Authority, about 18 months ago to discuss collaborating on a boxing league. White had toyed with the idea of starting a boxing promotion and trying to fix a sport many believe long broken because of everything from corruption to decaying interest in the United States to the alphabet soup sanctioning bodies refusing to play nice and book the best fights.\n\nThe 55-year-old White hit it off with Alalshikh and Saudi Arabia was eager to add to its sports portfolio.\n\nThe Saudis host a Formula 1 auto race, fund LIV Golf, have hosted numerous pay-per-view boxing cards \u2014 topped by Tyson Fury\u2019s win over Francis Ngannou in October 2023 \u2014 are in the midst of a 10-year deal to hold WWE events and will host the 2034 World Cup in men\u2019s soccer, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet in its sports expansion.\n\nEach marquee event only seems to push accusations against Saudi Arabia of \u201csportswashing,\u201d an effort to rebrand a nation\u2019s troubling public image that has been going on for decades, using the Olympics and other sports across the globe, further into the background. Endeavor (the majority owner of TKO) and CEO Ari Emanuel returned a $400 million investment from the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund in 2019 after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nNow, TKO is working with, among others, Sela, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. The Saudis will fund the league, while TKO will run it.\n\n\u201cSo far, it\u2019s been a great relationship,\u201d White said. \u201cI have to be aligned. I have to feel good about the relationship and these guys have kept their world and did everything they said they would do. Anything that happened with Saudi, pre-my deal, I didn\u2019t have a relationship, I wasn\u2019t with them.\u201d\n\nWhite and TKO have the tools to turn the company into a winner.\n\nWhite \u2014 whom Forbes estimated to have a personal net worth north of $600 million \u2014 has cashed in on the current political climate and an audience that embraces the extreme no-excuses ideological masculinity that ushered Trump into the White House. Trump has leaned on UFC fights as both testosterone-charged campaign rallies and election celebrations and White and his fighters have come along for the ride.\n\n\u201cA lot of the ways in which Trump wants to change culture, and to win at politics, he can express through connecting himself through sport, like UFC, because it does kind of promote manly man who are willing to be strong, be aggressive who are willing to fight for their side,\u201d Kusz said.\n\nMuch like loyalists seemed to tune out impeachment charges against Trump or even his conviction on 34 felony counts in his historic hush money trial, the murky ethos of being bad has never been so good inside UFC. UFC fighters can seemingly act however they want and say whatever they want \u2014 see fighter Bryce Mitchell\u2019s recent defense of Adolph Hitler or Conor McGregor\u2019s order by a civil jury to pay $250,000 to a woman who says he raped her \u2014 without any significant consequence levied by the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight business, man,\u201d White said. \u201cAnd then when you talk about races, religions, whatever you are, whoever you are, that\u2019s what I\u2019m selling. This is the fight business. At the end of the day, get over it. And if you can\u2019t get over it, here\u2019s my solution to you, don\u2019t watch it.\u201d\n\nIn American sports leagues, Mitchell and McGregor would have faced lengthy suspensions or more severe consequences for their actions, the kind of punishments White \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t even sanction himself for an incident with his wife \u2014 no longer worries about dishing out.\n\n\u201cWe went through that early on, figuring out where we fit, who we were and all that stuff.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe State Department on Friday formally notified Congress it is effectively dissolving the US Agency for International Development and moving some of its functions under the department.\n\nThe reorganization will be done by July 1, the State Department said, sounding a death knell for USAID, a multibillion-dollar agency that fought poverty and hunger around the world.\n\nThe shuttering of an agency established by Congress without the legislative branch weighing in is expected to draw legal challenges.\n\nThe Trump administration has accused USAID of mismanaging taxpayer dollars and funding overseas programs that aren\u2019t in US interests. Current and former USAID employees and aid experts have countered that the agency, while imperfect, meets vital humanitarian needs and bolsters America\u2019s soft power.\n\nIn its first weeks in office, the Trump administration moved to dismantle USAID and freeze almost all foreign assistance, pending a review of those programs. Since then, thousands of USAID employees have been fired or put on leave and billions of dollars in aid contracts have been canceled. Less than 900 USAID employees remained on the job as of last week, according to another notice from the agency to Congress.\n\nThe slashing of the agency brought lawsuits from aid groups and USAID employees, some of whom described harrowing journeys home from overseas for which they weren\u2019t reimbursed.\n\nLater on Friday, a federal appeals court greenlit, for now, the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the agency.\n\nThree judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals were unanimous in the decision, which notes that the courts could ultimately decide to reverse the agency\u2019s unwinding but won\u2019t at this time.\n\nUSAID was a major initial target of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which is cutting thousands of jobs and programs across the entirety of the federal government.\n\nIn a note to the remaining USAID employees obtained by CNN, Jeremy Lewin, a DOGE liaison who is a senior official at USAID, said the move would \u201csignificantly enhance efficiency, accountability, uniformity, and strategic impact in delivering foreign assistance programs \u2013 allowing our nation and President to speak with one voice in foreign affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstantially all non-statutory positions at USAID will be eliminated\u201d as part of the restructuring, Lewin said, and USAID employees will begin getting \u201creduction-in-force\u201d notices on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn the next three months, we will work closely with the State Department to build their capacities to assume the responsible administration of USAID\u2019s remaining life-saving and strategic aid programming,\u201d Lewin said.\n\nThe USAID programs that are being allowed to continue under the State Department involve \u201chumanitarian assistance, global health functions, strategic investment, and limited national security programs,\u201d according to USAID\u2019s notification to Congress, obtained by CNN. The development work done by USAID\u2019s regional bureaus around the world are set to be folded into the State Department\u2019s corresponding regional bureaus, the notice said.\n\n\u201cOther functions are likely to be substantially duplicative of existing functions and capabilities at the Department, and would be eliminated in the restructuring plan,\u201d the notice said.\n\nThere has been substantial resistance to the shuttering of USAID from senior career officials.\n\nA top USAID was put on leave after issuing a scathing memo blaming Trump political appointees for the US government\u2019s inability to conduct lifesaving humanitarian work."

            "full_content": "Photo: Nathan Posner/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nOver the past nine years, Elise Stefanik transformed herself from a Donald Trump critic into one of the president\u2019s biggest cheerleaders. Her exemplary MAGA shilling was finally rewarded in November, when Trump announced that Stefanik would serve in his Cabinet as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik gave up her House leadership position, sailed through her confirmation hearing, and was expected to be confirmed any day now \u2014 then on Thursday, her nomination was pulled because Republicans just realized they may need her vote to maintain their House majority.\n\nSo no one could blame Elise Stefanik if she wanted to spend Thursday evening sulking. But instead, she had to go on Fox News and claim she\u2019s not just okay with losing her dream job, she\u2019s actually delighted to sacrifice herself for the MAGA cause.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I was honored to have earned that nomination by President Trump, and I\u2019m proud to be one of his top allies on Capitol Hill,\u201d Stefanik told host Kayleigh McEnany on Hannity. \u201cI have been proud to be a team player. The president knows that.\u201d\n\nSo why was Stefanik\u2019s nomination pulled at the last minute? The congresswoman made it clear that she did absolutely nothing wrong. \u201cAs you know, Kayleigh, I had my hearing the day after the inauguration, the hearing went incredibly smoothly, it passed by voice, and there\u2019s been universal praise for the nomination,\u201d Stefanik explained.\n\nOf course, Stefanik doesn\u2019t blame Trump\u2019s decision to appoint several House members to his Cabinet despite the party\u2019s fragile majority or concerns that Republicans could lose the upcoming special elections in Florida. Instead, she pointed a finger at \u201ccorrupt\u201d New York governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s threat to delay the special election to fill her seat and the \u201cpoliticized radical left\u201d more generally.\n\nBut Stefanik tried to end on a positive note: \u201cThe good news, Kayleigh, is because I am not pending confirmation, the American people will be hearing a lot more from me.\u201d The congresswoman said she\u2019s excited to have more time for Fox News hits and being one of the president\u2019s \u201ctop fighters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI consider him a friend,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a leader in the House\u201d \u2014 perhaps not literally, as her leadership position has already been filled, but \u201cin terms of one of his top allies, and that will continue to be the case.\u201d\n\nMcEnany closed by reinforcing Stefanik\u2019s framing of her un-appointment as a heroic example of MAGA sacrifice. \u201cWell, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, you\u2019re being praised as a selfless warrior, and I look very much forward to seeing what the bight future holds for you,\u201d she said.\n\nWill Stefanik ever get a promotion for all this groveling? Maybe not. But being a Trump sycophant is reward in itself."

            "full_content": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump with a Tesla at the White House. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, the FBI announced a new task force to crack down on what Elon Musk has described as \u201cevil attacks\u201d against Tesla vehicles and facilities. \u201cThis is domestic terrorism,\u201d director Kash Patel wrote of the more than 80 instances of vandalism, arson, and gunfire that have targeted Musk\u2019s signature cars since January. Patel was joining a chorus of such statements from Trump officials. On March 20, Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to use the full force of the Justice Department against anyone who joined \u201cthis wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties.\u201d On March 21, the FBI urged the public to \u201cto look out for suspicious activity\u201d around Tesla-related buildings. And during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, Bondi accused Texas congresswoman Jasmine Crockett of \u201cpromoting violence\u201d for telling a virtual gathering of Tesla boycotters that she wanted \u201cElon to be taken down,\u201d even though it was clear she was referring to his money.\n\nThe car attacks, while not legal, have not physically harmed anyone \u2014 usually a component of what we think of as a terrorist attack. But because \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d is so loosely defined under federal law, Trump and Musk have been able to manipulate it to serve their ends. By expanding the definition to encompass everything from graffiti to partisan speech, the administration has recast what have typically been misdemeanors and First Amendment activity as 9/11-in-miniature. And they are not the first to do so: Trump & Co. are borrowing from a playbook that has already allowed local municipalities to charge people who have not injured anyone with terrorist offenses \u2014 a chilling portent for everyday Americans who have so far been spared from Trump\u2019s weaponization of the justice system.\n\nIn 2018, after years of protests and riots linked to the Black Lives Matter movement, Republicans in Georgia were eager for new ways to criminalize protests more easily. They passed a law expanding the legal definition of domestic terrorism to include damaging certain types of property. All of a sudden, breaking a window near a political demonstration \u2014 which in the past would have earned a \u201ccriminal damage to property\u201d charge or something similar, according to civil-rights attorney Tiffany Roberts \u2014 could be prosecuted as terrorism. Furthermore, the legal dragnet was widened so that even someone in the vicinity of politically coded property destruction could be labeled a terrorist, too.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened in 2021, when activists from around the world converged on the region to stop a proposed police training facility dubbed Cop City. Amid the ensuing clashes, protesters threw rocks at cops and set fire to construction equipment \u2014 providing local authorities with the perfect opportunity to trial-balloon Georgia\u2019s new anti-terrorism law. By Christmas 2022, cops had arrested five people for alleged domestic terrorism. \u201cWhy is an individual from Los Angeles, California, concerned about a training facility being built in the state of Georgia?\u201d asked the assistant chief of the Atlanta Police Department at the time. \u201cAnd that is why we consider that domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nAtlanta has since become a laboratory for manufacturing alleged terrorists who do not actually terrorize. When militants set fire to more construction equipment, cops simply began arresting whoever was in the general area, claiming that anyone with mud on their shoes was probably fleeing and therefore guilty. This round of arrests \u2014 carried out by Democratic-run law-enforcement agencies, it is worth noting \u2014 formed the basis for the massive, 42-defendant domestic-terrorism indictment filed by Georgia\u2019s Republican attorney general that September, which is still pending to this day.\n\nThe influence of Georgia Republicans is all over the Trump administration\u2019s modus operandi. You can scarcely throw a rock at a gathering of progressives these days without hitting a supposed terrorist. Even though federal law does not allow the Department of Justice to charge people with domestic terrorism specifically, the law is already being contorted to justify arresting and deporting noncitizen activists for exercising their free-speech rights, such as Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestine green-card holder about whom Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar told NPR, \u201cIf he would have declared he\u2019s a terrorist, we would have never let him in.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s list of alleged terrorists seems likely to keep growing \u2014 as with the Tuesday addition of Ruymesa Ozturk, a Tufts University graduate student who wrote a pro-Palestine op-ed and is now being held in ICE custody for \u201cglorifying and supporting terrorism,\u201d according to a DHS spokesperson. Similarly, as an act of acquiescence to Trump, Washington, D.C., is considering charging alleged Tesla vandals with hate crimes.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration has been silent about more recognizable acts of terrorism that align with Trump\u2019s ideological goals. According to Joan Donovan, an organizer of the Tesla Takedown movement, \u201cMusk has developed his own private army of networked harassers, who are calling me a domestic terrorist for picketing Tesla.\u201d The tenor of this picketing is anything but terroristic. Many of the protesters appear to be retirees who are eager to recapture the energy of the heyday of the resistance. But that is not how Trumpists are being trained to see them. The insistence that they are domestic terrorists is the sort of blanket propagandizing impressionable Trump supporters can be trusted to act on.\n\nSure enough, on Saturday, shortly after the FBI issued its warning about subversive activities near Tesla facilities, a group of about 100 protesters from the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Palm Beach County, Florida, was picketing on the sidewalk outside a local Tesla dealership when a man driving a black Nissan SUV drove by and started screaming at them. Suddenly, the driver jumped the curb, forcing several protesters to move out of his way to avoid being hit \u2014 an act of intimidation that called to mind recent vehicular terrorist attacks, like the one in New Orleans on January 1.\n\nThe 44-year-old driver, Andrew Dutil, reportedly exited the vehicle and walked into the dealership, where, one of the employees later told investigators, he announced that he \u201csupports Tesla\u201d and left. Dutil was arrested by local sheriff\u2019s deputies and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. But one of the looming crises of the Trump era is that it is not totally clear, between Dutil and the picketers, who is more likely to be considered a terrorist."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk was speaking to Tesla staff in Austin, Texas, last Thursday when he admitted: \u201cI\u2019m stretched pretty thin. I have like 17 jobs.\u201d\n\nThe meeting seemed hastily arranged. Employees were notified shortly before the event, which was scheduled for 9:30 pm, Business Insider reported. Never before had a Tesla all-hands meeting been live-streamed the way this one was.\n\nIt may have been the first time some Tesla employees had seen their CEO in weeks, as Musk has been spending more time in Washington, DC, working with his new Department of Government Efficiency. The political focus signals a big change for Musk, who has been known to be intimately involved at his companies, even sleeping at Tesla factories or X\u2019s offices during pivotal moments.\n\nAlthough Tesla\u2019s stocks rallied after the Thursday meeting, investors are increasingly calling for Musk to shift gears as the car maker faces a brand crisis \u2014 fueled in part by his politics and involvement in the Trump administration. Tesla sales and stock have been rocked as dealerships, and individual cars have been attacked and vandalized. Prices for used Teslas have plummeted, and Tesla had to recall most of its Cybertrucks in the US because of a problem with its exterior panel.\n\nInvestors worry that Musk\u2019s absence could impact the company\u2019s decision-making at such a critical time.\n\n\u201cThe point is, this has turned into a tornado that only one person could resolve: It\u2019s Elon,\u201d said Dan Ives, a top analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who has publicly called for Musk to return to the EV maker.\n\nWhere has Musk been?\n\nMusk addressed the attacks and vandalism targeting Tesla during last week\u2019s all hands, noting it sometimes \u201cfeels like Armageddon\u201d when he watches coverage of them on TV. Those attacking Tesla are \u201cbeing psycho,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere are times when there are rocky moments, a little bit of stormy weather,\u201d he told employees while encouraging them to \u201chold on\u201d to their stock.\n\n\u201cBut what I\u2019m here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting, and we\u2019re going to do things that no one I think has even dreamed of,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut judging by his public appearances, Musk\u2019s focus has been on his DOGE duties and ties to the Trump administration.\n\nOver the last few weeks Musk has often been seen in Washington or accompanying President Donald Trump, even on the weekends. He made a cameo alongside Trump at a professional golfer\u2019s wedding over the weekend of March 15 at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, for example. Last weekend, Musk tagged along with the president to watch the NCAA Division I wrestling championship in Philadelphia. On Monday, he was sitting at the table during Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Elon Musk attend the NCAA Division I wrestling championship on March 22 in Philadelphia. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nFlight-tracking data for planes associated with Musk largely align with his latest public appearances. But one of Musk\u2019s planes flew to San Jose, California, where many of his companies have major offices, on Tuesday. It flew back to Washington, DC, on Thursday, the same day an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier aired.\n\nHowever, the data doesn\u2019t show whether Musk was on the flight, so tracking his aircrafts isn\u2019t a foolproof method of learning his whereabouts.\n\nStill, the time spent away from Tesla is not sitting well with investors.\n\n\u201cNo one, including us, expected that he would dive so deep into the end of the pool with DOGE (and the) Trump administration, and it would be occupying 110% of his time,\u201d said Ives.\n\nBut Ives said he believes it\u2019s only a matter of time before Musk restores his focus to Tesla, as the all-hands meeting signaled.\n\n\u201cI think there was a groundswell from investors and employees, and he read the room,\u201d Ives said. \u201cThat was a big first step. Now the question is, does he take a step back with DOGE?\u201d\n\n\u2018Decision paralysis\u2019 at Tesla\n\nMusk has never installed a CEO at Tesla like he has at SpaceX or X, because \u201cTesla is his baby,\u201d Ives said. \u201cMusk is Tesla, and Telsa is Musk.\u201d But that\u2019s hampering decision making, Ives said.\n\nTesla did not return a request for comment.\n\nRoss Gerber, a major Tesla investor and co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki wealth management, said Musk\u2019s absence can \u201ccreate a culture where no one is comfortable making a decision\u201d at the company.\n\nTesla executives making higher-level decisions are at risk of getting fired over making a call that Musk may not agree with, according to Gerber, leading to \u201cdecision paralysis.\u201d\n\nA Tesla model Y and other Telsla vehicles sit at a dealership on March 19 in Kennesaw, Georgia. Mike Stewart/AP\n\nMusk is known for taking a hands-on approach to managing his companies, especially Tesla, whose factories he\u2019s said he lived in \u201cfor three years straight.\u201d His dedication continued even after Tesla achieved widespread success; for example, biographer Walter Isaacson wrote in 2023 that Musk would regularly visit Tesla\u2019s Palo Alto office and have impromptu discussions with engineers working on Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature.\n\nAlthough Gerber said he believes \u201cElon is the most suited person to run Tesla,\u201d he says it\u2019s time to pass the reins to save the company.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not coming back to Tesla. He has just moved on,\u201d Gerber claimed. \u201cHe has a much bigger role, and in his mind, (he\u2019s) saving the world now.\u201d"

            "full_content": "This isn\u2019t a joke, unfortunately. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Illustration: @WhiteHouse/X\n\nThere\u2019s understandably a lot of talk in the air about significant numbers of 2024 Trump voters feeling some buyer\u2019s remorse as the 47th president\u2019s actual agenda unfolds. Those who backed him because they wanted a return to economic normalcy, for example, are not going to be very happy with the price-inflating trade war he has launched or the public-sector austerity program he has undertaken to the detriment of popular federal programs and benefits. And swing voters surely did not think they were electing a dictator. Yet it is increasingly clear that Trump\u2019s key advisers think of him exactly that way.\n\nTo some extent, people paying close attention knew that Team Trump had radical ideas about presidential power over the executive branch, as reflected in the \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory common among so-called conservatives these days. This theory holds that the president should have total control of federal-agency operations, even in cases where Congress has endowed agencies with independent status. But Trump 2.0 has already gone far beyond the executive branch in its claims of presidential authority, trampling the Constitutionally established powers of the legislative branch and now threatening the judicial branch as well. The former power grab is exemplified by DOGE\u2019s reign of terror over the federal bureaucracy, threatening its ability to discharge its statutorily established responsibilities, and also by OMB Director Russell Vought\u2019s belief in a virtually unlimited presidential right to \u201cimpound\u201d (i.e., refuse to expend) congressional appropriations in defiance of Article I\u2019s clear grant of the spending power to the national legislature. The latter is implicit in the ever-growing threats being issued by Trump and his supporters to federal judges who have the temerity to exercise the judicial-review authority they\u2019ve enjoyed since 1803, when Marbury v. Madison was handed down.\n\nBut if you listen closely to some of Trump\u2019s most important advisers, we may not have seen anything just yet: they recognize virtually no limits to presidential authority, based on the dangerously exotic idea that he was elected to carry out a literal revolution against the established order of things. Here\u2019s how White House policy director Stephen Miller put it last month in what Fox News described as a \u201ccivics lesson:\u201d\n\nA president is elected by the whole American people. He\u2019s the only official in the entire government that is elected by the entire nation, right? Judges are appointed. Members of Congress are elected at the district or state level. The Constitution, Article II has a clause known as the Vesting Clause. And it says the executive power shall be vested in a president, singular. The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president. That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government.\n\nAside from Miller\u2019s self-serving view that he, himself, is empowered to \u201cimpose the democratic will\u201d on the entire federal government, the idea that the 49.9 percent of the electorate who voted for a particular presidential candidate intended (and are entitled!) to give him unlimited power is very much unprecedented. No wonder the people around the president have gone to such laughable lengths to exaggerate the size of his election victory and his alleged \u201cmandate.\u201d It should take a lot of votes to authorize a dictatorship.\n\nMiller is hardly alone in believing Trump 2.0 represents something of an elected dictatorship. OMB\u2019s Russ Vought, who occupies what he has called the \u201cnerve center\u201d of the federal government, has long argued that we are in a \u201cpost-constitutional\u201d era in which drastic presidential measures are necessary to restore the limited government envisioned by the Founders. In an extensive review of Vought\u2019s public utterances (particularly a 2022 essay he penned for The American Mind, the online publication of the notoriously radical Claremont Institute), Georgetown professor Thomas Zimmer sums up Vought\u2019s rationale for a massive expansion of presidential power:\n\nVought is convinced that America is facing an existential threat \u2013 a situation he has likened to 1776 and 1860: (Counter-) Revolution and total war, that is what America must face if it is to survive. What gives Vought hope is his devotion to Donald Trump, \u201cuniquely positioned to serve this role\u201d as the leader of such a revolutionary counter-offensive against the evil forces of \u201cunnatural\u201d leftism. Literally, in Vought\u2019s words, \u201ca gift of God.\u201d\n\nIt must seem like a \u201cgift of God\u201d to those who want a counterrevolutionary dictator that someone like Trump arrived on the scene. It\u2019s not every year, or even every century, that you get a leader whose supreme narcissism stands out starkly in the narcissistic world of politics, and who openly claims that \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law\u201d and believes that Article II of the Constitution gives him \u201cthe right to do whatever I want as president.\u201d Trump is the perfect vehicle for the authoritarians he has attracted to his banner.\n\nFrom that perspective, all the high-speed norm-shattering power grabs we\u2019ve seen in the past nine weeks make terrifying sense. As New York Times columnist and old-school conservative David French observes, the judiciary that Team Trump is clearly contemplating a collision with is the last barrier to total power:\n\nTrumpists are ultimately hoping to replace the separation of powers with executive primacy, but if they hope to swallow the other branches, they\u2019re right to identify the judiciary as their primary foe. Republicans in Congress exist to serve Trump. But the judiciary knows its role.\n\n\u201cThe primary protection of individual liberty in our constitutional system comes from the separation of powers in the Constitution,\u201d Brett Kavanaugh, argued in a speech at Notre Dame before his appointment to the Supreme Court, \u201cthe separation of the power to legislate from the power to enforce from the power to adjudicate.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope Kavanaugh remembers that when the administration\u2019s claims of total power reach the Supreme Court."

            "full_content": "Illustration: Tim Bouckley\n\nThey call him an opportunist and a vulture who\u2019s capitalizing on a tragedy to promote his dangerous Medicare for All agenda. Over and over, they invoke his name alongside those of left-wingers the likes of Bernie Sanders. For the target of these attacks, Wendell Potter, it\u2019s a familiar playbook \u2014 after all, he helped write it.\n\n\u201cI guess I should be flattered,\u201d he jokes.\n\nPotter is the nation\u2019s most prominent health-care whistleblower, a former Cigna executive who dramatically called out his old employer in front of a Senate committee almost two decades ago. Since the December killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Potter has also been the go-to expert mainstream media outlets have relied upon to help explain how insurance companies screw over patients. (Ammunition used to kill Thompson was pointedly inscribed with the words delay, deny, and depose, terms insurers use to deny prior authorization for treatments.) The attacks against Potter started just as soon \u2014 and bear all the hallmarks, he says, of remarkably similar spin operations he facilitated as a communications executive when hiring PR firms to place op-eds parroting industry talking points in outlets nationwide.\n\nSince walking away from the industry, Potter has waged a relentless, sometimes lonely campaign against for-profit insurance companies through media appearances, books, a newsletter, and Capitol Hill lobbying. Now 73, he\u2019s something of a guiding figure for a loose network of former health-insurance executives trying to atone. United by their desire to rein in the behemoth insurers, all are fighting their own overlapping battles \u2014 whether helping doctors wrangle with the companies or advocating for single-payer health care. Even as chaos reigns in Washington, D.C., they\u2019re hopeful the current outrage toward insurers just might provide momentum for a few crucial changes.\n\nIn their collective decades of work across the health-care sector, each of the four former executives I spoke to for this story, including Potter, arrived at the same conclusion: Patients\u2019 needs are fundamentally at odds with insurers\u2019 financial incentives and the ever-growing demands of Wall Street. \u201cHealth care is a weird thing where you don\u2019t want the customer to use your product,\u201d as one put it. All described stomach-churning encounters with greed that prompted them not only to leave the country\u2019s for-profit health-insurance industry but to question its premise.\n\nPatients are \u201cthe least important stakeholders\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Potter had never been more powerful as an executive, or more conflicted. Having spent the previous two decades climbing the industry ranks at Humana, then Cigna, he had grown uneasy with insurers\u2019 offsetting more and more costs onto patients. A series of events that year sent him over the edge. His mission involved undermining director Michael Moore, who was about to release his documentary Sicko criticizing the U.S. health-care system. Potter took his son along to an early screening in Michigan; his son was so taken with the film that he asked Moore to sign a poster, but Potter himself was preparing to smear the documentary as socialist propaganda. \u201cThe objective,\u201d he says, \u201cwas to get people to think Moore was outside the mainstream of American politics and was trying to sell us on a government-controlled health-care system.\u201d\n\nPotter soon decided on a whim to visit a free medical clinic at a fairground in Wise, Virginia, after seeing an ad for it in the newspaper. When he arrived, he saw hundreds of people waiting on line to get free medical care from doctors working out of animal stalls. Some of the patients had health insurance but simply lacked the money to cover the out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAt the end of that year, he reached his breaking point when Cigna denied prior authorization to pay for a liver transplant for Nataline Sarkisyan, a 17-year-old girl with leukemia. As with any crisis the company faced, Potter found himself fielding calls 24/7, trying to keep Cigna\u2019s reputation and stock price intact even as the standoff intensified into a national news story. The insurer eventually caved to the pressure, but the reversal came too late \u2014 Sarkisyan died within hours. Rattled, Potter later wrote, \u201cI simply didn\u2019t have it in me to handle the PR around another case like Nataline\u2019s.\u201d\n\nA few months later, Potter resigned and took some time off to gather his thoughts, reemerging in 2009 amid the Affordable Care Act debate to testify about how Wall Street\u2019s influence dictated insurers\u2019 coverage decisions. A professional communicator, Potter was uniquely qualified to handle the attention that comes with whistleblowing, deftly leaning into the role of a guilt-ridden executive who made it to the top only to realize in a fit of conscience that the whole system had to go.\n\nNine days after the UnitedHealthcare shooting, while suspected killer Luigi Mangione was being memed to folk-hero status, I asked Potter, \u201cIf you were running comms at UnitedHealthcare right now, what would you do?\u201d He proceeded to describe the steps the insurer\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group, has since taken: No interviews with reporters except in the friendliest of circumstances. Write an op-ed for CEO Andrew Witty in the New York Times acknowledging that this is a difficult business but that the company will work to do right by Americans. Give lobbyists talking points to assuage Congress, and give account representatives separate talking points to placate employer customers who may be facing calls from their workers to switch providers. And of course, send out Witty to comfort anxious shareholders. \u201cI\u2019ll assure you,\u201d Potter says, \u201cthat the least important stakeholders are the people who are enrolled in their health plans. They\u2019re at the bottom of the pile.\u201d\n\n\u201cExecute a few hostages\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from college in 1987, Ron Howrigon answered a help-wanted ad in the Sunday paper for a job at Kaiser Permanente, figuring a career in health care would make him a force for good in the world. Later, he made the leap to Cigna, where his specialty was negotiating payment rates with doctors and other providers, aiming to pay them as little as possible. In the early aughts, an order came down from his boss, Mark Bertolini, a major insurance-world figure who later became CEO of Aetna. According to Howrigon, Bertolini had decided Cigna was seen as too physician friendly, so Howrigon and his colleagues would need to drop 10 percent of the providers they contracted with from the insurer\u2019s network. After some debate, they talked Bertolini down to one percent, and Howrigon cracked a dark joke: Why not cut costs by specifically targeting cardiologists and other vital but expensive specialists? He says Bertolini responded with a straight face and said he was onto something.\n\n\u201cI got this feeling in the pit of my stomach,\u201d Howrigon says. \u201cLike, My God, we\u2019re going to terminate doctors out of network just to show \u2019em who\u2019s boss, and we\u2019re going to pick the doctors whose patients need them most.\u201d According to Howrigon, Bertolini said they needed to \u201cexecute a few hostages.\u201d He went through with it and kicked 150 doctors out of network without cause. (Bertolini, who now runs the insurance provider Oscar Health and has cast himself as an advocate for health-care reform and a progressive, yoga-doing figure in the industry, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIt was clear to Howrigon that the profit motive meant the only way these insurance companies could satisfy shareholders was to \u201cscrew the people who need your product.\u201d Hoping it would be different in the nonprofit sector, he took a job with a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in Pennsylvania \u2014 only to find that it prioritized generating revenue as much as the for-profit plans did. Shortly after his employer cut payment rates to obstetricians, Howrigon\u2019s wife had a successful C-section. Before he was even out of the operating room, his wife\u2019s obstetrician told him, \u201cNext time you take money out of a doctor\u2019s pocket, remember today because I\u2019m the one who was here.\u201d That, Howrigon says, was his rock bottom.\n\nHe secretly used his paternity leave to devise an exit strategy. \u201cI\u2019d be much richer,\u201d he says, if he had simply stayed put. \u201cBut it was making me into a person I didn\u2019t like.\u201d Howrigon now calls himself a \u201crecovering managed-care executive\u201d and works on the opposite side of the table, helping doctors negotiate higher reimbursement rates from insurers. In the process, he has run up against a hardball form of retribution from Cigna. After his business started having success in securing higher rates for doctors, Cigna gave some of his clients an ultimatum: Drop Howrigon or we\u2019re kicking you out of network. In response, two clients said they would sooner terminate their contracts with Cigna than with Howrigon. The insurer backed off but still refuses to communicate with him directly. Now, when he negotiates contracts with Cigna, Howrigon says he has to play a \u201cchildish game\u201d in which he emails messages to his clients, who then forward them to the insurance giant. \u201cThey won\u2019t talk to me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re holding a 20-year grudge that I left.\u201d (Cigna did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nEven now, Howrigon says one of his friends, a medical director at a big insurer, won\u2019t be seen with him in public. \u201cWhat\u2019s that old saying?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Am I paranoid?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Am I paranoid enough?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can we do to make him not want to come in?\u201d\n\nSeveral of the former executives I spoke with expressed fear of being corrupted on a personal level by working in a business that juices its profits partly by withholding care from its customers. Ed Weisbart went into medicine in the 1970s because he believed in the then-nascent idea of HMOs \u2014 self-contained insurance networks intended to keep patients\u2019 costs down by incentivizing doctors to keep them healthy with preventative care rather than saving the payouts for when patients got sick. He began to lose faith in that model after serving as the chief medical officer of an HMO outfit in Chicago in the \u201990s. One of its medical offices was humming along, he says, getting good outcomes for patients and earning a tidy profit, when a policyholder got in a car crash and discovered he had hemophilia. The infusions needed to treat the blood-clotting disorder would cost about $1 million a year, enough to flip the entire operation into the red. Weisbart began to have disturbing thoughts.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, What can we do to make him not want to come in? We could not answer the phone if we know it\u2019s him. We could make him wait an hour or two to be seen,\u201d he says, imagining he could declare victory once the patient gave up and found a new provider. Though the patient ultimately did receive treatment, Weisbart says, that is the kind of thinking the for-profit health-insurance business rewards: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happens in managed care all over the place.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Weisbart took a job with Express Scripts, the massive pharmaceutical-benefits manager, and quickly ran into similarly warped financial incentives. At the time, statins were a popular treatment for preventing heart attacks, but Weisbart couldn\u2019t sell insurance companies on the idea of paying for the drugs because the preventative benefits worked on too long a timeframe \u2014 why should insurers pay for a treatment when their policyholders were likely to switch providers by the time they started seeing any benefits? Why pass those savings along to a competitor? Rather than producing the best results through competition, Weisbart says, the country\u2019s fragmented insurance system just creates perverse business incentives: \u201cA robust public-health solution would be counterproductive for most insurance companies. That got me very disturbed, and it made me think, What am I doing here?\u201d\n\nA few years later, as the industry was working to undermine public support for the Affordable Care Act, he says the Express Scripts CEO asked him to put together a PowerPoint presentation on why health-care reform was unnecessary. Weisbart said \u201cno\u201d \u2014 not something he was in the habit of saying to the C-suite. \u201cI thought, Well, shoot, I am really on the wrong side of this dance card, and I can\u2019t keep putting my skills, such as they are, into supporting this really wrong industry,\u201d says Weisbart, who now volunteers full time for Physicians for a National Health Program, a group advocating for universal single-payer health care. \u201cSo I left.\u201d\n\n\u201cSitting in our living room drinking Champagne\u201d\n\nThe fourth former executive I spoke with requested anonymity because he thinks his former employer would bury him in expensive lawsuits if he were to go on the record for this story. Unlike the other three, the person we\u2019ll call John left the industry just recently. As a veteran physician and longtime health-policy wonk who has held executive roles in a hospital system, John took a job with a major nonprofit insurer primarily because it was the one side of the industry he hadn\u2019t yet worked on and he wanted to observe it up close. He was optimistic that he could at least push for marginal improvements to mechanisms like prior authorization. He lasted 17 months.\n\nOne day, John received a call from a spine surgeon who asked him, doctor to doctor, why his office had to deal with multiple prior-authorization denials per week when almost every single surgery ended up being approved in the end. John took that feedback to his higher-ups, along with a bold idea: Why not turn this whole thing upside down? Instead of using prior authorization for \u201ceverything\u201d and denying treatments that would likely be approved in the appeals process anyway, why not prior-authorize nothing and see if any greedy doctors prescribing unnecessary treatments emerged?\n\nHis bosses deemed it too difficult to implement, and John began to realize insurance executives are often too insulated from their own policies to understand them. At one point, a senior executive he had barely interacted with came to him when their spouse was diagnosed with cancer, \u201cpetrified\u201d that they wouldn\u2019t receive timely care through one of the insurer\u2019s own plans. \u201cAll of a sudden, when their loved one was sick,\u201d John says, \u201cthey decided it was time to get to know the chief medical officer.\u201d\n\nThat lack of concern about patients stood in contrast to the perks for executives like John. In late 2020, in the depths of the pandemic, he was attending a virtual board meeting when a delivery person showed up at his front door with his company-provided lunch. Already irked by the self-congratulatory tone of the meeting, which focused on how well the company was doing financially since so few people were getting nonurgent health care at the time, John was surprised to find a four-course French meal complete with an expensive bottle of Champagne at his doorstep. \u201cIt felt callous,\u201d he says. \u201cMy colleagues were on the front line risking their lives, and we\u2019re sitting in our living room drinking Champagne, talking about how good we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe Champagne wasn\u2019t a one-off, either \u2014 by the time John left the company, he had to buy a small wine fridge, partly just to store all the expensive bottles he\u2019d been sent. After leaving the insurance industry behind, John had some friends over on his birthday to clean out the collection. \u201cWe put it to good use,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t bring myself to open it or do anything with it while I was actually working there.\u201d\n\nThe financial incentive to deny care is at the core of the industry\u2019s rot, all four former executives argue, and it only seems to be getting worse as big insurers like UnitedHealth Group expand into more areas, including hospice care. It isn\u2019t hard, John says, to imagine the potential conflicts of interest when your insurance company also makes money from your hospice stay. \u201cThese companies are even bigger \u2014 far bigger \u2014 than they were when I was in the industry,\u201d Potter says. \u201cThey use a lot of their money on campaign contributions, on lobbying, on propaganda campaigns to protect the status quo.\u201d\n\nAs deeply entrenched as their business practices may seem, Potter says the big insurers haven\u2019t been this way for that long \u2014 only over the past 30 years or so has a majority of Americans\u2019 health care been consolidated under a few massive for-profit corporations. In that same period, the companies have perfected the art of what John calls \u201cself-dealing,\u201d buying out major players in other areas of the health-care sector to create more stopping points at which they get paid. Those points are often middleman businesses that arguably do little to improve the patient experience yet drive up the costs. Most of Cigna\u2019s $232 billion in revenue last year, for instance, came from Evernorth Health Services, a subsidiary that contains Express Scripts and the prior-authorization shop EviCore. Pharmaceutical-benefits managers, including Express Scripts, have been accused by the Federal Trade Commission of inflating drug prices, while one insider at a large, unidentified prior-authorization shop says the company sells its services to insurers by bragging about how many denials it issues for care it deems unnecessary.\n\nA broad consensus has formed that these companies are too big. Politicians in both parties have introduced prior-authorization bills in the past few years, and even President Trump has criticized PBMs, saying he plans to \u201cknock out the middleman.\u201d On a recent lobbying trip to D.C., Potter says he spoke with more Republicans than Democrats about cracking down on Medicare Advantage plans, which insurers have used to wildly overcharge the federal government.\n\nEven as the former executives and others attempt to channel revived public rage toward insurers into reform, they admit systemic overhaul remains a long way off. \u201cThings are going to have to get much worse before we can approach something like this,\u201d Howrigon says of his preferred model for a universal-coverage health-care system, before offering an analogy: \u201cSome people don\u2019t get serious about diet and exercise until after they have a heart attack. That\u2019s where we are now. I just hope we survive the heart attack.\u201d\n\nFor now, the health-care defectors\u2019 club remains small, though several of the ones I spoke with say former colleagues still working in the industry frequently reach out to secretly agree with them. In a frustrated email recently, Howrigon summed up a sentiment expressed by each of the former executives: \u201cI\u2019m tired of the stuff they get away with.\u201d\n\nWhile Potter acknowledges the risks of defection, he\u2019s made clear that he\u2019s willing to help any current insiders who might want to take a step toward becoming vocal critics of the industry, and is working with a whistleblower nonprofit, the Signals Network, to encourage more to come forward. \u201cI hope there will be more,\u201d he says, adding that the big insurers now find themselves in a more precarious situation than they\u2019ve seen \u201cin many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they have long felt, or at least have felt in recent years, that they could operate with impunity,\u201d Potter says. \u201cThey have to be thinking now that they may not be doing something they can do indefinitely.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "As he sized up a U.S. plan to strike Houthi militants in Yemen in March, Vice President JD Vance didn\u2019t think such an aggressive move was a good idea \u2014 at least not now. The vice president\u2019s initial comment in the Signal chat that has gotten so much attention this week was that such a strike would be \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, he didn\u2019t think the American public would understand why we were doing it and worried that it might cause oil prices to spike. In that message, he wrote:\n\n3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn\u2019t understand this or why it\u2019s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There\u2019s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth responded by arguing that the strike wouldn\u2019t even be about the militants the U.S. sought to kill. Instead, it was about signaling American power to the world.\n\nThough most of the commentary about the Signal group chat this past week has focused on the accidental inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg \u2014 an outrageous breach of national security protocols \u2014 the scandal has also provided us an extraordinary window into Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2019s thinking about foreign policy strategy.\n\nIt underscores how farcical Trump's pledge to be president of \"peace\" and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be.\n\nWhat it reveals is a cavalier attitude toward new open-ended bombardment campaigns. And it underscores how farcical Trump\u2019s pledge to be president of \u201cpeace\u201d and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be. Trump didn\u2019t need to drop bombs on scores of sites across the poorest country in the Middle East now or with such intensity \u2014 and his whole team admitted it.\n\nVance was not wholly opposed to the strikes, but saw them as a deviation from a narrow focus on American interests. In some ways, he seemed to be holding the strictest interpretation of \u201cAmerica First\" principles in the chat. His thinking was why attack Houthi militants if doing so wasn\u2019t that important for the U.S. economically, but could hurt U.S. consumers and politically hurt Trump?\n\nMultiple principals in the chat pushed Vance to adopt an expansive vision of U.S. national interests.\n\nHegseth argued, \u201cThis [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause.\u201d And national security adviser Michael Waltz contended: \u201cWhether it\u2019s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.\u201d\n\nIn a later exchange Vance says he defers to the group but that he hates the idea of \u201cbailing Europe out again.\u201d Hegseth replies, \u201cI fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It\u2019s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.\u201d\n\nIn the discussion, Hegseth and Waltz represent a more traditional view of America as the world\u2019s police officer. They\u2019re saying this isn\u2019t about defending the U.S. against the militants who are being targeted, and it isn\u2019t about the U.S.\u2019s own economic interests. Rather, it\u2019s an intervention on behalf of U.S. allies and a pre-emptive signal to the U.S.\u2019s nemesis in the region, Iran. It functions as a way \u201cto send a message\u201d about American geopolitical supremacy. It is the kind of argument that could easily be advanced by a Democratic liberal internationalist or a Republican neoconservative \u2014 both factions that some MAGA types have correctly lambasted as war hungry.\n\nWeeks after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel began its retaliation, Houthi rebels began launching missiles and drone attacks at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, citing Israel's bombing of Gaza and stating it wouldn't stop until \u201cIsraeli aggression stops.\" The Biden administration launched airstrikes against the Houthis in 2024, but that did not stop them. Rather, the Houthis announced a pause when Israel and Hamas struck a ceasefire deal. (In the meantime, many shipping companies have taken up routes avoiding the Red Sea, and after an initial rise in the price of shipping, those companies adapted and prices came down again this year.) Now, in light of Israel\u2019s decision to torpedo the ceasefire deal and impose a starvation blockade on the entire population of Gaza \u2014 with Trump's blessing \u2014 the Houthis had warned that they would resume missile attacks. But they hadn\u2019t yet. Multiple Pentagon officials told Military.com that the Houthis last launched an attack in December. In other words, Trump approved a pre-emptive strike, not a protective one; as Hegseth put it, the U.S. got to \"start this on our own terms.\" The U.S. has been carrying out such attacks on a daily basis since March 15 and released few details about them, and it\u2019s unclear when they\u2019ll stop.\n\nThese attacks have serious consequences for the civilian population of Yemen. Yemeni officials say the strikes have hit residential areas. Indeed, in the chat discussion in the aftermath of the strikes, Waltz appears to admit that the U.S. targeted civilian infrastructure. \u201cThe first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend\u2019s building and it\u2019s now collapsed,\u201d Waltz wrote on Signal.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Vance replied.\n\nThe Yemen Data Project, an independent nonprofit that monitors attacks in the country, reports that it \u201crecorded 53 civilian casualties in 38 U.S.-led strikes from 15 to 21 March.\u201d And according to Military.com, citing two defense officials, the Trump administration is striking a broader range of targets than President Joe Biden did and harbors \u201cless reluctance to hold off striking targets based on the casualties that may result.\u201d All this is all happening in a war-torn, destitute country where most of the population is food insecure.\n\nThere's reason to be doubtful that these attacks will deter the Houthis. \u201cThe group withstood seven years of Saudi-led airstrikes and a year of U.S. strikes under the Biden administration, which yielded little effect,\u201d Luca Nevola, a senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group, told The New York Times. Given that resilience, there\u2019s not a lot of reason to believe that Trump\u2019s apparently open-ended campaign will in fact make a huge dent using air power alone.\n\nAmerica First, as we\u2019re coming to see in Trump\u2019s second term, is not fundamentally about reducing conflict in the world; nor does it reflect a serious commitment to restraint. Since news of the Signal chat broke, Democrats and liberal commentators have slammed Trump\u2019s national security team for discussing military plans on a chat that included a journalist. They\u2019ve laughed at the misspelling of \u201cprincipals\u201d in the group chat, and derided those officials\u2019 hokey use of prayer emojis in anticipation of the strikes. Granted, it was an idiotic and concerning lapse in security protocol. However an important part of the story isn\u2019t just the lapse itself, but what it teaches us about how Trump\u2019s inner circle sees the United States\u2019 role in the world, and how that vision is contiguous with that of previous stewards of American empire. That this seems to have largely gone unnoticed speaks to how numb Americans have become to dropping bombs in the Middle East."

            "full_content": "Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin has been having a rough go at things since President Donald Trump picked the former lawyer for Jan. 6 defendants \u2014 who on the day of the attack tweeted that he was at the Capitol and relayed the \u201clove, faith and joy\u201d at the scene \u2014 to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.\n\nI wrote last month about Martin\u2019s rage over media leaks apparently coming from staffers in his office. And this week, he received fierce backlash during an appearance in one of the Blackest communities in D.C.\n\nThe Washingtonian magazine published a dispatch from Martin\u2019s trip to Anacostia, a neighborhood that is nearly 90% Black, for a discussion with local leaders about crime. On its face, this appearance seemed ripe for controversy, given that Martin is a staunch supporter of the insurrectionists who waged a Ku Klux Klan-style attack on the Capitol, with gallows and all.\n\nAnd apparently, Martin\u2019s disconnect from attendees was glaringly obvious. According to the Washingtonian, he made an attempt to drive a wedge between Anacostia residents and Africans who have benefited from foreign aid. And it didn\u2019t go over well.\n\nPer the Washingtonian:\n\nClearly a back-slapping, friendly person by nature, he began his appearance with a somewhat conciliatory tone, telling the crowd \u201cyou\u2019re the experts on what\u2019s happening in the community,\u201d and name-dropping the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site as commemorating \u201cone of the great historic folks.\u201d But he struggled to keep it relatable. By a few minutes in, he brought up the embattled USAID in what he clearly thought was a slam dunk: \u201cWhen USAID sent hundreds of millions of dollars to central Africa, didn\u2019t you ask, \u2018why didn\u2019t you send it to 7D? (the Seventh District),\u201d he asked. There was an immediate and resounding \u201cno\u201d from the crowd. \u201cYou didn\u2019t?,\u201d Martin scoffed. \u201cWell you should. I did.\u201d\n\nThis was a pretty disgusting attempt by Martin to sow division by invoking U.S. Agency for International Development cuts, which are inhibiting everything from HIV treatment to maternal health care in Africa.\n\nMartin appeared to be taking tips from his boss here: President Donald Trump peddled this same kind of \u201cforeigners are taking your money\u201d schlock, particularly to Black audiences, during last year\u2019s campaign. And the Washingtonian noted that Martin was called out on this by Cora Masters Barry, the widow of former Washington Mayor Marion Barry:\n\nA few minutes later, Cora Masters Barry, Marion Barry\u2019s widow, took issue, giving Martin the most severe dressing down of the day. \u201cYou need to learn your politics,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to learn geography, and world affairs. There\u2019s a whole different pot of money that goes to Africa that stops diseases\u2026. You don\u2019t know what you talking about, so be careful about what you say when you go places, because you show that you\u2019re not well read.\u201d\n\nOuch. She basically called Martin an ignoramus to his face. And Barry didn\u2019t stop there:\n\nBarry also pointed out that Martin, in his focus on crime, ignored the fact that DC had already made progress. \u201cYou haven\u2019t once mentioned Metropolitan [Police Department],\u201d she said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t talked about the chief of police, who\u2019s doing a great job of bringing crime down. So you can\u2019t sit there and talk about what you gonna do as if something\u2019s not being done already. What you do is you walk in and you say: \u2018what\u2019s being done and how can I help?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe reportedly received applause when she advised Martin to \u201cbe careful how you talk to us.\u201d\n\nThis seems to have been a pretty disastrous showing by Martin, whose MAGA messaging clearly goes over well with hardcore Trump supporters \u2014 and far less so with residents of Anacostia. At least those residents appear to see him more as an occupying force in D.C., which Trump has said he wants to \u201ctake over,\u201d than a helpful partner to its communities."

            "full_content": "Summary Three Yale professors are leaving the prestigious university to teach at the University of Toronto because of the direction of the country under President Trump.\n\nPhilosophy professor Jason Stanley cited concerns about academic freedom and the Trump administration's battle with higher education institutions.\n\nHistory professors Marci Shore and Timothy Snyder joined Stanley in the move to Canada to advocate for democracy and speak out against fascism.\n\nThe Trump administration recently paused federal funding to Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nCritics warn that losing elite educators to other countries could have long-term consequences for American academic leadership.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nYale philosophy professor Jason Stanley, who is leaving the prestigious Ivy League university for Toronto as the Trump administration\u2019s battle with higher education in the US continues, said mid-phone interview with CNN while walking the campus, \u201cHold on one second.\u201d\n\nA group of worried students approached the scholar as he walked the grounds of Yale Thursday in New Haven, Connecticut. Was he really leaving?, they wanted to know.\n\n\u201cI love Yale,\u201d Stanley, who has taught at the university for 12 years, reassured the students. \u201cBut Marci, Tim and I, we\u2019re gonna go defend democracy somewhere else,\u201d he said, referring to the Yale colleagues joining him in Canada.\n\nStanley set off a firestorm at the highest levels of American academia last Friday, when he decided to leave Yale and the United States largely, he said, because of the direction of the country under the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cSuddenly if you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States, you can\u2019t comment on politics if you\u2019re a professor?\u201d said Stanley, who has written books such as \u201cHow Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them\u201d and \u201cErasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Stanley, whose academic background is in social and political philosophy and epistemology. \u201cThat\u2019s not a free society.\u201d\n\nThe final straw for Stanley came after Columbia University made sweeping policy changes in an attempt to prevent the Trump administration from pulling hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding from the Ivy League institution.\n\nAmid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration and pro-Palestinian demonstrations on college campuses, Columbia was the first to experience funding cuts as President Donald Trump threatened to halt federal money going to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that started in October 2023.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just humiliating,\u201d Stanley told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re humiliating the universities and I don\u2019t see the universities standing up to it.\u201d\n\nNow Stanley, along with Yale history professors Marci Shore and her husband Timothy Snyder, are taking their teaching to the University of Toronto to advocate for democracy, speak out against fascism and teach without fear of academic capitulation to the White House, they say.\n\n\u201cThe thing about being a historian is that it\u2019s not that you know what will happen, but you know what can happen,\u201d Shore, who teaches modern European intellectual history, explained in an interview with CNN.\n\nShore said she and Snyder, who teaches history and global affairs, decided to leave after the 2024 presidential election, and the administration\u2019s threats against higher education during President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office reinforced their decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I think everyone has put their head down and gotten in line,\u201d Shore said.\n\n\u201c(But) I think a lot of people have, and I fear that university administrations will, because institutions naturally have an incentive to act in the interest of self-preservation,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Yale has not directly seen ire from the Trump administration, recent events unfolding between the administration and other Ivy League schools provide cautionary tales.\n\nIn early March, the Trump administration announced it was pausing $400 million of federal funding to Columbia University, citing the school\u2019s failure to \u201cprotect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\u201d\n\nStudents wait in long security lines outside of Columbia University as demonstrators rallied in support of Palestine on March 24, 2025. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nColumbia responded by starting to make changes demanded by the administration, such as banning face coverings during protests, boosting disciplinary policies and reviewing curriculums in subject areas like the Middle East.\n\nDuring his second week in office, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at combating antisemitism in schools and on college campuses, and last month announced a multiagency task force would \u201croot out anti-Semitic harassment\u201d on campuses.\n\nYale and Columbia were among 60 universities that received warnings from the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights earlier this month regarding \u201cpossible consequences\u201d if they fail to take adequate steps to protect Jewish students.\n\nThe office said it sent letters to universities under investigation for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act \u201crelating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination.\u201d\n\nLast week, a White House official told CNN the administration paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania, claiming it has violated an executive order barring transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nWhile Penn said as of this week it hadn\u2019t received official word of the paused funding, the school maintains it has always been in compliance with federal guidelines.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of money on the line,\u201d explained Keith Whittington, a Yale professor and cofounder of the Academic Freedom Alliance, which defends the speech of professors and higher education faculty across the country.\n\n\u201cI mean really these are practically existential threats to universities,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he noted if more elite educators decide to leave for similar reasons as the Yale professors, the universities will be weakened as well.\n\n\u201cI think from an overall American leadership position and sort of scientific research, that\u2019s a real threat,\u201d Whittington argued.\n\n\u201cIf you lose your best people who decide to go to other countries, that\u2019s going to have long-term consequences.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN, a spokesperson for Yale University wrote, \u201cYale University has been and continues to be home to world-class faculty members who are dedicated to excellence in scholarship and teaching. These faculty members conduct groundbreaking research, train aspiring leaders who will serve all sectors of society, and offer insights that can help improve the world, and the university is committed to supporting them in these endeavors.\n\n\u201cYale is proud of its global faculty community which includes faculty who may no longer work at the institution, or whose contributions to academia may continue at a different home institution. Faculty members make decisions about their careers for a variety of reasons and the university respects all such decisions,\u201d the statement continued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fear, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d reiterated Stanley regarding his decision to leave for Canada.\n\nStanley said he\u2019d rather just spend his energy fighting for democracy and against the administration\u2019s policies, rather than fighting the universities he loves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in a much better position to fight bullies,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Karina Tsui, Elizabeth Wolfe, Emma Tucker and Michelle Watson contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump took his most consequential action against federal employee unions yet late Thursday, signing an executive order aimed at ending collective bargaining for government employees whose work include national security aspects.\n\nThe expansive order applies to workers across many federal agencies, including the departments of State, Defense, Justice and Health and Human Services. It also impacts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Communications Commission, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nA fact sheet released by the White House said, \u201cThe President needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national security.\u201d\n\nThe order is aimed at stopping federal unions who have \u201cdeclared war on President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d according to the fact sheet. It noted that the largest union \u2013 the American Federation of Government Employees \u2013 has filed many grievances to \u201cblock Trump policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests,\u201d the fact sheet said, noting that the president is using authority granted by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nA guidance issued Thursday by the Office of Personnel Management said that the agencies and divisions covered by the executive order no longer need to collectively bargain with federal unions. It noted that the agencies can conduct the widespread reduction in force, or RIF, that Trump had previously ordered without regard to provisions in terminated collective bargaining agreements. Likewise, any procedural restrictions on agencies\u2019 return-to-office mandates won\u2019t be in effect after the agreements are terminated.\n\nAFGE, which represents more than 800,000 employees, condemned the move in a statement Thursday evening, noting that it affects the collective bargaining rights of more than 1 million federal employees.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s latest executive order is a disgraceful and retaliatory attack on the rights of hundreds of thousands of patriotic American civil servants\u2014nearly one-third of whom are veterans\u2014simply because they are members of a union that stands up to his harmful policies,\u201d AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\n\u201cAFGE is preparing immediate legal action and will fight relentlessly to protect our rights, our members, and all working Americans from these unprecedented attacks,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union also vowed to take swift action.\n\n\u201cThe executive order to eliminate collective bargaining rights for federal employees across the government is a brazen attempt by the administration to ensure its reckless assault on vital federal agency services can continue unimpeded,\u201d NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement. \u201cWe will vigorously challenge this illegal order in court.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Trump has sought to reshape the federal workforce. In one of his earliest moves, he ended remote work for government employees and agencies were provided guidance on how they can override union collective bargaining agreements on telework and remote work.\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security announced moves to rescind the collective bargaining agreement covering tens of thousands of transportation security officers at airports.\n\nFederal unions have fought back, filing multiple lawsuits in federal court \u2013 several of which have succeeded in stymieing Trump\u2019s agenda, at least for a short time. Lawsuits filed by AFGE and other unions have temporarily reversed the administration\u2019s laying off tens of thousands of probationary workers at certain federal agencies and blocked Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Social Security data, among other consequential rulings.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s new acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba said political prosecutors and judges are part of a \u201cbroken system\u201d that must be reformed.\n\nDuring an interview with Habba on Thursday\u2019s edition of The Alex Marlow Show podcast, Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow highlighted Habba\u2019s whirlwind rise inside Trump world and her time in the West Wing during what Habba called \u201cprobably the most epic first 100 days ever.\u201d\n\nHabba described some of the highlights during her experience as Trump\u2019s attorney since joining his legal team in the autumn of 2021.\n\n\u201cBeating Michael Cohen was probably the sweetest victory,\u201d Habba told Marlow.\n\nShe said Cohen \u201cis somebody who had the opportunity to do great things and instead got tied up in a mess of his own with his taxi medallions, et cetera, and then tried to come after President Trump.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s work with the government led to \u201cthe very public raids, the indictments\u201d against Trump, Habba said, adding that she believes her stalwart representation of Trump in that case is \u201cwhy I think he asked me to take on this new role.\u201d\n\nShe explained that her mission in her new role as a U.S. Attorney will be focused on fighting crime.\n\n\u201cMy mission is going to be the same as President Trump\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get crime off the streets. We have to be hard on crime. We have to take care of the immigration problem that the Biden administration created, get illegal immigrants out. And also, for me, in my time at the White House, I was very focused on human trafficking.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cviolent crime is, of course, going to be a priority. We want our streets safe.\u201d\n\nMarlow noted that Habba is best known for her work defending Trump in the case brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James regarding allegations that Trump had undervalued his properties for loan and tax purposes.\n\nHowever, there was \u201cno victim\u201d in that alleged crime, Habba explained, \u201cand they used a commercial law, section 6312, which is not supposed to be used in the private sector.\u201d\n\nHabba said James had \u201cdecided to butt her nose into a private sector, into a private company, into Deutsche Bank, who lost no money \u2013 made money \u2013 and was paid early; and for years and years and years, she tried to build a case. She couldn\u2019t build a case with the normal rules and laws, so she used section 6312.\u201d\n\nThe case is being appealed, but Habba warned that these lawfare tactics employed by James could become the new normal.\n\n\u201cIf you can do this to President Trump, then you can do this to anybody,\u201d she cautioned, echoing Trump\u2019s campaign message.\n\nHabba also noted that the date of one of Trump\u2019s alleged crimes took place past the statute of limitations, but the state passed legislation to change the statute.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed into law the Adult Survivors Act to grant sexual abuse victims a one-year window to file law suits against their alleged attacker even if the statute of limitations had passed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Gov. Hochul who created the Adult Survivors Act side by side with [Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll\u2019s lawyer] Robbie Kaplan to target people for one year, and who was their first person? It was Donald Trump,\u201d Habba said.\n\nThat kind of political lawfare from non-political officials must end, she believes.\n\n\u201cStepping in as a [U.S. Attorney], I can say that it\u2019s not a political position. It is a law and order position,\u201d Habba told Marlow. \u201cAnd when you make it political, when you run on getting Trump, when you start creating laws that avoid statute of limitations to get a political opponent, that is the single most un-American thing, and a real destruction of the judicial system.\u201d\n\nHabba said she is \u201cas frustrated as most Americans\u201d that those who weaponized the legal system against Trump have not faced any consequences for it. She believes this needs to be rectified.\n\n\u201cWatching consistent congressional testimony or hearings and then not seeing anything happen, that\u2019s where the enforcement offices need to step in and do their own investigations and then instruct the men in blue to arrest people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I see all the tweets, all the frustration \u2014 \u2018Why aren\u2019t we arresting people? Why aren\u2019t we arresting people?\u2019 We have to do that because we can\u2019t keep having investigations and no outcome of accountability.\u201d\n\nIn addition to overzealous and overtly political prosecutors, Habba sees broader problems with the system as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a real problem on the bench,\u201d Habba said of political judges, adding that government officials who decide \u201cwhat evidence goes in and out of court, what records you can and cannot make, as I know it, can completely ruin or destroy or change what the jury can see, what they can\u2019t see. Those decisions are so critical.\u201d\n\nShe called for reforms to the rules and ethics governing the officials who make these decisions.\n\n\u201cStart focusing on the enforcers of the law, the people that are truly the decision makers and that can really ruin somebody\u2019s life financially, putting them in jail, things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take that and mix politics into that.\u201d\n\nMarlow brought up the example of District Judge James Boasberg, who blocked Trump\u2019s deportation flights of gang members and is now handling the Signal group chat lawsuit. Boasberg and his wife are prominent Democrat donors. \u201cJust seems too crazy to be true,\u201d Marlow said.\n\nThat\u2019s just one example of the biased judges she and Trump have faced, Habba said, arguing that Congress, which created the court system, has the power to change or even defund it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that we fund these federal courts, and if it comes to it, we will play ball with you, just like you\u2019re playing with us,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s separation of powers for a reason. It\u2019s checks and balances. It\u2019s all those things. But this isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\nThe Alex Marlow Show, hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nVice President JD Vance on Friday made the highest-profile case to date for American control of Greenland during a controversial visit to the semiautonomous island, which its residents had resisted and its leaders said was unwelcome.\n\n\u201cWe want to have good relationships with everybody,\u201d Vance said during a visit to an American military installation high above the Arctic Circle. \u201cBut part of having good relations is showing your strength when you have to.\u201d\n\nIt was the clearest message yet to Greenlanders who have been watching with anxiety as President Donald Trump vows to acquire their land \u201cone way or another.\u201d Vance, who only decided in the last few days to make the trip, said Denmark had neglected its territory and that America could no longer ignore Russian and Chinese alleged designs on the island.\n\n\u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple,\u201d Vance said. \u201cYou have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.\u201d\n\nHe repeatedly claimed the island was vulnerable and that the United States had \u201cno other option\u201d than to ramp up its presence there.\n\nGreenland would be better off \u201ccoming under the United States\u2019 security umbrella than you have been under Denmark\u2019s security umbrella,\u201d he said, saying it was the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d to see changes to the island\u2019s Danish leadership.\n\nStill, he acknowledged the future of the island should be up to its residents.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback JD Vance accuses Denmark of neglecting Greenland 01:38 - Source: CNN JD Vance accuses Denmark of neglecting Greenland 01:38\n\n\u201cYes, the people of Greenland are going to have self determination. We hope that they choose to partner with the US because we\u2019re the only nation on earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security, because their security is very much our security,\u201d he said.\n\nVance\u2019s visit was a very different trip than the cultural foray White House officials had originally planned for his wife, second lady Usha Vance.\n\nInstead of viewing a dog sled race as she had originally planned, the Vances visited the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, 1,000 miles from the capital of Nuuk. Miles away from any civilian population center, they were greeted by enthusiastic troops in the sub-freezing weather.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold as sh*t here!\u201d Vance exclaimed when he arrived.\n\nWhy the VP decided to join the trip\n\nWhat the White House initially characterized as a visit by the second lady to learn more about the culture of the island, quickly became contentious earlier this week \u2013 with the outgoing leader of the semiautonomous Danish territory M\u00fate Egede describing it as \u201chighly aggressive.\u201d\n\nAs JD Vance watched the outrage over his wife\u2019s trip grow, he decided to join her, a senior White House official told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of a little bit of commotion from Danish leaders combined with Vance wanting to go for a while,\u201d said the official.\n\n\u201cI decided I didn\u2019t want her to have all that fun by herself and so I\u2019m going to join her,\u201d Vance said in a video announcing his participation earlier this week.\n\nVance\u2019s 11th-hour decision elevated the US delegation visit, with the vice president becoming the highest-ranking US official to visit Greenland, and in so doing, traveling further north than any senior American leader has ever gone on an official visit, the White House official said.\n\nBut the shortened trip also carried a more overtly militaristic tenor and kept the American visitors sequestered away from any planned protests.\n\nVance\u2019s first trip abroad \u2013 to conferences in Paris and Germany \u2013 was notable for his tough rhetoric about Europe, a viewpoint reinforced by his texts revealed this week in a private Signal chat about military action in Yemen. His message on this second trip overseas struck a similar tone.\n\nThe visit to the American military base avoided any potentially embarrassing incidents between the Vances and either members of the public or government officials, many of whom openly spoke out against Usha Vance\u2019s original plans.\n\nProtests had been planned in the capital Nuuk, where about a third of Greenlanders live, and Greenland\u2019s second largest city Sisimiut, where the dog sled race is taking place.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s talk of annexation and the visit of the Vances has united Greenlanders in defiance, with Greenlanders rallying together to protest,\u201d Dwayne Ryan Menezes, director of the UK-based think tank Polar Research and Policy Initiative, told CNN in an email.\n\n\u201cThe Vances clearly realised that if they visited Nuuk or Sisimiut, the strategy would backfire even more than it has: it would be a PR disaster, as all footage would likely feature protestors with placards of the sort we saw earlier this month (Yankee Go Home, and Make America Go Away), and would expose to the US electorate the misinformation they were fed about how enthusiastically Greenlanders wished for Greenland to join the US,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House official pushed back on that assertion, telling CNN, \u201cThe itinerary changes had nothing to do with any potential protests.\u201d\n\nThe official argued that Usha Vance\u2019s original plans were scrapped because her itinerary was not compatible with her husband\u2019s schedule.\n\nHer visit to Nuuk, for example, was off the table because Greenland was still forming its government after recent elections and did not have the officials in place to receive him, the White House official said. Meanwhile, the dogsledding race was in a remote part of Greenland, and installing the vice president\u2019s full security footprint wasn\u2019t possible on just a few days\u2019 notice, they added.\n\nA visit \u2018far away from anyone Greenlandic\u2019\n\nJust hours before the Vances were due to arrive, a new coalition government with Greenland\u2019s four leading parties was announced Friday, shutting out a staunch pro-independence party that expressed interest in working with the United States.\n\nDemokraatit party leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen will be the next prime minister and has urged unity in the face of pressure from the United States.\n\n\u201cThe coalition agreement could not have come at a better time as it will signal to the Vances the unity forged in defiance of Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric and their ill-timed visit,\u201d Menezes said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe visit to the space base was less likely to put the Vances near Greenlanders who may be expressing those opinions.\n\nUlrik Pram Gad, senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, said that Vance going to Pituffik Space Base \u201cfrom a Greenlandic perspective, is a lot less aggressive, because that\u2019s a place where Greenlanders are used to American officials. It\u2019s far away from anyone Greenlandic, basically.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Vance says media won't force Trump to fire anyone over Signal chat 01:33 - Source: CNN Vance says media won't force Trump to fire anyone over Signal chat 01:33\n\nUsha Vance has largely remained above the political fray since her husband took office, assembling a small team of staff, transitioning her three children to life at the Naval Observatory, and settling into the public role, for which she will have her own platform and responsibilities.\n\nHer original visit to Greenland for the dogsled race appeared to originate with an invitation from American Daybreak, a group founded by Tom Dans, who worked on Arctic issues in the first Trump administration.\n\n\u201cAs a sponsor and supporter of this event I encouraged and invited the Second Lady and other senior Administration officials to attend this monumental race. This visit was always intended to be purely personal in nature and in the spirit of the friendship between our two nations,\u201d Dans wrote on X, describing himself as \u201cvery disappointed by the negative and hostile reaction\u201d to the visit.\n\nOrganizers for the race said they didn\u2019t invite Usha Vance specifically, but that anyone could attend.\n\nBut residents in Sisimiut planned to silently demonstrate her visit by turning their backs to her motorcade, according to Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n\u201cWe want to show the world that we don\u2019t want to be a part of America,\u201d said Minik Lange, a resident of Sisimiut, who helped organize the protest against Vance\u2019s now-cancelled visit.\n\n\u201cWe are also aware that there are a lot of propaganda from the president to the American population that we want to be American citizens. That is one huge lie from him,\u201d Lange told CNN. \u201cAnd we see it as a very disrespectful action for the Greenlandic population. All we want is to be respected as a Greenlandic population from all sides.\u201d\n\nJakob Nordstr\u00f8m, who runs a local pilot business in Nuuk, said he thinks Greenlanders were \u201crelieved\u201d that the original visit to Sisimiut and Nuuk was cancelled. \u201cMost Greenlanders welcome tourists from the United States, but obviously this was not a tourist visit,\u201d Nordstr\u00f8m said.\n\nAmerican officials have downplayed the role potential protests played in altering plans for the trip. One person close to JD Vance said he had wanted to go to the island since Donald Trump Jr. returned from a visit earlier this year and \u201craved about how cool it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cVice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance are proud to visit the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland this Friday,\u201d said Taylor Van Kirk, Vance\u2019s press secretary.\n\nThe US Consulate in Nuuk declined to comment, referring questions to the vice president\u2019s office.\n\nAlso part of the delegation were national security adviser Mike Waltz \u2013 who has been at the center of this week\u2019s scandal over top Trump Cabinet officials discussing strikes in Yemen in a Signal chain that included a reporter \u2013 and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Lee, a vocal supporter of Trump\u2019s desire to control Greenland.\n\nWhite House officials have argued for months that the president\u2019s fixation with acquiring Greenland has dual benefits, both economic and for national security.\n\nTrump has ratcheted up his rhetoric in recent months, insisting his administration will acquire the territory despite Greenland and Denmark\u2019s leaders repeatedly making clear the island isn\u2019t for sale.\n\n\u201cWe have to have it,\u201d he said on the \u201cVINCE\u201d podcast earlier this week. \u201cAnd I think we will have it.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Lauren Kent contributed to this story."
