            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s marathon speech on the Senate floor has stretched overnight into Tuesday morning as he protests actions taken by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, saying that he will keep going \u201cas long as I am physically able.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic senator has spoken for more than 12 hours, beginning his remarks at 7 p.m. ET Monday evening, and is undertaking this effort at a time when Democratic leaders in Washington are under pressure from their base to do more to stand up to Trump. Booker is a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team.\n\nAs of 7:30 a.m. ET, Booker was still speaking and had touched on a number of topics.\n\n\u201cI rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,\u201d Booker said at the outset of his remarks. \u201cI rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans\u2019 safety; financial stability; the core foundations of our democracy,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThese are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nThe speech is not a filibuster because Booker is not blocking legislation or a nomination. The Democratic senator\u2019s speech will keep the Senate floor open \u2013 and floor staff working as well US Capitol police members detailed to the chamber \u2013 for as long as he continues speaking, but lawmakers had concluded voting on Monday before he began his remarks.\n\nIn his remarks, Booker warned of potential cuts to Medicaid by congressional Republicans and the harm that would cause to his constituents and Americans across the country.\n\nRepublicans have insisted that they will not cut Medicaid, but have said they will go after waste, fraud and abuse and have proposed deep spending cuts \u2013 without specifying exactly what programs the cuts could come from \u2013 as part of their legislative agenda.\n\nAt one point, Booker invoked the late GOP Sen. John McCain, reflecting on McCain\u2019s pivotal health care vote in 2017, and drawing parallels to the current moment.\n\n\u201cIt is maddening in this country to create greater and greater health care crisis and for us not to solve it but to battle back and forth between trying to make incremental changes or to tear it all down with no plan to make it better, leaving more Americans suffering,\u201d Booker said.\n\nLoudly raising his voice and speaking with emotion, Booker said, \u201cSenator McCain, I know you wouldn\u2019t sanction this, I know you would be screaming, I\u2019ve seen how angry you can get, John McCain. I\u2019ve seen you tear people apart on this floor, Democrat and Republican, for doing the same stupid thing over and over again. Listen to John McCain explain why he voted \u2018no\u2019 the last time the Republican Party tried to unite and tear down health care with no idea how to fix it, threatening to put millions of Americans in financial crisis and health care crisis. I can\u2019t believe we are here again.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, Booker took questions at various points from Senate Democratic colleagues and was able to take brief breaks while he fielded those questions. Per Senate procedure, when Booker yielded for a question, he was able to stop speaking without losing the floor.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was the first to pose a question to his New Jersey colleague, and he praised Booker for his \u201cstrength and conviction.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking the floor tonight to bring up all these inequities that will hurt people, that will so hurt the middle class, that will so hurt poor people, that will hurt America, hurt our fiscal conditions, as you document,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cJust give us a little inkling of the strength \u2014 give us a little feeling for the strength and conviction that drive you to do this unusual taking of the floor for a long time to let the people know how bad these things are going to be.\u201d\n\nBooker then yielded to Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester for further questions, noting that before he began speaking, the Delaware Senator prayed with him on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cMy sister came over and prayed with me that I could stand for a long time, because she knew what we were trying to do, which was to try to create with who we serve, with John Lewis-type good trouble in this institution, to not do things normal,\u201d he said, adding that Blunt Rochester had \u201casked God to give me words of love today.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators, including: Jeff Merkley against Neil Gorsuch in 2017; Chris Murphy on gun control in 2016; Rand Paul over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and Ted Cruz against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n\nThe late Strom Thurmond holds the record for the longest speech when he spoke on the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional information."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration recently stripped Columbia University of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding in a blatant act of authoritarianism that Trump and his allies dubiously say is necessary to stem antisemitism. The university sheepishly acquiesced to virtually all of the administration\u2019s demands in an effort to restart talks to unfreeze that money.\n\nI recently wrote about the absurdity of the MAGA movement\u2019s lobbing claims of antisemitism precisely as some of the most prominent conservative influencers are praising Nazi apologists and even defending Adolf Hitler himself.\n\nThe Trump administration has given a range of rationales \u2014 from diversity-related policies to the recognition of trans people in collegiate athletics \u2014 as it targets American universities, which JD Vance once branded \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Beyond that, the White House has used allegations of antisemitism to pursue deportation of foreign students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nAmid all of this, I\u2019ve been interested in hearing Jewish voices speaking about the administration\u2019s apparent use of Jewish people and their pain to carry out its illiberal goals \u2014 and the concerns they have about the White House\u2019s actions helping fuel antisemitism.\n\nJason Stanley, a philosophy professor who recently decided to leave Yale to go teach in Canada, recently explained on PBS\u2019 \u201cAmanpour & Company\u201d why he thinks the Trump administration\u2019s efforts are actually boosting antisemitic tropes:\n\nThis is reinforcing antisemitic tropes all across the political spectrum. ... What are the most toxic antisemitic tropes? Well, \u201cJews control the institutions.\u201d This is absolutely reinforcing this. Any young American is going to think: Remember what happened when they took down the world\u2019s greatest university system on behalf of Jewish safety? And this will go down in history books \u2014 the history of this era will say that Jewish people were the sledgehammer for fascism. So if we don\u2019t speak out, if we American Jews do not speak out against this, this will be a grim chapter in our history as Americans. It\u2019s the first time in my life as an American that I have been fearful of our status as equal Americans \u2014 not because of the protests on campus, which, as I said, had a lot of Jewish students in them. But because we are suddenly at the center of U.S. politics. It\u2019s never good to be in the crosshairs for us. And we are being used to destroy democracy.\n\nDylan Williams, the vice president for government affairs at the Center for International Policy, a progressive think tank, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly right and I have no doubt that it is how the overwhelming majority of Jewish Americans feel \u2014 we are being exploited in an attack on democracy, rights and the rule of law,\u201d Williams wrote on X.\n\nThis concern isn\u2019t confined to Jewish leftists. In fact, conservative writer Nick Cohen essentially warned about what we\u2019re seeing now back in December. In an article for The Jewish Chronicle headlined \u201cAmerican Jews, beware of being used by Trump,\u201d he wrote:\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying that antisemitism is never really about Jews. Everyone from European fascists to today\u2019s Khomeinists, for example, uses anti-Jewish conspiracy theories to justify the denial of human rights to their own citizens. The same applies to the philosemitism of the Trump movement. It wants to use American Jews \u2014 most of whom still vote Democrat, I should add \u2014 as an excuse to undermine their political opponents in liberal universities and abolish the US Education department.\n\nFurthermore, Kenneth Stern, the director of Bard College\u2019s Center for the Study of Hate and a lead drafter of the working definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, recently told NPR that the Trump administration\u2019s campus crackdown risks scapegoating Jewish students, as well.\n\n\u201cIt puts pro-Israel Jewish students in a situation where they may be seen as trying to suppress speech rather than answer it,\u201d Stern said.\n\nAs NPR noted, the administration has adopted Stern\u2019s definition of antisemitism in its executive orders \u2014 but he says the definition is being distorted and weaponized.\n\nThese concerns, about purported allyship\u2019s being used in ways that ultimately may undermine Jews, mirror what some Asian Americans expressed as conservatives were using their communities to argue against \u2014 and do away with \u2014 race-conscious admissions on college campuses.\n\nNeedless to say, members of more than one marginalized group have shown wariness about the MAGA movement\u2019s claiming to act on their behalf. And they have ample reason to feel that way."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Donald Trump selected Mike Waltz to serve as national security adviser, the choice was widely seen as win-win: A combat veteran with four Bronze Stars would bring his judgment to the White House and his deep-red Florida House district was safe in Republican hands.\n\nNow, both assumptions seem far less certain, as Waltz struggles to restore his credibility inside the West Wing after an embarrassing security breach and Republicans scramble to hold onto his old seat in a special election Tuesday that will stand as one of the most significant tests of Trump\u2019s popularity since taking office.\n\nWith questions still swirling around Waltz on Monday, the White House sought to turn the page. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump stands by Waltz and an investigation had been closed into how the national security adviser invited The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief into a chat on an encrypted messaging app where Trump\u2019s team discussed military plans to strike Yemen.\n\n\u201cAs the president has made very clear, Mike Waltz continues to be an important part of his national security team,\u201d Leavitt told reporters. \u201cThis case has been closed here at the White House, as far as we are concerned. There have been steps made to ensure that something like that can, obviously, never happen again. We\u2019re moving forward.\u201d\n\nLeavitt declined to elaborate what steps had been taken and didn\u2019t say whether the review \u2013 promised last week by the president, and also said to include the White House counsel\u2019s office and Elon Musk \u2013 shed any new light onto how Jeffrey Goldberg was invited to join the chat, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth disclosed a highly sensitive military operation for taking out Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to keep Waltz on board \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 does not mean that Waltz has resolved all of the questions surrounding a bizarre scandal that even the president conceded was the biggest \u201cglitch\u201d of the new administration. The president and other advisers were reticent to give in to a scandal, people familiar with the matter say, particularly involving The Atlantic, a magazine that Trump loathes.\n\nWhile he has publicly downplayed the matter, Trump was frustrated by the appearance of ineptitude by his aides and in disbelief that Goldberg would be communicating with anyone in his close inner circle.\n\nTrump determined early last week that he didn\u2019t want to fire anyone over the messages, wary of appearing to cave to outside pressure. But that didn\u2019t stop him from questioning other advisers and allies about how to proceed, officials said, including whether he should fire Waltz for adding Goldberg to the Signal chat discussing attack plans in Yemen.\n\nTrump\u2019s public support for Waltz was at its most effusive last Tuesday, when he told reporters he believed his aide was \u201cdoing his best\u201d and \u201cwill continue to do a good job\u201d while stopping short of blaming him for the snafu.\n\nBy Wednesday, he seemed somewhat less enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cIt was Mike, I guess. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nBy Thursday, Trump was continuing to consult with senior members of his administration about the wisdom of keeping Waltz on staff.\n\nHe met with Vice President JD Vance, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Sergio Gor, the head of presidential personnel, according to people familiar with the meeting, first reported by The Wall Street Journal. He also was venting in conversations with political allies that Waltz\u2019s old Florida congressional seat had become a much tougher race for Republicans than initially expected.\n\nDismissing Waltz would not prompt another contentious confirmation battle, something Trump and other White House officials are eager to move beyond. The national security adviser position, while one of the most powerful within the US government, doesn\u2019t require Senate approval. Trump has steadfastly stood by Hegseth, who survived a bruising confirmation battle in January.\n\nYet as a new week began, Trump remained set on not shaking up his team, despite the lingering resentment he has voiced to allies over what transpired.\n\nLong-standing questions around Waltz in Trump world\n\nBut the president has yet to learn the biggest question of all: How Goldberg\u2019s number ended up on Waltz\u2019s telephone. Waltz himself has offered less-than-clear explanations in public.\n\n\u201cSomehow it gets sucked in. It gets sucked in,\u201d he said on Fox News last week, in an interview that Trump and other senior officials found less than impressive.\n\nThe Signal incident was, in Trump\u2019s mind, the first glaring misstep of his second term, and marred what he believes to be a successful opening of his second administration that so far has avoided some of the pitfalls of his first term.\n\nEven before the Signal episode unfolded last week, there were voices in Trump\u2019s orbit questioning whether Waltz was enough of an ideological loyalist to serve in the high-profile job.\n\nHe previously served in the administration of President George W. Bush and had publicly questioned Trump ahead of the 2016 election, saying after Trump criticized Sen. John McCain that he \u201chasn\u2019t served this country for a day in his life\u201d and accusing him of \u201ccozying up to Putin.\u201d\n\nBefore assuming his role at the White House, Waltz also vocally encouraged American assistance for Ukraine, even as Trump and some of his allies questioned its value to the United States.\n\nSo, too, have there been questions about his manner in the West Wing, where he is now a senior-level aide rather than a principal, as he was on Capitol Hill.\n\nWaltz, 51, is part of a large contingent of Floridians in the top ranks of the White House. But during the first two months of the administration, Waltz rubbed some Trump loyalists the wrong way, particularly for hawkish foreign policy views, people familiar with the matter say.\n\nThe former congressman also carried himself with a sense of entitlement, in the view of some aides, rather than as a member of the national security staff. White House officials disputed any such characterization, saying all advisers and Cabinet secretaries serve as the pleasure of the president.\n\nWaltz was elected to Congress in 2018 to fill the seat of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and won reelection three times. An Army Ranger, Waltz was selected to serve in the elite Green Beret special forces, notching multiple tours to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nNational security advisers do not have a particularly strong track record in Trump\u2019s West Wing. He ran through four during his first term: Michael Flynn, whom he fired weeks after taking office in 2017 for lying about his contacts with Russia; HR McMaster, who left after differences on Syria and Russia; John Bolton, who Trump fired after 17 months (Bolton said he quit); and Robert O\u2019Brien, who lasted until the end of the term.\n\nThe repeated hirings-and-firings of the top national security aide \u2014 along with the West Wing\u2019s other top job, chief of staff \u2014 contributed to a sense of chaos in Trump\u2019s first term that he has been intent on avoiding this time around.\n\nTrump sought to put the matter to rest this weekend, saying he\u2019d held no discussions about dismissing Waltz or anyone else involved in the matter.\n\n\u201cNope, I\u2019ve never heard that,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cAnd nobody else makes that decision, but me and I\u2019ve never heard it, and I don\u2019t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts.\u201d"

            "full_content": "In spring 2024, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision that found a government official could not use her position to punish a disfavored political organization by going after the third parties that did business with it.\n\nLikewise, President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional. But unless lawyers stand up to the president and clients stand by their lawyers, the damage to the legal system will be profound.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional.\n\nClients and lawyers must band together against these blatantly illegal actions by the Trump administration and flip the script: They need not defend their own actions but, rather, force government attorneys who may seek to punish the clients of any \u201cdisfavored\u201d law firms to justify such unconstitutional efforts, which will be impossible to do.\n\nSo far, the president has targeted five private law firms and the clients they represent, claiming that his administration will punish those clients who have the temerity to do business with those firms. Two of these firms, Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps, have capitulated to this pressure, expressing fears that the president\u2019s attacks threaten their business model, and they will lose clients who might not want lawyers representing them who have such a bad relationship with the federal government.\n\nThis fear is certainly real, but if the president can scare clients away from the firms that might take positions against his administration, there will be fewer and fewer lawyers willing to take such stands. If that happens, our system of rights, protected by law, and not dispensed at the fiat of the executive, will crumble. But here\u2019s the thing: such actions by the president are clearly unconstitutional.\n\nLast year, in a case filed by the National Rifle Association, on facts eerily similar to those surrounding the president\u2019s actions, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, found that the efforts of a state agency in New York to punish companies that did business with the NRA violated its free speech rights enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nWhile it is deeply troubling that some firms feel the need to appease the White House in the face of such unconstitutional retribution, it will take more than just a handful of firms to resist such bullying. And if such resistance does not materialize, the threats to the rule of law will only increase, and our legal system will not serve to protect everyone\u2019s rights or facilitate the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n\nIt is in everyone\u2019s best interest \u2014 even those clients who might fear retaliation from the Trump administration for retaining disfavored firms \u2014 to condemn the president\u2019s efforts to attack members of the legal profession simply for playing their essential role in our legal system. These clients should stand by their lawyers and those lawyers must turn the tables on their opponents. They must force government lawyers who might take punitive action on behalf of the president to justify such unconstitutional behavior in court. Since government lawyers take an oath to the Constitution, they, too, have a duty to resist facilitating such punitive and unconstitutional actions.\n\nAddressing U.S. attorneys in 1940 about the role of the prosecutor in a society that abided by the rule of law, then-Attorney General Robert Jackson \u2014 who would also serve as a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and was later a Supreme Court associate justice \u2014 explained: \u201cWhile the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries.\n\nIn the last light of the first Trump administration, Justice Department lawyers refused to help the president remain in power after losing the 2020 election. Recently, federal prosecutors resisted pressure to dismiss the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. As one of those lawyers, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten, explained: \u201cAny assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way. If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries. Remember, President Richard Nixon, too, cycled through several lawyers until he found someone willing to fire the special prosecutor investigating him, but the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d also helped lead to Nixon\u2019s ultimate demise.\n\nThe ability of lawyers and their clients to operate free of such animus is an essential element of our legal system and the rule of law itself. And everyone benefits by a functioning legal system: a financial institution under investigation, a worker cheated out of a fair wage or someone facing deportation.\n\nIn a democracy that promises \u201cEqual Justice Under Law,\u201d a phrase chiseled above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court building, lawyers are critical to deliver on the promise of such equal justice, not for some, but for all. Attacks on lawyers \u2014 even elite ones \u2014 are designed to bring the entire legal system to heel.\n\nTurning to Robert Jackson once again, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, writing for the Supreme Court, he set forth what should be our national True North when it comes to speech and action disfavored by government officials: \u201cIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s attacks on law firms are designed to not just dictate orthodoxy, but also to bend the legal system to President Trump\u2019s will. These seemingly petty actions, from high officials, are setting us down a path where the legal institutions designed to protect everyone will no longer serve to check abuses of power. Everyone within the legal system \u2014 its judges, lawyers, clients and average citizens \u2014 must resist such efforts and do so together."

            "full_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nTwo astronauts whose planned weeklong stay in low-Earth orbit unexpectedly turned into a more than 9-month mission due to spacecraft problems spoke publicly to reporters Monday for the first time since their return to terra firma on March 18.\n\nNASA\u2019s Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore garnered worldwide attention when issues with their Boeing Starliner vehicle cropped up during a June test flight to the International Space Station. As they waited for an alternative ride home, the pair faced a stream of rhetoric, bolstered by politicians and media, about being \u201cabandoned,\u201d \u201cstranded,\u201d or \u201cstuck\u201d \u2014 descriptors the astronauts themselves have denied.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore and fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague \u2014 who were all part of the Crew-9 mission that ultimately brought the test flight team back to Earth \u2014 addressed questions about the Starliner saga during a NASA news conference.\n\n\u201cWe were always coming back, and I think people need to know that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re back to actually, you know, share our story with so many people, because \u2026 it\u2019s unique, and there\u2019s some lessons learned to it, and part of that is just resilience and being able to take a turn that was unexpected and make the best of it.\u201d\n\nWilliams acknowledged that she and Wilmore knew going into the Starliner test mission that flying a new spacecraft was \u201cunique,\u201d but neither expected all of the attention their extended stay garnered. Once the duo realized they would become part of the space station crew for longer than expected, they \u201cpivoted,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cWe are International Space Station crew members, and we\u2019re doing what all of our other friends in the astronaut office do: Go and work and train and and do amazing science experiments up on the International Space Station,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWilliams said she and Wilmore were honored and humbled by the amount of interest in their journey.\n\n\u201cWhen we came home, (it was) like, wow, there are a lot of people who are interested,\u201d she said. \u201cVery thankful, very amazed that we could hopefully be one positive element to bring people together.\u201d\n\nBoth Williams and Wilmore said that Starliner is \u201cvery capable.\u201d Given the chance, they would fly it again in the future, according to Wilmore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to rectify all the issues that we encountered,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix it, we\u2019re going to make it work. Boeing\u2019s completely committed. NASA is completely committed. And with that, I\u2019d get on in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nThe astronauts were repeatedly asked about any politics that came into play during their time on the station.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re up there operating in space, you don\u2019t feel the politics,\u201d Hague said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel any of that.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News on Monday, Wilmore for the first time said he thought \u201cin certain respects, we were stuck.\u201d\n\nBut he continued to refute the broader narrative that he and Williams were abandoned.\n\n\u201cBased on how they were couching this? That we were left and forgotten and all? We were nowhere near any of that,\u201d Wilmore said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, now one of Trump\u2019s top advisers, have repeatedly taken credit for expediting Williams and Wilmore\u2019s return.\n\nTrump and Musk have also accused the Biden Administration of abandoning the astronauts in space for \u201cpolitical reasons,\u201d though there is no publicly available evidence for that assertion.\n\nWilmore on Monday repeated earlier statements that he \u201cbelieves\u201d Musk and Trump, though he did not say about what, specifically.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given me no reason not to trust you \u2014 either one of them,\u201d Wilmore told Fox News when asked what he would say to Trump and Musk. \u201cI am grateful that our national leaders actually are coming in and taking part in our human spaceflight program.\u201d\n\nAstronauts Nick Hague, Suni Williams, and Butch Wilmore talk to reporters during a news conference at Johnson Space Center on March 31 in Houston. Ashley Landis/AP\n\nReacclimating to life on Earth\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were reassigned to the Crew-9 mission during their monthslong stay on the orbiting laboratory, integrating with space station staff. As their stay faced further extensions, the astronauts acknowledged it was difficult to be away from family and friends on Earth.\n\n\u201cDid I think about not being there for my daughter\u2019s high school year? Of course, but (we) compartmentalize. \u2026 I can\u2019t let that interfere with what I\u2019m called to do at the moment,\u201d Wilmore told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s not about my feelings. It\u2019s about what this human spaceflight program is about: It\u2019s our national goals.\u201d\n\nDespite the controversial rhetoric about the mission, the astronaut duo also relished the time spent in space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic up here. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to spend time up here with these views and with this company?\u201d Williams told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper from the space station in February.\n\nHague on Monday praised Wilmore and Williams as highly skilled astronauts who were welcomed as they helped the current station crew work through experiments and other tasks \u2014 more than \u201cgap fillers on the station,\u201d he said at the news conference.\n\n\u201cThey were productive, pushing the station mission forward and Suni was the station commander, so she was calling the shots,\u201d Hague said. \u201cSo you get in that environment, that operational environment, the politics, they don\u2019t make it up there. We are working as a part of an international team that spans the globe \u2026 and we just figure out how to make it happen. That\u2019s the magic of human spaceflight, is that we can focus on something so positive that pulls people together. And we\u2019ve been doing that for a long time.\u201d\n\nAfter returning home, Williams said she couldn\u2019t wait to hug her husband and her dogs. She said she\u2019s been feeling good and went for a 3-mile run yesterday \u2014 something she says is a testament to the astronauts\u2019 trainers, who are \u201crocking it\u201d in helping the crew reacclimate to life on Earth again.\n\n\u201cI mean, who would even imagine that you come back from roughly 10 months (in space) and within a week, you run 2 miles at an eight-minute pace,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not even conceivable that the body could handle that. But these folks get us ready to where those type of things happen.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s response to the \u2018stuck\u2019 narrative\n\nTo be clear, NASA officials have consistently denied that Williams and Wilmore were ever \u201cstranded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always had a lifeboat, a way for them to come home,\u201d said Steve Stich, who heads NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, under which SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft and Boeing\u2019s Starliner vehicle operate, on March 18.\n\nNASA officials were asked during news conferences around the astronauts\u2019 March 18 return to Earth about exactly how much credit should be given to Trump and Musk.\n\nFor key context: The space agency mapped out Williams and Wilmore\u2019s path home last summer \u2014 well before Musk or Trump began talking about it.\n\nFor their part, NASA leaders have mostly avoided giving the President or Musk overt credit.\n\nFor example, Joel Montalbano, the space agency\u2019s deputy associate administrator for the Space Operations Mission Directorate, addressed the matter after Williams and Wilmore splashed down off the coast of Florida.\n\n\u201cI think many of you heard that back in January, the President asked SpaceX what it would take to bring this crew home. And I will tell you that \u2014 at the time that that question was asked \u2014 we were already looking at options,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter being questioned by journalists, Montalbano added that NASA \u201cgot the input from the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you also have to look at the vehicle readiness,\u201d Montalbano said. \u201cWe talked about looking at weather. We talked about recovery team, (crew) handover, the vehicle traffic going to and from the International Space Station. So when you put all that together, we came up with a, I thought, a pretty good plan that the teams executed over the last four or five days.\u201d\n\n\u201cVehicle readiness\u201d is a key phrase.\n\nDuring the March 18 news conference, Stich said the next available SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that could bring Williams and Wilmore home was the one that brought them home. The fact that the spacecraft was one and the same suggests SpaceX did not have a different vehicle that could have flown a separate, dedicated mission to return the astronauts sooner.\n\nThat would contradict a claim from Musk. He previously indicated SpaceX offered to commission a rescue mission to retrieve the astronauts \u2014 perhaps expediting their return by months \u2014 to someone within the Biden White House, but his proposal was denied for \u201cpolitical reasons.\u201d Musk said he did not make the offer directly to NASA, though it\u2019s unclear why.\n\nNor is it clear what the details of that offer may have been and to whom, specifically, it was directed.\n\nA former senior Biden White House official and former senior NASA official previously told CNN they never heard such an offer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any communications that came directly to the White House, whether directly or indirectly, along the way \u2014 and there was a close team,\u201d the former Biden White House source said.\n\nNotably, NASA had said in December it was expecting to delay Crew-9\u2019s return because of SpaceX. Specifically, the company was tracking some hangups preparing a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule for Crew-10 \u2014 a mission with a fresh astronaut crew that had to arrive at the space station before Crew-9, carrying Wilmore and Williams, was allowed to disembark.\n\nNASA and SpaceX later opted to use a different capsule for the Crew-10 mission, a preflown Dragon vehicle."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, Steve Kornacki dives into how Democrats may be able to cut into the GOP\u2019s margins in a deep-red Florida House district in tomorrow\u2019s special election. Plus, we have more key numbers to know there and in Wisconsin ahead of a big state Supreme Court race.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nWhy Republicans are at risk of underperforming in a Florida special election\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nNo Democrat in America won a House seat last year in a district even remotely as pro-Trump as the two in Florida where special elections will be held Tuesday.\n\nTrump carried Florida\u2019s 1st District by 37 points and the 6th District by 30 points in 2024, according to NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk. The biggest margin for a Democratic-held seat that Trump won at the presidential level was 9 points, coming in Rep. Jared Golden\u2019s 2nd District in Maine.\n\nSo a Democratic win in either Florida race would be beyond stunning. The suspense is more about whether the party can take a bite out of those giant Trump margins and claim political momentum early in his second administration.\n\nThis is particularly the case in the 6th District, where Democrat Josh Weil has outraised Republican Randy Fine by a staggering margin and where early voting has hinted at an energized Democratic base \u2014 a dynamic that has been a pattern in special elections during the Trump era. And last year\u2019s presidential election results from the district suggest there\u2019s plenty of room for slippage for the GOP and overperformance from the Democrats.\n\nMuch of this is due to the growth in Trump\u2019s support from nonwhite voters, many of whom were younger and first-time voters without a history of participating in lower-turnout special elections. In November, they helped boost Trump\u2019s margin in Florida\u2019s 6th District by 6 points, from 24 points in 2020 up to 30. The two places where Trump gained the most new ground are significantly less white and less affluent than the district as a whole.\n\nIn Florida\u2019s 6th District, Trump\u2019s gains with nonwhite voters seem to have come in both heavily Latino and heavily Black areas. In precincts that are majority Black, he cut the Democratic margin from 53 points in 2020 down to 41, a 12-point improvement. The biggest single precinct-level shift toward Trump in the district (a net-gain of 57 points) came in a precinct that is 52% Black.\n\nA key question that emerged from 2024 is whether these types of gains are sustainable for Republicans without Trump on the ballot. Add in the lower-profile nature of this election and the task becomes that much tougher.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s gains were minimal in areas with higher concentrations of white, college-educated and affluent voters. It is among this demographic mix that Democrats have found their most energized supporters nationally during the Trump era. And given that turnout will be much lower on Tuesday than in November, an exercised cohort of anti-Trump, college-educated, white voters could punch well above its weight. The district also has plenty of retirees, and in areas where the average age is over 55, Trump only gained about two points last November.\n\nThis might not all add up to a Democratic win, but it could knock some points off that 30-point Trump margin.\n\nStay tuned tomorrow for Steve\u2019s breakdown of the key areas to watch in Wisconsin for the state Supreme Court election.\n\nTuesday's elections by the numbers\n\nBy Ben Kamisar, Bridget Bowman, Macklin Fishman, Adam Edelman and Scott Bland\n\nOutside of the Florida special elections, a state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin on Tuesday will also have major national implications.\n\nHere are the key numbers to know that have shaped these elections.\n\nA deluge of TV ads: The vast majority of the $80 million-plus spent since Jan. 1 on TV in these off-year elections has been in Wisconsin, where the contest between two state judges, Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel, has been the most expensive state Supreme Court race in history, surpassing Wisconsin\u2019s 2023 campaign.\n\nWisconsin has seen more than $70 million in TV ads on the court race (plus a bit more on other races on the ballot), according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Meanwhile, the special election in Florida\u2019s 1st District has seen $3.4 million in ads, and the one in the 6th District has seen $6.2 million through Election Day.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s spending: Billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk has played a major role in the uptick in spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nMusk\u2019s super PAC, America PAC, has spent $12.2 million and counting to boost Schimel. Musk also donated another $3 million to the state Republican Party. And he gave away million-dollar checks to petition signers at a recent event in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nMeanwhile, another group with links to Musk, the nonprofit Building America\u2019s Future, has also spent $4.8 million in Wisconsin. (It\u2019s unclear whether Musk is currently supporting that group.)\n\nThe biggest liberal-aligned group in the Wisconsin race has been A Better Wisconsin Together, which has spent $8.4 million to benefit Crawford.\n\nMusk\u2019s America PAC has also gotten involved in Florida, but with far smaller sums, dropping nearly $100,000 on phone calls and texts in the two races, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s posting: Musk isn\u2019t just pouring money into the race; he\u2019s been talking a lot about it, too.\n\nHe has posted or reposted 73 times on his X platform about the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this year, as of midday Monday. Most of those posts came in recent weeks, as his money and involvement in the campaign have become a central theme.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udc40 Zooming out: Moving at a rapid-fire clip, Trump has been concentrating power in his hands, pushing the bounds of executive authority while effectively muzzling an array of voices that pose threats to his agenda, Peter Nicholas and Sahil Kapur report.

            "full_content": "Jimmy who? Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nFor all his success in imposing his will on the federal government, Donald Trump may be deliberately engineering his own political downfall by mishandling the very job he was most certainly elected to perform: stewardship of the economy. The risks he\u2019s running were impressively summarized by Washington Post economics columnist Heather Long:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pushing the economy to a breaking point with sweeping tariffs and rapid cuts to immigration and the federal workforce. There is growing fear of not just a recession but stagflation, a frightful situation \u2014 not seen in the United States since the 1970s \u2014 in which the economy contracts and people lose jobs but prices remain high.\n\nThis is a self-inflicted wound from Trump. Many of his economic advisers, including Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore, are urging him to show restraint on tariffs. But Trump is set to unleash the biggest increase in tariffs since the Depression era on Wednesday. He\u2019s calling it \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d It may turn out to be Stagflation Day.\n\n\u201cStagflation\u201d (an economy characterized by both rapidly rising prices and slow growth) is the horrible bogeyman that economic policy wonks scare one another with around the campfire late at night. In theory, it\u2019s not supposed to happen because fiscal and monetary policies tend to push the economy either toward growth with price inflation or toward recession with low price inflation \u2026 or, ideally, toward steady growth accompanied by stable prices.\n\nBut stagflation can definitely happen, as the United States proved in the 1970s when inflation spurred by oil-price shocks and unemployment boosted by restrictive policies from the Federal Reserve gave the country the worst of all possible economic worlds. There were actually two moments of extreme stagflation: in 1975, when the core Consumer Price Index rose 9.1 percent while unemployment reached 8.5 percent, and in 1980, when core CPI was up 12.4 percent and unemployment was at 7.1 percent. Although the causes of this past era of stagflation were complex and some of the foreign and domestic policies of Richard Nixon were significantly responsible, its political consequences fell most heavily on his successors Gerald Ford (in office from August 1974 to January 1977) and Jimmy Carter (January 1977 to January 1981). It\u2019s not an accident that both men became the only electorally defeated incumbent presidents between Herbert Hoover and George H.W. Bush.\n\nTrump in 1980 when stagflation peaked. Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nTo assess the political risks associated with stagflation, it\u2019s important to understand that, despite their bumbling reputations as presidents, Ford and Carter took impressive political assets into their failed reelection campaigns. Ford inherited Nixon\u2019s massive landslide coalition from the 1972 presidential election and added a fresh image of openness, honesty, and bipartisanship. Carter put together a mind-bending coalition based on his strength in southern states that had been lost to Democrats for years and have not gone Democratic for any presidential candidate since. It took some work for either president to lose. But while both had other missteps (e.g., Ford\u2019s pardon of Nixon and Carter\u2019s mishandling of the Iran hostage situation), it\u2019s evident in retrospect that stagflation made both vulnerable to primary challenges (Ronald Reagan\u2019s against Ford, Ted Kennedy\u2019s against Carter) and ripe for defeat.\n\nIn comparing past presidents with Trump, it is very clear his 2024 win was uniquely attributable to the belief (to some extent based on dubious memories) that the U.S. economy had done well during his previous term in office, particularly compared with Joe Biden\u2019s inflation-plagued term. It\u2019s hard to imagine his already-limited popularity surviving a return to rising prices, particularly if there is also a surge in unemployment.\n\nNow, doubtless, Trump is arguing that the potential downside of his tariff program will soon give way to its manifest benefits once the wiseacres in the economics profession and the scaredy-cats of the stock markets are proved wrong in their near-universal expectation that protectionism and trade wars are very bad ideas. Is it possible Trump could survive a burst of stagflation and come out vindicated?\n\nIn the very era examined above, there is some precedent for a bounce-back of presidential popularity once stagflation abates. In Reagan\u2019s first term, the so-called misery index (combined inflation and unemployment) was at 18 percent in 1981 and 17.1 percent in 1982, no better than Carter\u2019s record. But by 1984, Reagan\u2019s reelection year, it was down to 12.5 percent and the positive trend caused the Gipper to claim it was \u201cmorning in America.\u201d Then again, Reagan pursued a simple austerity strategy for quelling inflation, and the subsequent recovery mostly reflected a cyclical development that was especially well timed for the 40th president. Trump is trying something very different with a mixed bag of economic policies that include public-sector austerity, big high-end tax cuts, and the highest tariffs since the Smoot-Hawley rates of the Hoover administration, all on a high wire of unstable congressional majorities, extreme partisan polarization, and likely midterm setbacks. It\u2019s really a big gamble, and if Trump miscalculates, his losses may exceed those he encountered in his ill-fated lurch into the casino business in the 1980s."

            "full_content": "Photo: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix\n\nMeghan Markle has taken a lot of flak for her two recent business endeavors: a Netflix lifestyle show and her product line, As ever. The eight-episode series With Love, Meghan pioneered \u201cnew frontiers in unrelatability,\u201d per Vulture, as the Duchess poured things from one container into a prettier container and passive-aggressively informed Mindy Kaling that her last name is now Sussex. Meanwhile, it\u2019s not entirely clear what products Meghan is selling (definitely food, maybe other stuff) or even how her brand\u2019s new name should be styled (\u201cAmerican Riviera Orchard\u201d is now either \u201cAs Ever\u201d or \u201cAs ever\u201d).\n\nNevertheless, like any true millennial girlboss, Meghan persisted. In a Monday-morning email to people who signed up for As ever updates, the Duchess of Sussex shed light on several of her products \u2014 but not too much light. The email does not say exactly when the products will go on sale. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to introduce the As ever collection to you this week,\u201d Meghan teases. A click on the absolutely stunning photo of raspberry-jam-drenched cr\u00eapes brings you to the As ever website, which is similarly vague. Eight items are shown \u2014 including honey, teas, and \u201cflower sprinkles\u201d \u2014 but don\u2019t bother looking for prices, product descriptions, or an exact launch date.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t learn a ton about Meghan\u2019s wares, the email is full of other useful information. For anyone who subscribed for updates about a British royal\u2019s Montecito-inspired home-goods brand but has never heard of cr\u00eapes, Meghan explains what they are (\u201cstreetside thin pancakes\u201d), what they can do (house various other foodstuffs), and their deeper essence (they are a \u201ccanvas for flavor\u201d).\n\nAnd there are even free tips! Worried about what you\u2019ll do with the packaging from your As ever raspberry spread, should you decide to purchase it for an unknown sum at some undetermined point in the future? Well, you can use the \u201ckeepsake packaging\u201d to hold \u201clove notes or special treasures\u201d and to \u201cremember this pivotal moment\u201d with Meghan.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all: Once you\u2019ve slathered every last drop of jam on those \u201ceasy to make\u201d cr\u00eapes, you can wash the jar out and use it for other stuff! Hopefully the Duchess has trademarked this idea; I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be huge on \u201cshabby chic\u201d wedding Pinterest boards.\n\nUpon further investigation, the most remarkable thing about the jar and its packaging is that Meghan has opted to present jam like fancy perfume:\n\nAnd a video posted to Instagram last week revealed that us plebs will receive factory-produced jam, not the handmade stuff that Meghan sent to several dozen celebrity friends:\n\nBut I am still looking forward to making the \u201ceveryday exceptional\u201d by reusing that jam box. I will surely \u201cthink of it as our time capsule\u201d to remember that time both Meghan and I were kind of confused about the nature of her brand."

            "full_content": "Photo: Chet Strange/Getty Images\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s biggest current star is an 83-year-old who has never technically belonged to it. Bernie Sanders continues to barnstorm across America, drawing tens of thousands of people at every destination, all of whom are desperate to combat Donald Trump, or at least hear from a politician who vocalizes their fury. The \u201cresistance,\u201d certainly, is not as pervasive or culturally widespread as it was eight years ago \u2014 the era of so-called hyperpolitics is mostly done \u2014 but it\u2019s bubbling up where politicians are showing any kind of fight. Sanders plainly is, and Democrats of all ideological stripes seem appreciative of the democratic-socialist senator from Vermont. Of late, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has joined him on the road, and there\u2019s renewed chatter that the 35-year-old member of Congress could run for president in 2028.\n\nSanders, unlike the rest of the Democrats, has never struggled over formulating a coherent political message. He has beliefs and he acts on them. And he understands the outrage many ordinary Americans feel about Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, laying waste to the federal bureaucracy. Hence the tour\u2019s crisp theme: oligarchy. Sanders has railed against income inequality and the influence of the ultrawealthy on American life for at least a half-century. His prominence now illustrates the power of a consistent, easily digestible message, and puts him in stark relief with the mainstream of his party, which conspicuously lacks one.\n\nThe overriding question is what comes next. Neither Sanders or the rest of the Democrats have a great answer. Next year\u2019s midterm elections should be favorable to them: Trump is increasingly unpopular, Americans are weary of DOGE and fearing a recession, and it\u2019s easy to imagine the fragile GOP majority in the House disappearing altogether. The Senate races are much tougher, given the growing share of rural states that vote Republican, but there\u2019s some hope there. At least two Republican-held states, Maine and North Carolina, could be flippable.\n\nBut for now, Democrats must wait. The rallies do offer catharsis, and it\u2019s hard for progressives to demand much more from Sanders since he has accomplished so much for the American left over the last decade. But those looking to build durable power in a post-Sanders world must wonder where this is all headed. The organization Sanders founded to bolster progressives across America, Our Revolution, has had a minimal impact on the political scene. The left-wing group does little beyond doling out endorsements and cash to favored candidates.\n\nA recent email from Our Revolution did seem to recognize that Sanders\u2019s enormous rallies are potential organizing opportunities, promising to mobilize \u201ccommunities to challenge Trump\u2019s regressive policies and demand that the Democratic Party embrace bold economic populism.\u201d The email boasted of \u201cmore than 9,000 members\u201d of Our Revolution \u2014 a minuscule number, especially for an organization that was formed in 2016 to be the political arm that drove Sanders\u2019s movement beyond his presidential campaigns. For context, the Democratic Socialists of America \u2014 which Sanders does not formally belong to \u2014 still claim close to 80,000 dues-paying members with active chapters across America. Notably, DSA is playing a central role in the rise of its New York City mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, but Our Revolution is nowhere to be found. It\u2019s far from becoming a major player in the Democratic Party, much less dominating it.\n\nThat Our Revolution is tangibly weaker than DSA may be an indictment of Sanders, but it\u2019s not as if center-left, Sanders-hating Democrats can feel much schadenfreude. The disaster of 2024 is one they must own. They tamped down any hopes of an open primary and pretended, until the very end, that Joe Biden was fit to run again. They didn\u2019t mind that Kamala Harris had no overarching campaign message, no compelling argument for the next four years.\n\nThese sorts of Democrats should wonder why it isn\u2019t Harris headlining massive anti-Trump rallies. The former vice-president is thought to be mulling running again in 2028. For Democrats, it would be ideal if they just moved on \u2014 there are plenty of fresh faces and more intriguing options \u2014 but the rank and file probably wouldn\u2019t mind seeing their last standard-bearer battle Trump in public. Barack Obama isn\u2019t anywhere to be found, either. (Few sentient adults want Biden near a political rally.) Absent leaders, Sanders has emerged as one. Were he ten years younger, he might have another presidential campaign in him. Now that he\u2019s in what could be his last Senate term, other Democrats must learn from his example and try, at least, to inspire people. It starts with having convictions and acting on them."

Coming soon, the Trump sons will be getting into the business of using ridiculous amounts of energy to feed computers so they can do complex math problems and eventually pop out coins. But if you think the Trumps will be learning the zeros and ones of crypto supercomputing, the deal will look a little different from that. They\u2019ve really just taken one of their many business entities \u2014 a company you\u2019ve definitely heard of called American Data Centers, Inc. \u2014 and merged it with an already-functioning crypto-mining firm. The Trumps and their fellow investors will get 20 percent of the profits moving forward, with Eric serving as strategy officer.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, we\u2019ve backed our conviction in bitcoin, personally and through our businesses,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement. \u201cFrom the start\u201d may be a stretch, considering his father was calling cryptocurrency a scam as recently as 2021. But ever since Trump Jr. helped convince the family head that cryptocurrency was a great way to monetize the family name, Team Trump has been all in on bitcoin and other, lesser coins. Since he was elected for the second time, the Trump crypto rush has been nonstop.\n\nThere was Donald Trump\u2019s meme coin, $Trump, which earned more than $100 million in trading fees alone in January before plummeting in value. Then people in the know made millions on Melania before it immediately tanked. As Trump has pushed for an end to enforcement by regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, he has continued with his crypto plans and glaring conflicts of interest. Last week, Trump launched a crypto investment fund two days after the SEC killed its probe into the company Trump teamed up with. Also last week, a company run by Trump\u2019s eldest sons announced the launch of a stablecoin, a cryptocurrency pegged to treasuries and the U.S. dollar to help provide liquidity for trades. They did so the day before Republicans in Congress put forward a new bill on how to regulate such tokens.\n\nAt a crypto conference last week, Trump Jr. had high expectations for how much money he intends to make in the new crypto era ushered in by his father. \u201cThe sky is the limit for this,\u201d he said.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Photo: Bonnie Cash/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFor many Americans, the big political question is how much of this country as we have known it will be left when Donald Trump leaves the White House in 2029. In an apparent effort to troll Trump\u2019s detractors, MAGA folk keep calling for a third Trump term. And the president himself keeps bringing it up. It has become something of a game for journalists to force Trump to come to grips with the constitutional barriers to a third term (most notably the 22d Amendment, which flatly rules it out). And when NBC News confronted him with that simple fact on Sunday, he rather mysteriously said \u201cthere are methods\u201d whereby he could stay in office beyond the 2028 election.\n\nTo make it worse, Trump said of exploring a third term, \u201cI\u2019m not joking\u201d \u2014 yet he would not further clarify his intentions. This could be Trumpian bluster, but then again, this is a president who appears to be deadly serious about almost-equally preposterous ideas like the military conquest of Greenland.\n\nTo be clear, there is no constitutional path to a Trump third term. The 22nd Amendment, enacted by a Republican Congress infuriated by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s four consecutive presidential-election victories, is categorical: No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice. This amendment wasn\u2019t just a momentary act of partisan spite, either: It essentially codified a tradition set by George Washington, which lasted until the combined emergencies of the Great Depression, then an impending World War II gave FDR an opening to violate that tradition, not without great controversy. Presidents who even considered a third-term bid prior to Roosevelt (notably Ulysses Grant in 1880 and Woodrow Wilson in 1920) were met with considerable public hostility and accusations of dictatorial intentions.\n\nThere is no exception for presidents serving nonconsecutive terms, as Steve Bannon has fatuously suggested. The dodge most often discussed by Trump fans is a scheme whereby the incumbent would run for vice-president in 2028 with, say, J.D. Vance at the top of the ticket, who would quickly resign and let The Boss stay right there in the Oval Office. But this is very clearly banned by the 12th Amendment, which holds that No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States. Sure, you can contrive some wild scenario where Trump would be elected House Speaker, then both the duly elected president and vice-president would resign to return him to power. But obviously, that would require a cult of personality beyond any precedent in America, or much of anywhere else other than clearly authoritarian regimes like Stalin\u2019s USSR, Mao\u2019s China, or Per\u00f3n\u2019s Argentina.\n\nIn theory, of course, the Constitution could be amended to allow Trump a third term, the presidency in perpetuity, or perhaps a title like \u201cemperor of America, Canada, and Greenland.\u201d But there is a reason the Constitution hasn\u2019t been amended since 1992, when the very popular idea of barring members of Congress from voting themselves instant pay raises was added. There is no foreseeable situation where the two-thirds votes in both houses of Congress required to let Trump stick around would exist, unless the Democratic Party has somehow been banned. Even if that happened, three-fourths of the state legislatures would have to ratify it. Republicans are ten short of that number in legislatures they control.\n\nIn other words, the only way Trump can get around the various obstacles to another term would be through some extra-constitutional action that suspends all barriers to his power or disables the opposition to create a one-party state (say, via a Reichstag Fire situation where the Insurrection Act is invoked to ban non-GOP political parties). If that happens, little trifles like hallowed democratic institutions or even the express language of the U.S. Constitution would no longer matter."

Gen. Christopher Norrie, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division, called the soldiers \"a part of our family.\"\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe bodies of three of the four US soldiers who were reported missing after their vehicle was submerged in a bog in Lithuania last week have been recovered, the Army announced on Monday. The vehicle has also been recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Soldiers we have lost in this tragedy were not just Soldiers - they were a part of our family. Our hearts are heavy with a sorrow that echoes across the whole Marne Division, both forward and at home,\u201d Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary \u2018Dogface Soldiers\u2019 during this unimaginable time. But the search isn\u2019t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.\u201d\n\nSearch and recovery operations continue to find the fourth soldier, the statement said.\n\nThe four soldiers were assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, Georgia. Their identities are being until their families are notified.\n\nLithuania\u2019s President Gitanas Naus\u0117da said his country is mourning the loss of the soldiers.\n\n\u201cLithuania mourns together with the American nation. Please accept my heartfelt condolences, as well as those of the Lithuanian people, to you, the loved ones of those who lost their lives, and all the people of the United States of America. During this difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with you,\u201d he said in a tweet that tagged President Donald Trump.\n\nThe soldiers and vehicle, an M88 Hercules, have been missing since the early morning of March 25 when they were conducting a maintenance training mission, recovering another US vehicle in a Lithuania training area. The M88 was found the morning of March 26; US and partner military forces have been working around the clock since to pull the nearly 70-ton vehicle out of the bog.\n\nThe recovery effort involved \u201ctremendous resources from Lithuania,\u201d as well as \u201chundreds of service members from the US Army, US Navy, Lithuanian Armed Forces and the Polish Armed Forces\u2014along with other elements from the Lithuanian government and civilian agencies.\u201d\n\nIndeed, other officials have pointed to the recovery operation as a prime example of the importance of relationships with US allies abroad \u2014 a position that has been strained in recent weeks as Trump administration officials have railed against partner nations for not doing enough, largely regarding the war in Ukraine and NATO funding.\n\nAn Army official told CNN that troops on the ground \u201csee things that others might not\u201d regarding working with allies, and the recovery operation of the last few days has only further shown that.\n\n\u201cFor us, that\u2019s politics, that\u2019s not our bailiwick. \u2026 For those that say our allies aren\u2019t doing enough, those are people that didn\u2019t see this,\u201d the official said. \u201cThose are people that didn\u2019t pay attention to this, that weren\u2019t watching. For all of us soldier, I think if I was the one in that Hercules, Lithuania is the country I would want helping to bring me home to my family.\u201d\n\nAfter finding the submerged vehicle, Lithuanian divers were on the scene \u201cvery rapidly,\u201d Maj. Nicholas Chopp, spokesman for US Army Europe and Africa, told CNN. Poland also started mobilizing dozens of engineers and sappers, or combat engineers.\n\n\u201cThere was literally chief of defense to chief of defense conversations happening between Lithuania and Poland\u201d to coordinate support, Chopp said. He added that the Lithuanian defense minister and prime Minister were on the ground at the recovery site nearly every day, if not daily, to \u201ccome talk to the rescuers on the ground and say, \u2018What do you need that you don\u2019t have?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an entire country bent towards these efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Army\u2019s release on Monday said Lithuania provided helicopters, drones, fixed-wing aircraft, and search and rescue personnel, as well as excavators, pumps to get water out of the bog\ufeff, various technical experts, and \u201cother heavy construction equipment.\u201d The Army official said Lithuania has not asked to be reimbursed for their efforts in the recovery, saying everything they\u2019ve done \u201cis out of pocket.\u201d\n\nThe release on Monday also said the Archbishop Metropolitan of Vilnius \u201cled a mass at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Stanislaus and St. Ladislaus of Vilnius, March 30, to pray for the four Soldiers, their families, and those conducting recovery operations.\u201d\n\nCol. Martin O\u2019Donnell, spokesman for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, told CNN that allies helping allies is \u201cwhat an alliance is all about.\u201d\n\n\u201c[NATO] and these allies have done and continue to do all they can to recover America\u2019s missing soldiers,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cAs the Lithuanian Minister of Defense said earlier this week, \u2018just as America doesn\u2019t leave its own behind, we in Lithuania don\u2019t leave our own behind either.\u2019\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump used contentiousness around transgender people\u2019s access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds. And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt\u2019s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board \u2014 particularly Trump\u2019s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies \u2014 along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president\u2019s spotlight is giving Monday\u2019s Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n\u201cWhat he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,\u201d said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. \u201cWe have to show him we won\u2019t go back.\u201d\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nThe focus on trans people is part of a long-running campaign\n\nTrump\u2019s actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women\u2019s spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort \u201cto reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land\u201d that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt\u2019s not just political gamesmanship. \u201cI think that whether or not that\u2019s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,\u201d Fordham\u2019s Murib said.\n\nMany voters think trans rights have gone too far\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election \u2014 55% \u2014 said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn\u2019t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris\u2019 voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it\u2019s been about right and about one-quarter said it\u2019s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump\u2019s and Republicans\u2019 positions have given them a political edge.\n\n\u201cThey are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\u201cPeople across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,\u201d said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nThe full political fallout remains to be seen\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s so small, it\u2019s relatively unknown,\u201d said Currah, who is transgender. \u201cAnd then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what\u2019s wrong with the left. You know: \u2018It\u2019s just too crazy. It\u2019s too woke.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n\u201cA lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,\u201d Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n\u201cThe Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,\u201d National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women\u2019s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women\u2019s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience \u2026 to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,\u201d she said. But \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nNearly a dozen known students and faculty members at colleges across the country have been detained by federal agents amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration, which on college campuses, has taken aim at pro-Palestinian student activists and Israel critics.\n\nMany of those detained have been granted the right to live in the US either as permanent residents or through temporary work or student visas. Their rights, however, have been put into question under new, sweeping immigration orders that some legal experts fear may be used liberally to clamp down on dissent.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that under his direction, more than 300 visas \u2013\u2013 \u201cprimarily student visas, some visitor visas\u201d \u2013\u2013 have been revoked. Rubio did not specify how many visas belonged to people tied to the pro-Palestinian movement.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re taking activities that are counter to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we\u2019ll revoke the visa,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nWhen asked about freedom of speech concerns, Rubio said international students are \u201chere to study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here to go to class. They\u2019re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it\u2019s lunacy to continue to allow that.\u201d\n\nHere is what we know about the detainment of college activists.\n\nMahmoud Khalil\n\nMahmoud Khalil speaks during a press briefing organized by pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus on June 1, 2024, in New York City. Selcuk Acar/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and one of the school\u2019s most prominent pro-Palestinian activists, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nHe was arrested by federal agents on March 8 and taken to a detention facility in Louisiana after his lawyer said his green card was revoked by the Trump administration.\n\nThe administration ordered for Khalil to be deported after baselessly claiming he is a Hamas sympathizer, a threat to national security, and poses \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d\n\nOfficials later said Khalil\u2019s deportation was justified because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident \u2013\u2013 an argument his attorneys call weak.\n\nOn March 19, a judge blocked the government indefinitely from deporting Khalil and transferred his case to New Jersey.\n\nSince his detention, Department of Justice officials have sought to keep Khalil\u2019s case in Louisiana \u2013\u2013 a move which Khalil\u2019s legal team argue will cause hardship for his attorneys and his family.\n\nA federal district court on Friday declined to say whether the US government\u2019s case against Khalil should be heard in New Jersey. Khalil\u2019s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is an American citizen and 8 months pregnant, sat in the front row of the gallery during the proceedings.\n\nBadar Khan Suri\n\nFlyers in support of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University professor, are seen, demanding his release from a deportation process over his views on Palestinians and the war in Gaza, at Georgetown University in Washington. Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nBadar Khan Suri, an Indian national and Georgetown scholar whose research focuses on peacebuilding in the Middle East was arrested in his Virginia home in mid-March after his J-1 visa was revoked.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Khan Suri was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d and that he had \u201cclose connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d\n\nLike other student detainees, Khan Suri has been accused of posing a threat to national security. He is currently being held in detention in Louisiana.\n\nHis defense team denies the US government claims and argues Khan Suri\u2019s detainment is part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to clamp down on individuals \u201cpurportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech,\u201d according to his court petition.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s attorney also believes he\u2019s being targeted because his wife is a prominent Palestinian activist.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as Deputy of Foreign Affairs in Gaza until 2010, according to a court filing.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a Georgetown University spokesperson said, \u201cWe expect the legal system to adjudicate (Khan Suri\u2019s) case fairly.\u201d\n\nRumeysa Ozturk\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, poses in an undated photograph provided by her family and obtained by Reuters. Ozturk Family/Reuters\n\nTurkish national Rumeysa Ozturk was on her way to break the Ramadan fast in late March when she was arrested and physically restrained by six plainclothes officers near her apartment by Tufts University\u2019s Somerville campus.\n\nThe arrest, which was captured on surveillance video, was described by Tufts President Sunil Kumar as \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nIn March 2024, the PhD student cowrote an op-ed in the school\u2019s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts\u2019 response to a student government group\u2019s call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands.\n\nWhen asked about Ozturk\u2019s case, Rubio suggested, without evidence, that the 30-year-old participated in disruptive student protests over Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza.\n\nA DHS spokesperson told CNN that Ozturk \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas,\u201d but did not specify what those alleged activities were.\n\nOzturk is currently being held at a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to Homeland Security. While in transit to Louisiana, she suffered an asthma attack, according to an amended habeas corpus petition filed Friday. Ozturk has also not been charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer.\n\nOn Friday, a judge in Boston ordered Ozturk not to be deported until she can determine whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if Ozturk was lawfully detained \u2013\u2013 a decision that drew praise from Ozturk\u2019s lawyers.\n\nA student at the University of Minnesota\n\nThe University of Minnesota said in a campus-wide letter that an international graduate student was detained by immigration officials at an off-campus residence.\n\nThe university did not identify the student but called their arrest \u201ca deeply concerning situation.\u201d\n\nDHS initially declined to comment to CNN on the case and deferred questions to ICE. The attorney for the detained student also declined to comment to CNN, saying it\u2019s a \u201chighly sensitive situation\u201d and they want to protect their client\u2019s privacy.\n\nOn Monday, a senior DHS official told CNN the student was taken into custody because of a prior drunken driving incident.\n\n\u201cThis is not related to student protests,\u201d the official said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThe individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.\u201d\n\nDetaining an international student over a prior DUI conviction seems to suggest a different approach by immigration officials who, so far, appear focused on students who have participated in protests against the Israel Hamas war.\n\nThe unidentified student\u2019s detainment has drawn the ire of local, state and national leaders like Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Democratic Minnesota Gov, Tim Walz \u2013\u2013 all who are demanding answers from ICE.\n\nOther students and scholars targeted\n\nRasha Alawieh, an assistant professor with a valid US visa at Brown Medical School, was deported from Boston to Lebanon after federal agents discovered that she attended former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s funeral in February.

            "full_content": "Tim Walz at a town-hall meeting in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in March. Photo: Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Minnesota Star Tribune/Getty Images\n\nEvery Democrat seems to have their own diagnosis for why the party lost power in Washington last year, but only one of them was on the vice-presidential ticket. Minnesota governor Tim Walz catapulted himself over other Democrats to be Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate by famously calling Republicans, especially J.D. Vance, weird. Today, he has a label for his own party: \u201ctimid.\u201d\n\nFor the past several weeks, Walz has been barnstorming Republican congressional districts to press the case for his party, which has hit rock-bottom approval with its own voters for not fighting harder against Donald Trump. I spoke with him a few hours before a town-hall meeting outside Houston with Beto O\u2019Rourke that drew thousands, where Walz argued that Democrats had let Republicans define DEI and immigration, issues they hammered the party on in 2024. Looking at crowd size alone, Walz seems to be on to something: Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez and Bernie Sanders have drawn even larger crowds of tens of thousands to hear their prescription for \u201cfighting oligarchy.\u201d In our interview, Walz faulted his party for not delivering major change for voters during the Trump era, even saying Harris wasn\u2019t allowed to be bold enough after replacing Joe Biden as the nominee. Democrats, he said, could have the same sort of success he has had in Minnesota during two terms, but the party is afraid to be bold.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the meaning of these crowds we\u2019re seeing for you, AOC, and Bernie?\n\nIt\u2019s good, and it\u2019s good for my soul, too, because after these first couple months I was deeply concerned, and remain concerned, that folks had become disengaged and with the number of people who did not vote. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d But it doesn\u2019t appear that\u2019s happening. I think the Democratic Party would be wise to listen to what folks are saying, to understand why they\u2019re willing to wait in line, and to take some lessons from that. How do we not be a party that seems very misunderstood by a lot of the public?\n\nDoes that mean the people coming to these events were engaged and voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024?\n\nYeah, I think a lot of them were. I felt a primal scream of \u201cJust do something!\u201d People want to be engaged and make a difference, and they don\u2019t know what that looks like. So I think this is a way to gather in community.\n\nAre any of these people ones who didn\u2019t come out to vote or who voted for Trump?\n\nYes. A woman wore a Marianne Williamson shirt the other day to my event in Wisconsin, and she said, \u201cI want to give Democrats a chance.\u201d She was there because she does not agree with Donald Trump, but she wasn\u2019t sure about the Democrats. Look, I think it\u2019s mostly folks who supported the vice-president and myself, but that\u2019s not totally it. And then there\u2019s a lot of folks who are showing up who maybe voted, maybe hadn\u2019t, but the implications of these policies are raining down on them.\n\nThere was a transgender airwoman in Omaha \u2014 highly specialized, highly trained \u2014 who wasn\u2019t able to deploy. I have no idea what her politics were beforehand, but she was there to ask a very specific question: \u201cWhat happens to me now?\u201d So it\u2019s that. \u201cWhat happens to my Parkinson\u2019s disease?\u201d \u201cWhat happens to my son who\u2019s got a million-dollar insurance bill and we\u2019re using Medicaid?\u201d Those are the people showing up.\n\nWhat is the elevator pitch for the Democratic Party?\n\nWhen I was growing up, there was little question the Democratic Party was there for labor unions, was there for workers, and the Republican Party was there for the wealthy \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t necessarily a pejorative, it was just the way it was. Apparently, now, whether it\u2019s our low approval ratings or the millions who stayed home, people aren\u2019t so certain that\u2019s true. I think our policies are popular: paid family medical leave, protection of reproductive rights, investments in infrastructure. But that\u2019s not getting to them.\n\nI keep saying this, and the teacher in me knows this so well: You teach a lesson, and a big chunk of kids don\u2019t get it or don\u2019t understand the concept. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re dumb; you have to teach it differently. Not everybody learns by verbal. Not everyone learns by seeing it. Some of them have to touch. Some of them have to do it themselves. Some of them have to do trial and error.\n\nWe as the Democrats think if there\u2019s a golden message and we get a charismatic leader and we just send it out, everybody\u2019s going to gravitate to us. A whole large number do, and I\u2019ve been making the case that in these special elections, these off-year elections, we do really well. Those are people who watch the news every night. But during a presidential year, there are folks who are busy, they don\u2019t live politics all the time, and we apparently don\u2019t reach them in any meaningful way. This has happened for three cycles. So I\u2019m listening to folks, saying, \u201cWhat can we do to resonate with you better?\u201d\n\nBut even in cycles where Democrats were ultimately successful, it has felt like the party\u2019s self-critique centered on better messaging. To me, this cycle\u2019s results suggest there needs to be bigger change than just reaching voters where they are.\n\nCritics keep saying, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got to message better to them.\u201d Well, I\u2019m not going to demonize immigrants, and I\u2019m not going to advocate for terrorists [after the interview, a spokesman said Walz was referring to defending Vladimir Putin and foreign dictators], and I\u2019m not going to do a white-power thing. I\u2019m not going to get rid of saying \u201cOur diversity is our strength.\u201d\n\nLook, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re very entertaining, either, like Bill Clinton playing his saxophone.\n\nWe need to make sure there\u2019s something in this party for you. The folks who are MAGA got a common uniform, a common language, common things they talk about. Democrats, don\u2019t know if we have that. But look, our policies poll favorably, so if that\u2019s the case yet people are voting against them, then we\u2019re not reaching them, we\u2019re not doing it right, the messenger\u2019s wrong. We need to look at it all.\n\nEven the most prominent Democrats are looking to keep some kind of distance from the party. AOC is aligned with Democratic Socialists. Bernie Sanders is an independent. And you identify as a member of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, a DFL-er, correct?\n\nI\u2019m a DFL-er, yeah.\n\nWhy not identify as a Democrat? I mean, you were on the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nYeah, no, you\u2019re on to it. Look, I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t have this worked out in my mind yet, but you hit on something I\u2019ve been talking about. If it were up to me, since I\u2019m a DFL-er, I think we message our party as Democratic-farmer-labor, Democratic-worker-labor, and get more to the core of who we are. Because sometimes your brand gets damaged, you know?\n\nShould Chuck Schumer stay on as leader?\n\nWell, the Senate\u2019s got to make its own decision on that.\n\nWhat do you say to the people who ask why they should listen to you or to other prominent Democratic officials at this point?\n\nWell, I\u2019m going to say this: I take my lumps, and I\u2019m a team player, and as I say, I am proud to have been with the vice-president. But my work has been done in Minnesota, where we won. We also had a Democratic trifecta where we passed incredibly important legislation with a very slim majority \u2014 things that are very popular. So I have made the case that we are too timid. If you think we win back the presidency in \u201928 and you think we\u2019re going to pass some subsidies for the ACA exchange, you\u2019re sadly mistaken. The people who stand up at my town hall and say, \u201cMy God, I can\u2019t do this anymore. My entire life is dependent on what happens with each presidential election\u201d \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be that way. Health care should transcend presidential elections. So I\u2019ve been making the case \u2014 and we did it in Minnesota, and I think you\u2019re seeing it in some other states \u2014 to be bold. I think that\u2019s the AOC-Bernie message, too.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like the party was very bold when you and Harris got on the ticket in the latter half of the 2024 campaign.\n\nI think we\u2019re cautious by nature. And look, I said this and I told the vice-president, I said I know my strengths and weaknesses. I said about 90 percent of the time, I can be really good, but about 10 percent of the time, I can be a train wreck because I\u2019m speaking from the heart, like a teacher sitting in a teachers lounge or a laborer sitting at the break table.\n\nI thought they would choose the district attorney and the teacher over the hedge-fund manager and the billionaire.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they?\n\nI don\u2019t \u2014 look, the folks who voted for Trump are going to vote for Trump. My biggest concern are the folks who stayed home. And that goes back to this idea of what the Democratic Party is, who\u2019s standing with us, and \u201cWho do I identify more with?\u201d Maybe we\u2019re not aspirational.\n\nI heard this from someone who said, \u201cWith Democratic go-to messages, basically to Black men, these Democratic politicians led with \u2018We restored felon voting rights,\u2019 and the Black men said, \u2018But we\u2019re not felons, we\u2019re MBAs looking for capital.\u2019\u201d The restoration of felon voting rights is important \u2014 I did that in Minnesota \u2014 but it\u2019s not aspirational. With Donald Trump, everything\u2019s gold plated and he\u2019s hanging around with these stars, and I don\u2019t know if we do enough of that.\n\nYou\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t have an opportunity to be bold during the campaign?\n\nWell, I won\u2019t critique the campaign. They need to do what they need to do, but I don\u2019t think Vice-President Harris got to be bold. We were dealing with a short runway. That was that one election. I think it would be foolish for us to take a ton of lessons from that because this has been going on for several cycles, certainly since 2016, that we are really struggling to broaden our appeal and energize folks.\n\nWhat does being bolder look like?\n\nWe\u2019re asking them to come to rallies not so we can get capital and get reelected but so we can burn it as fast as we can to improve their lives. I heard Ezra Klein say, \u201cYeah, Biden was incredibly bold,\u201d and I talked about this: \u201cMore money ever invested in broadband ever,\u201d and we\u2019ve connected like 12 houses. We didn\u2019t get it done. I think this goes back to the bureaucracy. This goes back to us status quo\u2013ing. Look, I\u2019m not going to do the Republican message that government\u2019s horrible, it should get out of our way, it should be involved in nothing. But I am going to say if you\u2019re going to believe in collective will, you need to get it done for people. We need to tell \u2019em we\u2019re going to burn this political capital and we\u2019re going to get these things done whether that is health care, whether that is paid family medical leave, whether that is moving toward climate policies that make sense rather than just talking about it. I think a lot of folks like what the Democrats are saying, but they don\u2019t believe we can get it done.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of scandal right now with the Trump administration, and I don\u2019t see any actual damaging consequences, like with the Signal fiasco. How do you fight, given that?\n\nI agree. Look, there\u2019s nobody who has served in the military who\u2019s buying this bullshit between attack plans and war plans. They were telegraphing where our troops would be before they would be there. My question is will the press give them a pass? Trump saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what was really going on\u201d? What the hell?\n\nKaroline Leavitt is yelling at the Wall Street Journal op-ed page. It feels like the press isn\u2019t sleeping on this scandal.\n\nYeah. No, you\u2019re right. I hope they hold them accountable. We just need a few courageous Republicans.\n\nAnd some Democrats, though, right?\n\nI agree. I saw Tammy Duckworth give the most full-throated talk. I saw Marty Heinrich talk about this. I saw Andy Kim. And look, I\u2019m around some fairly conservative folks saying, \u201cI can\u2019t defend this.\u201d We need to tap into that. At a minimum, I would\u2019ve thought they\u2019d have fired Mike Waltz, which would\u2019ve been good for me because I\u2019m tired of people getting confused.\n\nThis is the time for us to find our spine, push \u2019em \u2014 this should\u2019ve been and would\u2019ve been a slam dunk. It was a screwup. Somebody should\u2019ve taken accountability \u2014 the president \u2014 and they should\u2019ve let these people go. And I hope that\u2019s how it ends."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nRanjani Srinivasan was busy talking to an adviser at Columbia University when the federal agents first came to her door. The day before she\u2019d got an unexpected email that her student visa had been canceled, and she was trying to get information.\n\n\u201cIt was my roommate who heard the knock and immediately recognized (it as) law enforcement,\u201d Srinivasan told CNN. \u201cShe asked them \u2018Do you have a warrant?\u2019 And they had to say \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was stunned and scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember telling the adviser \u2018ICE is at my door and you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m fine? Do something.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey returned another day, also without a warrant, Srinivasan said. Matters escalated when they came a third time, with a judge\u2019s permission to enter the Columbia apartment. By then she had already left the country.\n\nThe biggest question for Srinivasan is why they came at all.\n\nSrinivasan had renewed her student visa just a few months earlier, being granted permission for another five years in the United States \u2014 more than enough time to complete her PhD in urban planning. She was no stranger to immigration rules, having won a Fulbright scholarship to Harvard University for her master\u2019s degree and then returning to her native India for the requisite two years after.\n\nHer dream acceptance at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation coincided with the beginning of the Covid pandemic, so she started her studies in Chennai, India, before making it to New York City.\n\nBy last month, the end of her doctorate was almost in sight, she was grading papers for the students she was teaching and fretting over a deadline for a journal. Far from her mind was a night almost a year before when she got caught up in a crowd.\n\nThat evening in April 2024 she\u2019d been trying to get back to her university apartment from a staff picnic when she was swept up in a police operation against a crowd protesting Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza, she said.\n\nI did not mean to deceive anyone \u2026 If I made a mistake, I would have been happy to clarify it to the state Ranjani Srinivasan\n\nSrinivasan had only just returned to the US, having been away from Columbia since before the war began and generated passionate protests. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know what was going to happen that day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole perimeter of the neighborhood had been barricaded.\u201d Unable to prove she lived there, she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to her street, so she ended up circling the neighborhood, looking for a way through, she told CNN.\n\n\u201cThey kept shifting the barricades, and then I think around 200 cops descended, and they kind of charged at us. It was absolute confusion. People were screaming, falling, people were running out of the way,\u201d she said. Too small to force her way through the melee, she ended up in a large group of people detained by the police.\n\nShe said she was held with the crowd for several hours but never fingerprinted or booked for an arrest. She was given two pink-colored summonses by the New York Police Department \u2014 one for obstructing pedestrian traffic and the other for failure to disperse \u2014 before being released. A lawyer working pro bono for a number of the students got the summonses dismissed even before she had to appear in court. That means there should be no record against her, and as far as Srinivasan was concerned, she could forget the whole thing.\n\nShe did not report the dismissed summonses on her visa renewal.\n\nWhen asked why Srinivasan\u2019s visa was revoked, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement \u201cthese citations were not disclosed.\u201d\n\nThat was never mentioned to Srinivasan when she was told her visa had been taken away.\n\n\u201cI did not mean to deceive anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I made a mistake, I would have been happy to clarify it to the state.\u201d\n\nBut she was never given the chance.\n\n\u2018A punitive dragnet\u2019\n\nAccording to local so-called sanctuary laws, federal authorities should not have even known Srinivasan had ever been detained, according to her lawyer, Nathan Yaffe.\n\n\u201cNew York City is supposed to have protections in place to prevent people who don\u2019t commit crimes, who haven\u2019t been in any kind of trouble, from getting caught in this sort of punitive dragnet that the administration is implementing here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut clearly the federal government has access to the summons database or to other data that allows them to see even when people aren\u2019t fingerprinted, even when people don\u2019t have any criminal case, even when the only allegation against them is entirely dismissed.\u201d\n\nIt was very clear to her, rightly so, that this government would stop at nothing to pursue her, even though their pursuit of her was based on nothing Nathan Yaffe, Srinivasan's lawyer\n\nNo one from DHS, the NYPD or Columbia University responded to CNN requests about how federal authorities became aware of this case. When asked about Srinivasan by CNN at a news conference, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said: \u201cI\u2019ll say it over and over again: New York City Police Department, they do not collaborate for civil enforcement.\u201d He said he would look into it but his office has not got back to CNN.\n\nFor Srinivasan, the sudden escalation was alarming. She says she had attended protests in her time in the US, but as much to experience American culture as to exercise free speech.\n\nDemonstrators rally outside Columbia University in upper Manhattan on March 14. Dave Sanders/The New York Times/Redux\n\nBut she was seeing others being detained under orders from the Trump administration and was afraid.\n\n\u201cYou keep going back, thinking \u2018Have I done something?\u2019 And there are no answers there,\u201d she said.\n\nShe knew Columbia University graduate student and US permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and put in detention in Louisiana, and did not want to take that risk.\n\n\u201cIt was very clear to her, rightly so, that this government would stop at nothing to pursue her, even though their pursuit of her was based on nothing,\u201d Yaffe said.\n\nSrinivasan went to LaGuardia Airport and took a flight to Canada.\n\nAgents searched her home\n\nGovernment officers, now in possession of a warrant, went back to her apartment.\n\nFour agents, three with their faces covered, spent several minutes inside.\n\nThey asked Srinivasan\u2019s roommate to stay in her room. \u201cIf not, you can leave,\u201d one agent said, as heard on a video recording taken by the roommate that CNN has viewed.\n\nAnother said he would explain the warrant \u201cif you would like to put down your phone.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security on X\n\n\u201cWe have a warrant to search this premises for electronics, documents related to Ranjani Srinivasan,\u201d continued the officer who identified himself as coming from \u201cHomeland Security\u201d as the roommate recorded. \u201cDid you get enough video?\u201d he added.\n\nThe officers left, taking nothing for evidence.\n\nA DHS news release heralded Srinivasan\u2019s departure but did not mention unreported summonses, instead alleging she was \u201cinvolved in activities supporting Hamas.\u201d The release was headlined: \u201cColumbia University Student Whose Visa Was Revoked for Supporting Hamas and Terrorist Activities Used CBP Home App to Self-Deport.\u201d The app, introduced the day before Srinivasan left, includes a feature for immigrants without legal permission to be in the US to inform the government they intend to depart.\n\nThere was also a damning post on X from Secretary Kristi Noem: \u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country. I\u2019m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport.\u201d\n\nYaffe said the statements about Srinivasan were \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has basically been a private person, pursuing her studies and pursuing her career,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a student, and they not only took that away from her in the sense of forcing her out of the country \u2026 but they also took away her privacy, obviously, and made her the huge public face of this campaign of repression that they\u2019re undertaking with the deliberate desire, as the administration has said, to send a message to other students.\u201d\n\nSrinivasan also takes issue with how she was portrayed. She denies using the CBP Home app, saying it wasn\u2019t on her phone and anyway her device was almost dead at the airport. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the app existed. I just left,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for her politics, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not a terrorist sympathizer, I\u2019m not a pro-Hamas activist. I\u2019m just literally a random student \u2026 It just seems very strange that they would spend so much, vast resources, in persecuting me.\u201d\n\nFor now, she\u2019s trying to stay optimistic about getting back to her life and doctorate. She was due to complete it in May. She hopes somehow Columbia can reenroll her so her five years of study with them is not for naught.\n\nBut she\u2019s unhappy with the actions of the Ivy League school, which has made policy changes apparently to address demands from the Trump administration since she left. The interim president of Columbia University stepped down the following week.\n\n\u201cI do think that Columbia should have protected me against this. I think that that\u2019s part of their mandate,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re attracting these international students to come and study at Columbia, when you go and do outreach all across the world to attract the best and the brightest, you have a mandate to protect them.\u201d\n\nShe might be an expert in planning, but Srinivasan is not trying to look too far ahead and is set on two goals.\n\n\u201cI want my PhD. I want my name cleared.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Green Bay, Wisconsin CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk has thrust himself into the center of a state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. Democrats are trying to use it to their advantage.\n\nIn the final stretch of the election, Musk has intensified his involvement in the contest, pouring millions of his personal fortune into the state to boost the conservative candidate, Brad Schimel. On Sunday, the tech billionaire made the trek to Wisconsin to directly pitch voters and handed out two $1 million checks to attendees at a town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got to mobilize everywhere like crazy for the next 48 hours,\u201d said Musk, who started the event wearing a cheesehead that he threw into the crowd. \u201cI think this will be important for the future of civilization. It\u2019s that significant.\u201d\n\nThe liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, and her Democratic allies are using Musk\u2019s involvement to frame the race as a referendum on him, betting it will motivate voters turned off by his big spending on the race or by DOGE efforts to slash the federal government.\n\nDane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Crawford, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, greets supporters during a campaign stop in Milwaukee on Saturday. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe push comes as the April 1 contest is set to provide the first electoral gauge of voter sentiment in the opening months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, in which Musk and DOGE have played a central role. The race also will test Musk\u2019s influence on local races after he spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to aid Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign.\n\nThe matchup between Crawford, a Dane County Circuit Court judge, and Schimel, a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and former state attorney general, will determine the ideological balance of Wisconsin\u2019s high court, which currently has a liberal majority. The contest is officially nonpartisan but has attracted attention from the national political parties and will offer insight into how the swing state\u2019s voters are assessing the early months of Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nIn the first major election of the year, Musk and groups aligned with him have poured more than $20 million into the race. America PAC, the super PAC Musk formed to support Trump in 2024, has disclosed more than $12 million in spending on messaging and field operations so far.\n\nMusk has also personally contributed $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party for the contest, while Building America\u2019s Future, another group with links to the DOGE leader, has spent more than $7 million on waves of sharp attack ads targeting the liberal candidate in the race.\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Musk\u2019s PAC reprised controversial get-out-the-vote tactics used in the 2024 election. America PAC launched a petition against \u201cactivist judges,\u201d offering Wisconsin signers $100 and an additional $100 for each additional signer they referred. The group later announced it would offer $1 million awards to signers of the petition, with the first check delivered to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay.\n\nAnd Musk invited fresh controversy with an early Friday X post saying he would speak at an event in Wisconsin on Sunday and present $1 million checks to two people \u201cin appreciation for you taking the time to vote.\u201d Entrance to the event was also limited to those \u201cwho have voted in the Supreme Court election.\u201d\n\nBy Friday afternoon, Musk had deleted the original post and clarified that those who signed the petition would be admitted into the event and the million-dollar checks would be presented to \u201c2 people to be spokesmen for the petition.\u201d\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul attempted to block Musk\u2019s cash giveaway by asking the state Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court denied his initial lawsuit on the matter.\n\nMusk presents a one million dollar check to an attendee during Sunday's town hall in Green Bay. Jamie Kelter Davis/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut the court denied Kaul\u2019s request in a decision that came just minutes before Musk\u2019s event was scheduled to begin.\n\nAt the town hall Sunday, Musk handed out two $1 million checks \u201cin appreciation\u201d to two attendees who had signed the petition \u2014 Nicholas Jacobs and Ekaterina Diestler. He also announced the creation of a \u201cblock captain program,\u201d offering further cash incentives two days before the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to pull a rabbit out of the hat, next level,\u201d Musk said, noting that betting odds strongly favor Crawford. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually got to have a steady stream of rabbits out of the hat, like it\u2019s an arc of rabbits flying through the air and landing in a voting booth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically what\u2019s needed, is we need to generate an anomaly in the matrix,\u201d he continued.\n\nSchimel, who received Trump\u2019s endorsement, has argued Musk\u2019s political operation is working independently of his campaign. But he did team up with Musk for a discussion on X in recent weeks. Asked by CNN about voters who think Musk should have stayed out of the race, Schimel decried big money from Democrats.\n\n\u201cI hope that they also think George Soros and JB Pritzker and others (should) stay out,\u201d Schimel said after an event in Elkhorn. \u201cWhy are they so worried about what Elon Musk does that I can\u2019t control when (Crawford\u2019s) got money coming directly into her campaign that she can control?\u201d\n\nLiberal megadonors have waded into the race, though on a smaller scale than Musk. Financier George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have donated a combined $3.5 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, which can transfer money to Crawford\u2019s campaign. The race has smashed spending records to become the most expensive judicial contest in US history.\n\nCrawford and her Democratic allies have run ads trying to tie Musk to Schimel, and she frequently brings up Musk in her campaign speeches, including at one point jokingly referring to the billionaire as \u201cmy opponent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this comes down to, you know, red or blue or Democrat or Republican,\u201d Crawford told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cI think all voters in Wisconsin should be concerned about this, about somebody coming in and trying to buy a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nDebates over Tesla and redistricting\n\nMusk\u2019s election engagement comes as Tesla is waging a legal battle over a state law that prevents the electric vehicle company from opening company-owned stores in Wisconsin. Crawford has used the lawsuit, which could make its way to the state\u2019s Supreme Court, to argue Musk surged money to the race because of his business interests.\n\n\u201cElon Musk wants to sell more cars here. So that\u2019s one way to do it,\u201d Crawford said at a stop in Janesville. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for access and influence to the Wisconsin judiciary.\u201d\n\nPressed by a reporter on whether he would recuse himself from the Tesla case if it came before the court, Schimel said he would evaluate the circumstances the same as any other case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running to uphold the law as the legislature passes,\u201d Schimel said last week. \u201cSo if his reason is to support me because he thinks he\u2019s going to get a result he wants, he might be supporting the wrong candidate.\u201d\n\nThe potential redrawing of congressional maps also has emerged as a campaign flashpoint. The court could weigh redistricting in a state where Republicans hold six out of eight US House seats even as statewide races have seen narrow victories for both parties. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries recently said the way to address \u201cgerrymandered congressional lines\u201d in the state is with \u201can enlightened Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nA resident drops their ballot into the box during in-person absentee voting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Wednesday. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nMusk also touched on the issue at his event Sunday, portraying the stakes in dramatic terms. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Tuesday is a vote for which party controls the US House of Representatives,\u201d he said. \u201cWhichever party controls the House, to a significant degree controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization. I feel like it\u2019s one of those things that may not seem it\u2019s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.\u201d\n\nCrawford, in an interview, told CNN that if the court took up the validity of congressional maps, she would \u201cexamine what the facts are based on the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll apply the law and make a decision that does not take politics into account but that follows the law,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nVoters are mixed on Musk\u2019s involvement\n\nPolitics usually is not the focus on Monday afternoons at RiversEdge Bowl in Janesville, where several dozen seniors take over most of the lanes for their weekly bowling league. But in the closing stretch of the election, many of the bowling voters were keyed in on the race and frustrated with the flood of outside money.\n\n\u201cThese people are interfering where they shouldn\u2019t interfere,\u201d said Marvin Whitson, a Trump voter who is undecided but leaning toward Schimel in the Supreme Court contest. \u201c(Musk) should stick to figuring out what he\u2019s supposed to be figuring out for the government and let us do our job as voters.\u201d\n\nCircuit Court Judge Brad Schimel, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, speaks to supporters during a campaign stop in Milwaukee on Saturday, Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nRaymond Huntoon, an independent who favors Crawford for the seat, said Musk\u2019s spending in the race is among the issues factoring into his vote.\n\n\u201cFor a judge to have that kind of money going into it, somebody wants something from up above,\u201d Huntoon said. \u201cHe could be like your puppeteer and be pulling, pulling the strings on something that him or the president wants to get through.\u201d\n\nGeorge Buehl, a Trump voter who is supporting Schimel, disagreed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think one side is any better than the other when it comes to the money. That\u2019s part of life,\u201d Buehl said. \u201cI\u2019m not in favor of the left-wing agenda that\u2019s going on with the Democratic Party, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna make sure I\u2019m there, because I\u2019m trying to stop it.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s David Wright and Fredreka Schouten contributed reporting."

            "full_content": "As a conservative woman living in Texas, I often feel like I'm living a dual reality. I'm a mom and a writer, but that's not all. I go to church, laugh with friends and wave at my neighbors while we are walking our dogs.\n\nAt dinner, my kids and I discuss the Beatitudes, the Bill of Rights and the best and worst things that happened that day (we call them highs and lows). I love to cook, hate to clean and probably need to have a better morning routine. My life is similar to millions of other women in America.\n\nBut online, in the legacy news media and in my increasingly ugly inbox, I live in a different world. In that world, I'm portrayed \u2212 and viewed \u2212 through a singular lens: my conservative beliefs. As such, I am easy to hate, mock and scorn.\n\nI am far from the only woman who experiences this abuse. Progressives claim to value women, but they routinely demonize conservative women who refuse to conform to the molds that the left tries to force us into. That's not only bad for women like me and for our society, but it's also a poor reflection of reality. Tens of millions of American women embrace traditional values and conservative ideas.\n\nWe're also more than our politics.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe demonization of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\n\nThe Washington Post provides a recent example of how conservative women are so often demeaned and patronized in the mainstream media. Last Monday's profile of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, written by reporter Kara Voght, drips with condescension, starting with the headline: \"In Karoline Leavitt's world, Trump's word is enough.\"\n\nLeavitt is a 27-year-old devout Christian and conservative who has been an excellent spokeswoman for President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nBut The Post tried to smear her faith, personality and confidence from the start of the article: \"Trump\u2019s newest press secretary is radiant, blond and apple-cheeked \u2012 as if one of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Madonnas had been styled for a Fox News hit. Her delivery is righteous, if a bit smug. God gives everyone gifts, Leavitt believes; hers is public speaking. And for roughly a half hour, once or twice a week, she delivers Trump\u2019s word to a room filled with professional skeptics.\"\n\nIf the trivializing of an accomplished woman wasn't so disgusting, I'd laugh. Can you imagine The Post smugly diminishing a progressive woman (or man) as \"radiant, blond and apple-cheeked\"?\n\nLeavitt isn't the only conservative woman to recently receive The Post's patronizing treatment. A profile of second lady Usha Vance began with this sentence: \"Most of what we know about Usha Vance we know because her husband told us.\"\n\nNever mind that Vance is an accomplished lawyer who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts on the U.S. Supreme Court. Ignore that she graduated from Yale University with a law degree and a bachelor's degree and from Cambridge with a master's. Brush aside that she has served on the boards of the Washington National Opera and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.\n\nWe only know, according to The Post, what her husband allows her to tell us.\n\nAnother Post news story \u2212 a profile of conservative influencer Alex Clark published the day before the elections in November \u2212 is laced with opinionated and condescending observations. Clark, for example, is accused of engaging in conspiratorial thinking about the food industry, \"consistent with the right\u2019s Trump-inspired paranoia about deep-state master planning.\"\n\nEach of those profiles was written or cowritten by Voght, who worked for Mother Jones and Rolling Stone, both ultraliberal publications, before joining The Post as a politics reporter.\n\nThe disdain for conservative women isn't confined to The Post. Recent Salon headlines have been even more pointed in their attacks, including this one: \"The misogynist agenda of \"MAHA moms.\" Conservative aren't just wrong, you see, they hate women, including presumably themselves.\n\nSalon also gave us this affront to good taste \u2012 \"From 'Mar-a-Lago face' to uncanny AI art: MAGA loves ugly in submission to Trump.\" The article, by senior writer Amanda Marcotte, is filled with cruel attacks on the appearance of conservative women in leadership positions, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nThe article includes this gem: \"Drag queens also embrace outlandish gender performance, but it's to subvert rigid gender roles instead of reinforcing them. That, plus your typical drag queen knows how to make five pounds of make-up look cool instead of gross, but they won't share their secrets with the ladies of the GOP.\"\n\nDrag queens are cool. Conservative women are gross. And that is what passes for journalism in 2025.\n\nTune in to ABC's \"The View\" to see the progressive hosts, all women, rip on the conservative women in the Trump administration. No one is more misogynistic to conservative women than liberal women. Again, the irony would be funny if not so disgusting.\n\nVoght and Marcotte are part of a bevy of legacy media reporters who seem to be liberals first and journalists second. That bias has destroyed the news industry's credibility but perversely also has hurt more than helped their allies in the Democratic Party.\n\nConservative women are denigrated for their beliefs\n\nFor all their flaws, Democrats used to promote tolerance and inclusivity. They used to at least say they embraced women's rights.\n\nBut tolerance apparently doesn't extend to the many women who exercise their right to form their own beliefs and to vote for the candidates of their own choosing. In progressives' eyes, those women, conservative women, deserve to have their accomplishments devalued and their appearance mocked.\n\nI'm tired of being the butt of jokes and scorn because I'm a conservative woman and a mother. I'm sick of legacy media acting like women such as Leavitt, Vance and me are an anomaly.\n\nAnd I'm done with seeing progressives in politics and journalism spew hate at women for embracing conservative political and social values.\n\nNicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

            "full_content": "Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux for New York Magazine\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nDo you see that?\u201d said Andrew Cuomo, who was making the rounds over brunch at Melba\u2019s in Harlem one Sunday in March. Earlier that the morning, Cuomo had given a speech at Mount Neboh Baptist Church on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, just down the street from here, calling for the hiring of 5,000 more police officers and levying a blistering attack on the left flank of the Democratic Party\u2014some members of which were running against him for mayor\u2014for uttering what he called \u201cthe three dumbest public-policy words you can utter: \u2018Cut the police.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe speech was well received, and the former governor gained an endorsement from the pastor, a longtime ally, and now here he was remarking on the inverted political landscape of the Democratic Party and trying to get in a couple of more shots at the antagonists to his left.\n\n\u201cThis extremist left wing represents no one. Who does it represent? If you are in Manhattan, or Park Slope, and it\u2019s \u2018No police; police are bad.\u2019 That was Bill de Blasio, and it\u2019s very popular in Park Slope, yes, but who does that help?\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cProgressives were supposed to be about helping the poor, minorities, the disenfranchised. That\u2019s why I wanted to do \u2018more police\u2019 in a Black church, because, by their own theory, progressives care about the poor and the\u200b\u200b downtrodden. No, they don\u2019t. That\u2019s not who your policies help. And meanwhile the city is going backwards and people are leaving.\u201d\n\nCuomo hasn\u2019t been much seen since he resigned his decadelong governorship three and a half years ago in the face of certain impeachment by the State Legislature, and here he reemerges among the post-church crowd like Lazarus. He stops for selfies. Tourists from California remember him from his COVID briefings. He goes into the kitchen to shake hands with the line cooks and busboys and to try out a little Spanish. Grandmothers pinch his cheek and kiss him, ask him if it\u2019s true, if he is really back and running for mayor. He shakes hands with a dad who says he\u2019s from Queens. \u201cOh, me too!\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cHollis.\u201d\n\nNo one asks him about the almost too long to list set of scandals that chased him from office and have hounded him ever since: the nursing-home deaths from COVID and their attendant cover-up, the book he wrote in the middle of the crisis that he used state employees to help work on, how his friends and family received COVID tests before anyone else in the state could, how a close aide went to federal prison for bribery, or even about the sexual-harassment scandal that ultimately led to his resignation.\n\n\u201cMy case goes to nine women. I didn\u2019t even know who they were,\u201d Cuomo said after he finally sat down at a table in the middle of Melba\u2019s dining room to discuss what forced him out of office. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even in a position to defend myself because they never said. I knew some of them, but \u2018Was there ever a woman who on a rope line you put your arm around and took a picture? Did you ever kiss a woman on the cheek at a wedding reception?\u2019 Literally like that. \u2018Did you ever pat a woman on the waist?\u2019\u201d Cuomo said, putting on a face of someone bewildered by the nonsensical question he is being asked. \u201cI mean, yeah. \u2018Did you ever kiss a woman on the cheek? Did you ever say ciao bella?\u2019 Yeah, I probably did. But there were no names.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see all this behavior, for a 25-year-old or younger woman with different mores and sensitivities, it\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t touch me\u2019 and \u2018Ciao bella is offensive\u2019 and \u2018honey\u2019 is offensive and \u2018sweetheart\u2019 is offensive, and that is a legitimate school of thought. I heard that intellectually, and I got it\u2014but I just didn\u2019t actually get it enough.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a report by state attorney general Letitia James found that allegations of sexual harassment by 11 women (seven of whom were named) were credible, including from one who said that Cuomo put his hand on, tapped, and grabbed her buttock at an event and another who said Cuomo used to ask if she had ever cheated on her husband or if she could help him find a girlfriend and a third, a 25-year-old aide who said Cuomo used to ask her intimate questions about her sex life. Later, a report by the Justice Department upped the count to 13 women and found that Cuomo discriminated against women in his office and retaliated against those who spoke out against him.\n\nCuomo has spent his years out of office running these allegations down, even going so far as to sue one of the women who made them\u2014at taxpayer\u2019s expense and a cost of at least $18 million, according to one estimate\u2014and maintains that much of the whole affair was concocted by James, whom Cuomo endorsed for the position and who, in a kind of gubernatorial attempted coup, ran for the job herself after he resigned. He points out that five district attorneys found that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of wrongdoing to bring charges. He blames the leftists in the State Legislature, who never liked him no matter how many left-wing priorities he passed\u2014gay marriage, a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, a fracking ban, free state-college tuition, legal marijuana, and stricter gun laws\u2014and who were lying in wait to take him down. The allegations were just a pretext, in his view, especially at a moment when the progressive wing of the party had the upper hand in the Democratic coalition.\n\n\u201cThat women\u2019s issue was so electric that once somebody lights that fuse, you can\u2019t stop it in that environment. Politicians were like dominoes\u2014boop, boop, boop, boop,\u201d he said, mimicking with his fingers the tumbling of the play tiles. In the end, everyone from Joe Biden\u2014who, Cuomo was quick to point out, said he never read James\u2019s report\u2014to a legislator who was a personal (i.e., nonpolitical) friend told him there was no coming back. \u201cSo that\u2019s how the system works. Do I think it was fair or accurate? No, and it\u2019s been proven not fair or accurate. But I knew the political impact of it. I mean, I wasn\u2019t kidding myself about that.\u201d\n\nThe blast radius of the sexual-harassment scandal extended far beyond Andrew Cuomo. It eventually ensnared his brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, and aides who were working at agencies across the government, and even people in the private sector who had lent Cuomo support. But for all the effort Cuomo has gone to (and continues to go to) to defend himself, the allegations are mostly a dead issue on the campaign trail. When Cuomo made his first press availability after announcing his run, no one from the city press corps even asked him about the sexual-harassment claims. His mayoral rivals have been slamming Cuomo for all sorts of transgressions but have mostly been laying off that angle as polls have shown that most voters don\u2019t care.\n\nAnd so, even though no one ever really thought that Andrew Cuomo would go away after stepping down, it can be a little hard to believe that he is here, running for mayor in a city he hasn\u2019t lived in for decades and seemed to avoid when he was governor. Cuomo is facing a half-dozen serious contenders, most of whom have been running for many months in a still relatively new ranked-choice voting system. He is facing an antagonistic press corps that wants politicians it buried to stay dead and a city business and political Establishment exhausted by the seemingly nonstop battles royale of the Cuomo era and wary of a resurrected Cuomo out hunting for revenge.\n\nCuomo hasn\u2019t run against a serious opponent in two decades, and the three months before the June 24 Democratic primary (which almost certainly will crown the next mayor) are bound to get ugly, with Cuomo\u2019s opponents every day trying to make salient for voters Cuomo\u2019s past behavior and the COVID dead that they say are his fault and, in the case of Mayor Adams, all but accusing Cuomo of racism for even entering the race against the city\u2019s second Black mayor.\n\nAfter finishing off his post-breakfast coffee and the sweet-potato pie with whipped cream, the former governor got up to go. As he does so, two older women, a mother and a daughter, sidle up to him for selfies. He obliges, posing in a three-sided hug, then turns back to the table he just left.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hug anybody, I didn\u2019t kiss anybody, I didn\u2019t touch anybody. It never happened,\u201d Cuomo said with a wink. \u201cI was harassed about 800 times, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nCuomo told me that part of the process of his coming to grips with what had happened to him was reconnecting with his faith\u2014reading the Bible, going to church, prayer. At one point, he said, he wrote down his sins on a piece of paper and tossed it into the waters off the Hamptons, where he was staying with his sister.\n\n\u201cI lived life. I spent time with my kids, I had my eyes opened to the part of life I was missing,\u201d Cuomo said, his eyes reddening. He described a life in public service from the time his children were born, which meant that he missed the day-to-day moments of being together. \u201cYou know, they used to talk about \u2018quality time.\u2019 Like if you didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with your kids it was fine so long as you had \u2018quality time.\u2019 And let me tell you, all of that was bullshit. You have to be there when they are down, when they are up, when they are moody. I did quality time, but it wasn\u2019t a substitute.\u201d\n\nRealizing what he had missed with his children, now adults and scattered around the country, \u201cwas sad for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I always appreciated at the time the cost that I was paying for the life I had chosen. I just wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nCuomo took up running, lost 20 pounds, saw his siblings and their children in ways he hadn\u2019t for years, and practiced a little law \u2014 \u201cprivate clients, business clients, and people with private issues that they were trying to think through.\u201d He also started his own consulting firm, making more than $500,000 in total according to recent Conflict of Interest Board filings. He invested in gold bars and in bitcoin, and was, he insists, at peace and not necessarily sure he would ever return to politics.\n\n\u201cThings happen, and you learn to live with it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of bad things happen and a lot of good things happen, and if you believe in God, you know that men plan and God laughs, and you move on.\u201d\n\nFriends say Cuomo was truly shocked, and more than a little devastated, over how quickly his political career unraveled. He knew there was a rank of fractious leftists in Albany who wanted him gone but not that legislative allies would fold so quickly or that James would deliver such a devastating final report.\n\nCuomo resigned as governor 2021, facing imminent impeachment. Photo: Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nHe had seen all of this unfold before, he said. Cuomo cited Al Franken, the Minnesota senator whose upward political trajectory changed in a moment after New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand said he needed to resign in the aftermath of allegations that he behaved inappropriately around women. In 2018, Cuomo had called on Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general accused by four women of intimate partner abuse, to resign (he was ultimately not charged).\n\n\u201cOne of the things I had to give up was reliving the bad or any bitterness or any anger or any regret or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too negative. You can\u2019t keep that negative in you and be productive and be healthy. I was angry for a period, and it affected everything I did. I couldn\u2019t enjoy anything. You know this is the business. What I did to Eric Schneiderman, you could argue, or what happened to Schneiderman, or what happened to Franken. Things happen and things don\u2019t happen, and you have to give that up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI replayed the game,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, Monday morning, you wake up, you replay the game tape. I always felt good about what I got done, what I got accomplished. But was there a way to do it without pushing the legislature or the whole system, the bureaucracy, as hard? Probably. Could you get enough done if you didn\u2019t push as hard? Probably not. But what\u2019s the trade-off? I don\u2019t know. I still think about it,\u201d he said, trailing off.\n\nAnd yet if you ask those who spoke with Cuomo what he was up to in his wilderness years, the answer they most often give is, \u201cScheming.\u201d They describe a man who was never planning to walk away from politics.\n\nCuomo had considered running against Kathy Hochul almost as soon as he stepped down, but with investigations into his handling of COVID and the sexual-harassment allegations against him still swirling, it was deemed impossible. Instead, he started a podcast, As a Matter of Fact, and brought on guests like Anthony Scaramucci, Kellyanne Conway, and Larry Summers for conversations that often became a litany of complaints about the left or about Joe Biden, politicized prosecutors, and the ongoing migrant crisis. He blasted James and Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg for going after Donald Trump, saying they were politicizing the justice system. He struck up a friendship with Eric Adams, dining with the mayor at his favorite midtown haunts, excursions that were dutifully covered by the New York Post and that helped feed the speculation that the former governor must be up to something.\n\nHe joined the legal team that is supposed to defend Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the International Criminal Court (a move that was widely seen as yet another thumb in the eye of the DSA crowd in New York City), started a gun-control group called Gun Safe America and another group designed to combat antisemitism in America, an initiative he kicked off on the Fourth of July weekend at the Hampton Synagogue. \u201cHe spent a lot of time out here in the Hamptons,\u201d said Rabbi Marc Schneier, who founded the synagogue and counts Cuomo as a personal friend. \u201cYou could tell he missed public life and was looking for a way to reenter the market, as it were. I think the phrase is \u2018testing the waters,\u2019 and why not? Americans love a comeback story, and Andrew Cuomo would be a great comeback story.\u201d\n\nCuomo had been here, in the wilderness, before. Back in 2002, fresh off an eight-year stint at Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton and living in Washington, D.C., Cuomo ran for governor. The party Establishment backed Carl McCall, the state comptroller, who, if he were able to defeat incumbent governor George Pataki, would become the first Black governor of New York. Almost certain to lose, Cuomo dropped out a week before the primary, claiming that he did it for the sake of party unity and not because he was about to get embarrassed. The city\u2019s Black leadership was infuriated.\n\nThe next year, his marriage to Kerry Kennedy, a union of two of the most famous families in Democratic Party politics, blew up in spectacular fashion amid allegations that she was having an affair with a polo-playing restaurateur. A report in this magazine portrayed Cuomo as almost clinically depressed, wandering around his empty Westchester mansion (the mansion was described as her idea; Cuomo had wanted to live in the city) at a loss at what to do next.\n\nWhat he did next was scheme, putting together a master class in how an out-of-work politician returns to power. He threw himself into the cause of reforming New York\u2019s harsh Rockefeller-era drug laws, teaming up with the likes of Russell Simmons and Sean Combs to host a rally and concert outdoors in Manhattan; it was an issue of paramount importance to the Black political leaders Cuomo had irritated with his gubernatorial campaign. He met with labor leaders and bigwig Democratic donors, boxing out his closest competition to run for state attorney general. Once elected AG, Cuomo almost immediately set his sights on the job he had run for five years before, teaming up with Republicans to investigate Governor Eliot Spitzer, sinking Spizer\u2019s popularity before he ultimately resigned in a prostitution scandal.\n\nSpitzer\u2019s lieutenant governor, David Paterson, took over in a similar wave of good feeling that quickly crashed as stories of dysfunction in the governor\u2019s office\u2014in political circles, it was always believed that Cuomo was behind many of them, though Cuomo denies it to this day\u2014led him to decide to not seek reelection.\n\nThis time around, Cuomo\u2019s comeback has taken a lot less work. Neither the anti-gun effort or the antisemitism campaign amounted to much, and the case against Netanyahu has gone nowhere. The podcast never caught on.\n\nIn the end, all he had to do was lie low and take occasional meetings with political power players to keep his name out there\u2014and watch while a mayoral administration collapsed into chaos.\n\nTo be a New York political reporter during these past two years has been to be tipped off every few months by someone who claims to be very much in the know about how Andrew Cuomo is about to announce he is running for mayor, or has already hired a campaign manager, or isn\u2019t running but is instead running for governor. He was going to announce over the holidays, then in early February, then late February, or maybe it was just a week before the April 3 filing deadline. He was pushing Eric Adams out of the race except when he was working to keep Adams in the race to deflect some of the media scrutiny.\n\nSuch is the mystique of Cuomo as a political operator that after four of Adams\u2019s top deputies resigned suddenly in the wake of the mayor\u2019s acquiescence to Trump, a rumor went around city political circles that somehow Cuomo was behind it, a contention his aides said was ridiculous. One labor operative told me that he had been paranoid for weeks that anytime someone called him to talk about the mayor\u2019s race, the person, no matter how close an ally, was secretly working for Cuomo and back-channeling the conversation back to him.\n\nThe rumors were crazy but also evidence of the shadow Cuomo has cast on the political conversation in New York over the past two decades. Cuomo was regularly meeting with labor and business leaders, eating breakfast as often as three times a week at the Regency, still the city\u2019s premier place to see and be seen. Those who met with him say that some of Cuomo\u2019s old feral instincts seemed a bit softer, as if the guy who, as one former aide put it to me, \u201cwoke up every morning wondering how he could get revenge on someone who he thought had fucked him over\u201d had mellowed now that he was no longer consumed with smiting his enemies.\n\n\u201cHe just seemed like a really different person than the one I had always heard about,\u201d said Andrew Yang, the 2021 mayoral candidate who dined with Cuomo at the Regency earlier this year. \u201cJust on a human level, he sounded like he had been on a journey and that he had learned from it.\u201d\n\nHe asked Yang about his ideas for the city, and Yang talked to him about the need for more police and for more specialized high schools. \u201cHe expressed that the city\u2019s future really hangs in the balance right now, that we could end up in the soup if we aren\u2019t careful,\u201d Yang said.\n\nCuomo wouldn\u2019t publicly admit his interest in the race, but privately, as 2024 wore on, Cuomo was increasingly telling business, labor, and religious leaders that he was running, that the city was in the grip of politicians who weren\u2019t just too spineless to stand up to the far left but who were incompetent to boot. He told them that if he entered, he was almost certain to win, with the unspoken warning that they would be wise to not support his opponents. A team of close advisors, including consultants Charlie King and Bill Murrow, along with his former chief aide, Melissa DeRosa, built a turnkey campaign operation on his behalf. Hoping to avoid a perception that Cuomo was running against the political Establishment, she set about lining up endorsements from fellow politicians, many of whom had previously called Cuomo unfit for office, and reigniting Cuomo\u2019s old network of staff and allies for another battle.\n\nCarl McCall had lunch with Cuomo and agreed to endorse even before Cuomo announced he was running, taking some of the heat out of the charge that Cuomo was again elbowing aside a Black political leader. Ritchie Torres, an ambitious congressman from the Bronx who had been making noises about running for governor, did the same. The Staten Island Democratic Party endorsed him. In late February, two weeks before Cuomo was set to announce, Frank Carone, a Brooklyn lawyer and political power broker who has been Adams\u2019s chief political patron, told Politico New York Playbook that while of course he was still supporting the mayor, he had also been in touch with DeRosa and the rest of Cuomo\u2019s team, for whom he has \u201cgreat respect.\u201d Five days later, Adams abruptly canceled an appearance at a candidate forum that was supposed to mark his unofficial entry into the race, citing \u201cthe advice of counsel.\u201d Associates of the former governor even tried to come to some accord with Tish James. One elected official showed up unexpectedly at her house, but James rebuffed their entreaties. (The Cuomo team denies this ever happened.)\n\nWhen Cuomo finally entered the race after weeks of speculation, he didn\u2019t do so with the kind of inspiring, shareable social-media video that most campaigns aim for; instead, he announced with a direct-to-camera, 17-minute address that didn\u2019t so much inspire hope or love for the city as fear. New York, as Cuomo described it, was on the brink.\n\n\u201cYou feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person or when the anxiety rises up in your chest as you\u2019re walking down into the subway. You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence,\u201d he said, his eyes darting across the teleprompter above the lens. \u201cThe city just feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis. These conditions exist not as an act of God but rather as an act of our political leaders \u2014 or more precisely \u2014 the lack of intelligent action by many of our political leaders.\u201d\n\nThe video was Cuomo\u2019s idea, and he knew that almost no actual voters would sit through it. Rather, it was for the press and the political professionals the Cuomo campaign expects will spread its core message: that this is a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d moment and Andrew Cuomo is the voters\u2019 hammer. Let the rest of the field go for social-media virality; this was going to be a campaign built on old-school brute-force logic.\n\nThe next day, Cuomo announced his run in person at the carpenters-union hall on the West Side of Manhattan. The hall was packed with supporters, including, according to a report in Politico, union members who were bussed in without being told they were attending a Cuomo campaign rally. Signature gatherers with clipboards fanned out among the crowd to get Cuomo on the ballot. His three daughters spoke on his behalf and attested to his character, as did a multidenominational array of religious leaders.\n\nThe same day Cuomo announced, his opponents countered. Brad Lander held \u201can emergency press conference\u201d calling Cuomo unfit to be mayor. Scott Stringer released a web ad reminding voters how he had defeated Eliot Spitzer when that former governor tried to make a comeback attempt and run for a city office. Zellnor Myrie slammed him for cutting funds for critical city services as governor.\n\nCuomo didn\u2019t respond to the attacks and scarcely engaged with the media. After his announcement, he ducked behind a blue curtain while his staff and security kept the reporters away.\n\nFriends say that when he was out of office, Cuomo could sound like a retired football coach watching his old team play, yelling at the television, but that his outrage was mostly directed at the governor, not the mayor. Eric Adams was, after all, a moderate like him, someone who seemed to hate the DSA-inflected left and its enablers in the elite media as much as he did and, perhaps most important, governed every day as if his administration were a rebuke of Bill de Blasio. Cuomo even warned Adams against going out on the town so much, telling him that it read to voters much like de Blasio\u2019s late-morning gym habit: a sign that you weren\u2019t much interested in them.\n\nAs Cuomo knows better than anyone, the city is a function of the state. New York City is reliant on Albany not just for its funding but for many of the rules and laws that it implements to govern itself. This stark reality is why, even as Cuomo inched closer to a mayoral run, many political analysts thought he was in fact gunning to get his old job as governor back. Would a Mayor Cuomo really want to go hat-in-hand to the State Legislature that nearly impeached him and ask for more funding or for local control of city schools? But a potential governor\u2019s race was almost two years away, Adams was starting to flounder, and so in late 2023 Cuomo took an apartment on East 54th St.\n\nIn his campaign launch, it could sound sometimes as if Cuomo still thought he was running for governor, especially when he talked about the infrastructure projects that he built as governor, including the Mario Cuomo Bridge, which connects suburban Westchester County to even more suburban Rockland County. Cuomo\u2019s political image was always as someone who understood the suburbs around New York City, especially its more middle-class towns, where he capped property taxes and spent his time off fishing or working on cars. In his first term especially, Cuomo rarely held public events in New York City, according to aides, out of fear of being upstaged by then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg. These days, he gets around town in his own car, a Dodge Charger.\n\n\u201cA big risk for Andrew Cuomo is that he runs a campaign like he is trying to win over swing voters in the Rochester suburbs and not Democratic-primary voters in New York City,\u201d said one Democratic pollster. \u201cSuburban voters want to hear you talk about all the problems the city is for the state, but city voters, to state the obvious, live here, and so they don\u2019t really believe all the doom and gloom about the place. They see New York\u2019s problems, but they want to know your plan to immediately fix them. He is pitching a different audience now.\u201d\n\nEven before Cuomo got into the race, a pair of dark-money groups, funded by business and labor leaders who feared a campaign of retribution, formed in order to drive up his negatives. One, New Yorkers for Better Government, ran digital ads that compared Cuomo with disgraced pols like Spitzer, Anthony Weiner, and George Santos and accused him of covering up COVID-19 nursing-home deaths. Its efforts are echoed by another group called the Nursing Home Justice League, which is supported by a number of leading local Republicans and Democrats and has built a memorial wall in Brooklyn to, as the group puts it, \u201chonor the nursing home victims of Governor Cuomo\u2019s failed leadership during the pandemic crisis.\u201d (Cuomo has always insisted that he complied with federal guidelines.) Meanwhile, the Working Families Party, which Cuomo went to war with during his term as governor, and a coalition of labor groups have been developing a strategy to get all of the non-Cuomo, non-Adams candidates to work together.\n\nUnexpectedly, he also has to contend with the New York Post, a newspaper that in the past has been willing to throw its weight behind favored candidates. As the moderate in the race, Cuomo should be the paper\u2019s favorite, but the early coverage has been brutal, including a welcome-to-the-race editorial on the day Cuomo announced titled, \u201cBehold! Biggest Liar in New York Wants to Be Mayor.\u201d\n\nHis half-dozen or so progressive opponents, who had mostly been muddling through a somnolent mayoral campaign, appear energized at the emergence of a Cuomo candidacy. Lander held a press conference nearly every day after Cuomo first announced, blaming the former governor for many of the ills that now befall the city: \u201cAt a time when we all want to turn the page on endless chaos, Andrew Cuomo\u2019s scandals, corruption, and disregard for our city except for when it serves his personal ambitions, are literally the last thing New Yorkers want to replace Eric Adams.\u201d Stringer led reporters on a tour of \u201cAndrew Cuomo\u2019s Manhattan,\u201d which included stops on Billionaires\u2019 Row to call out Cuomo\u2019s failures to boost the city\u2019s affordable-housing stock. DSA-aligned assemblyman Zohran Mamdani compared him to Trump, and said that Cuomo \u201cshares the president\u2019s love for billionaires, corruption, and harassing women.\u201d Myrie, a state senator from Central Brooklyn, has been hitting Black churches, warning at Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network that Cuomo isn\u2019t one of them. \u201cWe have had so-called leaders who sat in the governor\u2019s mansion, sat in our pews on Sunday, and cut our schools on Monday, and now they are using us to rehabilitate their image,\u201d he said at one in early March.\n\nWith the sexual-harassment scandal not moving voters away from Cuomo \u2014\n\n\u201ceveryone already knows about it, and absolutely nobody cares,\u201d said one operative from a rival campaign \u2014 his competitors have focused their efforts on trying to blame his actions as governor for a lot of what voters say are their current dissatisfactions with New York City. That has meant pinning the mental-health crisis on his decision to reduce psychiatric hospital beds and the poor state of the subways on his decision to raid the coffers of the MTA. Similarly, they point out how he failed to meaningfully address the city\u2019s spiraling housing crisis and suggest that his reforms on bail and discovery have led to a spike in crime.\n\nProgressive attacks on Cuomo in the mayoral race have yet get much traction. Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux for New York Magazine\n\nThe anti-Cuomo candidates are also consolidating into something of a team, coordinating their strategies in the hopes that there is a progressive, anti-Cuomo majority in the city\u2019s Democratic-primary electorate. The idea is that together, they can maneuver the relatively new ranked-choice-voting system to their benefit. Their staffs are all on a text chain and in regular contact. Lis Smith, a top Democratic operative who once worked for Cuomo but publicly broke with him last year, has been offering advice unofficially to friends working for Cuomo\u2019s rivals.\n\nThe anti-Cuomo candidates, a group that now includes Adrienne Adams, the City Council Speaker and a relative moderate who was a late entrant into the race, have mostly refrained from attacking one another. And if they do, progressive leaders have been quick to remind them to knock it off. \u201cWe are not going to have a fight between the four or five candidates that are vying for the left,\u201d said Antonio Reynoso, the left-leaning Brooklyn borough president. \u201cWe are going to be working together. I get calls from candidates running for mayor every week, and I am brutally honest with them,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there is a candidate that starts bashing another candidate, I am going to give them a phone call and tell them that their individual goals are not more important than the greater good here and we are not going to allow you to hurt the movement.\u201d\n\nBut operatives for the progressive candidates admit that they are stuck in something of a prisoner\u2019s dilemma: They all think they can win, if only voters will give them a shot, and so want their opponents, who they believe definitely can\u2019t win, to sacrifice themselves and spend all their energy attacking Cuomo. But of course, if everyone thinks they should be the next mayor, and someone else should be the designated attack dog, the strategy falls apart.\n\nCuomo has been consistently polling in the 30s or 40s, and before he entered the race, the question his rivals were facing is whether that is the ceiling of his support or the floor. Cuomo is, after all, a candidate with close to 100 percent name identification. \u201cHe is not going to become better known in the course of this campaign,\u201d said another rival operative. \u201cAnd he is not going to be better liked either.\u201d\n\nOne pollster pointed to surveys that showed Cuomo\u2019s retrospective job approval (i.e., how well you think he did as governor) is somewhere in the high 60s. But ask voters about his personal favorability rating, and it drops to the 50s. Ask voters if they could see themselves voting for him, and the number drops to the 40s. And ask if they will rank him first on their ballots in the city\u2019s ranked-choice-voting system, and the number drops to the 30s\u2014proof, they said, that his current strength is a mirage.\n\nOther recent polling shows that this theory might not be right. A trio of late March polls put Cuomo at around 40 percent, suggesting that since entering the race, Cuomo has, if anything, increased his lead \u2014 that he was, in fact, becoming if not better known, at least better liked. One survey showed Cuomo leading among nearly all demographics, including with over half of women. The poll also found \u2014 matching the conviction of some in the Cuomo camp \u2014 that backers of Eric Adams and Adrienne Adams might ultimately give their support to Cuomo, potentially giving him a route to clear 50 percent and victory in the primary.\n\nThe poll also showed Cuomo\u2019s nearest competitor to be Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old assemblyman from Queens. The Cuomo campaign can scarcely believe their good fortune \u2014 as much as Cuomo likes to deride his opponents as far-left members of the Democratic Socialists of America, Mamdani, whose viral online videos have turned him into a phenom in the early part of the campaign, actually is a member of the group. It is the belief among several of Cuomo\u2019s advisers that Mamdani can\u2019t possibly break 50 percent but that he could win over the left and deprive oxygen and attention from Cuomo\u2019s other competitors, creating a dynamic much like Cuomo faced when he ran statewide against Zephyr Teachout and Cynthia Nixon, both candidates beloved by the progressive left but with little traction beyond it. The Cuomo camp has been privately in conversations with donors and potential supporters, warning them of the possibility that Mamdani could win and that the city is on the brink of electing an avowed \u201cdefund the police\u201d\u2013style socialist unless Cuomo puts a stop to it.\n\nTo Cuomo aides, who derisively refer to his opponents as \u201cthe assistant managers,\u201d none of the attacks on the former governor are working. To those who say he is not a real New Yorker, \u201cjust listen to him talk,\u201d said one aide. The notion that Cuomo is somehow weak on crime will be ludicrous to voters, and as much as his opponents want to criticize his record, he is also the only one with the experience running an entity as large and as complicated as New York City, the argument goes.\n\nCuomo\u2019s rivals\u2019 current strategy is to get him out of his cocoon, to bait him into actually campaigning in unscripted settings, hoping he makes a gaffe. But Cuomo has been disciplined in sticking to a front-runner\u2019s strategy, appearing with local leaders who have endorsed him\u2014many of whom Cuomo donated to out of his sizable state campaign war chest over the past couple of years\u2014at diners and senior centers. He rarely alerts the press to his public schedule, and when he does, he does not often take questions from the media, whom he believes have it in for him. Cuomo is almost certain to max out in fundraising as part of the city\u2019s campaign-finance system and is also the only candidate with a multimillion-dollar super-PAC boosting his chances, one that has already raised more than $2 million from donors like Stephen Ross, the billionaire real-estate developer.\n\nIt is a campaign built on a belief that politics hasn\u2019t changed as much as some pundits might think. \u201cThe backbone of this campaign is labor, the backbone of this campaign is the Black and brown and white ethnic working class in the outer-boroughs,\u201d said DeRosa. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be diners and senior centers and churches, and it is a belief that Twitter is not real life and that is going to go over the top of the press.\u201d\n\nWhat Cuomo has not done much of on the campaign trail is attack Donald Trump, something his opponents have done relentlessly and also wondered aloud why Cuomo is not, positing publicly that Cuomo is trying to avoid prosecution from the Trump Justice Department or that he and Trump have a secret alliance.\n\nPrivately, in making his case to elected officials, Cuomo has been talking up the threat that Trump signifies for the functioning of the city and has been telling members of the city\u2019s congressional delegation especially that he is best suited to be the strong hand against an increasingly vengeful federal government; Cuomo aides say that continually going after Trump publicly on the campaign trail would risk his getting lumped in with the rest of the mayoral field. Plus even before Cuomo announced, there were rumors among New York politicos that the mayoralty was little more than a stepping-stone for a presidential run. Not talking at all about Trump, or any national issues, was a way to tamp some of that down.\n\nCuomo\u2019s is not a campaign that aims to inspire or become a cause. Mayoral campaigns, or any campaign for that matter, tend to succeed when they are built around big ideas and tangible improvement. Think of de Blasio, who ran on the theme of \u201cThe Tale of Two Cities\u201d and pushed for universal prekindergarten to address those inequalities. It was true for Mike Bloomberg too, who pledged to utilize technocratic expertise to help the city recover from 9/11, and even for Eric Adams, who relied on his biography as a working-class former cop from the outer-boroughs to bring attention to crime and small businesses.\n\nThen there is the wild card of this being \u2014 allegedly \u2014 a different Cuomo, one matured and made more human by the battles that led to his resignation. A guy who has discovered a new peace and equanimity and not the person who wakes up every morning thinking about revenge. How that guy runs a government is really anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nToward the end of our interview, Cuomo began recounting all the things that had seemingly gone wrong in the state since he left office\u2014the botched marijuana rollout, a legislature that won\u2019t confirm a governor\u2019s chief-judge pick, a lack of major infrastructure accomplishments. \u201cBut the situation here in the city is much more dire,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, if I wanted to get back to office, the question will be, \u2018Why don\u2019t you run for governor?\u2019 That is not why I got here. I didn\u2019t have a desire to get back into office. I felt that I was needed here, that I have the experience to actually really help.\u201d\n\nHe got up to leave, heading toward his Dodge Charger, out into the city he hopes to lead. Cuomo\u2019s strength among the voters belies how much of the political class, from across the ideological spectrum, wanted to see him gone. Few of course were willing to say that publicly, fearful of a governor with a famous taste for vengeance.\n\nBut this is, he promises, a new Andrew Cuomo, one who is not just scarred by a precipitous fall from grace but aware of how one needs friends in politics.\n\n\u201cYou know this dynamic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I do.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday seeking to boost proof of citizenship requirements for voter registration, which critics say could disenfranchise poor and older voters who don\u2019t have easy access to citizenship documents like passports or birth certificates.\n\nRepublican state lawmakers have long sought to require such documents for voter registration, but a major hurdle has been a Supreme Court ruling mandating that states accept, at least for federal elections, the generic voter registration form offered by the US Election Assistance Commission, which currently does not require documents proving citizenship.\n\nTrump\u2019s order directs the EAC to add the requirement and to withhold election funding from states that don\u2019t enforce the requirement for voters who use the federal form to register. The EAC is currently made up of two Democratic and two Republican appointees.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Election Assistance Commission is carefully reviewing the President\u2019s Executive Order and determining the next steps in enhancing the integrity of voter registration and state and federal elections,\u201d EAC Chairman Donald Palmer said in a statement. \u201cWe also anticipate consulting with state and local election officials.\u201d\n\nThe order also instructs the Department of Homeland Security to work with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to review state voter rolls in an effort to identify foreign nationals on the rolls, and to turn over that list to the state and local officials tasked with managing elections.\n\nThe directive is likely to raise alarm bells among voting rights advocates who have argued that DHS immigration databases are not equipped for vetting voter rolls without proper guardrails, as they pose a risk of identifying naturalized citizens for purges.\n\nThe order facilitates potentially sweeping changes to election practices long sought by conservatives while capitalizing on Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. The impact of the order won\u2019t be fully clear until it is implemented, and parts of it could be challenged in court.\n\nElections are run by state and local officials, with the federal government playing only a limited role. But Trump\u2019s order uses a number of tools, including the threat of withholding federal funding, to push changes to election policies that Republicans say will make elections more secure. Their opponents counter such changes create needless hurdles for legitimate voters.\n\nIn a blog post, Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, called Trump\u2019s order \u201can executive power grab\u201d with the potential to disenfranchise millions of voters. \u201cThe aim here is voter suppression pure and simple,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s executive order is unlawful. It would prevent eligible Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote,\u201d Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump administration is weaponizing the federal government and trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe order was welcomed by conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation. \u201cPresident Trump is finally taking the action long needed to put the resources of federal agencies like the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to work helping states, instead of trying to hinder their efforts to reform our election process,\u201d said Hans von Spakovsky, manager of Heritage\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative.\n\nThe order also makes it easier for states to access such federal databases for their own list maintenance activities.\n\nTrump is also ordering his attorney general to take \u201cenforcement action\u201d against states that accept mail ballots that arrive after Election Day. Roughly 20 states, including some battleground states, currently do so, and the practice was the target of GOP litigation in the lead-up to the 2024 election, even as many of those states require a postmark confirming the ballots were in the mail by Election Day.\n\nCNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report."

Plus, Steve Kornacki writes that next week\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court race will test whether Democrats can maintain their Trump-era edge in off-year elections.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nRepublican escalate their efforts to rein in the courts amid rulings that have halted Trump\u2019s agenda\n\nRepublican lawmakers are ramping up their attacks on the judiciary \u2014 and rushing to demonstrate they are in lockstep with President Donald Trump \u2014 amid court rulings that have blocked his agenda.\n\nFeeling pressure on that front from his right flank, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Tuesday floated the possibility of Congress eliminating some federal courts, Scott Wong, Melanie Zanona and Rebecca Kaplan report.\n\n\u201cWe do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts and all these other things,\u201d Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cBut desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.\u201d\n\nJohnson, a former constitutional attorney, later clarified that he was making a point about Congress\u2019 \u201cbroad authority\u201d over the \u201ccreation, maintenance and the governance\u201d of the courts. Article III of the Constitution established the Supreme Court but gave Congress the power to \u201cordain and establish\u201d lower federal courts.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who plans to hold a hearing focused on district judges next week, said he\u2019s speaking with GOP appropriators about what he called \u201clegislative remedies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got money, spending, the appropriations process to help try to address some of this,\u201d Jordan said, without adding further details.\n\nWhile these comments may fire up the MAGA base, Republicans are a long way from making good on them. It\u2019s far from clear that enough members of their caucus would support defunding courts in the House, where the party holds a narrow majority. And then there\u2019s the issue of the Senate, where the 60-vote threshold comes into play and Republicans control 53 seats.\n\nThe same issues would also arise if Republicans pursued impeachment of judges such as District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump\u2019s using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. (The bar for conviction is even higher in the Senate, at 67 votes.)\n\nHouse GOP leaders are pursuing one potential off-ramp for a vote that would be less politically precarious: Johnson backed a bill from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that would seek to limit district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, the sort of rulings that have hampered Trump from fully enacting his plans on issues from deportation to federal agency cuts.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said the chamber would vote on the bill next week, and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he\u2019d introduce similar legislation in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have a major malfunction in our federal judiciary, and practically every week another judge casts aside the tradition of restraint from the bench and opts to be the Trump resistance in robes,\u201d Issa told NBC News.\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court election will test a key Democratic advantage\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nNext week\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court election will reveal if what has been a Trump-era advantage for Democrats has endured despite the party\u2019s defeat in November.\n\nThis is the type of contest in which Democrats have been excelling of late \u2014 one that\u2019s oddly timed, for a lower-profile office and expected to be marked by modest overall turnout. Under these conditions, any differences in motivation and intensity between the two parties\u2019 bases are magnified. And that has netted out to the benefit of Democrats, who rely increasingly on a set of highly educated and higher-income voters who have been the most politically engaged in the Trump era.\n\nJust consider Wisconsin\u2019s recent history. Despite being nominally nonpartisan, Supreme Court elections are shaped by unmistakably partisan contours. And, compared to four high-turnout general election races, the last Supreme Court election, also held in the spring, stands out as the lone blowout.\n\nThis has been the trend not just in Wisconsin but throughout the country, one that seemed to accelerate following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Between the summer of 2022 and the fall of 2024, 15 special elections for House seats were held. Democrats swept the three that were heavily contested by both parties and posted some eye-popping gains in others that were assumed to be noncompetitive.\n\nThe disproportionately high activation of more educated and affluent voters played a key role. In a February 2024 House special election for a Long Island-based district in New York, for example, turnout in areas with the highest concentration of white voters with college degrees tracked 15-20 points higher than in areas with the lowest concentration.\n\nThis was also evident in the 2023 Supreme Court election in Wisconsin that the Democratic-favored candidate won. In that race, turnout was disproportionately high in Dane County, home to the University of Wisconsin and the highest share of white voters with college degrees in the state.\n\nDane County has become a massive vote bank for Democrats in the state, and one they are increasingly reliant upon as Republicans have built strength in rural and small-town Wisconsin. And in the 2023 court election, it punched above its weight. Not only did the Democratic-favored candidate win Dane by 64 points, the county also accounted for just over 13% of all votes cast statewide. By comparison, in last year\u2019s presidential race, it made up only 10.7% of the statewide vote pool.\n\nMore broadly, if you combine all of the counties in Wisconsin where the share of white voters with college degrees exceeds the statewide average, they accounted for just under 38% of total turnout in the 2023 Supreme Court race, compared to 34.7% in last year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nThe problem for Democrats, of course, is that their pronounced edge in off-year and special elections didn\u2019t translate into victory last November, when the electorate was much larger. This reflects a role reversal for the two parties. Until recently, Democrats enjoyed an advantage with less-engaged voters and the general view was that an expanded electorate would favor them. But in 2024, it was Trump who won support from voters who don\u2019t typically participate in nonpresidential elections, many of them younger and nonwhite.\n\nThat dynamic will be put to the test next Tuesday. If the upscale end of the Democratic coalition is still intensely and atypically engaged in Trump\u2019s second term, it will be apparent in the results \u2014 and will serve as a signal of what may lie in ahead in similar lower-turnout races this year and next.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\ude28 Special election fears: Republican leaders have grown privately alarmed about the massive fundraising disparity their candidate, Randy Fine, faces in a special House election in a deep-red Florida district and have swooped in at the eleventh hour to help resuscitate his campaign.

            "full_content": "Is buying Greenland back on the table? Former U.S. diplomat gives insight\n\nWashington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.\n\n\n\nThe White House previously said the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"\n\nBut the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.\n\nThe vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.\n\n\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"\n\n\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"\n\nVance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"\n\nMr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.\n\nHeather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"\n\nConley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\""

            "full_content": "Team speed. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nVarious theories are kicking around to explain the speed and lack of caution surrounding the initial blizzard of executive actions in the second Trump administration. The most conventional is simply that having four years to mull what happened in his first term, Trump and his top advisers came prepared to hit the ground running. That may account for developments like the early start on Cabinet nominations, but there have been plenty of second-term presidencies that did not begin with breaking every norm constraining executive powers, so something else is clearly going on.\n\nOne very plausible explanation is that both Trump and Russell Vought, the OMB director at the wheel of the executive branch, are very invested in a tremendous expansion of presidential powers at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of the federal government. Moving ahead rapidly with executive orders, funding \u201cfreezes,\u201d and plans for presidential impoundments made a lot of sense as part of a very deliberate power grab.\n\nThen, even more obviously, there\u2019s the truly unanticipated X-factor in Trump 2.0: Elon Musk and his DOGE initiative, which was apparently put together on the fly at some point between Election Day and Inauguration Day with about as much preparation as might normally be associated with a Tesla joyride in the country. Musk is famously deploying the same shock-and-awe tactics he used in earlier corporate takeovers, based on the Silicon Valley motto of \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d He has indeed done that, with the chortling glee of a toddler overturning a Lego structure. So perhaps he\u2019s running wild, beyond the control of the congressional leaders and the Cabinet whose authority he has usurped. Or maybe Musk and Vought together have joined forces to hit the disruption accelerator.\n\nBut at some point it must occur to the more thoughtful minds of Team Trump \u2014 Susie Wiles, anybody? \u2014 that the politics of this onslaught of chaotic activism is a bit backward. For generations, conservatives have come to Washington, D.C., clutching an agenda of limited government and tax cuts. By and large, the former goal, which requires cuts in highly popular federal programs and deflationary reductions in federal employment and contracting, is tough politically; it\u2019s the broccoli on the plate, allegedly good for you but unpalatable without hollandaise sauce. Tax cuts supply the tasty dessert. Serving up dessert first is the best way to encourage broccoli consumption. That\u2019s the lesson of George W. Bush\u2019s successful push for tax cuts and then budget cuts in the early 2000s. The strategy was known as \u201cstarving the beast\u201d (as anti-tax guru Grover Norquist put it): Deny \u201cthe welfare state\u201d (the early 2000s term for the \u201cdeep state\u201d) the resources to expand its programs and services and budget cuts would flow naturally and with less public angst.\n\nThat\u2019s not how Team Trump is proceeding. And in fact, on top of all the pain and paralysis Trump and Musk are causing throughout the federal government, the administration is insisting on moving fast with another unpleasant agenda item: widespread tariffs, which both economists and the public believe will reignite inflation \u2014 the very issue that most clearly led to the 2024 election result \u2014 and could even induce the ultimate hell of stagflation, a shrinking economy with spiraling prices.\n\nSo why is the administration and its party insisting on front-loading so many politically hazardous actions? The most likely answer is that they believe they are living on borrowed time and have to smash the deep state and then grab the tax cuts made possible by budget cuts before the American people react in ways that might quickly reduce their power. For many years now, it\u2019s been clear that an agenda of cutting programs like Medicare and Medicaid (and perhaps even Social Security via the indirect method of disabling its administration) and shutting down major agencies like the Department of Education in order to finance tax cuts for the rich was not a big crowd-pleaser. So upon taking office, the leaders of Trump 2.0 had a distinct choice: Build up their political capital carefully with popular steps that would give them the credibility to take less popular steps later, or move fast and get what they wanted while they can. It does make a certain logic, and not just for political neophytes like Musk or stone anti-government Christian national ideologues like Vought, but for the 78-year-old narcissist serving in his final public-sector job.\n\nIn an interview with Ezra Klein, conservative wonk Santi Ruiz explained the psychology as reflected in DOGE\u2019s modus operandi:\n\n[W]hen you talk to people in and around DOGE, you hear the debt come up over and over again \u2014 that if we don\u2019t take this one opportunity now, while the window is open before the midterms, before public opinion naturally swings back and we lose the House, there\u2019s a green field to run into to try and cut, cut, cut. And this will never happen any other time.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong instinct here that this is our one shot. So if we\u2019re going to err on one side, we have to err on the side of cutting too much\u2026.\n\n[T]hat\u2019s very much the instinct: The Dems are going to stop us. They\u2019re going to come in, and we\u2019re going to do crazy oversight in the House in a year and a half. Public opinion will just change over time because cutting things is unpopular.\n\nFrom that perspective, which may be shared more broadly within Team Trump than we realize, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the polls show, or how more rational Republican politicians focused on their own futures want, or whether the whole revolution is doomed to eventual defeat. It\u2019s all carpe diem, baby, and let tomorrow take care of itself. That\u2019s certainly cold comfort for us innocent bystanders, who are fated to be collateral damage in somebody else\u2019s war on government."

Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThere are many different ways to explain Donald Trump\u2019s improbable rise to the presidency in 2016, ranging from mere fatigue with Democratic governance to a vast revolt against a bipartisan Establishment pushing globalization. But all accounts would converge on one important detail: He would not have won his incredibly narrow Electoral College victory had not Hillary Clinton\u2019s reputation been battered by many months of criticism over her use of personal email to handle sensitive official business. \u201cHillary\u2019s emails\u201d and the interminable drumbeat over them from both conservative and mainstream media damaged perceptions of her trustworthiness and also generated crucial headlines late in the campaign, obscuring what looked to be a fatal Trump scandal associated with the Access Hollywood tapes.\n\nGiven this history, along with the paranoia characteristic of national-security types generally and MAGA people specifically, you\u2019d think secure comms on any discussions remotely related to national security would be a categorical imperative for any Trump administration. But you\u2019d think wrong, given the incredibly sloppy handling of high-level discussions over plans to attack Houthis in Yemen that came to light because Team Trump brought the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, into its group chat on Signal.\n\nMost of the uproar over this bizarre incident has focused on national-security adviser Michael Waltz, who accidentally added Goldberg\u2019s name and phone number to the chat, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who discussed operational details of the attacks outside of secure channels. But the entire group of Cabinet-level officials chatting away in Goldberg\u2019s silent presence are guilty of inadequate security precautions. Many of them, in fact, were very outspoken about the terrible misconduct involved in Clinton\u2019s emails (along with others involving the Obama and Biden administrations) back in the day, as CNN reminded us in delicious detail:\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host; White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller; national security adviser Mike Waltz; and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have all made public comments in the past attacking officials under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for allegedly being sloppy with sensitive government information.\n\nMuch of that criticism has revolved around Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State under President Obama \u2026\n\n[Marco] Rubio, identified by Goldberg in the chat as \u201cMAR,\u201d repeatedly attacked Clinton over the issue in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 tweeting about it at least a dozen times.\n\nIn an August 2015 Fox News interview, Rubio noted that classified information should only be viewed in a secure room to protect it from unauthorized access or surveillance.\n\n\u201cYou most certainly know you shouldn\u2019t be talking about it or passing it on in an email, particularly to a private server like the one she had. What they did is reckless \u2014 it\u2019s complete recklessness and incompetence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a fair description of what we have in the current case. But Rubio\u2019s far from the only hypocrite here:\n\nIn a November 2016 Fox News appearance, Hegseth called Clinton\u2019s use of the email server, \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have gone to jail for 1/100th of what \u2014 even 1/1,000th of what Hillary Clinton did \u2026\u201d\n\nWaltz, who invited the Atlantic journalist to the group chat, similarly tweeted his outrage that the Department of Justice did not pursue charges against Clinton for her private messages.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing,\u201d Waltz tweeted in June 2023.\n\nThere are additional quotes sternly condemning insecure comms and leaks to the press from Stephen Miller and Tulsi Gabbard, both apparent participants in the Houthi group chat. Indeed, the air in Washington is full of the soft clucking of chickens coming home to roost. Clinton certainly appreciated the irony:\n\n\ud83d\udc40 You have got to be kidding me.https://t.co/IhhvFvw6DG pic.twitter.com/bnNG4dGSpI \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 24, 2025\n\nBut Team Trump could at least mitigate the damage by admitting its errors and moving on. Instead, it is shooting the messenger who drew attention to its incompetence, as Axios reports:\n\nHegseth, who briefly spoke to reporters after landing in Hawaii Monday, lashed out at Goldberg for The Atlantic\u2019s history of publishing negative stories about President Trump.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called \u2018journalist\u2019 who\u2019s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again,\u201d Hegseth said, attacking Goldberg\u2019s reporting on the Russia investigation and allegations that Trump called fallen veterans \u201csuckers and losers.\u201d\n\nAsked why details of the operation were shared on Signal, an encrypted messaging app available to the public, Hegseth denied that part of Goldberg\u2019s reporting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans. And that\u2019s all I have to say about that,\u201d the former Fox News host said.\n\nGoldberg later responded to Hegseth on MSNBC, alleging that the texts he withheld included \u201cprecise details\u201d of the attack on the Houthis \u2014 including the specific time, specific targets and sequencing of the operation.\n\nPerhaps even more to the point, Hegseth\u2019s claims that Goldberg is a fake journalist motivated mainly by animus to Trump makes the idiocy of including him in any sort of Cabinet-level discussion even clearer.\n\nThese people screwed up royally, and they should come clean about their collective responsibility for sloppy communications management and stop lashing out at media for reporting it. A retroactive apology to Clinton is probably too much to ask for, but she will have the satisfaction of watching Trump\u2019s high command cut themselves with the same knife they used to strike her down.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

Pro-Hamas flyers. Deleted photos.\n\nThese are just a few of the pieces of evidence that the Trump administration has cited in its legal efforts to detain and deport migrants from the United States in high-profile actions the past few weeks.\n\nThe evidence has been cited in efforts to send over 200 Venezuelan men to prison in El Salvador for alleged gang membership, to detain a pro-Palestinian activist and green card holder without charging him with any crime, and to deport a doctor with a visa to Lebanon.\n\nPeople in immigration court already face a lower standard of due process in proceedings, but the Trump administration\u2019s moves reflect a stark deterioration of migrant civil liberties even further, immigration attorneys said.\n\n\u201cIn this instance under the Trump administration, what we\u2019re seeing is yes, allegations using flimsy evidence paired with no meaningful opportunity to refute that evidence in any kind of proceeding before any kind of decision-maker,\u201d said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration non-profit group. \u201cThat\u2019s really what makes this different.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s quick pace of detention and deportation has similarly disoriented attorneys.\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019re hit with a different decision, and we just don\u2019t know how to make sense of it,\u201d Veronica Cardenas, the former assistant chief counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, told CNN last week. \u201cUs immigration lawyers are really experiencing the lack of due process circumventing immigration courts, and so it\u2019s been a very difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed back against critics who raised concerns about immigrants\u2019 legal rights.\n\n\u201cDue process? What was Laken Riley\u2019s due process?\u201d border czar Tom Homan said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d referring to the nursing student who was killed by an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela. \u201cWhat were all these young women that were killed and raped by members of (Tren de Aragua) \u2013 what was their due process?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some of the evidence being cited in the cases and what attorneys and family members of the migrants have said about its relevance.\n\nA closer look at the tattoo evidence\n\nThe Trump administration deported over 230 Venezuelans earlier this month, sending them to prison in El Salvador for alleged gang membership. But some have said they were wrongly suspected due to their tattoos.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety last year identified an assortment of tattoos connected to Tren de Aragua, many relatively common: stars on the shoulder, royal crowns, firearms, trains, dice, roses, tigers and jaguars. A photo collage of the tattoos even includes a Nike \u201cJumpman\u201d logo and Michael Jordan\u2019s number 23 jersey number as an identifier of gang membership.\n\nJos\u00e9 Daniel Simancas Rodr\u00edguez, who spent 15 days in detention at Guantanamo Bay before being deported back to Venezuela, told CNN that US authorities had suspected him because of his tattoos and because he was from the gang\u2019s original stomping grounds in Maracay. He denies being in the gang.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Trump administration related to its deportation efforts tells the story of \u201cJ.G.G.,\u201d a non-citizen from Venezuela and tattoo artist who has requested asylum. J.G.G. has several tattoos on his leg, and that ink that made him the target of deportation efforts, according to the suit.\n\nThe ACLU said that J.G.G. has two tattoos \u2013 a rose and skull on his leg as well as an eye with a clock in it \u2013 and neither are associated with Tren de Aragua.\n\n\u201cDuring an interview with ICE, he was detained because the officer erroneously suspected that J.G.G. was a Tren de Aragua member on account of his tattoos,\u201d the suit states.\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, the co-founder and president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, is representing a Venezuelan asylum seeker who they say was abruptly removed to El Salvador.\n\n\u201cHe came here seeking protection, seeking asylum, and because of his tattoos \u2013 which are the type of tattoos you would see on any person hanging out in a coffee shop in (Los Angeles) \u2013 because of those tattoos, he\u2019s in a labor prison in El Salvador known for human rights abuse,\u201d Toczylowski said.\n\nTrump admin defends deportations\n\nThe deportations stem from President Donald Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, an obscure 18th century law that has only been invoked three times in US history, all during major military conflicts.\n\nDetentions and deportations that occur under the measure do not go through the immigration court system, which provides immigrants the chance to seek relief and make their case to stay in the country.\n\nThe US recently designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, and officials have claimed the country is under \u201cinvasion\u201d by the gang to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. CNN previously reported that more than half of the 261 migrants expelled to El Salvador were done under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe administration has not publicly identified those removed to El Salvador, or presented evidence that the deported Venezuelans belong to Tren de Aragua. CNN has not been able to confirm whether any of the deported migrants identified in this story have any affiliation to the gang.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to reveal operational details about a counter terrorism operation,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week. She added that ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents had \u201cgreat evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were 100% confident in the individuals that were sent home on these flights and in the president\u2019s executive authority to do that,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nThe administration has argued in court the migrants sent to El Salvador were \u201ccarefully vetted\u201d through investigative techniques and a review of information to ensure they were members of Tren de Aragua, according to a court declaration submitted last week from an agency official.\n\nRobert Cerna, acting field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, argued that the agency \u201cdid not simply rely on social media posts, photographs of the alien displaying gang-related hand gestures, or tattoos alone.\u201d\n\nICE also looked at previous criminal convictions, testimonies and interviews with known Tren de Aragua members, according to the filing.\n\n\u201cMembers of TdA pose an extraordinary threat to the American public. TdA members are involved in illicit activity to invoke fear and supremacy in neighborhoods and with the general population,\u201d the filing states.\n\nThe flyers and \u2018misrepresentation\u2019 evidence\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist, was arrested by immigration officers nearly three weeks ago outside of his apartment on the campus of Columbia University. A legal permanent US resident and green card holder, he played a central role in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on the Ivy League campus last year.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio ordered Khalil\u2019s detention, relying on an obscure section of US law which gives him wide authority to revoke a person\u2019s immigration status if their \u201cactivities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d to the country.\n\nLeavitt, the White House press secretary, accused Khalil of organizing protests that \u201cdistributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas,\u201d a claim his attorneys have denied. During the briefing, she said she had a copy of the flyer but did not present it.\n\nKhalil has not been charged with any crime since he has been detained.\n\nKhalil described himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d in a letter dictated to his attorneys from inside the ICE detention facility. \u201cMy arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza,\u201d Khalil said.\n\nIn a court filing Sunday, the Trump administration said that his deportation is justified because Khalil did not reveal his previous work at the Syria office of the British Embassy in Beirut or his membership in United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in his application to become a permanent US resident.\n\nKhalil \u201csought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud of willful misrepresentation of a material fact,\u201d the US government wrote.\n\nKhalil was an unpaid intern with UNRWA in 2023, but was never on staff, spokesperson Juliette Touma told CNN.\n\nHis defense attorneys argue the new justification to deport him is weak and doesn\u2019t \u201ccure the obvious taint of retaliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that the initial charges are unsustainable,\u201d attorney Baher Azmy told CNN. \u201cSo, they\u2019re going with a theory that they must think is more legally defensible.\u201d\n\nThe deleted photos\n\nDr. Rasha Alawieh, 34, was deported last week from Boston to her native Lebanon after federal agents found photos of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran\u2019s supreme leader on her cell phone, a court filing by the Trump administration said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why federal officers were examining her phone.\n\n\u201cIn explaining why these multiple photos were deleted by her one to two days before she arrived at Logan Airport, Dr. Alawieh stated that she did not want to give authorities the perception that she supports Hezbollah and the Ayatollah politically or militarily,\u201d the court filing reads, per CNN affiliate WCVB.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Former Homeland Security lawyer responds to Donald Trump's immigration crackdown 03:37 - Source: CNN Former Homeland Security lawyer responds to Donald Trump's immigration crackdown 03:37\n\nAlawieh, who attended Nasrallah\u2019s funeral in Lebanon, described him as a highly regarded religious leader and told them she follows his religious and spiritual techniques but not his politics, a source familiar with the case told CNN.\n\n\u201cAlawieh openly admitted to this to CBP officers, as well as her support of Nasrallah,\u201d a spokesperson for the DHS said in a statement. Alawieh also acknowledged to immigration officers Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, a source familiar with the case told CNN.\n\nAlawieh\u2019s attorney, Stephanie Marzouk, who told the court all Alawieh\u2019s other attorneys had withdrawn from the case, spoke briefly to reporters last week outside a federal courthouse in Boston.\n\n\u201cOur client is in Lebanon, and we\u2019re not going to stop fighting to get her back in the US to see her patients, and we\u2019re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law,\u201d she said.\n\nThe groundwork to deport these people did not just begin with Trump. DHS has a long history of using \u201cflimsy or unsubstantiated\u201d allegations to deport people in the immigration system, said Gupta, the American Immigration Council policy director.\n\n\u201cThis is the most egregious final step in what has been many years of devolving due process in the immigration system,\u201d she said."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty Images\n\nThere is a growing rallying cry in the city\u2019s mayoral race: D.R.E.A.M., or in other words, \u201cDon\u2019t Rank Eric or Andrew for Mayor.\u201d\n\nProgressive groups and candidates are urging voters ahead of the June Democratic primary to fill out their ranked-choice ballot without Andrew Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams, with the goal of ultimately ensuring neither man receives the necessary votes to become the presumptive mayor.\n\nOne of the first groups to promote the idea was United Auto Workers Region 9A, which represents union members in the city. In December, its political council announced its unranked slate of endorsed candidates in the mayoral race: Comptroller Brad Lander, Queens state senator Jessica Ramos, and Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. It also included a clear warning to members: Don\u2019t rank Adams. In February, with Cuomo\u2019s entry into the race all but assured, the union revised its guidance to include the former governor, writing that members are \u201cunited behind our D.R.E.A.M.\u201d\n\nBrandon Mancilla, the director of UAW Region 9A, says the decision against ranking the two men was an easy one. \u201cMayor Adams, over the last three to four years as mayor of the city, we\u2019ve seen a lot of cuts, a lot of misplaced priorities, taking a knee to whatever Donald Trump wants, essentially just not running the city,\u201d Mancilla says. \u201cThat has been a red line for our members.\u201d\n\nAs for Cuomo, Mancilla cited his lack of apparent support for a UAW strike at upstate General Motors auto plants when he was governor, saying Cuomo has never made an appearance at any of their picket lines. \u201cAt this point, the UAW has gotten President Biden to show up to the picket line right during last year\u2019s strike, and, in 2019, Cuomo refused to do that in a state that is very proud of its union density and being a pro-union state,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we don\u2019t think he has working class people\u2019s needs in mind. He\u2019s running to empower himself and that\u2019s basically something that our members don\u2019t want to go back to.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, another D.R.E.A.M. campaign was taking form. New Yorkers for a Better New York Today launched dreamfornyc.com in February after months of planning, featuring hats and shirts with the slogan and backed by a social media campaign targeting Cuomo\u2019s record. And now the issue is coming up at campaign events and forums across the city, with more candidates officially joining the D.R.E.A.M. team.\n\n\u201cI wholeheartedly support this approach and I\u2019ve said ever since we launched our campaign in late October that I would only be critiquing disgraced New York executives, whether past or present,\u201d says Mamdani.\n\nShortly after Cuomo joined the race, Ramos shared a video on social media criticizing his handling of the pandemic and urging voters to embrace D.R.E.A.M. \u201cWe don\u2019t need City Hall to be a refuge for scandal-ridden men,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Cuomo campaign, so far, appears unfazed by the strategy. \u201cOur city is in crisis \u2014 a crisis of affordability, of quality of life and of leadership, and in this race, Governor Cuomo, and Governor Cuomo alone, is the only proven, tested leader to tackle these issues head on and who voters know can get the job done. New Yorkers aren\u2019t stupid: these are serious times that demand a serious Mayor, not performance art from defund the police, DSA-extremist and anti-Israel activists,\u201d Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the campaign, said in a statement.\n\nWith Cuomo currently leading in the polls and the moderate lane of the field growing with the recent entry of City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, candidates in the progressive bloc appear ready to wield ranked-choice voting to their advantage. It\u2019s a marked change from 2021, when candidates largely eschewed strategic approaches to the race, such as backing each other in case the other was eliminated as votes were tabulated. The lone exception was a late-stage joint endorsement between Andrew Yang and Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, who each vowed to rank the other second and urged their voters to do the same. Garcia was runner-up to Adams.\n\n\u201cHad Maya Wiley and Kathryn Garcia cross-endorsed each other a month out from the election, one of them very likely would be mayor today and we wouldn\u2019t have a mayor who had sold us out to Donald Trump for a pardon for his crimes,\u201d says Lander.\n\nThat\u2019s why progressives are hoping this time will be different. \u201cThat\u2019s where the D.R.E.A.M. strategy is really helpful and very smart,\u201d says Ana Maria Archila, co-director of the New York Working Families Party. \u201cIt helps guide voters, gives them clear direction about what not to do. Obviously, the other element is making sure that we guide voters about what to do.\u201d\n\nMamdani, who has been second behind Cuomo in recent polls, is open to joint endorsements. \u201cI have told other candidates and campaigns directly from the very beginning of this race that I am interested in cross-endorsements as we get closer to Election Day because we must turn the page on this failed leadership and we must utilize every single tool at our disposal to ensure that all of our supporters understand that where they have five options, they should use them, and that none of them should be Eric Adams or Andrew Cuomo,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Brooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie said he\u2019s not opposed to cross-endorsements down the line, he said each campaign must present a case to voters that stands in strong contrast to the records of Cuomo and Adams. \u201cI\u2019m excited about what ranked-choice voting provides for voters. I think it gives people the opportunity to express their preferences in a way that they might not have had in the past and I do think that it allows for candidates to focus on presenting what their vision for the city is, and I feel good about our ability to do that in this field,\u201d he says.\n\nThis is the sort of collaboration the UAW was ultimately hoping for when it dreamed up D.R.E.A.M. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet to see the cross-endorsements and that kind of thing, but we\u2019ve been very clear also with the candidates we\u2019ve endorsed that that\u2019s what we would like to see,\u201d Mancilla says. \u201cWe would like to see them get to the point that they\u2019re also endorsing each other. \u2018If I\u2019m number one on your ballot, here\u2019s who I believe should be number two.\u2019 Because in the end, that\u2019s the way that progressive labor voices are going to be able to come out on top, instead of letting the field get divvied up.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article previously misstated when DreamforNYC started its campaign.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Photo: Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n\nThe general consensus is that this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament has been a huge bummer so far. This is, the thinking goes, primarily because it has lacked the driving force of the best tournaments of the past: upsets. There is no Saint Peter\u2019s this year, no Fairleigh Dickinson, no Northwestern State. In fact, there is not a single mid-major team \u2014 defined as a team that plays outside the Power Five conferences \u2014 remaining in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s tournament. The favorites keep winning; the established powers remain entrenched. Some have attempted to blame NIL (\u201cname, image, and likeness\u201d rules) or the transfer portal for this, mainly because people try to blame NIL and the transfer portal for everything. The more likely culprit is simply the fickle nature of the tournament itself. Some years, it gives you everything you want; some years, it doesn\u2019t. The chaos \u2014 or unpredictable lack thereof \u2014 is its defining feature. Besides, those people are wrong about NIL and the transfer portal anyway; they\u2019re actually college basketball\u2019s saving grace.\n\nBut there is an upside to the lack of upsets: a riveting set of Sweet 16 games. It turns out that when the favorites (mostly) win, it makes for some outstanding Godzilla vs. Mothra matchups in the later rounds. Six of the top 25 winningest coaches of all time remain in the tournament. The biggest, best teams in men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball are all still remaining. And now they get to take each other out. Even without the upsets, this tournament always delivers.\n\nStill, unless you\u2019re an alumnus of one of the remaining 16 schools or possess gambling-related loyalties, it\u2019s not easy to figure out where you should direct your affections. So, as is tradition, I\u2019ve put together a harmless, just-playing-around \u2014 please do not sic your school\u2019s sub-Reddits on me \u2014 ranking of the teams and schools by likability, a hopefully helpful Guide to the Otherwise Unaffiliated.\n\n(Note: This is for the men\u2019s tournament; the women\u2019s Sweet 16 will be set by Tuesday morning, and I\u2019ll put my picks in the comments of this post on Wednesday. Free content!)\n\n1. Maryland\n\nIt remains so strange, even in an age of expansion, even in a world where UCLA and Rutgers play conference games against each other, that Maryland is in the Big Ten. This is probably the best Maryland team since they joined the conference 11 years ago, and definitely the most Maryland edition: Three starters are from the Old Line State, and the starting lineup has become known as the \u201cCrab Five,\u201d which is a fantastic nickname. They are led by freshman Derik Queen, a pending first-round draft pick who is a joy to watch and is responsible for the single best moment of the men\u2019s tournament so far:\n\nMARYLAND MADNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nTERPS WIN IT! pic.twitter.com/NO0UozXVyj \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) March 24, 2025\n\nYeah, fine: He probably traveled, but if the referees declined to call it because \u201cit looked so cool,\u201d I would have a hard time blaming them.\n\nNotable alumnus: Larry David (really).\n\n2. Michigan State\n\nIf you do not like the turn that college basketball has taken toward professionalism; if NIL irks you; if you hate that players can transfer at will; if you wish it were 1998 again: Well, Michigan State is absolutely your team. Longtime coach Tom Izzo (No. 23 on that winningest coaches list) has steadfastly avoided the quick-fix solutions that have gained widespread acceptance throughout the rest of the sports, focusing instead on consistency and familiarity: He\u2019ll take a less talented team if they\u2019re willing to stick around and play the way he wants them to. This is an outdated notion in college sports, to say the least, but Izzo has made it work this year with what is one of his most enjoyable teams to watch. (He has said it might be his favorite team he\u2019s ever coached, which is high praise indeed.) Your tolerance for older white men sticking stubbornly to their mores and norms of the past may vary, but this is a fun team, and you almost have to admire Izzo for being the last guy tilting at the windmill.\n\nNotable alumnus: Gretchen Whitmer.\n\n3. Houston\n\nBefore coach Kelvin Sampson arrived in 2014, Houston hadn\u2019t won a single NCAA Tournament game in 30 years, not since the mid-\u201980s glory days. He has turned the team into college basketball\u2019s most consistently outstanding team, one that has dominated every league it has played in, making a huge jump from the American Conference to the Big 12 without missing a beat. Houston regularly does this without many All-Americans or future NBA draft picks, which is the sort of thing that would seem impossible in today\u2019s game. Sampson was fired by Indiana in 2008 for recruiting violations that are not only no longer illegal but are so commonplace now that any coach who didn\u2019t commit them would be fired for incompetence. At Houston, he has become perhaps the best college-basketball coach in the country.\n\nNotable alumnus: Dennis Quaid.\n\n4. Purdue\n\nAnother team that represents consistency and straightforward competence, Purdue lost two-time National Player of the Year Zach Edey and barely missed a step. The main reason for their steadiness is point guard Braden Smith, this year\u2019s Big Ten Player of the Year and the kind of star that can exist in college basketball but rarely at the pro level. He\u2019s short (well, six feet, which is basketball short), he\u2019s white, he\u2019s slow, he has a completely ridiculous beard. He\u2019s also unstoppable, to the point that an opposing coach this year said the only player who was harder to deal with was Stephen Curry. That\u2019s, uh, probably not Smith\u2019s future career path, but no one should be surprised if he\u2019s absolutely infuriating you as an opposing player in the NBA for the next decade.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jim Gaffigan.\n\n5. Michigan\n\nMichigan basketball fans are slightly less insane than Michigan football fans, which still means you wouldn\u2019t want to get stuck in a corner with any of them at a party. They\u2019re one of the happier success stories in college basketball, a team that fired a beloved but slightly deranged famous alum in Juwan Howard and replaced him with Dusty May, the man who took Florida Atlantic to the Final Four and who instantly turned Michigan into a winner again. Their biggest asset is Yale transfer Danny Wolf, a seven-foot former Team Israel player who, I\u2019ve argued, looks like Saturday Night Live\u2019s James Austin Johnson if the comedian\u2019s limbs were all cartoonishly extended to meet a much larger frame. Michigan\u2019s fans make it nearly impossible to cheer for them at much of anything, but as far as their teams go, this is one of the more likable ones.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jonathan Chait.\n\n6. Brigham Young\n\nLook out: The Mormons are good! Part of the reason for this is that, uh, most of their star players are not actually Mormons, including future NBA draft pick Egor Demin. (It should be noted that, according to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, there are currently 5,101 Mormons in Russia. Demin is not one of them.) BYU has boosted its recruiting game in recent years thanks to some free-spending Mormons (really) and a former NBA coach who is now in charge, to the point that the top overall recruit in the 2025 class, AJ Dybantsa, signed with the school for next season. This is just the start of the BYU sports renaissance. Pretty impressive for a college that bans premarital sex, alcohol, and caffeine. You\u2019ve got to have a pretty impressive NIL budget to overcome that.\n\nNotable alumnus: Mitt Romney, obviously.\n\n7. Tennessee\n\nA slow, plodding, brilliant defensive team, Tennessee gets points for notching some truly dramatic wins this season and for Zakai Zeigler, their five-foot-nine point guard who is essentially impossible to deal with. They lose points for wearing the ugliest shade of orange imaginable; I\u2019m not sure what you mix with actual orange to get that color, but I bet if you put it on your plants, it will help them grow faster.\n\nNotable alumnus: Dave Ramsey.\n\n8. Texas Tech\n\nThere\u2019s always one or two mostly nondescript teams to make the Sweet 16, and Texas Tech is often one of them. (They actually made the national championship game a few years ago, under Chris Beard, whom we\u2019ll be talking about in a bit.) They are led by All-American JT Toppin, who, contrary to popular belief, is not in fact the brother of former Knick and current Pacer Obi Toppin (or Obi\u2019s brother Jacob, also a former Knick). The most interesting thing about Texas Tech is that their best player is not related to a mid-tier NBA player. That about sums them up.\n\nNotable alumnus: John Denver.\n\n9. Arizona\n\nHere\u2019s one undeniable truth about Arizona: This is the last time you won\u2019t have heard of anyone on their team. That\u2019s because their top recruit next year is Bryce James, LeBron\u2019s other basketball-playing son who has already committed to the Wildcats. He\u2019s widely considered a better player than Bronny (though, while almost no one has noticed, Bronny has started making some very steady improvements). It is to LeBron\u2019s credit that he never refers to either of them as \u201cPrince.\u201d\n\nNotable alumnus: Kourtney Kardashian.\n\n10. Alabama\n\nNo team better represents the sudden SEC dominance of college basketball \u2014 14 teams from that conference made the tournament this year, an all-time record \u2014 better than Alabama, a football-obsessed institution that has never really cared about basketball but has so much money lying around that they went ahead and just spent their way to a great team anyway. There\u2019s nothing specifically wrong with that, and while Alabama has been inconsistent, they can score like crazy and can be a blast to watch when they\u2019re clicking. Still: They could win the national championship and only 30\u201340 percent of their football fan base would likely even notice.\n\nNotable alumnus: Joe Scarborough.\n\n11. Arkansas\n\nRun out of Kentucky\u2019s infamously insane fan base despite winning a national championship and putting together an endless string of top recruiting classes, Hall of Fame coach John Calipari retreated to SEC rival Arkansas. He got off to a miserable start this year, and his hiring had the makings of an expensive disaster before he turned things around to make the tournament, then beat Rick Pitino and reach the Sweet 16 as a ten-seed (the lowest one left). This isn\u2019t the most inspiring team, and Calipari is hardly some plucky underdog. But anyone who ever left a job vowing revenge on your former co-workers \u2014 I\u2019ll show them \u2014 can\u2019t help but feel some solidarity with Calipari. Even if he has to live in Arkansas.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jerry Jones.\n\n12. Kentucky\n\nThe Wildcats replaced Calipari with Mark Pope, a former Kentucky star (he won a national championship under Pitino) who instantly charmed the fan base in a way Calipari never could. He has been showered with love the way Calipari once was, but they\u2019ll turn on Pope like they turn on everyone; that\u2019s how it works here. I\u2019ll confess to being grouchier about Kentucky than is probably fair, since they eliminated my beloved Illini in the Round of 32, which is not their fault but of course totally is. Unfortunately, Arkansas and Kentucky are on opposite sides of the bracket, which means the nuclear explosion that would result from an elimination battle between Calipari and his old team could only happen in a theoretical national championship game.\n\nNotable alumnus: Ashley Judd.\n\n13. Duke\n\nThat Duke \u2014 the most hated team in college basketball for several decades now, without any particularly close competitors \u2014 is as high on this list as they are speaks to the loathsomeness of those below them. But it also should be said: This isn\u2019t that hateable a Duke team, relatively speaking. Coach K is gone. There are three future NBA stars on the Blue Devils, all of whom have more interesting games than, say, Steve Wojciechowski ever did. Cooper Flagg is going to be the No. 1 overall pick, an amazing thing to say about someone from Maine, and he\u2019s actually pretty fun to watch. I mean, sure, it\u2019s still Duke; all the bile currently building up in your gullet is entirely justified. But this is not a vintage throw-a-brick-through-your-TV iteration. If you find yourself almost kinda-sorta liking them, don\u2019t worry: No one has to know.\n\nNotable alumnus: Stephen Miller.\n\n14. Mississippi\n\nWe now reach the Dastardly Coaches portion of our list with the first of the the Three Assheads, all from the Southeastern Conference. Mississippi\u2019s coach is Chris Beard, who, back in 2022, was the coaching profession\u2019s rising star, having just been hired at Texas, his alma mater. In December of that year, he was arrested on a felony domestic-violence charge. His then-fianc\u00e9e said he had \u201cchoked me, bit me, bruises all over my leg, throwing me around, and going nuts,\u201d accusations police said were consistent with the physical evidence. Texas fired him, but after the woman eventually declined to press charges, Beard rebuilt his career at Mississippi, whose athletic director, in a shockingly credulous article at ESPN over the weekend, said, \u201cBeing very candid, the situation that unfolded there [in Texas] certainly allowed us to get our name in [to hire him].\u201d (The piece, bizarrely, focuses on a student outreach event Beard did at an Ole Miss sorority.) Beard\u2019s success in Oxford has surely allowed him to launder his reputation into a better job than this one, which basically makes him the \u2026 I dunno, Corey Lewandowski of college basketball? Uh, go Rebs?\n\nNotable alumnus: John Grisham.\n\n15. Florida\n\nTime for Asshead No. 2. That would be coach Todd Golden, a wunderkind hired out of San Francisco at the age of 36 to run one of the SEC\u2019s top programs. The first couple of seasons were a bit middling, but there was optimism heading into his third season until last November, when, according to a blockbuster report in the student-run Independent Florida Alligator, he was accused by an \u201cundefined\u201d number of women, most of them students, of sexual harassment and stalking, including sending \u201cunsolicited photos of his genitalia\u201d to students. After a Title IX investigation by the school \u2014 and, it should be noted, a start to the season that was one of the best in Florida basketball history \u2014 the university dropped any disciplinary actions against Golden, saying it could not verify that any of the accusations \u201coccurred within a university program or activity.\u201d (None of the women have changed their stories, and the Alligator has stood behind its story.) Every game Florida wins, they get closer to the Final Four, and the more questions about this Golden faces. With two more Florida wins, those allegations become the story of this Final Four.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jesse Palmer.\n\n16. Auburn\n\nAuburn head coach Bruce Pearl is living proof of the theorem that if shameless and relentless for long enough, even the most vainglorious scoundrel can paint himself as respectable. Pearl has been one of college sports\u2019 most notorious con men for decades now \u2014 he has been blackballed from the sport twice \u2014 and he keeps popping back up, like a penny laced with anthrax. He has one of his best teams ever in this Auburn team, the No. 1 overall seed, albeit one that struggled a bit down the stretch. Pearl is, plainly, a terrible person \u2014 there has never been a less surprising MAGA coach, and I can\u2019t think of a more apt metaphor for what it feels like to be an American in 2025 than watching him raise a national championship trophy over his head in San Antonio next month. My stomach is turning just thinking about it.\n\nNotable alumnus: Kay Ivey.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that all five of Maryland\u2019s starting lineup hailed from the state."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSeveral top Trump administration officials are facing scrutiny for sending detailed operational plans and other likely highly classified information about US military strikes on Yemen to a group chat on a messaging app that inadvertently included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nThe mistake amounts to an unprecedented breach of security by some of President Donald Trump\u2019s most senior national security officials and raises questions about whether they violated the Espionage Act, which makes it illegal to mishandle national defense information.\n\nNormally, discussions of this nature occur in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF), a highly secure area to discuss classified information.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council told CNN the messages appeared to be authentic. When asked about the report, Trump told reporters on Monday in the Roosevelt room, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\nA CNN KFile review uncovered multiple instances in which officials, believed by Goldberg to have joined the group chat, previously criticized others for how they handled classified information and materials.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host; White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller; national security adviser Mike Waltz; and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have all made public comments in the past attacking officials under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for allegedly being sloppy with sensitive government information. CNN reached out to the officials\u2019 agencies for comment.\n\nMuch of that criticism has revolved around Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State under President Obama.\n\nRubio, identified by Goldberg in the chat as \u201cMAR,\u201d repeatedly attacked Clinton over the issue in 2015 and 2016 \u2013 tweeting about it at least a dozen times.\n\n\u201cNobody is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton \u2013 even though she thinks she is,\u201d he said on Fox News in January 2016.\n\nIn an August 2015 Fox News interview, Rubio noted that classified information should only be viewed in a secure room to protect it from unauthorized access or surveillance.\n\n\u201cYou most certainly know you shouldn\u2019t be talking about it or passing it on in an email, particularly to a private server like the one she had. What they did is reckless \u2013 it\u2019s complete recklessness and incompetence.\u201d\n\nIn a November 2016 Fox News appearance, Hegseth called Clinton\u2019s use of the email server, \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have gone to jail for 1/100th of what \u2013 even 1/1,000th of what Hillary Clinton did.\u201d\n\nIn September 2017, Hegseth criticized Clinton\u2019s use of the server on Fox News, calling her \u201csuch a corrupt politician,\u201d and her actions \u201creckless.\u201d\n\nWaltz, who invited The Atlantic journalist to the group chat, similarly tweeted his outrage that the Department of Justice did not pursue charges against Clinton for her private messages.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing,\u201d Waltz tweeted in June 2023.\n\nEarlier that week, Waltz lamented, \u201cHow is it Hillary Clinton can delete 33,000 government emails on a private server yet President Trump gets indicted for having documents he could declassify?\u201d\n\nAnd in a Fox News interview in May 2024, Waltz said of Biden\u2019s mishandling of classified documents, \u201cAll of those things are a crime, he should be charged at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen those classified documents that were sitting in Biden\u2019s garage and his basement \u2013 highly classified, highly relevant to what\u2019s going on in the world today, with very, very sensitive sources,\u201d he added.\n\nIn August 2022, Miller tweeted, \u201cOne point that doesn\u2019t get made enough about Hillary\u2019s unsecured server illegally used to conduct state business (obviously created to hide the Clintons\u2019 corrupt pay-for-play): foreign adversaries could easily hack classified ops & intel in real time from other side of the globe.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s email scandal is not the only example. In a late 2012 appearance on Fox News, Hegseth criticized sharing classified information with journalists and filmmakers in a segment regarding how the Obama administration shared intelligence to the filmmakers of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d a 2012 film that depicts the CIA\u2019s decadelong hunt for Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nHegseth responded, \u201cIf we\u2019re sharing intelligence with filmmakers in addition to it being leaked to the New York Times, and we\u2019re releasing movies to affect political elections based on that intelligence, that\u2019s an absolute bright line of something we shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d was released in mid-December 2012 \u2013 a month after the 2012 presidential election.\n\nAnother national security official Goldberg believes was on the chain, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tweeted on March 14, denouncing leaking information to journalists.\n\n\u201cAny unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such.\u201d The tweet came one day after the group chat began and one day before the US military strikes in Yemen occurred.\n\nGabbard recently pulled security clearances from current and former Biden administration officials and barred access to classified information briefings. The move, made at Trump\u2019s direction, was seen as retaliation for Biden revoking security clearance from Trump amidst his administration\u2019s mishandling of classified documents."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nTop Justice Department officials told a federal judge on Monday that the Trump administration is invoking the state secrets privilege to avoid giving him information about deportation flights from earlier this month that are at the center of a legal dispute over whether the government flouted his judicial commands.\n\n\u201cThe Court has all of the facts it needs to address the compliance issues before it,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top DOJ officials wrote in a filing to US District Judge James Boasberg. \u201cFurther intrusions on the Executive Branch would present dangerous and wholly unwarranted separation-of-powers harms with respect to diplomatic and national security concerns that the Court lacks competence to address.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe information sought by the Court is subject to the state secrets privilege because disclosure would pose reasonable danger to national security and foreign affairs,\u201d the officials wrote in the 10-page filing.\n\nBoasberg is seeking the information to determine whether the government violated a pair of temporary restraining orders he issued on March 15 that temporarily blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport individuals the administration has accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe judge had ordered any flights containing noncitizens being deported pursuant to Trump\u2019s directive to turn around immediately, but it quickly emerged that the administration appeared to have violated his command by allowing two deportation flights to continue the evening of March 15.\n\nIncluded in the Monday evening filing were declarations from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem who said that disclosing the information sought by Boasberg would harm US national security or foreign relations.\n\n\u201cIt is critical to bear in mind that removal operations can be (as they are here) counterterrorism operations. If foreign partners believed that any relevant details could be revealed to third parties, those foreign partners would be less likely to work with the United States in the future,\u201d Rubio said in his declaration. \u201cThat impairs the foreign relations and diplomatic capabilities of the United States and threatens significant harm to the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nAmong the questions Boasberg wanted the Justice Department to answer are ones concerning the exact timing of when the two planes took off from US soil and left US airspace that day, as well as the specific times individuals deported under Trump\u2019s proclamation were transferred out of US custody that day.\n\nHe told the government last week that it could submit the information under seal or invoke the privilege, though he said if DOJ decides to shield the information, he \u201cis obligated to \u2018determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the filings submitted Monday to Boasberg, the department pushed back strongly on the judge\u2019s continued inquiry into whether the administration violated his orders, saying, \u201cNo more information is needed to resolve any legal issue in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether the planes carried one TdA terrorist or a thousand or whether the planes made one stop or ten simply has no bearing on any relevant legal issue,\u201d the officials wrote. \u201cThe need for additional information here is not merely \u2018dubious,\u2019 \u2026 or \u2018trivial,\u2019 \u2026 it is non-existent. The Executive Branch violated no valid order through its actions, and the Court has all it needs to evaluate compliance.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Tonight, the Voice of America is silent. The storied broadcaster was launched in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda, but two weeks ago president Donald Trump usurped Congress' authority and signed an executive order effectively shutting down the taxpayer funded broadcaster for what the White House calls \"radical propaganda.\" Friday, a federal judge put any further actions by the administration on hold. Over the decades VOA has projected American values globally, and for hundreds of millions it was the place to find fact-based news about America and the world in their own languages. It all came crashing down in a single day.\n\nSteve Herman: When I heard that 1,300 of my colleagues had been suspended immediately with pay in an email saying that they couldn't do any more work, couldn't go into the building, I knew at that point the Voice of America was gonna die very quickly.\n\nSteve Herman is chief national correspondent for Voice of America and perhaps its best-known journalist. Americans may not recognize him since VOA is prohibited by law from broadcasting in the United States.\n\nSteve Herman: People say, \"Oh, international broadcasting, it's archaic, it's obsolete.\" Why are the Chinese spending so much money and, and broadcasting in dozens of languages over radio and setting up all these TV services? You know, are they wasting their money? I don't think so. VOA is probably the best bang for our buck that we have in terms of public diplomacy.\n\nAfter joining VOA in 2002 as a Tokyo-based foreign correspondent, Herman spent the next 15 years covering the globe for America's flagship international broadcaster before landing at the White House in 2017. He told us he decided to take the job as a federal employee because of VOA's charter, which requires accurate, objective reporting and sets a firewall to protect the editorial independence of its reporters from political meddling.\n\nSteve Herman 60 Minutes\n\nSteve Herman: I've met people, even in North Korea, who have said, when they first started listening to it and they heard it's from the United States, that it must be propaganda. Because that's what their broadcasters do. And then they heard us talking about America, warts and all. And they also heard us reporting about their own country, and telling them things that they could verify with their own eyes, that their own media wasn't telling them. And a light bulb goes off when they realize what it is like with the media in the United States. That you can criticize your own government, have opposition politicians on the air. That doesn't happen everywhere in the world.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Our mandate was never to present the administration's story. Our mandate was always to present America's story.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara is VOA's White House bureau chief. A native of Indonesia, she started working for VOA in its Indonesian service in 2003. Growing up under the dictatorship of President Suharto, she understands the value of VOA.\n\nBill Whitaker: What's the size of the audience?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: All around the world, it is 360 million weekly unduplicated.\n\nBill Whitaker: Listening and watching VOA?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Multi-platform television, radio, digital, social media.\n\nAnd 86% of its worldwide audience tell pollsters they find VOA trustworthy. Two weeks ago, those millions of viewers and listeners were getting daily news in 49 languages.\n\nTurn on VOA today, you get this... on a loop.\n\nSteve Herman: Bill, you and I have both been in a lotta countries. And if you're in a country and all of a sudden television or radio switches from regular programming to music, you know something's up.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what do you think that says to your listeners and viewers?\n\nSteve Herman: I think it would make them wonder, \"What the hell is going on in the United States?\n\nThe Voice of America spoke its first words during World War II, beaming German language broadcasts into Nazi Germany to counter Hitler's propaganda machine. During the Cold War it expanded in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and China to challenge communist disinformation with straight-forward reporting on American life and politics \u2013 our highs and lows, an approach President John F. Kennedy praised at VOA's 20th anniversary.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy: We compete with other means of communication, of those who are our adversaries who tell only the good stories. But the things that go bad in America, you must tell that also.\n\nWith bipartisan support, VOA grew to spread American news and values across the globe.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan: My fellow Americans and fellow citizens of the world, this is Ronald Reagan, President of the United States, speaking to you live from the broadcast studios of the Voice of America in Washington, D.C.\n\nVOA told the Chinese people about the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and the deadly COVID outbreak in Wuhan when their own government wouldn't. It beamed reports into Iran about the democracy protests in 2009, it told the people of North Korea about their government's gulags and Russians about atrocities in Ukraine. VOA has been supported by every president since 1942 \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2026 all but one.\n\nPresident Trump: If you heard what's coming out of the Voice of America, it's disgusting. What things they say are disgusting toward our country.\n\nThat was President Trump in 2020. He complained VOA's coverage of the COVID epidemic parroted Chinese propaganda. Two weeks ago, the White House released a statement called \"The Voice of Radical America\" listing a dozen specific grievances, like VOA reports on white privilege, transgender migrants and Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nKari Lake: They've got national security risks inside this agency. The rot is so bad it's like having a rotten fish and trying to find the little portion you can eat. It's, it's unsalvageable right now.\n\nIn February, President Trump installed Kari Lake of Arizona, a former TV anchor who lost two statewide political races, as senior advisor at the Agency for Global Media, the entity that oversees VOA and its sister services covering Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Cuba. She says they've grown too large.\n\nKari Lake: We are going to be slimming this agency down, way down, it's going on a Ozempic diet.\n\nVOA's budget is $267 million a year. Lake is now moving to implement President Trump's executive order to eliminate the broadcaster to the \"maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\"\n\nWe asked Lake for an interview to discuss her findings and plans for VOA. She declined, responding: \"I won't do an interview with a disreputable news outlet like 60 Minutes.\"\n\nThe president has a well-known animus toward the press, but he seems to hold special disdain for Voice of America. Under his administrations, Steve Herman has been investigated twice for his copious social media posts, including this link to a critic of the dismantling of USAID, which one senior administration official suggested was treasonous.\n\nBill Whitaker: What do you say to people who would say that your Twitter activity, your social media activity, as foreign service officer, technically part of the government, that perhaps you shouldn't be criticizing the president?\n\nSteve Herman: I wasn't criticizing the president. I wasn't criticizing his policies. I was quoting people who didn't like those policies. But I also put out what the president says, verbatim. I put out links to the president's executive orders. Does that mean that I'm supporting or praising those statements or policies? No. And I think any reasonable observer understands that.\n\nOn the 12th of this month, Patsy Widakuswara \u2013 working her White House beat \u2013 asked the prime minister of Ireland a question President Trump found impertinent.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara 60 Minutes\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: What about the president's plan to expel Palestinians out of Gaza? Are you discussing that with him and giving him your position?\n\nPresident Trump: Nobody's expelling any Palestinians. I don't know... Who are you with?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: I'm with Voice of America, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: Oh, no wonder. Voice of America.\n\nBill Whitaker: So when the President turns around and says, \"Who are you with,\" what'd you think?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Honestly, my heart sank a little bit.\n\nTwo days later the president signed that executive order all but eliminating VOA. In following days, Kari Lake suspended hundreds of journalists, banned them from the building, and halted transmissions overseas. For the first time in 83 years, the Voice of America was silenced.\n\nBill Whitaker: You think your question had anything to do with that?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: I think it's impossible for me to know the answer to that question. This is happening to all federal agencies. Honestly, when I was at the Oval Office, it was-- it was just my reporter's instinct and I wasn't thinking about anything else. It was just...\n\nBill Whitaker: Just doing your job.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Two world leaders in front of me. What am I going to do if not ask the questions?\n\nSteve Herman questions whether the president's executive action is legal.\n\nSteve Herman: There are those who want to make the Voice of America the voice of the president. Now, that's not up to the executive branch of government. That's up to the Congress. We're following the laws that Congress passed.\n\nRepublican Congresswoman Young Kim of California is a South Korean immigrant, a Trump supporter, and a longtime champion of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.\n\nRep. Young Kim 60 Minutes\n\nRep. Young Kim: I encourage President Trump to reconsider his executive order.\n\nKim is one of the only Republican members of Congress to challenge the administration on VOA.\n\nRep. Young Kim: When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies, they're gonna, they are not gonna hear the truth. Why are we ceding our soft power that helps us to stay as a free world leader. We're just playing right into Xi Jinping's hands.\n\nBill Whitaker: Since President Trump's executive order, media in China and Russia have been celebrating.\n\nRep. Young Kim: Oh yeah. [laughs] I'm not surprised.\n\nBill Whitaker: Does that concern you?\n\nRep. Young Kim: That concerns me because we're losing that information war.\n\nBill Whitaker: So we pulled back. Who fills the void?\n\nRep. Young Kim: China. Ayatollahs. Kim Jong Uns. Dictators. And we're not there to counter that disinformation.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara is lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to resuscitate VOA, but she fears the damage has already been done.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: If they bring back everybody next week, what kind of newsroom would that be? How can we continue to report without fear or favor with this hanging over us? Would we only have to report on things that pleases the President? It's not something that I signed up for.\n\nProduced by Jack Weingart and Graham Messick. Broadcast associate, Mariah Johnson. Edited by Matthew Lev."

            "full_content": "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Jodey Arrington, Republican of Texas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, Texas Congressman Jodey Arrington, who joins us this morning from New Orleans. Mr. Chairman, great to see you. Thanks for joining us. In the last month, the Dow has lost 5.14% of its value, the NASDAQ 8%, the S&P 6.2%. Consumer confidence, as you probably are aware, has dipped a bit in the last couple of months. How do you account for all of this?\n\nREP. JODEY ARRINGTON: Well, good morning to you Major. First of all, core inflation is down. Mortgage rates are down just a little bit. Food and gas prices are down. So you're going to have fluctuations in in the financial markets, but we're seeing that the fundamentals are already having an impact on the cost of living, which I think should be job number one of this President, but you've got the tariffs, which I think are critical for our long term prosperity to have that reset, have that Fair and reciprocal trade dynamic that doesn't exist today. So transitioning from the last four years to a new administration with a new economic policy agenda is going to have some adjustments that go with it, and- but I think at the end of the day, you're going to have better prospects for growth. You're going to bring down the prices and you're going to have better prospects for our future, including reducing the debt to GDP, which, as the budget chairman, I can tell you, is completely unsustainable at this point and could bankrupt our country.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, one of the top tariff advisers to the president, Peter Navarro, said this morning that tariffs are tax cuts. Are they?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: Well, in the long run, I think having an unfair trade dynamic at the current point is suppressing growth. It's suppressing wages and suppressing job creation, so it has an adverse impact on our economy. There's no way, Major, to reset the trade dynamic that we've allowed to persist in an unfair way for so long without some disruption. The President has been very transparent about it, and he deployed the same tactics. Now, back in his first administration, successfully, we brought China and others to the table. We had a reset. We had new purchase agreements, we had structural reforms, and we benefited. We had better trade activity, we had better economic activity. And overall, wages grew and life in the American economy, and the quality of life for our fellow Americans was better, so that transition has to happen, and the only person I've seen in my life and experience in politics with the political courage to do it has been President Trump, and I support him 100%.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: When you think about the budget and the process by which to finance tax cuts, either the existing ones or new ones, you're going to count on tariff revenue, are you not?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: Well, I think we should count on reducing spending that is runaway, bankrupting levels of spending at $2 trillion in annual deficits that will double in the next 10 years. Half of that $2 trillion is interest on the debt that will more than double in the next 10 years. So, we have a spending problem. That deficit spending is driving World War levels of debt and will bankrupt the country. So, I think we should offset the tax cuts with spending reductions and bend that debt to GDP. The revenue from tariffs could do two things, accelerate the reduction of deficit to GDP and do what the President has said he wants to happen in this America First agenda put our nation on a path to balance, but it can also provide tariff relief like he did in the first administration for farmers in West Texas, for example, with the market facilitation payments that took the sting out of the fallout from the early stages of the trade battles, before we had the reset for reciprocal trade. So, I think those are better uses of tariff revenue, but I think we've got to bring down spending. If we don't, then I don't know how much longer we have before, as Ray Dalio says, we're going to have an economic heart attack, and it will undermine everything.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: Let's talk about spending for a second. As you know, Mr. Chairman, Medicaid is projected to increase 5.2% each year for the next 10 years. House Republicans have voted for $880 billion in cuts over 10 years. You and I both know you don't have to argue with me about it, that it would be a reduction of the future growth, not a pure cut, but if you lose a service as a Medicaid recipient, that's probably a distinction without a difference. Can you say that when this all gets done, alterations to Medicaid will not change the way people access that program and the health services they receive from it?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: Major, I'll do better. I think if we don't make these changes, this program and the federal budget in general is not sustainable, because we're allowing states and local organizations to siphon hundreds of billions of dollars away from the Medicaid beneficiary and the Medicaid program. We also this is the one means tested program that doesn't have work requirements for able-bodied adults. We also have a Medicaid program because of the Obamacare expansion and the expansion population of able-bodied adults, where the federal government provides 90 cents on every dollar match for that population, but the preponderance of Medicaid beneficiaries, the blind, the disabled, the poor, the sickest among our fellow citizens, get about 60% to 65% So all of the healthcare system is oriented around the 90% the able bodied adults, and they're not providing the same access, which is to the- to the traditional Medicaid, which is why the outcomes are going down. So, there is a lot of ways to reorient the system, to make it more efficient, to root out waste and fraud, and it's well over the $800 billion. It's common sense, straightforward, and you don't have to touch a dime of the benefits.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, very quickly, the President told NBC he \"couldn't care less if foreign automakers raised prices.\" Do you care?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: What I care about is that our workers and manufacturers in this country are competing head-to-head with China and every other competitor country that we allow their mark their products to come in our markets, open and free, and they don't, they tax our products, and it's hurting our workers. It's hurting our economic output, and we need a reset, and so there's no way to get to that dynamic, that reciprocal trade arrangement, without the tough negotiation tactics of President Trump. He was successful in the first term. We didn't create economic chaos. We didn't even have much of inflation. In fact, the economy was roaring. We had more jobs, more people out of poverty. That's what's going to happen. And I support the president, and he has to prove that he is committed to this, and I believe he is, and I think that's important if we're going to get to the other side of this.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: House Committee- Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington of Texas. Thanks very much, sir. I appreciate it."

            "full_content": "Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers Union, praised President Trump's move to impose tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S., while noting that \"tariffs aren't the total solution.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers,\" Fain told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview that aired Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\n\nMr. Trump announced the 25% tariffs last week, which he said will take effect on April 2, escalating his administration's effort to boost domestic manufacturers through aggressive trade measures. Fain, who leads the 400,000-member union that went on a 46-day strike in 2023, called the tariffs a \"motivator,\" noting that \"we have to fix the broken trade laws.\" And he urged that if jobs are going to be brought back to the U.S., they need to be \"good paying union jobs that set standards.\"\n\n\"The big part of this that gets left out a lot of times is, if they're going to bring jobs back here, you know, they need to be life sustaining jobs where people can make a good wage, a living wage, have adequate health care and have a retirement security and not have to work seven days a week or multiple jobs, just to scrape to get by, paycheck to paycheck,\" Fain said.\n\nAsked whether he has assurances from the Trump administration, Fain said \"that is the conversation we're having.\"\n\n\"Every time we speak, we talk about bringing jobs back, about bringing the manufacturing base back in this country,\" Fain said. \"But you know, it doesn't do any good if they're going to locate them in places and they're not going to have the opportunity to have a union, you know. And so naturally, we have concerns.\"\n\nFain pointed to the U.S.' manufacturing history over the last 30 years, noting that tens of thousands of manufacturing facilities have left under \"unfair trade laws.\" He agreed with a sentiment shared by Trump officials that auto manufacturing plants have untapped capacity that would allow production to be shifted back to the U.S.\n\n\"We have excess capacity. They could bring work back in very short order,\" Fain said. \"In a situation where they need to build a new plant, yeah, that's going to take a couple years, but there is plenty of opportunity for these companies to do the right thing and bring work back here overnight, just as quick as they shifted out of here.\"\n\nThe UAW president reiterated that \"tariffs are a tool in the toolbox\" and \"not the end-all solution,\" saying \"we have to fix the broken trade system.\"\n\n\"But the way tariffs work, I mean, it's a motivator, because there's going to be a penalty for everything the companies ship in here,\" Fain added. \"And I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.\"\n\nFain argued that companies don't have to \"raise the price of vehicles a penny with these tariffs,\" while criticizing Wall Street for its stance on the issue.\n\n\"All this crying about the effects of tariffs, I find it interesting, because to me, this is just Wall Street,\" Fain said. \"Now that Wall Street's upset about it, it's an issue. Where was Wall Street when all these manufacturing facilities have been leaving the country in the last 30 years?\"\n\nAutomakers' stocks have tumbled since Mr. Trump's tariff announcement, with even U.S. automakers feeling the brunt because supply chains are spread throughout North America. On Friday alone, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%.\n\nMeanwhile, 55% of Americans say the administration is too focused on tariffs, while 64% say it's not focused enough on lowering prices, according to a CBS News poll released Sunday.\n\nThe UAW endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris over Mr. Trump in July. He told CBS News of the endorsement and more recent support for the tariffs that \"there's been no change in where we stand politically as a union.\"\n\n\"We have expectations. Endorsements are earned,\" Fain said, while noting that the union isn't partisan. \"We expect, no matter what party someone comes from, to stand up for what we believe in. So just because we find common ground on tariffs or on trade doesn't mean that everything else goes out the window.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Fain also slammed an executive order the president signed last week to stop or slow down collective bargaining with agencies that have national security responsibilities, calling it \"despicable,\" and saying some of the union's members have been detained. He added that \"free speech is under attack, unions are under attack.\"\n\nIn August 2024, the UAW filed federal labor charges against Mr. Trump and Elon Musk accusing the duo of trying to \"intimidate and threaten\" workers during an interview on the latter's social media platform X."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has blitzed its way through federal agencies over the last two months, spawning dozens of lawsuits in its effort to shrink the federal government.\n\nAs judges take a closer look at how DOGE is operating, and what authority it exercises across the federal bureaucracy, among the many questions they\u2019re asking is whether DOGE is actually a government agency itself.\n\nThe answer to that question, pedantic as it may sound, could have major ramifications, including whether DOGE is subject to public records laws and other statutes that require some oversight of executive branch activity.\n\nThe laws could pose a check on what Musk can do with his government-slashing project \u2014 both by granting access to what\u2019s happening behind the scenes, and by giving legal challengers tools to potentially reverse some of his most drastic actions.\n\nIf DOGE is determined to be a government entity that wields \u201csubstantial authority independently of the President,\u201d the public can seek the release of some of its internal records under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe Trump administration is saying in court that federal agencies, rather than Musk\u2019s DOGE initiatives, are what\u2019s driving the cuts. That\u2019s quite different from the dramatic, braggadocios, chain saw-waving picture Musk and President Donald Trump have painted in the public arena.\n\nIt\u2019s also different from what government whistleblowers have described witnessing as their agencies get slashed and burned.\n\nAfter retrofitting DOGE onto a preexisting government information technology office known as the US Digital Service, or USDS, the administration dispersed DOGE operatives inside a variety of government agency headquarters across Washington.\n\nNow, in a number of lawsuits, the administration is claiming that DOGE has very little centralized organization or power, that its leaders are merely advisers, and that some of the operatives embedded across the federal bureaucracy are now directly employed by the agencies they\u2019re overhauling.\n\nDeclarations in court from multiple government officials claim that Musk has no formal position at DOGE, and no power of his own to execute his vision for shrinking the government. They say his role is just to give counsel to the president.\n\nThe Justice Department is leaning on that argument to try to convince courts that they should not order discovery, including the production of internal documents and even depositions. Several judges appear skeptical, often pointing to public reporting and contradictory statements by government officials in other cases. But the administration has, in some cases, found a more receptive audience at the appellate level.\n\n\u201cThere is this unusual disjunction between what Musk and his minions are actually doing, and what the administration is saying they\u2019re doing\u201d in court filings, said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. \u201cThe key question is: Do courts have to accept that description on paper, which could be bogus, or can they peer through to the underlying reality?\u201d\n\nElon Musk shows off a shirt that says \"DOGE\" as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House on March 9, 2025. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe recent tactics have backfired in some cases, as judges have concluded the new explanations about DOGE\u2019s approach raise more questions than they answer \u2014 and thus could warrant more discovery.\n\nBut the administration has taken aggressive steps to get higher courts to intervene in the fundamental disputes about what DOGE is and, in some cases, secured appellate orders pausing the judges\u2019 decisions.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, suggested in a recent Fox News interview that the legal setbacks were the result of \u201cbias\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe DC Circuit is notorious for having a very far-left bias,\u201d Musk said, while describing the judges as having a close relationship with the nongovernmental organizations being targeted in DOGE cuts. \u201cDoes that seem like a system that lacks corruption? It sounds corrupt to me.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s really in charge?\n\nAmong the greatest checks on DOGE\u2019s power within the government is the Constitution\u2019s appointment clause, which requires that certain government leaders receive Senate confirmation. The Supreme Court has interpreted the clause to cover officials exercising \u201csignificant authority.\u201d\n\nSome legal challenges allege this clause, along with separation of powers principles, is being violated as Musk and his agents are allegedly calling the shots when it comes to sweeping layoffs, major funding freezes and the mass cancellation of government contracts.\n\nOne of the groups challenging DOGE\u2019s authority revealed in court filings this month that a grant cancellation letter the group received was, according to its metadata, written by a DOGE affiliate, rather than the high-ranking Department of Education official who signed it.\n\nA worker removes the US Agency for International Development sign on its headquarters on February 7, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nThe claim that the Constitution prohibits Musk from ordering agencies to make drastic changes to their operations has already persuaded a federal judge in Maryland to limit DOGE\u2019s involvement in the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development. But Musk and DOGE\u2019s access to USAID was restored last week by the 4th US Circuit of Appeals, which embraced the administration\u2019s arguments that Musk has been playing the role of presidential adviser and that USAID\u2019s disassembly had the backing of the agency\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn another lawsuit attacking Musk\u2019s influence, brought by Democratic state attorneys general, the administration successfully appealed the discovery order of a DC federal judge that would have required the government to answer specific questions and turn over documents shedding light on Musk\u2019s role. The US DC Circuit\u2019s brief, unsigned order indicated the judge, Tanya Chutkan, could not allow discovery before ruling on Trump\u2019s legal arguments for why the lawsuit should be dismissed.\n\n\u2018Legal gaslighting\u2019\n\nThe administration\u2019s filings with DC\u2019s federal appeals court describe Musk as a White House adviser with no authority of his own who is entitled to broad protections of executive privilege because of the counsel he is giving to the president.\n\nThe White House last month identified Amy Gleason as the acting administrator of USDS, after judges and reporters dogged the administration for weeks about who was occupying the role.\n\nThis still from video shows Amy Gleason. From What's the Fix?!/YouTube\n\nIn a case in which a watchdog group secured a court order requiring the quick release of internal documents from DOGE, the administration asked Judge Casey Cooper to reexamine his conclusion that DOGE, as it exists in USDS, was likely covered by the Freedom of Information Act and pointed to court declarations from Gleason arguing that USDS has \u201climited responsibilities\u201d that are \u201cpurely advisory.\u201d\n\nWhile USDS has 79 direct employees and 10 others detailed from other agencies, there is \u201cno formal front office or organizational chart reflecting\u201d USDS\u2019 \u201ccurrent composition,\u201d Gleason said in a court declaration this month.\n\nCooper is taking a closer look at whether the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, applies to DOGE, but has said some of Gleason\u2019s assertions raised their own \u201cfactual disputes\u201d that could warrant more discovery.\n\nA claim by Gleason that Musk does not work for USDS was \u201ccontradicted\u201d by Trump and Musk\u2019s own statements, Cooper wrote in an opinion this month, and he pointed to news reports of orders from the president that Cabinet secretaries cooperate with DOGE on staffing issues.\n\nThe watchdog group behind the FOIA litigation has taken up Cooper\u2019s invitation for discovery, seeking depositions of Gleason and of Steve Davis, a longtime Musk adviser now involved with DOGE, as well as other internal information about its work.\n\nThe group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW), noted in its Thursday discovery request that lawyers for Musk told a judge last week, in a case concerning his company X, that he was too busy to sit for a deposition because the White House had put him \u201cin charge of Establishing and implementing\u201d DOGE.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 representations to this Court that Mr. Musk is not running DOGE are tantamount to legal gaslighting,\u201d CREW said.\n\nDo other laws limit DOGE\u2019s activity?\n\nWhile Gleason was explaining in the FOIA case her \u201cfull-time\u201d role at USDS, a separate case revealed she is simultaneously serving as a consultant at the Department of Health and Human Services to implement DOGE\u2019s agenda there. The case, one of several challenging DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive government data, hinges on the Privacy Act, which limits who within the government can access troves of confidential data collected about the American public.\n\nIn the data case, Judge John Bates has OK\u2019d four depositions, while green-lighting other discovery requests from the challengers.\n\nThe Justice Department argued this month that Bates should reconsider that order because the administration had switched gears in how some DOGE affiliates were being deployed. At the agencies covered in the case, some DOGE representatives are now serving as direct employees, rather than just being temporarily detailed from DOGE, the administration said.\n\nThis new setup, the Justice Department argued, meant that Bates no longer needed to look under the hood at how DOGE was operating.\n\nBut Bates rejected that rationale and questioned whom those \u201cdirect hire\u201d employees truly answered to: those above them at DOGE or at the agencies they\u2019re also working for.\n\nThe challengers in the case will get to show the judge \u2014 and the public \u2014 what the discovery has shown to be the answer in a court filing due April 8."

His thinking offers a fresh window into how a swing-state Democrat will try to navigate the politics of Trump in next year\u2019s midterms.\n\n\u201cI think the president is turning off swing voters by acting so recklessly \u2014 by abusing his power,\u201d said Ossoff, the lone Senate Democratic incumbent running in a state that Trump won in 2024.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with CNN last week, Ossoff doubled down on his contention that Trump is \u201cpoisoning democracy,\u201d defended his vote to block a GOP spending bill with a government shutdown looming and attacked senior Trump administration officials for their role in the now-infamous Signal chat before striking Houthis in Yemen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s reckless, he\u2019s unqualified. He should have resigned yesterday,\u201d Ossoff said of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. \u201cAny military officer who so recklessly handled or inadvertently disclosed this kind of information would lose their job, their security clearance and possibly face a court martial.\u201d\n\nDemocrats face a difficult path next year to win back the Senate, currently at a 53-47 GOP majority. Three incumbents have opted to retire, including in two battlegrounds of Michigan and New Hampshire, and they have limited pickup opportunities \u2014 with North Carolina and Maine at the top of the list. But the Georgia seat represents a pivotal pickup opportunity for Republicans \u2014 with tens of millions expected to be spent in the race.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is planning an aggressive push to knock off Ossoff, took umbrage with the senator\u2019s comments about Trump and the GOP \u2014 and took a shot at him over immigration, a sign of the Republican attack plan against the first-term Democrat.\n\n\u201cInstead of a working with President Trump to keep Georgia families safe, Ossoff is leading the fight against efforts to prevent tragedies like this,\u201d said Joanna Rodriguez, the NRSC spokeswoman, referring to a 21-year-old Honduran national who entered the US illegally in 2021 and was accused of murdering a woman earlier his month in the Atlanta suburbs. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful and Georgia deserves better.\u201d\n\nBut Ossoff is trying to navigate his own line on immigration. He broke with much of his party when he was one of a dozen Senate Democrats who voted earlier this year to enact the Laken Riley Act, a GOP law to require detention of undocumented migrants charged with certain crimes and named after the 22-year-old Georgia student who was killed last year.\n\nYet while he contends then-President Joe Biden\u2019s tougher border restrictions came \u201cfar too late,\u201d Ossoff is attacking Trump\u2019s deportation and detention policies as \u201cdraconian.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think the American people are turning against it,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s immigration orders.\n\nKemp eyes a run, Ossoff eyes MTG\n\nWhile Ossoff makes the case against Trump, the Republican field in Georgia\u2019s 2026 Senate race has yet to materialize.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp, who won reelection by more than 7 percentage points in 2022, just two years after Biden flipped the state blue, is being wooed by national Republicans to jump into the race.\n\nOssoff declined to weigh in on Kemp\u2019s prospects, but then turned his attention to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the MAGA firebrand and staunch Trump ally.\n\n\u201cWe will see who runs,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cIt may be the governor. President Trump has said that he would back Marjorie Taylor Green to run for United States Senate. I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s got the guts to do it. But she would be a disaster in the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nPressed on whether it might be difficult to defeat Kemp, Ossoff said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate about who\u2019s tougher. I\u2019m not going to get into the punditry in the horse race. I will be ready for anyone who challenges me for this seat.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans are also eyeing the seat. GOP Rep. Buddy Carter, a longtime veteran of Georgia politics, told CNN on Thursday he is looking at entering the race.\n\n\u201cI was with the governor yesterday. He\u2019s tied up right now,\u201d Carter said of Kemp. \u201cHis focus is on finishing up the [state legislative] session. They finish next Friday the 4th. After that, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make a decision. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he makes a decision, I\u2019ll make a decision,\u201d Carter said.\n\nBut Ossoff is wasting no time in trying to rally his base.\n\nAfter winning support from liberals for voting against a GOP spending bill earlier this month \u2014 and being accused by the NRSC for effectively threatening a damaging government shutdown \u2014 the young Democrat held a rally in Atlanta last weekend with a fiery rebuke of Trump, saying the president has launched a \u201cpower grab unprecedented in our history\u201d and is \u201ctrying to poison our democracy with fear and intimidation.\u201d\n\nAsked why he chose to make that argument in state that swung back to Trump, Ossoff didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s true, and because it\u2019s urgent and it requires us to push back,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Sarah Ferris contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer\n\nAmazon would like the world \u2014 and its investors \u2014 to know it\u2019s trying a few new things with generative AI. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about 1,000 different generative AI applications we\u2019ve either built or are in the process of building right now,\u201d said CEO Andy Jassy on an earnings call in February. Most of these will affect internal tools and processes, but regular customers might have noticed a few recent changes to the Amazon they see and use. In addition to its AI-summarized reviews, last month Amazon debuted Rufus, a chatbot alternative to search, on its site and apps. And last week, it started testing Interests, which turns descriptive requests \u2014 \u201cI am looking for feminine energy and aesthetic in home d\u00e9cor \u2026 under $100\u201d or \u201ctravel-friendly skin-care products from premium brands,\u201d to borrow Amazon\u2019s examples \u2014 into auto-updating widgets you can come back to and check.\n\nThese are all \u201cAI\u201d features in that they rely on LLM-based technology to summarize review text, to layer a chat interface on top of search, and to, as Amazon puts it, \u201cautomatically translate everyday language into queries and attributes that traditional search engines can process and turn into product recommendations.\u201d They\u2019re also responses to things going on outside Amazon that it would either like to co-opt or compete with. Automatic review summaries approximate SEO e-commerce publishing, in which review sites (and quasi-review sites) read and summarize Amazon users\u2019 feedback. As for AI-generated moodboarding, Amazon has long had an interest in Pinterest, which is a quiet but major force in online shopping, in part because it provides a way to organize Amazon\u2019s chaos. Maybe \u201cInterests\u201d captures some of that? Rufus, the most visible of the bunch, is both a \u201cchatbot, why not?\u201d AI-boom feature-add and a response to people using services like ChatGPT for shopping advice, which is a marginal but fast-growing trend.\n\nAt first glance, these are just slightly different ways to use Amazon, alternate paths to the same \u201cBuy Now\u201d\u2013button destination, and new enticements to spend money in basically the same way. But they also offer a way to see Amazon and to understand how strange its business has become.\n\nWhen Microsoft and Google first teased AI-powered search back in early 2023, their pitches were similar to Amazon\u2019s. With LLMs, you could submit queries in plain English and get plain English back. You could have a conversation of sorts with results to refine your search. You could get not just results but context for those results.\n\nThese AI interfaces were simple and clean. There were no ads, and while there was conversational text and the chatbots offered more than just links, the links were still at the center of the experience, and were sensibly selected and ordered. This all-new Google was, mostly, a lot like Google used to be; it was AI Google, sure, but more than that, it was unmonetized Google, which at least looked pretty appealing. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s new interfaces, while superficially novel, are most appealing for what they lack: disorienting layers of interface junk, abundant but redundant options, and, of course, all those ads.\n\nFor fairly obvious reasons that have now been borne out with extensive reporting, Google didn\u2019t end up replacing Search, one of the most popular and well-monetized products on the internet, with a stripped-down, ad-free AI alternative. Instead, it bolted AI-generated summaries to its results pages, a controversial half-measure that has so far amounted to more, not less, bloat. In the meantime, newer AI firms, for now content to lose money in a race for market share, have started adding basic search features to their core products. More recently, Google started testing AI Mode, which looks a lot like its 2023 demo but with a more capable underlying model. This demo too is clean and ad free, available first to paid users and now to anyone who wants to test it.\n\nThis would seem like less of a problem for Amazon, which we tend to think of as an e-commerce operation, but that\u2019s not quite right. Amazon\u2019s encroaching shabbiness is a consequence of its success in the advertising business; analysts expect Google\u2019s share of the search-advertising market to dip below 50 percent this year, in large part due to gains by Amazon, whose share is approaching 25 percent. Advertising isn\u2019t just a $50 billion business for the company \u2014 along with AWS, it\u2019s one of its most profitable businesses, squeezing massive amounts of money from (mostly) sellers and brands in exchange for visibility on Amazon\u2019s own properties. It\u2019s a pretty good business, provided you\u2019re in a position to unilaterally establish and control it.\n\nAmazon has, in this sense, a lot in common with Google, which is still struggling to resolve the tensions between its advertising business and its barely monetized AI products. Meanwhile, as Joanna Stern writes in The Wall Street Journal, one of the things money-losing AI search alternatives are pretty good at is basic product recommendations, and data from Adobe suggests that people are increasingly asking ChatGPT, and others, for buying advice. Rufus, like Google\u2019s early chat-search half-steps, isn\u2019t especially useful, except to draw attention to just how extractive and inefficient the Amazon experience has become.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn a Fox News segment last year on America\u2019s declining birth rate, former congressman Sean Duffy joked about how he would \u201close count\u201d of his nine kids, and urged viewers to follow his lead in having more children.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s good for country and society, it\u2019s to reproduce, to have kids,\u201d Duffy declared. \u201cThat shows that you\u2019re healthy, you\u2019re strong, and you\u2019re patriotic.\u201d\n\nNow, in his new position in President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet, Duffy is writing that philosophy into an unlikely area of federal policy: transportation funding.\n\nThe day after he was sworn in as Secretary of Transportation, Duffy issued a four-page memo to align the department\u2019s grants with what he described as \u201csound economic principles.\u201d One of his new directives: the department should give a \u201cpreference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average\u201d in programs and funding.\n\nThat move could end up disproportionately benefiting pro-Trump areas, according to a CNN analysis of Census and health data and other research charting the wide variations in birth and marriage rates around the US.\n\nDuffy\u2019s order \u2013 which was foreshadowed by his public warnings that a falling birth rate is a \u201ccrisis\u201d for the country \u2013 echoes rhetoric pushed by conservative activists and Trump allies like Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, who have long raised the alarm about the declining numbers of births and marriages.\n\nThe transportation policy would lead to new winners and losers: Fast-growing metros in Texas and Western states that are home to many young adults appear poised to take in more funding, while college towns with fewer people tying the knot and having kids could come up short.\n\n\u201cMaking babies has nothing to do with making roads,\u201d said Justin Elicker, the Democratic mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, which has among the lowest birth and marriage rates of mid-to-large size cities in the US. \u201cThis seems clearly designed to prioritize funding for red states.\u201d\n\nDuffy, a former congressman and reality TV star, has defended the policy as a reasonable investment strategy, at a time when the department\u2019s funding could face significant cuts under GOP budget proposals.\n\n\u201cWhen communities have kids and families, that\u2019s where you see growth,\u201d Duffy told reporters last month. \u201cWe want to invest in growth, and it\u2019s only one factor that we\u2019re going to consider as we look at where we put our money.\u201d\n\nElvis Presley impersonator Michael Conti officiates a wedding at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2023. By one measure, Las Vegas has by far the highest marriage rate in the US. Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nThe policy appears to be unprecedented, experts said. In 25 years of working in transportation planning and demography, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit that analyzes US demographic trends. But she noted that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more guidance that\u2019s needed before this could actually truly be implemented.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, for example, whether federal officials would examine rates at the state level in divvying up funds, or do so at the level of counties or cities. A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation declined to specify how the policy will work in action, or which data and calculations the department will use in determining rates.\n\nCalculating marriage rates in particular is not as simple as it seems. The most straightforward metric would look at the number of marriage licenses approved per resident in a county or state.\n\nBut by that measure, Las Vegas and Nevada have by far the highest rates in the country, thanks to the couples who flock to Sin City to tie the knot. Other areas that attract destination weddings, like Hawaii, also have elevated rates. If the DOT uses this way of calculating marriage rates, it could end up boosting plans for high-speed rail and other projects in Nevada: Officials in Las Vegas \u201cmight be really happy\u201d about Duffy\u2019s policy, Jarosz said.\n\nTo get a more accurate picture of marriage trends around the country, planners could instead use data from the US Census to estimate the rate of couples living in a community who married in recent years. But those kinds of statistics are not easily accessible for less populous areas of the country.\n\nAt the state level, data shows that states that voted for Trump tend to have higher birth and marriage rates than those that voted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, with places like South Dakota and Utah at the top.\n\nAbout 70% of the states Trump won were above the national birth rate average in 2023, compared to just 15% of the states Harris won, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Similarly, 70% of the states Trump won were above the national marriage rate in 2023, compared to 25% of the states Harris won, according to data from the Census\u2019 American Community Survey.\n\nAge plays a big role in explaining the wide variations in birth and marriage rates around the country, said Wendy Manning, a professor at Bowling Green State University and the co-director of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research. Areas that attract young adults who are starting new families have the highest rates of both, while communities that have more retirees and students have lower rates.\n\nReligion also factors in, in part because some studies have suggested Americans who describe themselves as strongly religious tend to have more children and marry at a younger age.\n\nAn analysis by the Urban Institute, a research organization, found that the DOT prioritizing high birth and marriage rate areas would mean more transportation funds going to higher-income areas and areas with larger White populations. It would also benefit suburban and exurban areas where almost all trips are made by car \u2013 potentially meaning more investment in highways instead of public transit.\n\nDuffy\u2019s policy suggests that \u201cthe administration\u2019s approach to funding projects has little to do with the actual benefits that those projects are providing, and a lot more with rewarding certain constituencies,\u201d said Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the institute and a co-author of the study.\n\nA DOT spokesperson said in a statement responding to criticism of the policy that \u201cfamilies and children are the foundation to a strong society, and by investing in them, we invest in the strength and future of our country.\u201d\n\nCurrently, most DOT funding is distributed to state governments based on formulas that take into account state population, fuel taxes paid by residents, and other factors. Other DOT programs dole out funds through a competitive process of grant applications from state or local governments for specific projects.\n\nBeyond using birth and marriage rates in determining funding, Duffy has also worked more broadly to reorient the department\u2019s funding to follow the Trump administration\u2019s political goals. He\u2019s threatened to pull funding to New York City\u2019s transit system, criticized California\u2019s high-speed rail project, and ordered a review of efforts to build bike lanes, electric vehicle chargers, and other green infrastructure.\n\nPotholes are seen on a street in Midland, Texas. Transportation infrastructure in Midland, which has high birth and marriage rates, has struggled to keep up with a booming population. Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe big winners of Duffy\u2019s birth and marriage rate policy could include places like Midland, Texas, which has had one of the top birth rates in the country of any city with at least 100,000 people in recent years, according to census data. Trump won Midland County with 80% of the vote in 2024.\n\nThe city, located in Texas\u2019 Permian Basin, has seen a population boom in recent decades as young people have flocked there for jobs in the oil industry. While Midland has enjoyed economic benefits from the growth, its road network is \u201cbuilt for a city with a much smaller population,\u201d Mayor Lori Blong, a Midland native and oil industry executive, said in an interview.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for 18-wheeler oil tankers to rattle through the center of town, which has contributed to Midland County having higher traffic fatality rates than most of the US. And drives across town that took less than 10 minutes when Blong was growing up can now take half an hour or more, she said.\n\nLast year, the City of Midland won an $8.6 million grant from the federal DOT to implement safety measures on a major street through the city. But officials could save more lives from traffic accidents if Midland received a higher rate of federal funds to pursue similar projects around the city, Blong said, describing herself as a strong supporter of Duffy\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a place where we have to have investment in our roadways to keep people safe,\u201d she said.\n\nNotably, counties and metro areas with large populations of college students tend to have lower birth and marriage rates. In New Haven, home to Yale University, officials are bracing for the potential impact of funding cuts, said Elicker, the mayor.\n\nIn recent years, the city has won federal grants to improve road safety, speed bus service across town, and start planning to redesign a highway that cuts through neighborhoods near the city\u2019s downtown, splitting communities apart. The highway project is dependent on future federal funding, and without it, major changes are unlikely to happen, Elicker said.\n\nElicker argued that federal transportation funds could help more people if they\u2019re used for projects in densely populated areas like his city, instead of less populous areas that have higher marriage and birth rates. He said the DOT policy felt like it was designed to punish areas that opposed Trump \u2013 about 80% of New Haven voters supported Harris.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about it,\u201d Elicker said. \u201cWe should be working together as a nation to address our aging infrastructure, instead of creating policies that prioritize some areas over others that aren\u2019t based on facts or actual need.\u201d\n\nCommuters walk through the snow in New Haven, Connecticut. The city, which has lower birth and marriage rates than the US as a whole, has received past federal grants for efforts to improve its bus service. Michelle McLoughlin/Reuters\n\nDuffy\u2019s policy comes as right-wing groups have advocated for allocating more funding based on birth and marriage rates. Brad Wilcox, a fellow at the conservative Institute for Family Studies, wrote that it was a sign that \u201ccabinet heads and other leaders in Trump 2.0 will be taking a range of creative steps to make good on the new administration\u2019s avowed commitment to make America more family friendly.\u201d\n\nSome key members of Trump\u2019s administration have long focused on declining birth rates, raising the alarm over what they have described as an existential crisis for the US. Vance warned last year that the US doesn\u2019t \u201chave enough families and children to continue as a nation.\u201d And Musk has argued that \u201cpopulation collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.\u201d\n\nBut Manning, the Bowling Green family researcher, suggested that if the administration\u2019s goal is to encourage more marriages and kids, it should focus on passing policies like subsidized childcare or paid family leave \u2013 not redistributing transportation funds.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t tell me the reason they\u2019re not having children or getting married is because they don\u2019t have a well-funded bus system,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to do with feeling uncertain about their future.\u201d"

But then she abruptly decided to put the trip on hold, and now she wonders when she\u2019ll ever go back to her second home.\n\n\u201cI should be there right now,\u201d Savoy told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to debate whether or not it\u2019s a good idea to go.\u201d\n\nSavoy is one of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who make their home in warmer parts of the United States during Canada\u2019s colder months. In fact, Canadians are the top foreign buyers of US properties \u2014 making up 13% of all home purchases in 2024, mostly concentrated in Florida and Arizona \u2014 according to a July report from the National Association of Realtors.\n\nBut as trade tensions grow between the two countries, many Canadians have taken the conflict to heart, loudly booing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at sporting events and boycotting US-made products. Some Canadian snowbirds are reconsidering their lives in the United States altogether. US-based Realtors in Arizona and Florida told CNN they are fielding calls from Canadians looking to sell their homes, and recent data shows Canadian tourism to the United States has slowed to a trickle.\n\nStephen Fine, the president of Snowbird Advisor, a Canadian company that provides real estate, legal and insurance guidance to Canadians who travel south for the winter, said many of his company\u2019s members feel \u201cangry, upset, disappointed and frustrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cA number of them are considering alternative destinations to the US next year. Some want to sell their US properties,\u201d Fine said.\n\nSavoy said that although she loves her Miami home, she is putting off a visit to show solidarity with her fellow Canadians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in these snowbird groups where people have been saying we shouldn\u2019t be spending money in the US,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my country to feel like I\u2019m betraying them during this threatening time.\u201d\n\nEconomic fallout from tariffs\n\nA drop-off in Canadian tourism could bruise the US tourism industry.\n\nCanada is the top source of international visitors to the United States, according to the US Travel Association. A hypothetical 10% reduction in Canadian travel could mean $2.1 billion in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\n\nThere are already signs of a slowdown: Canadian residents made 13% fewer trips by air to the United States in February and 23% fewer trips by car, compared to a year ago, according to Statistics Canada, Canada\u2019s national statistical office.\n\nFlight reservations from Canada to the United States have plummeted by more than 70% every month from March through the end of September, according to OAG, a travel data provider.\n\nShare Ross, a Realtor based in southeast Florida, said she\u2019s recently seen a sharp uptick in Canadians listing their Florida homes for sale.\n\n\u201cSome of the clients I have been dealing with want to sell at any cost, even at a loss,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRental properties have also experienced a steep decline in demand this year, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian market for rentals is just done,\u201d said Ross. \u201cI usually get a few people from various provinces looking for homes to rent. I didn\u2019t have any this season.\u201d\n\nA growing exodus of Canadians from Florida could strain the state\u2019s already troubled housing market. Florida currently has a record number of homes for sale as homeowners face skyrocketing insurance premiums and a growing risk of hurricane-induced flooding fueled by climate change.\n\nTariffs to be placed on Canada and other U.S. trading partners may significantly impact Florida's tourism industry. STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP\n\nThe drop-off in travel from Canada to the United States comes amid a bubbling tit-for-tat trade squabble between the two nations. The latest blow came this past week: US President Donald Trump said he would place a 25% tariff on all auto imports, which Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called a \u201cdirect attack\u201d in violation of US trade agreements with Canada.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration officially placed a 25% tariff on most of the other imports from Canada and Mexico. The president also ramped up threats to annex Canada and make it the 51st state. Canada responded by announcing retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American goods, though the trade war threatens to plunge Canada\u2019s economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner,\u201d Carney said Thursday, adding that Canada would look to shift to trading more with other countries.\n\nTo sell or not to sell?\n\nMiles Zimbaluk, an Arizona-based Realtor who offers cross-border real estate guidance for Canadians looking to buy and sell US property, said he believes politics isn\u2019t the only thing motivating more Canadians to list their properties for sale.\n\nZimbaluk said a weakened Canadian dollar has factored into some snowbirds\u2019 decision-making process. Last month, the Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2003, meaning that everyday goods like groceries and gas have become significantly more expensive for Canadians. It also means that Canadians stand to make a profit by moving their money from the United States to Canada.\n\n\u201cThere are people cashing in now and taking that dollar back to Canada and converting it back to Canadian dollars,\u201d Zimbaluk said. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen a big uptick in people wanting to sell their homes for a lot of different reasons right now.\u201d\n\nSavoy, the Toronto-based retiree, said she isn\u2019t quite ready to put her Miami home up for sale.\n\n\u201cI enjoy my life there. Miami has some great nightlife and beautiful beaches. It\u2019s got everything you need, and I\u2019ve never had any issues,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if things continue to get worse, I will be selling my home in the USA. Not because I\u2019m afraid of being there, but because, why would I want to do business there?\u201d"

            "full_content": "The minimum wage in Florida is under attack \u2013 and this time in a very dishonest way.\n\nAfter years of purposeful inaction by state lawmakers, Florida voters took matters into their own hands five years ago by passing a constitutional amendment that raised the minimum wage in the state. The voter initiative increased the then-paltry minimum wage of $8.65 per hour for nontipped workers, by putting it on a schedule of yearly increases that tops out at $15 an hour by Sept. 30, 2026.\n\nThis year, the graduated minimum wage is $13 an hour in Florida.\n\nThe constitutional amendment passed despite a well-funded opposition led by several business groups, including the Associated Builders and Contractors of Florida, the Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Farm Bureau, the Florida Home Builders Association and the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t sit well with the Republican-led state legislature, either. GOP lawmakers apparently have decided to disregard the state\u2019s constitution and the will of the voters expressed through that referendum. It took them five years to find a new way to circumvent the voters' wishes. What they\u2019ve come up with is a real doozy.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nA new Florida bill would let employers pay below minimum wage\n\nA bill (SB 676) working through the Florida Legislature this session rewrites labor laws in the state to allow workers to voluntarily request to get paid less than the minimum wage.\n\nYes, I know. It sounds crazy.\n\nWho goes into a job asking to be underpaid? Or hopes to get a job that makes an instant pay cut sound like an exciting new opportunity?\n\nI guess the conversation will go something like this: \u201cGood news! You\u2019re hired. Now, just sign here on the line that says you have agreed to participate in our floor-sweeping apprenticeship opportunity at $7.25 an hour.\n\n\u201cIf you do well there, you\u2019ll be eligible for a french fries work-based learning opportunity as soon as you complete your restroom internship.\u201d\n\nUnder this bill, reclassifying low-wage jobs as internships, apprenticeships or work-based learning opportunities would allow employers to sidestep the state\u2019s minimum wage law by hiring workers willing to sign away their absolute right to a minimum salary.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor in the Senate, Jonathan Martin, R-Fort Myers, tried to make this Dickensian dystopia sound like a noble gesture by calling it \u201ctrading pay for a marketable skill.\u201d\n\nBy Martin\u2019s reckoning, Florida is full of people who don\u2019t deserve to be paid a day\u2019s pay for a day\u2019s work.\n\nThe bill doesn\u2019t define what a \u201cskill\u201d is. There\u2019s also no definition in state law that defines an \u201cinternship.\u201d\n\nTellingly, the bill purposefully allows the subminimum pay to apply to workers of all ages \u2013 not just teenagers. And it is being forwarded despite clear language in the Fair Labor Standards Act and Florida case law that employees can\u2019t waive their rights to minimum pay.\n\nWe need fair wages. This is the opposite.\n\nIn the end, this bill is just a legally flawed gift to businesses looking to cut labor costs at the expense of their poorest, unskilled workers.\n\n\u201cIf we think that $13 an hour is what a bag boy at a grocery store should be making in rural Florida, then I think we have a misconception of either what\u2019s reasonable or we\u2019re not relating that to the cost of goods and services anymore,\u201d Martin said.\n\nReality check: A living wage in Florida for an adult with no children is $23.41 an hour, according to MIT\u2019s Living Wage Calculator. And there are about 1.5 million Floridians working in jobs that pay less than $15 per hour, according to data compiled by the Florida Policy Institute.\n\nThe problem in Florida isn\u2019t that wages are too high and corporate profits are too low.\n\nThis bill is a monumental step in the wrong direction. It lends a hand to those who need it least at the expense of those who are most in need.\n\nHere\u2019s how Jackson Oberlink, the legislative director for the social justice group Florida For All, put it.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, no worker truly opts out of fair wages. There is zero protections in this bill against coercion, fraud, or employer intimidation, meaning bad actors can and will exploit it,\u201d Oberlink told lawmakers at a committee meeting earlier this month.\n\n\u201cUnder this bill,\" he added, \"a fast-food worker, a grocery store cashier or a construction apprentice could suddenly find themselves reclassified as an intern and making far less than the legal minimum wage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this bill becomes law, it won\u2019t just hurt individual workers. It will drive down wages across entire industries as more and more businesses push workers into these bogus exemptions to cut costs,\u201d Oberlink said.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re asking for is fair pay for a hard day\u2019s work without loopholes, without carve-outs and without games,\u201d he said.\n\nIs that too much to ask? We\u2019ll soon find out.\n\nFrank Cerabino is a news columnist with The Palm Beach Post, where this column originally published. He can be reached at fcerabino@gannett.com"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump is using the power of the federal government to intimidate or neuter potential sources of opposition to him: The legal establishment, academia and prominent cultural institutions, the media, the judiciary, the Democratic Party, Congress and independent government oversight.\n\nThe unprecedented breadth of the actions Trump and his allies inside the government have taken against his perceived political and ideological opponents in his first two months back in office is stunning \u2013 both in the president\u2019s willingness to test the limits of his powers and the extent to which his foes have struggled to respond or even bent to his will.\n\nThrough executive orders, his bully pulpit and lieutenants in charge of the Justice Department and other Cabinet agencies, Trump\u2019s actions are paralyzing institutions that stand as pillars of America\u2019s independent civic society.\n\nWithin the legal establishment, at least two law firms Trump has a political vendetta against have chosen to cut a deal with him to avert his threats. In academia, universities like Columbia have agreed to sweeping demands that encroach on principles of academic freedom that date back centuries.\n\n\u201cThis White House\u2019s public, multi-pronged frontal assault on national institutions is unprecedented,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, the CNN presidential historian and senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs. \u201cInstitutions can be rebuilt, but political culture can be poisoned for a generation.\u201d\n\nThe sources of typical opposition for a president have been quieted \u2013 if not quashed altogether. Independent media organizations like the Associated Press are being shut out of access to the president in favor of pro-Trump outlets, while state-supported media is gutted and threatened with defunding.\n\nThe legislative branch has in many ways ceded its constitutional role as a check on the executive. Republicans in Congress have mostly been willing to give up control of federal spending to the Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 which has shut down agencies and programs mandated by Congress. And Democrats have flailed amid infighting over how they should oppose Trump.\n\nInside his administration, Trump has fired the inspectors general at more than a dozen federal agencies, as well as the head of the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nThe one source of sustained pushback to Trump\u2019s actions is the federal judiciary, where judges have repeatedly halted or reversed Trump\u2019s actions that they have ruled go beyond the legal limit. The judges who have stopped Trump have faced attacks from the president and his allies \u2013 with threats of impeachment or the elimination of courts that oppose him \u2013 and many of the injunctions being levied at the district court level may ultimately not survive a Supreme Court where Trump appointed one third of the justices in his first term.\n\nTrump has boasted about his effectiveness so far. At the White House on Wednesday, he gleefully said that he\u2019s been able to pressure law firms and colleges because the Biden administration\u2019s failures after he lost in 2020 allowed him to return to power and \u201cdo things that we could have never done if it were traditional.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see what we\u2019re doing with the colleges, and they\u2019re all bending and saying, \u2018Sir thank you very much we appreciate it,\u2019\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cAnd nobody can believe it \u2013 including law firms that have been so horrible, law firms that nobody would believe and they\u2019re just saying, \u201cWhere do I sign where do I sign?\u201d he continued. \u201cNobody can believe it. And there\u2019s more coming.\u201d\n\nLaw firms\u2019 dilemma: Sue or settle\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly lobbed attacks against the prosecutors who investigated and indicted him. Now that he\u2019s in office, he has gone a step further by kneecapping the law firms that have employed or defended those who investigated him.\n\nTrump has signed executive orders revoking security clearances, restricting access to federal buildings and severing federal ties with lawyers from at least five law firms: one that Hillary Clinton hired in 2016, one retained by special counsel Jack Smith and three that had previously employed lawyers who investigated him.\n\nThe onslaught has divided the targeted firms: Some are trying to fight in court while others are settling with Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s first two targets were Perkins Coie, the Democratic law firm that\u2019s long been in Trump\u2019s crosshairs for its role funding the 2016 Russia dossier, and Covington & Burling, where the White House suspended security clearances of lawyers representing former special counsel Jack Smith, now a private citizen.\n\nPerkins Coie tried to fight back, quickly filing a lawsuit and winning a temporary restraining order from US District Judge Beryl Howell, who issued a scathing ruling accusing the administration of undermining the integrity of the legal system, writing that the president cannot \u201cbring the federal government down on his political opponents \u2026 as he has done here.\u201d\n\nAnother law firm targeted by Trump took a different path. New York-based Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison was hit with an executive order in part because of the firm\u2019s former partner, Mark Pomerantz, who had investigated Trump in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nLast week, the firm struck a settlement with the administration agreeing to the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services to \u201csupport the Administration\u2019s initiatives,\u201d in exchange for rescinding the executive order.\n\nBrad Karp, the chairman of Paul Weiss, wrote in a letter to employees the executive order was an \u201cunprecedented threat\u201d that could have \u201cdestroyed our firm.\u201d The firm settled, he argued, because a legal fight was a no-win situation.\n\nSensing weakness, Trump has expanded his list of targeted firms. On Tuesday, he issued another executive order, this time taking aim at Jenner & Block, where Andrew Weissman, a top investigator in the FBI\u2019s 2016 Russia investigation, had once been a partner. And Thursday he added Wilmer Hale to his list, the former law firm of one-time special counsel Robert Mueller. Both firms filed lawsuits Friday to block Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nAnother potential target, Skadden Arps, proactively settled with Trump on Friday ahead of a possible executive order, pledging at least $100 million in pro-bono work.\n\nTrump also issued a memo last week to his attorney general, Pam Bondi, ordering her to review the conduct of law firms the administration considers to have filed \u201cfrivolous\u201d lawsuits against the United States, going back to his first term.\n\n\u201cAmerican law firms have always represented interests adverse to the US government, without worrying if there would be retribution or sanctions until now,\u201d said Cari Brunelle, the founder of a legal advisory firm that works with several large American law firms. \u201cIt\u2019s created just an incredible amount of fear.\u201d\n\nUniversities face dire funding threats\n\nThe Trump administration has turned the president\u2019s anger over pro-Palestinian campus protests and encampments into policy that\u2019s forced sweeping changes at Columbia University, considered the epicenter of the protests last year.\n\nThe Trump administration this month canceled $400 million in federal grants to Columbia over alleged \u201cinaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u201d Three agencies sent Columbia a letter demanding sweeping policy changes in order to regain access to the money.\n\nThe changes included implementing stricter rules for protests, banning masks, announcing a plan to hold student groups accountable, empowering law enforcement, and reviewing its Middle East studies programs and admissions.\n\n\u201cIt is, I think, the most serious intrusion into academic freedom, and the autonomy of universities,\u201d said Lee Bollinger, a First Amendment scholar and Columbia\u2019s president for more than two decades. (Naftali, the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, said that Nixon had wanted to crack down on universities over anti-war protests, but his aides stopped him.)\n\nStudent protesters gather inside their encampment on the Columbia University campus in April 2024 in New York. Stefan Jeremiah/AP/File\n\nLast week, Columbia agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands. The federal government responded positively but also said that it was \u201conly the first step in rehabilitating its relationship with the government.\u201d\n\nColumbia is hardly the only university in the government\u2019s crosshairs: The Department of Education is now investigating 60 colleges and universities for alleged violations \u201crelating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s immigration authorities have targeted a half-dozen foreign-born students and academics at Columbia and other top universities for deportation over their alleged roles in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nThe Trump administration has also pushed universities to align with the administration\u2019s stance on diversity programs and transgender women competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nPerhaps the most long-term threat to American universities is the Trump administration\u2019s desire to slash the grant funding that universities receive, which universities and scientists say could be devastating for research in America.\n\nIn addition to universities, Trump this week directed his government to scrutinize and threaten funding for the Smithsonian Institution to force federal museums to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from their exhibits.\n\nBanning and investigating the press\n\nTrump constantly attacked the reporters that covered him as \u201cfake news\u201d during his first term, and his rhetoric helped erode public confidence in the media.\n\nNow Trump\u2019s White House and several arms of the government are taking more direct aim at Trump\u2019s perceived opponents in the press.\n\nThe White House barred the Associated Press from the Oval Office, the White House press pool and other events because it objected to the news outlet\u2019s language. The White House singled out the AP because it continued to use the phrase \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d even though Trump renamed the body of water \u201cGulf of America.\u201d\n\nThe AP has sued the White House to regain its access.\n\nThe White House last month went a step further by taking control of which news outlets get access to the president in the press pool, adding pro-Trump outlets in place of the AP and others.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has launched investigations into several media companies \u2013 including CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its interview of Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last year. The FCC demanded CBS provide the transcript and raw footage of the interview. (The transcript, which the network published, showed CBS engaged in normal editing and not nefarious activity as Trump had alleged, CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter wrote).\n\n\u201cThis is a retaliatory move by the government against broadcasters whose content or coverage is perceived to be unfavorable,\u201d said Anna Gomez, one of two Democrats on the FCC.\n\nIn addition, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr quickly reversed eleventh-hour decisions from his Biden-era predecessor by reviving complaints that had been brought against local CBS, ABC and NBC stations \u2013 but not complaints against a Fox station. Carr has been unabashed about treating the historically independent agency as an extension of the Trump White House, including publicly touting \u201cDEI\u201d probes of NBC owner Comcast and ABC owner Disney.\n\nRep. James Comer speaks in front of posters of NPR headlines during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing at the US Capitol on March 26, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe FCC has also launched probes of NPR and PBS over the sponsorship practices of their member stations, and individual public radio stations over their reporting on immigration raids.\n\nIn Congress, Republicans have called for stripping federal funding of NPR and PBS \u2013 Trump said this week he would \u201clove to do that.\u201d And the Trump administration has already gutted Voice of America, the state-run media outlet that broadcasts around the world.\n\nMedia outlets have grappled with how to respond. ABC News settled a defamation lawsuit from Trump by pledging $15 million to a presidential foundation. The Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos \u2013 whose other companies receive government contracts \u2013 asserted control over the direction of the newspaper\u2019s opinion section last month, prompting resignations and a staff revolt.\n\nCBS\u2019s parent company, Paramount, agreed to a merger last year with Skydance that needs government sign-off. Paramount has reportedly considered settling a lawsuit from Trump against CBS over the 60 Minutes interview with Harris.\n\nCongress abdicates its power of the purse\n\nRepublicans in charge of both houses of Congress have largely stood back and supported the way Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE have taken over federal spending, raising little objection to the canceling of funds appropriated by Congress and destruction of agencies created via laws passed by the legislative branch.\n\nThe process of largely dismantling the US Agency for International Development and the Department of Education happened with little pushback from GOP lawmakers, even if the law requires Congress to play a role.\n\nAmbassador Samantha Power (C), former head of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), embraces fired employees and their supporters outside the agency's headquarters as former workers came to collect their personal belongings on February 27, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou can do a lot with just the use of executive authority, and I don\u2019t have any problem with the president aggressively using executive authority,\u201d House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole told CNN.\n\nIn response to mounting pressure from constituents, some lawmakers have privately raised concerns about the party\u2019s rhetoric towards federal workers, relying on backchannels with agency heads, while others have leveraged their personal connections in the administration to get certain federal programs impacting their districts turned back on. In closed-door meetings, they\u2019ve urged Musk to move his efforts to slash spending through Congress.\n\nBut the recent government funding process showed just how far Republicans were willing to go in abdicating their role over the power of the purse to the Trump administration. The bill that passed to keep the government open did not reflect the cuts the administration had made, which meant that Congress was no longer dictating the terms for which money was being spent.\n\nWhen given the room to speak anonymously, many Republicans are blunter about the way the Trump administration is bulldozing through institutional norms.\n\n\u201cIf this was a Democratic administration with the same things happening, people would be lit up about it,\u201d one GOP lawmaker told CNN. \u201cSo, I think we have to be careful about the precedent that they\u2019re setting.\u201d\n\nDemocrats involved in the process say Trump\u2019s spending moves violate the law.\n\n\u201cI absolutely believe that this administration is acting illegally and that we have a responsibility here in Congress to hold them accountable,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, told CNN. She joined with GOP Sen. Susan Collins to protest Trump not designating $3 billion in emergency funds approved by Congress from the spending bill.\n\nBut any Democratic hopes to use the spending process to slow Musk fizzled out, after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to back the spending bill rather than shut the government down to try to win concessions from the administration.\n\nDemocrats fear Trump\u2019s government will target them\n\nDemocrats are now completely out of power in Washington, still pointing fingers about the reasons they lost to Trump and trying to find a winning message to oppose him. They say they already see warning signs that Trump\u2019s Justice Department and Republicans in Congress could use their power to harm Democrats\u2019 political operations.\n\nEd Martin, interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia, has pushed for investigations into congressional Democrats, including reportedly seeking to present evidence to a grand jury over comments Schumer made about Supreme Court justices in 2020.\n\nDemocrats are also gearing up for a fight on the rules surrounding elections after a new executive order this week attempts to dramatically reshape how US elections are carried out. Democrats and voting rights experts this week denounced the executive order as a blatant power grab.\n\nTrump\u2019s order, which is likely to be challenged in court, seeks to use the withholding of federal funding and other threats of action to require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote \u2013 which critics say could disenfranchise millions of Americans \u2013 and to demand that states refuse to accept mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day. It also would allow federal officials to compare state voter rolls against federal databases in a search for unlawful voters, an exercise election experts say is likely to turn up false positives.\n\nMusk and congressional Republicans have also turned their attention to Democrats\u2019 powerhouse fundraising platform, ActBlue. Senior Republicans in Congress are urging Trump\u2019s Treasury Department to share with lawmakers reports of suspicious financial transactions related to ActBlue and calling for probes from Treasury and the FBI.\n\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy is urging the FCC to reconsider a decision last year that allowed billionaire Democratic megadonor George Soros to become the largest shareholder in Audacy and its empire of more than 200 radio stations.\n\nThe tactic by Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill to target progressive groups and law firms aligned with Democrats amounts to \u201cusing the levers of government to try and permanently destroy political opposition, which is what authoritarianism looks like,\u201d said one person close to Democratic fundraising circles.\n\nMike Davis, a former legal adviser to Trump and unapologetic evangelist for political retribution, forewarned during a recent appearance in Florida that there would be \u201csevere legal, political and financial consequences\u201d for many Democrats over the next four years. Reached by CNN, Davis held back on providing specifics of what\u2019s to come, but suggested Trump\u2019s early moves have made clear he intends to inflict pain on those he feels wronged him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn the other cheek,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd this is not the Trump 45 administration. They\u2019ve learned from their mistakes. Four years in office, four years in the wilderness, four years in lawfare.\u201d\n\nMichael Berry, a conservative lawyer serving as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s chief counsel, acknowledged recently an \u201cinternal tension\u201d over whether to \u201cfight fire with fire.\u201d Sharing a stage with Davis, Berry concluded, \u201cWe have to continue to take the high ground.\u201d\n\nDavis disagreed. \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make it right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes it even.\u201d\n\nJudges have been strongest counterbalance\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to stretch the limits of his executive authority have been repeatedly curtailed by the third branch of government: the judiciary.\n\nThere have been more than 100 lawsuits filed against the administration\u2019s executive actions in the first two months of Trump\u2019s presidency. They hit on all aspects of Trump\u2019s attempts to wield his power \u2013 from firing federal workers and slashing federal aid to deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and Trump\u2019s executive order to ban birthright citizenship.\n\nIn dozens of those cases, judges have temporarily blocked the Trump administration from taking action, so the cases can be litigated. Ultimately, much of Trump\u2019s efforts to bend US institutions to his will could come before the Supreme Court, where Trump\u2019s lawyers remain confident he will ultimately prevail in his use of executive power.\n\nBut many of the judges who have slowed Trump have come under professional and personal attack from both the president\u2019s allies and Trump himself on social media.\n\nSome Trump allies in Congress want to impeach the judges who oppose his policies, even though such an effort has no chance of succeeding. House Speaker Mike Johnson this week suggested Congress should consider eliminating district courts altogether, while there are several Republican bills to curtail nationwide injunctions.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg, the chief just of the federal court in Washington, DC, has been a top Trump target. Trump smeared Boasberg as a \u201cRadical Left Lunatic Judge\u201d and called for his impeachment on social media, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump\u2019s ire stems from Boasberg\u2019s ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration\u2019s use of a 1798 law for deportations. Boasberg has since pressed the administration to explain how it didn\u2019t defy his court order when it refused to turn two flights to El Salvador around earlier this month.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s possible violation of Boasberg\u2019s order has prompted fears that the White House will openly defy his \u2013 and other \u2013 court orders without facing repercussions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk over the last seven weeks about a constitutional crisis. People are throwing that term around,\u201d ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said at a hearing Boasberg held on the deportations. \u201cI think we are getting very close to it.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed, Devan Cole, Ray Sanchez and Brian Stelter contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File)\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump used contentiousness around transgender people's access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds. And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt\u2019s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board \u2014 particularly Trump\u2019s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies \u2014 along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president's spotlight is giving Monday's Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n\u201cWhat he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,\u201d said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. \u201cWe have to show him we won\u2019t go back.\u201d\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nTrump's actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women's spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort \u201cto reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land\u201d that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt's not just political gamesmanship. \u201cI think that whether or not that\u2019s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,\" Fordham\u2019s Murib said.\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election \u2014 55% \u2014 said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn\u2019t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris' voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it\u2019s been about right and about one-quarter said it\u2019s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump's and Republicans' positions have given them a political edge.\n\n\u201cThey are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\u201cPeople across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,\u201d said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s so small, it\u2019s relatively unknown,\u201d said Currah, who is transgender. \u201cAnd then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what\u2019s wrong with the left. You know: \u2018It\u2019s just too crazy. It\u2019s too woke.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n\u201cA lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,\u201d Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n\u201cThe Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,\" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women\u2019s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women\u2019s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience \u2026 to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,\u201d she said. But \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nTwo federal judges in separate rulings late Friday froze parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting the law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, both firms linked to the Robert Mueller investigation Trump has sought to punish.\n\nThere have now been direct and separate rebukes by three judges of the Trump administration\u2019s retaliatory policies toward law firms. All three judges have said core constitutional protections are likely violated by the orders \u2013 for people and companies to choose their own attorneys and for firms to be shielded from political retribution because of their speech.\n\nThe temporary restraining order in the Jenner & Block case, announced by Judge John Bates at the end of a hastily scheduled Friday hearing, pauses parts of the order instructing agencies to terminate contracts with the firm and its clients, as well as the order\u2019s directives seeking to limit the firm\u2019s access to federal officials and buildings.\n\nBates said those directives, as well as another he paused aiming to crack down on former Jenner employees being hired for government jobs, were likely unconstitutional because they retaliated against protected speech and were a form of view point discrimination. Language in Trump order\u2019s expressing his desire to sanction the firm for pro bono work for causes the president disagrees with was \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201ctroubling,\u201d Bates said.\n\nThe Jenner & Block hearing began minutes after a different judge in the same courthouse heard a similar request from WilmerHale, which was also targeted by Trump in an executive order issued this week.\n\nJudge Richard Leon issued his order late Friday blocking parts of Trump\u2019s executive order that denied attorneys for the law firm WilmerHale access to federal buildings and retaliated against firm clients with government contracts.\n\nThe measures in the executive order are \u201cthreatening plaintiffs\u2019 very existence,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, and that is qualified as a constitutional harm,\u201d the judge wrote Friday night, a few hours after the hearing.\n\nLeon declined to step into the White House decision to suspend firm lawyers\u2019 security clearances, saying those types of decisions are made by the executive branch.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the court\u2019s swift action to preserve our clients\u2019 right to counsel and acknowledgement of the unconstitutional nature of the executive order and its chilling effect on the legal system. The court\u2019s decision to block key provisions of the order vindicates our and our clients\u2019 foundational First Amendment rights,\u201d the firm said in a statement Friday night.\n\nIn his executive orders, Trump also said he was taking aim at Jenner & Block and WilmerHale because of their work on political causes he disagreed with and because of their ties to the Mueller probe, as both firms previously or currently employed veterans of that investigation.\n\nLeon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, expressed concern at various points in the earlier hearing about how the president\u2019s order could cause some clients to go elsewhere for legal representation if they had concerns with how effectively WilmerHale\u2019s attorneys could provide legal services.\n\nTrump\u2019s order directs federal agencies to suspend the security clearances and access to federal buildings of lawyers for the law firm and to curtail hiring people from the firm. Additionally, it directs agencies to review any contracts they may have with the firm and make efforts to terminate them.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that uncertainty have a chilling effect?\u201d Leon asked DOJ attorney Richard Lawson at one point, adding that the order was \u201clike a sword of Damocles hanging over (the firm\u2019s) head.\u201d\n\nLeon seemed particularly concerned with a section of the executive order that barred the firm from entering government buildings.\n\n\u201cThis is a government building. The Supreme Court is a government building,\u201d Leon pointed out.\n\nWhen Lawson said he couldn\u2019t speak to whether prospective clients of WilmerHale would worry about whether their lawyers could enter courthouses, the judge appeared incredulous.\n\n\u201cHave you practiced law? Have you had clients?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen use your common sense.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, a third judge in the courthouse issued an order temporarily blocking another executive order from Trump that went after the law firm Perkins Coie.\n\nIn court on Friday, Clement told Leon that those three cases \u201care some of the most important cases for the First Amendment and for the rule of law,\u201d adding later that barring certain law firms \u201cis not the tradition in our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf lawyers are looking over their shoulder to decide if they should take the case or if they do, deciding \u2018How do I argue this? Do I walk on eggshells \u2026 or defend my client zealously?\u2019\u201d Clement said.\n\nThis story and headline been upd\ufeffated with additional reporting."

In today\u2019s edition, we take you behind the scenes of President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden move to withdraw Elise Stefanik\u2019s U.N. ambassador nomination. Plus, Kristen Welker writes that the Signal chat controversy highlights a key dynamic of Trump 2.0.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nInside Trump's shock decision to pull the plug on Elise Stefanik's nomination\n\nBy Garrett Haake, Melanie Zanona and Bridget Bowman\n\nAt a White House event honoring Women\u2019s History Month on Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump took six minutes out of his speech to personally recognize many of the Republican women who were gathered in the audience.\n\nBut one person in attendance that he did not mention was Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who was, at the time, Trump\u2019s nominee to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nThe omission, which several GOP lawmakers took notice of at the time, was all the more conspicuous given that Stefanik\u2019s name was included on the list of women in Trump\u2019s prepared remarks, according to a White House official.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear whether Trump purposely chose to skip Stefanik\u2019s name, less than 24 hours later, the president delivered another public blow to the congresswoman. He announced that he was withdrawing Stefanik\u2019s nomination for the ambassadorship, citing concerns over Republicans\u2019 razor-thin House majority and the prospect of a special election to fill her seat.\n\nThe sudden implosion of Stefanik\u2019s nomination came as a surprise to many Republicans on Capitol Hill, especially given that she sailed out of the committee process earlier this year and would have likely garnered bipartisan support on the Senate floor. Plus, the trickiness of the House GOP\u2019s narrow margins is hardly a new dynamic, with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., warning Trump almost immediately after the November election against plucking members from the House for the new administration.\n\nBut over the last few months, there had been growing anxiety inside the GOP and the White House about the difficulties of governing as they try to pass Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy agenda \u2014 a sentiment that was only further compounded by a special House election next week in Florida.\n\nTrump and Stefanik have spoken multiple times since the announcement, according to a Republican source familiar with the conversations, and the president heaped praise on her from the Oval Office Friday.\n\n\u201cShe is phenomenal, number one. She is a friend of mine. \u2026 But she\u2019s very popular in her district. And I didn\u2019t want to take a chance,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a slim margin. We don\u2019t want to take any chances. We don\u2019t want to experiment.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican leaders are now scrambling to create a new spot on the team for Stefanik, who gave up her No. 4 leadership post in anticipation of her ambassadorship. Those discussions are still underway, according to a GOP leadership source, but anything they come up with will not carry the same weight or power as Stefanik\u2019s previous post, which was an elected leadership position that came with additional staff and resources.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nTrump turns to Supreme Court as judges push back on the administration's view of presidential power\n\nBy Dareh Gregorian and Gary Grumbach\n\nThe Justice Department has now submitted multiple filings with the Supreme Court that accused federal judges of abusing their constitutional powers, while lower courts criticized the Trump administration\u2019s expansive view of presidential power.\n\nThe administration asked the high court to intervene in three cases it argues are hampering President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, including one where it\u2019s been ordered to rehire thousands of dismissed federal workers.\n\nThe latest filing, on Friday, focuses on the administration\u2019s complaints about a judge who temporarily halted deportations under Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th century wartime law. Attorneys argued that the judge overstepped his authority, and complained about the overall number of temporary restraining orders imposed by federal judges as a result of legal challenges to Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda.\n\nThe third case where the administration sought Supreme Court intervention involves hundreds of millions of dollars in education grants that were abruptly canceled by Trump officials. After a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Education Department to temporarily make the payments while the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit proceeds, the administration petitioned the Supreme Court in a filing that argued the justices should \u201cput a swift end to federal district courts\u2019 unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of Executive Branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nVice President JD Vance sharply criticized Denmark and other European allies during his visit to Greenland, as the Trump administration continues to push U.S. ownership of the semi-autonomous territory.\n\nTrump had his first phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, calling it \u201cproductive\u201d in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump called on the House to immediately consider Senate-passed legislation that would \u201cfix\u201d language in the recently passed government spending measure that addresses funding for Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump pardoned Nikola Corp. founder Trevor Milton, for his 2022 conviction of federal crimes related to defrauding investors with false claims about the success of the electric and hydrogen-powered truck maker.\n\nTrump signed an executive order taking aim at the Smithsonian and its museums, education and research centers.\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nTeam Trump\u2019s response to the group chat leak underscores a central tenet of his new administration\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nThe question continues to grip Washington: Will there be any accountability for the stunning realization that senior Trump administration officials sent sensitive military information on a text chain, made public after they accidentally added a journalist?\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg disclosed the revelation Monday that he had been inadvertently added to what appeared to be a small group of high-level Trump officials discussing impending military strikes in Yemen, a discussion the National Security Council has said \u201cappears to be authentic.\u201d\n\nThe White House has closed ranks from the top on down. President Donald Trump and top Cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi have either attacked Goldberg or Democrats. And while national security adviser Michael Walz said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the journalist ending up on the chain, he took to Fox News to not just call Goldberg \u201cscum,\u201d but question whether he \u201cdeliberately\u201d found his way onto the private chat.\n\nAll together, they\u2019re refusing to concede an inch, or acknowledge what appears to many to be a clear mistake \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 by Trump\u2019s national security team.\n\nTrump built his brand as a businessman on a simple phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d And during his first term, he was more than willing to cut ties with Cabinet officials and other key aides who waded into controversy.\n\nBut the decision to dig in embodies this central tenet of Trump\u2019s second term: No matter what hand they draw, Trump and his allies relish the fight.\n\nIt\u2019s why former Trump adviser Steve Bannon argued to me that he views the efforts to investigate the incident as nothing but an attack on Hegseth.\n\n\u201cThey are coming for Pete Hegseth \u2014 they\u2019ve been coming for him since the very first day of his confirmation hearing. All this is a second confirmation hearing of Pete Hegseth. And the MAGA base is 110% backing Hegseth,\u201d Bannon said.\n\n\u201cRight now, the administration should have a \u2018no scalps\u2019 policy,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s why I hope you\u2019ll tune into this Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where we\u2019ll speak exclusively to Goldberg, The Atlantic editor-in-chief at the center of the story. I\u2019ll also hear from Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who leveled fiery criticism at key Trump officials at this week\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate.\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Mailbag: How to decipher early vote numbers\n\nThanks to everyone who emailed us this week! One reader wrote in to ask about the early voting numbers in Florida ahead of next week\u2019s special House elections. (As Bridget Bowman reported, Republicans are nervous about early turnout among Democrats in two solidly red districts.)\n\n\u201cHow usual is it to have election authorities to release reports of parties\u2019 early returns? And is it meaningful, as in, predictive?\u201d\n\nTo answer that, we turned to senior politics editor Scott Bland. Here\u2019s his response:\n\nData on who votes is public record, and keeping track of early turnout by party (in states where voters register with a party) has become a big part of campaigns in recent years. Campaigns and outside groups use this data to make sure, among other things, that they\u2019re targeting their appeals to people who haven\u2019t already voted.\n\nSo the release of this data is very normal. (In fact, NBC News had a tracker in 2024 looking at the early vote before the general election.) The key question is how predictive this data can be, and the unsatisfying answer is that it\u2019s very hard to glean predictive insights from early vote data. Currently, Republicans and Republican-leaning voters tend to turn out more heavily on Election Day, while Democrats and Democratic leaning voters tend to turn out more heavily in early voting. But since we can never know exactly how many people will turn out on Election Day before it happens, it\u2019s hard to know what early turnout means ahead of time.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83e\udda1 Badger State bash: Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, said he would seek a court order to block Elon Musk from awarding million-dollar prizes to people at a weekend event ahead of next week's pivotal state Supreme Court race.

            "full_content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Taxpayer-funded staffers in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 office have been making fundraising calls to state lobbyists, asking them to commit to raise money for a DeSantis-aligned political committee as Casey DeSantis considers a campaign for governor, according to five sources who either received the calls or have direct knowledge of them.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office and the staffers said to have been on the calls denied that they happened. And Casey DeSantis, the governor\u2019s wife, has not yet decided if she will run to succeed him in 2026. But she has openly hinted at the idea, which has increasingly become a point of political intrigue in the state \u2014 and prompted DeSantis\u2019 political operation to try to slow the fundraising pace of Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., who has already announced his bid for governor and received President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a no-brainer for most of us. Of course we will give. He\u2019s the governor,\u201d said one person who said they received a call. Like the others who received or were told about the calls, the person spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity in order to freely discuss the conversations without fear of retribution.\n\n\u201cI mean, my kid has to eat,\u201d the person continued.\n\nWhen asked about the calls, DeSantis\u2019 communications director Bryan Griffin said, \u201cThis is completely untrue and I strongly caution you against publishing such potentially defamatory allegations.\u201d\n\nHe did not respond to follow-up questions about what information he disputed.\n\nNBC News reported earlier this month that DeSantis\u2019 political team was calling state lobbyists and asking them to not give to Donalds, according to seven people familiar with that effort. But over the past week, those efforts have included specific requests for lobbyists to give or raise money for a DeSantis-aligned political committee, which would be able to support Casey DeSantis if she were to run.\n\nAnd unlike the calls previously reported by NBC News, recent calls came from taxpayer-funded staffers in the governor\u2019s office, as opposed to political operatives.\n\nThe calls, four sources told NBC News, were made by the governor\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Anastasios Kamoutsas, and legislative affairs director Peter Cuderman. (The fifth source said they were aware of the calls but did not say who in DeSantis\u2019 office made them.) At least some of the calls were made during what would be considered traditional business hours.\n\nKamoutsas wrote in an email to NBC News: \u201cYou have a bad source, this is false.\u201d Cuderman, also reached by email, wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not sure where the misinformation originated, but such claims are entirely false.\u201d\n\nGiven the degree of control the Florida governor\u2019s office has over how state funds are spent, the use of state employees to help in the raising of campaign money \u2014 whether those people have a formal or informal campaign role \u2014 raises ethical questions about the intermingling of official government business and political efforts. Raising political cash is generally handled by political and campaign staffers who aren\u2019t officially involved in governmental functions.\n\nBut it is not unheard of from the DeSantis political team. During Ron DeSantis\u2019 2024 presidential bid, his then-chief of staff, James Uthmeier, organized a group of top administration officials to try to raise money from state lobbyists. It was seen as unprecedented at the time and caught off-guard many state lobbyists, who generally help finance state-level races but do not regularly give to federal campaigns.\n\nAt the time, Ben Wilcox, co-founder of the nonpartisan government watchdog group Integrity Florida, said using taxpayer-funded staff for political fundraising is out of the ordinary.\n\n\u201cCandidates who are also public officials are supposed to draw a bright line between their campaign and public office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sure looks bad to the taxpaying public.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s election code does prevent a political candidate from using \u201cthe services of any state, county, municipal, or district officer or employee during work hours.\u201d But government employees could volunteer on campaigns during their hours off work.\n\nThis round of calls is going out in the middle of Florida\u2019s two-month legislative session, the period of time when lawmakers meet in Tallahassee to pass legislation and the annual state budget. The process concludes with the governor having veto authority over legislation and line-item veto authority over the state budget, giving Ron DeSantis an ultra-fine degree of control over whether certain projects or initiatives get state funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the calls included them listing our priorities or anything,\u201d said another lobbyist who said they received one of the phone calls. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty clear that that stuff is being watched, and this time the calls were, if you were, coming from inside the house.\u201d\n\nRon DeSantis\u2019 political power over Florida\u2019s political ecosystem, which was once seen as endless, is also now waning. When he ran for president, he was overwhelmingly popular among Republicans in Florida and beyond, and he had significant power over the party, which gave him more sway to earn contributions.\n\nBut now, the governor\u2019s 2024 presidential aspirations are in the rearview mirror, he is a lame duck, and he is engaged in protracted fights with members of his own party who lead the state legislature for the first time in his two terms. That decreased profile, coupled with the fundraising appeals to lobbyists, is breeding annoyance among some who are getting the calls.\n\n\u201cIt seems once again we are supposed to be the political piggy bank,\u201d said another who received one of the calls. \u201cThe same people are the ones who keep being asked to give, and now some of that goodwill just does not exist.\u201d\n\nFederal super PACs that supported her husband\u2019s run for president still have roughly $5 million in the bank, according to campaign finance filings \u2014 money that could give Casey DeSantis an early boost if she decides to run for governor.\n\nBut beyond the shot in the arm Donalds got from an early Trump endorsement, he has quickly stashed away roughly $5 million in his own state political committee, boosted by $1.5 million in transfers from his congressional campaign account and an aligned super PAC, according to campaign finance filings.\n\nIn addition, Donalds has a May fundraiser scheduled at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThere is some hope among DeSantis supporters that Trump may give a dual endorsement, or at the very least not lean in hard publicly supporting Donalds beyond the endorsement, but the fundraiser itself will be a key tell.\n\n\u201cIf Trump is not there, or it\u2019s just a regular event, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d said a veteran Florida GOP fundraiser. \u201cBut if he is there, and gives remarks and praises Byron in front of a room like that, it\u2019s clear where things are headed.\u201d"

Photo: Faith Ninivaggi/Reuters\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Tufts University doctoral student, was leaving her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, on Tuesday to join friends in breaking her Ramadan fast when she was arrested by ICE agents. Video of the agents in masks accosting Ozturk on the street generated a new wave of public outrage just two weeks after the Trump administration sought to deport other pro-Palestinian activists holding green cards and visas.\n\nBy most accounts, Ozturk was not a prominent activist on campus, which has prompted questions as to why she was arrested. Her most significant foray into politics appears to be a jointly written March 2024 op-ed in the student newspaper that urged the university to engage with a student-led push for Tufts to divest from Israel. But the editorial was enough for Ozturk to be highlighted by Canary Mission, a website dedicated to calling out people and organizations it accuses of taking part in antisemitic or anti-Israel behavior by compiling and publishing detailed dossiers on them. (Canary Mission did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nDays after Ozturk\u2019s arrest, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the U.S. had revoked her student visa, linking her case to the administration\u2019s ongoing crackdown on student activism and implying she is a protester. \u201cWe gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. If we\u2019ve given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we\u2019re going to take it away,\u201d he told reporters during a press conference.\n\nOzturk\u2019s lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, has filed a petition in court alongside the ACLU, seeking her immediate release. \u201cR\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s experience is shocking, cruel, and unconstitutional. For nearly 24 hours, we could not locate her, and despite a court order to prevent the government from taking her out of Massachusetts, we finally learned the Trump administration had shipped her to Louisiana,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cCriticizing U.S. foreign policy and human-rights violations is neither illegal nor grounds for detention. The government must immediately release R\u00fcmeysa to continue her studies and rejoin her community.\u201d\n\nSeveral other more prominent activists detained by the Trump administration are similarly profiled on the site. Canary Mission lists Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent resident arrested earlier this month, accusing him of leading \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d protests on campus \u2014 the same rationale the U.S. has used to begin his deportation proceedings. Also featured is Mapheze Saleh, the Palestinian American wife of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University graduate student who was detained. Suri\u2019s lawyer has argued that his client has no criminal record and that his arrest was due to his father-in-law being a former adviser to a Hamas leader, according to the New York Times.\n\nCanary Mission emerged in 2015 with a focus on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement to document \u201cindividuals and organizations that promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews on North American college campuses and beyond.\u201d But the site quickly gained prominence with the rise of on-campus protests after the October 7 attacks on Israel, as it trained its focus on student activists demonstrating against the conflict in Gaza. The group behind the site has been accused of conflating pro-Palestinian activism with hate speech and for doxxing the people it highlights. On Canary Mission, Ozturk\u2019s profile includes a photo of her as well as a description of the region where she lives. The page also features screenshots of the op-ed and her LinkedIn page as well as descriptions of college courses she was slated to teach this year.\n\nAttempts to determine who funds and leads Canary Mission have been notably murky. In 2018, The Forward reported that the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco had donated $100,000 to the cause through its foundation via an Israeli charity called Megamot Shalom. The \u200b\u200bJewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles ended its grants to Megamot Shalom after its ties to Canary Mission were reported. The Nation reports that the charity is run by Jonathan Bash, a British-born resident of Jerusalem who has denied a connection with the organization.\n\nCanary Mission\u2019s work has also been used to detain students in Israel. Lara Alqasem, a Palestinian American graduate student, was barred from entering the country to study at a local university in 2018 because of her past work with the University of Florida\u2019s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. Alqasem\u2019s attorneys said the government\u2019s file on their client was largely based on her profile on Canary Mission\u2019s website, according to the Times. She would later win an appeal to stay in the country.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump is extending his efforts to influence American cultural and artistic institutions to the Smithsonian Institution \u2013 a sprawling organization that encompasses the National Zoo and a collection of museums that anchor tourism in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIn an executive order signed Thursday night, Trump put Vice President JD Vance in charge of stopping government spending on \u201cexhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.\u201d Vance serves on the Smithsonian\u2019s Board of Regents.\n\n\u201cOnce widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\u201d the order reads. \u201cThis shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\u201d\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum complex, including 21 museums and the National Zoo. Nearly 17 million people visited Smithsonian properties last year, according to the museum\u2019s website. Admission at nearly all the museums is free.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Smithsonian Institution for comment.\n\nThe order appears crafted in part to direct the museums to soften or distort forthright discussions about the history and impact of racism in the United States and follows similar orders that seek to exert the president\u2019s will over law firms and educational institutions.\n\nIt also follows his aggressive push to take over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where last month he gutted the board of trustees and was then elected chairman of a newly constituted board.\n\nTrump promised to make the center \u201cgreat\u201d and eliminate programs he doesn\u2019t support, including drag shows.\n\nEarlier this month, the president also signed an order directing the Institution of Museum and Library Services, among several other government entities, to be \u201celiminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\u201d The IMLS supports museums and libraries in all 50 states.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas spoke out against the order on Thursday, saying in an X post, \u201cFirst Trump removes any reference of diversity from the present \u2014 now he\u2019s trying to remove it from our history. Let me be PERFECTLY clear\u2014 you cannot erase our past and you cannot stop us from fulfilling our future.\u201d\n\nIn his order, Trump specifically targeted the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum as carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate.\n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture, the order said, \u201chas proclaimed that \u2018hard work,\u2019 \u2018individualism,\u2019 and \u2018the nuclear family\u2019 are aspects of \u2018White culture.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat portion of the order appears to refer to an educational resource for discussing race released by the museum in 2020, which the museum almost immediately removed and apologized for.\n\nTrump visited the museum during his first term in 2017, just months after it opened to the public, where he vowed to unite a \u201cdivided country\u201d and pledged to do \u201ceverything I can to continue that promise of freedom for African Americans and for every American.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the order may affect the museum\u2019s sprawling exhibits which includes frank discussion about the history of slavery in the Americas.\n\nThe order also criticizes a sculpture exhibit of the Smithsonian American Art Museum examining \u201cthe ways in which sculpture has shaped and reflected attitudes and understandings about race in the United States\u201d and a planned exhibit at the forthcoming American Women\u2019s History Museum which the order said celebrated the contributions of transgender athletes.\n\nThe order further directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to \u201cprovide sufficient funding\u201d to revitalize Independence Hall National Historic Park in Philadelphia, which briefly served as the seat of the federal government and is where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were debated, in preparation for the 250th anniversary of the declaration\u2019s adoption next July 4.\n\nIt also directs Burgum to determine whether any statues or memorials in the Department of the Interior\u2019s jurisdiction have been \u201cremoved or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history\u201d since Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nThough that time period includes the last year of Trump\u2019s first term, it also encompasses the period where several monuments celebrating Confederate officers, conquistadors and colonialists were removed throughout the United States as part of the racial reckoning and public outcry against George Floyd\u2019s murder in the summer of 2020.\n\nBurgum is also directed to ensure memorials \u201cdo not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times),\u201d an edict that could be interpreted to direct the removal of references to slave-owning among America\u2019s earliest Founding Fathers."

            "full_content": "NEW YORK -- Dana White squeezed in a recent workout in New York \u2014 ahead of the launch of his new boxing promotion, just after he struck a YouTube deal for Power Slap, days ahead of the next major UFC pay-per-view card and around the time he celebrated making the cover of Forbes \u2014 when his phone buzzed in the gym from one of his closest confidants, the president.\n\nHours before President Donald Trump addressed Congress, he texted White congratulations on becoming the latest cover boy for the business magazine that labeled the UFC CEO the \u201cPopulist Capitalist.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship dates to UFC\u2019s infancy in White\u2019s reign as he reorganized the company and led its rise into national prominence. Their alliance has yielded dividends for both parties \u2014 White stumped for Trump at Republican conventions while men who soak up fight nights threw their support behind Trump in the elections. It\u2019s that kinship that prompted Trump to text White after the cover was released and even take Forbes to task for publishing the president\u2019s name in the sub-headline.\n\n\u201cYou deserve the cover without having absolutely nothing to do with Trump,\u201d White said, as he read the text exchange to The Associated Press. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be mentioned in the scheme of your tremendous success, so much as mentioned.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but perhaps it's telling that Trump's rise politically mirrors that of UFC's ascendance under White, two men whose style has served as a siren song for a segment of the population yearning for a return to the so-called traditional definition of a virile man, not just in the ring, but in life.\n\nKyle Kusz, a University of Rhode Island professor and author of \u201cRevolt of the White Athlete: Race, Media and the Emergence of Extreme Athletes in America,\u201d said Trump smartly latched onto UFC because White has posited the company as a safe space for \u201cmanly men.\"\n\n\u201cIt kind of embodies the brutal, fight-to-the-finish way of being a man,\u201d Kusz said. \u201cIt seems open to all sorts of men across different social categories, whether that\u2019s class, whether that\u2019s ethnicity, whether that\u2019s race. It\u2019s also open to women who are willing to be all-in on that way of thinking. Trump is cultivating that way of being to essentially train the population to fight for his reign.\u201d\n\nWhite was grateful in his text reply to Trump, writing, \u201cWhen they mention tribal business model, it\u2019s really about loyalty and friendship, which is something people these days know nothing about. You and I are the poster boys for loyalty. Thank you for the kind words, Mr. President. But I have no problem being mentioned with you in any shape or form.\"\n\nYes, that\u2019s right, White calls his long-time friend and former business associate from the days when Boardwalk cards at Trump Taj Mahal lifted UFC into relevancy, Mr. President.\n\n\u201cI called him Don before he became President,\u201d White said, laughing. \u201cNow that he became President, I call him Mr. President.\u201d\n\nNow, White, already the king of combat sports, may soon be called the final boss in boxing.\n\nTKO Group, the company that already houses WWE and UFC, entered into a partnership with Saudi Arabian businessmen to form the new, yet unnamed boxing venture that could provide the jolt of cash, infrastructure, and organized leadership the sport needs. TKO will serve as managing partner and run the day-to-day operations of the promotion expected to run its first card next year, but details are scarce beyond the initial announcement.\n\nThe league needs a name \u2014 TKO is literally the low-hanging fruit there for the taking \u2014 a roster and a rights deal.\n\nGiven the business acumen of the parties involved, and the hefty Saudi bankroll, those issues seem easily solvable and White\u2019s input might be enough to prop boxing out of its niche status and into a mainstream sports player. Boxing retreated from the public sports consciousness in part because White and UFC exploited its inherent messiness to create a more coherent fight organization.\n\nIt was WWE president and TKO board member Nick Khan who introduced White to Turki Alalshikh, chairman of the Saudi General Entertainment Authority, about 18 months ago to discuss collaborating on a boxing league. White had toyed with the idea of starting a boxing promotion and trying to fix a sport many believe long broken because of everything from corruption to decaying interest in the United States to the alphabet soup sanctioning bodies refusing to play nice and book the best fights.\n\nThe 55-year-old White hit it off with Alalshikh and Saudi Arabia was eager to add to its sports portfolio.\n\nThe Saudis host a Formula 1 auto race, fund LIV Golf, have hosted numerous pay-per-view boxing cards \u2014 topped by Tyson Fury\u2019s win over Francis Ngannou in October 2023 \u2014 are in the midst of a 10-year deal to hold WWE events and will host the 2034 World Cup in men\u2019s soccer, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet in its sports expansion.\n\nEach marquee event only seems to push accusations against Saudi Arabia of \u201csportswashing,\u201d an effort to rebrand a nation\u2019s troubling public image that has been going on for decades, using the Olympics and other sports across the globe, further into the background. Endeavor (the majority owner of TKO) and CEO Ari Emanuel returned a $400 million investment from the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund in 2019 after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nNow, TKO is working with, among others, Sela, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. The Saudis will fund the league, while TKO will run it.\n\n\u201cSo far, it\u2019s been a great relationship,\u201d White said. \u201cI have to be aligned. I have to feel good about the relationship and these guys have kept their world and did everything they said they would do. Anything that happened with Saudi, pre-my deal, I didn\u2019t have a relationship, I wasn\u2019t with them.\u201d\n\nWhite and TKO have the tools to turn the company into a winner.\n\nWhite \u2014 whom Forbes estimated to have a personal net worth north of $600 million \u2014 has cashed in on the current political climate and an audience that embraces the extreme no-excuses ideological masculinity that ushered Trump into the White House. Trump has leaned on UFC fights as both testosterone-charged campaign rallies and election celebrations and White and his fighters have come along for the ride.\n\n\u201cA lot of the ways in which Trump wants to change culture, and to win at politics, he can express through connecting himself through sport, like UFC, because it does kind of promote manly man who are willing to be strong, be aggressive who are willing to fight for their side,\u201d Kusz said.\n\nMuch like loyalists seemed to tune out impeachment charges against Trump or even his conviction on 34 felony counts in his historic hush money trial, the murky ethos of being bad has never been so good inside UFC. UFC fighters can seemingly act however they want and say whatever they want \u2014 see fighter Bryce Mitchell\u2019s recent defense of Adolph Hitler or Conor McGregor\u2019s order by a civil jury to pay $250,000 to a woman who says he raped her \u2014 without any significant consequence levied by the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight business, man,\u201d White said. \u201cAnd then when you talk about races, religions, whatever you are, whoever you are, that\u2019s what I\u2019m selling. This is the fight business. At the end of the day, get over it. And if you can\u2019t get over it, here\u2019s my solution to you, don\u2019t watch it.\u201d\n\nIn American sports leagues, Mitchell and McGregor would have faced lengthy suspensions or more severe consequences for their actions, the kind of punishments White \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t even sanction himself for an incident with his wife \u2014 no longer worries about dishing out.\n\n\u201cWe went through that early on, figuring out where we fit, who we were and all that stuff. Not anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the fight business. People are going to say some stupid (stuff). People that you won\u2019t necessarily agree with. Some bad thing will break out in their part of the world, and you hold all of them accountable for it and they can\u2019t make a living? That\u2019s never going to be us while I\u2019m here. After I\u2019m gone, I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nAnd how long does White plan to keep running his mixed martial arts empire?\n\n\u201cUntil I die,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe State Department on Friday formally notified Congress it is effectively dissolving the US Agency for International Development and moving some of its functions under the department.\n\nThe reorganization will be done by July 1, the State Department said, sounding a death knell for USAID, a multibillion-dollar agency that fought poverty and hunger around the world.\n\nThe shuttering of an agency established by Congress without the legislative branch weighing in is expected to draw legal challenges.\n\nThe Trump administration has accused USAID of mismanaging taxpayer dollars and funding overseas programs that aren\u2019t in US interests. Current and former USAID employees and aid experts have countered that the agency, while imperfect, meets vital humanitarian needs and bolsters America\u2019s soft power.\n\nIn its first weeks in office, the Trump administration moved to dismantle USAID and freeze almost all foreign assistance, pending a review of those programs. Since then, thousands of USAID employees have been fired or put on leave and billions of dollars in aid contracts have been canceled. Less than 900 USAID employees remained on the job as of last week, according to another notice from the agency to Congress.\n\nThe slashing of the agency brought lawsuits from aid groups and USAID employees, some of whom described harrowing journeys home from overseas for which they weren\u2019t reimbursed.\n\nLater on Friday, a federal appeals court greenlit, for now, the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the agency.\n\nThree judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals were unanimous in the decision, which notes that the courts could ultimately decide to reverse the agency\u2019s unwinding but won\u2019t at this time.\n\nUSAID was a major initial target of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which is cutting thousands of jobs and programs across the entirety of the federal government.\n\nIn a note to the remaining USAID employees obtained by CNN, Jeremy Lewin, a DOGE liaison who is a senior official at USAID, said the move would \u201csignificantly enhance efficiency, accountability, uniformity, and strategic impact in delivering foreign assistance programs \u2013 allowing our nation and President to speak with one voice in foreign affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstantially all non-statutory positions at USAID will be eliminated\u201d as part of the restructuring, Lewin said, and USAID employees will begin getting \u201creduction-in-force\u201d notices on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn the next three months, we will work closely with the State Department to build their capacities to assume the responsible administration of USAID\u2019s remaining life-saving and strategic aid programming,\u201d Lewin said.\n\nThe USAID programs that are being allowed to continue under the State Department involve \u201chumanitarian assistance, global health functions, strategic investment, and limited national security programs,\u201d according to USAID\u2019s notification to Congress, obtained by CNN. The development work done by USAID\u2019s regional bureaus around the world are set to be folded into the State Department\u2019s corresponding regional bureaus, the notice said.\n\n\u201cOther functions are likely to be substantially duplicative of existing functions and capabilities at the Department, and would be eliminated in the restructuring plan,\u201d the notice said.\n\nThere has been substantial resistance to the shuttering of USAID from senior career officials.\n\nA top USAID was put on leave after issuing a scathing memo blaming Trump political appointees for the US government\u2019s inability to conduct lifesaving humanitarian work."

            "full_content": "Photo: Nathan Posner/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nOver the past nine years, Elise Stefanik transformed herself from a Donald Trump critic into one of the president\u2019s biggest cheerleaders. Her exemplary MAGA shilling was finally rewarded in November, when Trump announced that Stefanik would serve in his Cabinet as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik gave up her House leadership position, sailed through her confirmation hearing, and was expected to be confirmed any day now \u2014 then on Thursday, her nomination was pulled because Republicans just realized they may need her vote to maintain their House majority.\n\nSo no one could blame Elise Stefanik if she wanted to spend Thursday evening sulking. But instead, she had to go on Fox News and claim she\u2019s not just okay with losing her dream job, she\u2019s actually delighted to sacrifice herself for the MAGA cause.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I was honored to have earned that nomination by President Trump, and I\u2019m proud to be one of his top allies on Capitol Hill,\u201d Stefanik told host Kayleigh McEnany on Hannity. \u201cI have been proud to be a team player. The president knows that.\u201d\n\nSo why was Stefanik\u2019s nomination pulled at the last minute? The congresswoman made it clear that she did absolutely nothing wrong. \u201cAs you know, Kayleigh, I had my hearing the day after the inauguration, the hearing went incredibly smoothly, it passed by voice, and there\u2019s been universal praise for the nomination,\u201d Stefanik explained.\n\nOf course, Stefanik doesn\u2019t blame Trump\u2019s decision to appoint several House members to his Cabinet despite the party\u2019s fragile majority or concerns that Republicans could lose the upcoming special elections in Florida. Instead, she pointed a finger at \u201ccorrupt\u201d New York governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s threat to delay the special election to fill her seat and the \u201cpoliticized radical left\u201d more generally.\n\nBut Stefanik tried to end on a positive note: \u201cThe good news, Kayleigh, is because I am not pending confirmation, the American people will be hearing a lot more from me.\u201d The congresswoman said she\u2019s excited to have more time for Fox News hits and being one of the president\u2019s \u201ctop fighters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI consider him a friend,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a leader in the House\u201d \u2014 perhaps not literally, as her leadership position has already been filled, but \u201cin terms of one of his top allies, and that will continue to be the case.\u201d\n\nMcEnany closed by reinforcing Stefanik\u2019s framing of her un-appointment as a heroic example of MAGA sacrifice. \u201cWell, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, you\u2019re being praised as a selfless warrior, and I look very much forward to seeing what the bight future holds for you,\u201d she said.\n\nWill Stefanik ever get a promotion for all this groveling? Maybe not. But being a Trump sycophant is reward in itself."

            "full_content": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump with a Tesla at the White House. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, the FBI announced a new task force to crack down on what Elon Musk has described as \u201cevil attacks\u201d against Tesla vehicles and facilities. \u201cThis is domestic terrorism,\u201d director Kash Patel wrote of the more than 80 instances of vandalism, arson, and gunfire that have targeted Musk\u2019s signature cars since January. Patel was joining a chorus of such statements from Trump officials. On March 20, Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to use the full force of the Justice Department against anyone who joined \u201cthis wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties.\u201d On March 21, the FBI urged the public to \u201cto look out for suspicious activity\u201d around Tesla-related buildings. And during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, Bondi accused Texas congresswoman Jasmine Crockett of \u201cpromoting violence\u201d for telling a virtual gathering of Tesla boycotters that she wanted \u201cElon to be taken down,\u201d even though it was clear she was referring to his money.\n\nThe car attacks, while not legal, have not physically harmed anyone \u2014 usually a component of what we think of as a terrorist attack. But because \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d is so loosely defined under federal law, Trump and Musk have been able to manipulate it to serve their ends. By expanding the definition to encompass everything from graffiti to partisan speech, the administration has recast what have typically been misdemeanors and First Amendment activity as 9/11-in-miniature. And they are not the first to do so: Trump & Co. are borrowing from a playbook that has already allowed local municipalities to charge people who have not injured anyone with terrorist offenses \u2014 a chilling portent for everyday Americans who have so far been spared from Trump\u2019s weaponization of the justice system.\n\nIn 2018, after years of protests and riots linked to the Black Lives Matter movement, Republicans in Georgia were eager for new ways to criminalize protests more easily. They passed a law expanding the legal definition of domestic terrorism to include damaging certain types of property. All of a sudden, breaking a window near a political demonstration \u2014 which in the past would have earned a \u201ccriminal damage to property\u201d charge or something similar, according to civil-rights attorney Tiffany Roberts \u2014 could be prosecuted as terrorism. Furthermore, the legal dragnet was widened so that even someone in the vicinity of politically coded property destruction could be labeled a terrorist, too.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened in 2021, when activists from around the world converged on the region to stop a proposed police training facility dubbed Cop City. Amid the ensuing clashes, protesters threw rocks at cops and set fire to construction equipment \u2014 providing local authorities with the perfect opportunity to trial-balloon Georgia\u2019s new anti-terrorism law. By Christmas 2022, cops had arrested five people for alleged domestic terrorism. \u201cWhy is an individual from Los Angeles, California, concerned about a training facility being built in the state of Georgia?\u201d asked the assistant chief of the Atlanta Police Department at the time. \u201cAnd that is why we consider that domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nAtlanta has since become a laboratory for manufacturing alleged terrorists who do not actually terrorize. When militants set fire to more construction equipment, cops simply began arresting whoever was in the general area, claiming that anyone with mud on their shoes was probably fleeing and therefore guilty. This round of arrests \u2014 carried out by Democratic-run law-enforcement agencies, it is worth noting \u2014 formed the basis for the massive, 42-defendant domestic-terrorism indictment filed by Georgia\u2019s Republican attorney general that September, which is still pending to this day.\n\nThe influence of Georgia Republicans is all over the Trump administration\u2019s modus operandi. You can scarcely throw a rock at a gathering of progressives these days without hitting a supposed terrorist. Even though federal law does not allow the Department of Justice to charge people with domestic terrorism specifically, the law is already being contorted to justify arresting and deporting noncitizen activists for exercising their free-speech rights, such as Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestine green-card holder about whom Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar told NPR, \u201cIf he would have declared he\u2019s a terrorist, we would have never let him in.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s list of alleged terrorists seems likely to keep growing \u2014 as with the Tuesday addition of Ruymesa Ozturk, a Tufts University graduate student who wrote a pro-Palestine op-ed and is now being held in ICE custody for \u201cglorifying and supporting terrorism,\u201d according to a DHS spokesperson. Similarly, as an act of acquiescence to Trump, Washington, D.C., is considering charging alleged Tesla vandals with hate crimes.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration has been silent about more recognizable acts of terrorism that align with Trump\u2019s ideological goals. According to Joan Donovan, an organizer of the Tesla Takedown movement, \u201cMusk has developed his own private army of networked harassers, who are calling me a domestic terrorist for picketing Tesla.\u201d The tenor of this picketing is anything but terroristic. Many of the protesters appear to be retirees who are eager to recapture the energy of the heyday of the resistance. But that is not how Trumpists are being trained to see them. The insistence that they are domestic terrorists is the sort of blanket propagandizing impressionable Trump supporters can be trusted to act on.\n\nSure enough, on Saturday, shortly after the FBI issued its warning about subversive activities near Tesla facilities, a group of about 100 protesters from the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Palm Beach County, Florida, was picketing on the sidewalk outside a local Tesla dealership when a man driving a black Nissan SUV drove by and started screaming at them. Suddenly, the driver jumped the curb, forcing several protesters to move out of his way to avoid being hit \u2014 an act of intimidation that called to mind recent vehicular terrorist attacks, like the one in New Orleans on January 1.\n\nThe 44-year-old driver, Andrew Dutil, reportedly exited the vehicle and walked into the dealership, where, one of the employees later told investigators, he announced that he \u201csupports Tesla\u201d and left. Dutil was arrested by local sheriff\u2019s deputies and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. But one of the looming crises of the Trump era is that it is not totally clear, between Dutil and the picketers, who is more likely to be considered a terrorist."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk was speaking to Tesla staff in Austin, Texas, last Thursday when he admitted: \u201cI\u2019m stretched pretty thin. I have like 17 jobs.\u201d\n\nThe meeting seemed hastily arranged. Employees were notified shortly before the event, which was scheduled for 9:30 pm, Business Insider reported. Never before had a Tesla all-hands meeting been live-streamed the way this one was.\n\nIt may have been the first time some Tesla employees had seen their CEO in weeks, as Musk has been spending more time in Washington, DC, working with his new Department of Government Efficiency. The political focus signals a big change for Musk, who has been known to be intimately involved at his companies, even sleeping at Tesla factories or X\u2019s offices during pivotal moments.\n\nAlthough Tesla\u2019s stocks rallied after the Thursday meeting, investors are increasingly calling for Musk to shift gears as the car maker faces a brand crisis \u2014 fueled in part by his politics and involvement in the Trump administration. Tesla sales and stock have been rocked as dealerships, and individual cars have been attacked and vandalized. Prices for used Teslas have plummeted, and Tesla had to recall most of its Cybertrucks in the US because of a problem with its exterior panel.\n\nInvestors worry that Musk\u2019s absence could impact the company\u2019s decision-making at such a critical time.\n\n\u201cThe point is, this has turned into a tornado that only one person could resolve: It\u2019s Elon,\u201d said Dan Ives, a top analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who has publicly called for Musk to return to the EV maker.\n\nWhere has Musk been?\n\nMusk addressed the attacks and vandalism targeting Tesla during last week\u2019s all hands, noting it sometimes \u201cfeels like Armageddon\u201d when he watches coverage of them on TV. Those attacking Tesla are \u201cbeing psycho,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere are times when there are rocky moments, a little bit of stormy weather,\u201d he told employees while encouraging them to \u201chold on\u201d to their stock.\n\n\u201cBut what I\u2019m here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting, and we\u2019re going to do things that no one I think has even dreamed of,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut judging by his public appearances, Musk\u2019s focus has been on his DOGE duties and ties to the Trump administration.\n\nOver the last few weeks Musk has often been seen in Washington or accompanying President Donald Trump, even on the weekends. He made a cameo alongside Trump at a professional golfer\u2019s wedding over the weekend of March 15 at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, for example. Last weekend, Musk tagged along with the president to watch the NCAA Division I wrestling championship in Philadelphia. On Monday, he was sitting at the table during Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Elon Musk attend the NCAA Division I wrestling championship on March 22 in Philadelphia. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nFlight-tracking data for planes associated with Musk largely align with his latest public appearances. But one of Musk\u2019s planes flew to San Jose, California, where many of his companies have major offices, on Tuesday. It flew back to Washington, DC, on Thursday, the same day an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier aired.\n\nHowever, the data doesn\u2019t show whether Musk was on the flight, so tracking his aircrafts isn\u2019t a foolproof method of learning his whereabouts.\n\nStill, the time spent away from Tesla is not sitting well with investors.\n\n\u201cNo one, including us, expected that he would dive so deep into the end of the pool with DOGE (and the) Trump administration, and it would be occupying 110% of his time,\u201d said Ives.\n\nBut Ives said he believes it\u2019s only a matter of time before Musk restores his focus to Tesla, as the all-hands meeting signaled.\n\n\u201cI think there was a groundswell from investors and employees, and he read the room,\u201d Ives said. \u201cThat was a big first step. Now the question is, does he take a step back with DOGE?\u201d\n\n\u2018Decision paralysis\u2019 at Tesla\n\nMusk has never installed a CEO at Tesla like he has at SpaceX or X, because \u201cTesla is his baby,\u201d Ives said. \u201cMusk is Tesla, and Telsa is Musk.\u201d But that\u2019s hampering decision making, Ives said.\n\nTesla did not return a request for comment.\n\nRoss Gerber, a major Tesla investor and co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki wealth management, said Musk\u2019s absence can \u201ccreate a culture where no one is comfortable making a decision\u201d at the company.\n\nTesla executives making higher-level decisions are at risk of getting fired over making a call that Musk may not agree with, according to Gerber, leading to \u201cdecision paralysis.\u201d\n\nA Tesla model Y and other Telsla vehicles sit at a dealership on March 19 in Kennesaw, Georgia. Mike Stewart/AP\n\nMusk is known for taking a hands-on approach to managing his companies, especially Tesla, whose factories he\u2019s said he lived in \u201cfor three years straight.\u201d His dedication continued even after Tesla achieved widespread success; for example, biographer Walter Isaacson wrote in 2023 that Musk would regularly visit Tesla\u2019s Palo Alto office and have impromptu discussions with engineers working on Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature.\n\nAlthough Gerber said he believes \u201cElon is the most suited person to run Tesla,\u201d he says it\u2019s time to pass the reins to save the company.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not coming back to Tesla. He has just moved on,\u201d Gerber claimed. \u201cHe has a much bigger role, and in his mind, (he\u2019s) saving the world now.\u201d"

            "full_content": "This isn\u2019t a joke, unfortunately. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Illustration: @WhiteHouse/X\n\nThere\u2019s understandably a lot of talk in the air about significant numbers of 2024 Trump voters feeling some buyer\u2019s remorse as the 47th president\u2019s actual agenda unfolds. Those who backed him because they wanted a return to economic normalcy, for example, are not going to be very happy with the price-inflating trade war he has launched or the public-sector austerity program he has undertaken to the detriment of popular federal programs and benefits. And swing voters surely did not think they were electing a dictator. Yet it is increasingly clear that Trump\u2019s key advisers think of him exactly that way.\n\nTo some extent, people paying close attention knew that Team Trump had radical ideas about presidential power over the executive branch, as reflected in the \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory common among so-called conservatives these days. This theory holds that the president should have total control of federal-agency operations, even in cases where Congress has endowed agencies with independent status. But Trump 2.0 has already gone far beyond the executive branch in its claims of presidential authority, trampling the Constitutionally established powers of the legislative branch and now threatening the judicial branch as well. The former power grab is exemplified by DOGE\u2019s reign of terror over the federal bureaucracy, threatening its ability to discharge its statutorily established responsibilities, and also by OMB Director Russell Vought\u2019s belief in a virtually unlimited presidential right to \u201cimpound\u201d (i.e., refuse to expend) congressional appropriations in defiance of Article I\u2019s clear grant of the spending power to the national legislature. The latter is implicit in the ever-growing threats being issued by Trump and his supporters to federal judges who have the temerity to exercise the judicial-review authority they\u2019ve enjoyed since 1803, when Marbury v. Madison was handed down.\n\nBut if you listen closely to some of Trump\u2019s most important advisers, we may not have seen anything just yet: they recognize virtually no limits to presidential authority, based on the dangerously exotic idea that he was elected to carry out a literal revolution against the established order of things. Here\u2019s how White House policy director Stephen Miller put it last month in what Fox News described as a \u201ccivics lesson:\u201d\n\nA president is elected by the whole American people. He\u2019s the only official in the entire government that is elected by the entire nation, right? Judges are appointed. Members of Congress are elected at the district or state level. The Constitution, Article II has a clause known as the Vesting Clause. And it says the executive power shall be vested in a president, singular. The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president. That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government.\n\nAside from Miller\u2019s self-serving view that he, himself, is empowered to \u201cimpose the democratic will\u201d on the entire federal government, the idea that the 49.9 percent of the electorate who voted for a particular presidential candidate intended (and are entitled!) to give him unlimited power is very much unprecedented. No wonder the people around the president have gone to such laughable lengths to exaggerate the size of his election victory and his alleged \u201cmandate.\u201d It should take a lot of votes to authorize a dictatorship.\n\nMiller is hardly alone in believing Trump 2.0 represents something of an elected dictatorship. OMB\u2019s Russ Vought, who occupies what he has called the \u201cnerve center\u201d of the federal government, has long argued that we are in a \u201cpost-constitutional\u201d era in which drastic presidential measures are necessary to restore the limited government envisioned by the Founders. In an extensive review of Vought\u2019s public utterances (particularly a 2022 essay he penned for The American Mind, the online publication of the notoriously radical Claremont Institute), Georgetown professor Thomas Zimmer sums up Vought\u2019s rationale for a massive expansion of presidential power:\n\nVought is convinced that America is facing an existential threat \u2013 a situation he has likened to 1776 and 1860: (Counter-) Revolution and total war, that is what America must face if it is to survive. What gives Vought hope is his devotion to Donald Trump, \u201cuniquely positioned to serve this role\u201d as the leader of such a revolutionary counter-offensive against the evil forces of \u201cunnatural\u201d leftism. Literally, in Vought\u2019s words, \u201ca gift of God.\u201d\n\nIt must seem like a \u201cgift of God\u201d to those who want a counterrevolutionary dictator that someone like Trump arrived on the scene. It\u2019s not every year, or even every century, that you get a leader whose supreme narcissism stands out starkly in the narcissistic world of politics, and who openly claims that \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law\u201d and believes that Article II of the Constitution gives him \u201cthe right to do whatever I want as president.\u201d Trump is the perfect vehicle for the authoritarians he has attracted to his banner.\n\nFrom that perspective, all the high-speed norm-shattering power grabs we\u2019ve seen in the past nine weeks make terrifying sense. As New York Times columnist and old-school conservative David French observes, the judiciary that Team Trump is clearly contemplating a collision with is the last barrier to total power:\n\nTrumpists are ultimately hoping to replace the separation of powers with executive primacy, but if they hope to swallow the other branches, they\u2019re right to identify the judiciary as their primary foe. Republicans in Congress exist to serve Trump. But the judiciary knows its role.\n\n\u201cThe primary protection of individual liberty in our constitutional system comes from the separation of powers in the Constitution,\u201d Brett Kavanaugh, argued in a speech at Notre Dame before his appointment to the Supreme Court, \u201cthe separation of the power to legislate from the power to enforce from the power to adjudicate.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope Kavanaugh remembers that when the administration\u2019s claims of total power reach the Supreme Court."

            "full_content": "Illustration: Tim Bouckley\n\nThey call him an opportunist and a vulture who\u2019s capitalizing on a tragedy to promote his dangerous Medicare for All agenda. Over and over, they invoke his name alongside those of left-wingers the likes of Bernie Sanders. For the target of these attacks, Wendell Potter, it\u2019s a familiar playbook \u2014 after all, he helped write it.\n\n\u201cI guess I should be flattered,\u201d he jokes.\n\nPotter is the nation\u2019s most prominent health-care whistleblower, a former Cigna executive who dramatically called out his old employer in front of a Senate committee almost two decades ago. Since the December killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Potter has also been the go-to expert mainstream media outlets have relied upon to help explain how insurance companies screw over patients. (Ammunition used to kill Thompson was pointedly inscribed with the words delay, deny, and depose, terms insurers use to deny prior authorization for treatments.) The attacks against Potter started just as soon \u2014 and bear all the hallmarks, he says, of remarkably similar spin operations he facilitated as a communications executive when hiring PR firms to place op-eds parroting industry talking points in outlets nationwide.\n\nSince walking away from the industry, Potter has waged a relentless, sometimes lonely campaign against for-profit insurance companies through media appearances, books, a newsletter, and Capitol Hill lobbying. Now 73, he\u2019s something of a guiding figure for a loose network of former health-insurance executives trying to atone. United by their desire to rein in the behemoth insurers, all are fighting their own overlapping battles \u2014 whether helping doctors wrangle with the companies or advocating for single-payer health care. Even as chaos reigns in Washington, D.C., they\u2019re hopeful the current outrage toward insurers just might provide momentum for a few crucial changes.\n\nIn their collective decades of work across the health-care sector, each of the four former executives I spoke to for this story, including Potter, arrived at the same conclusion: Patients\u2019 needs are fundamentally at odds with insurers\u2019 financial incentives and the ever-growing demands of Wall Street. \u201cHealth care is a weird thing where you don\u2019t want the customer to use your product,\u201d as one put it. All described stomach-churning encounters with greed that prompted them not only to leave the country\u2019s for-profit health-insurance industry but to question its premise.\n\nPatients are \u201cthe least important stakeholders\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Potter had never been more powerful as an executive, or more conflicted. Having spent the previous two decades climbing the industry ranks at Humana, then Cigna, he had grown uneasy with insurers\u2019 offsetting more and more costs onto patients. A series of events that year sent him over the edge. His mission involved undermining director Michael Moore, who was about to release his documentary Sicko criticizing the U.S. health-care system. Potter took his son along to an early screening in Michigan; his son was so taken with the film that he asked Moore to sign a poster, but Potter himself was preparing to smear the documentary as socialist propaganda. \u201cThe objective,\u201d he says, \u201cwas to get people to think Moore was outside the mainstream of American politics and was trying to sell us on a government-controlled health-care system.\u201d\n\nPotter soon decided on a whim to visit a free medical clinic at a fairground in Wise, Virginia, after seeing an ad for it in the newspaper. When he arrived, he saw hundreds of people waiting on line to get free medical care from doctors working out of animal stalls. Some of the patients had health insurance but simply lacked the money to cover the out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAt the end of that year, he reached his breaking point when Cigna denied prior authorization to pay for a liver transplant for Nataline Sarkisyan, a 17-year-old girl with leukemia. As with any crisis the company faced, Potter found himself fielding calls 24/7, trying to keep Cigna\u2019s reputation and stock price intact even as the standoff intensified into a national news story. The insurer eventually caved to the pressure, but the reversal came too late \u2014 Sarkisyan died within hours. Rattled, Potter later wrote, \u201cI simply didn\u2019t have it in me to handle the PR around another case like Nataline\u2019s.\u201d\n\nA few months later, Potter resigned and took some time off to gather his thoughts, reemerging in 2009 amid the Affordable Care Act debate to testify about how Wall Street\u2019s influence dictated insurers\u2019 coverage decisions. A professional communicator, Potter was uniquely qualified to handle the attention that comes with whistleblowing, deftly leaning into the role of a guilt-ridden executive who made it to the top only to realize in a fit of conscience that the whole system had to go.\n\nNine days after the UnitedHealthcare shooting, while suspected killer Luigi Mangione was being memed to folk-hero status, I asked Potter, \u201cIf you were running comms at UnitedHealthcare right now, what would you do?\u201d He proceeded to describe the steps the insurer\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group, has since taken: No interviews with reporters except in the friendliest of circumstances. Write an op-ed for CEO Andrew Witty in the New York Times acknowledging that this is a difficult business but that the company will work to do right by Americans. Give lobbyists talking points to assuage Congress, and give account representatives separate talking points to placate employer customers who may be facing calls from their workers to switch providers. And of course, send out Witty to comfort anxious shareholders. \u201cI\u2019ll assure you,\u201d Potter says, \u201cthat the least important stakeholders are the people who are enrolled in their health plans. They\u2019re at the bottom of the pile.\u201d\n\n\u201cExecute a few hostages\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from college in 1987, Ron Howrigon answered a help-wanted ad in the Sunday paper for a job at Kaiser Permanente, figuring a career in health care would make him a force for good in the world. Later, he made the leap to Cigna, where his specialty was negotiating payment rates with doctors and other providers, aiming to pay them as little as possible. In the early aughts, an order came down from his boss, Mark Bertolini, a major insurance-world figure who later became CEO of Aetna. According to Howrigon, Bertolini had decided Cigna was seen as too physician friendly, so Howrigon and his colleagues would need to drop 10 percent of the providers they contracted with from the insurer\u2019s network. After some debate, they talked Bertolini down to one percent, and Howrigon cracked a dark joke: Why not cut costs by specifically targeting cardiologists and other vital but expensive specialists? He says Bertolini responded with a straight face and said he was onto something.\n\n\u201cI got this feeling in the pit of my stomach,\u201d Howrigon says. \u201cLike, My God, we\u2019re going to terminate doctors out of network just to show \u2019em who\u2019s boss, and we\u2019re going to pick the doctors whose patients need them most.\u201d According to Howrigon, Bertolini said they needed to \u201cexecute a few hostages.\u201d He went through with it and kicked 150 doctors out of network without cause. (Bertolini, who now runs the insurance provider Oscar Health and has cast himself as an advocate for health-care reform and a progressive, yoga-doing figure in the industry, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIt was clear to Howrigon that the profit motive meant the only way these insurance companies could satisfy shareholders was to \u201cscrew the people who need your product.\u201d Hoping it would be different in the nonprofit sector, he took a job with a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in Pennsylvania \u2014 only to find that it prioritized generating revenue as much as the for-profit plans did. Shortly after his employer cut payment rates to obstetricians, Howrigon\u2019s wife had a successful C-section. Before he was even out of the operating room, his wife\u2019s obstetrician told him, \u201cNext time you take money out of a doctor\u2019s pocket, remember today because I\u2019m the one who was here.\u201d That, Howrigon says, was his rock bottom.\n\nHe secretly used his paternity leave to devise an exit strategy. \u201cI\u2019d be much richer,\u201d he says, if he had simply stayed put. \u201cBut it was making me into a person I didn\u2019t like.\u201d Howrigon now calls himself a \u201crecovering managed-care executive\u201d and works on the opposite side of the table, helping doctors negotiate higher reimbursement rates from insurers. In the process, he has run up against a hardball form of retribution from Cigna. After his business started having success in securing higher rates for doctors, Cigna gave some of his clients an ultimatum: Drop Howrigon or we\u2019re kicking you out of network. In response, two clients said they would sooner terminate their contracts with Cigna than with Howrigon. The insurer backed off but still refuses to communicate with him directly. Now, when he negotiates contracts with Cigna, Howrigon says he has to play a \u201cchildish game\u201d in which he emails messages to his clients, who then forward them to the insurance giant. \u201cThey won\u2019t talk to me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re holding a 20-year grudge that I left.\u201d (Cigna did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nEven now, Howrigon says one of his friends, a medical director at a big insurer, won\u2019t be seen with him in public. \u201cWhat\u2019s that old saying?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Am I paranoid?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Am I paranoid enough?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can we do to make him not want to come in?\u201d\n\nSeveral of the former executives I spoke with expressed fear of being corrupted on a personal level by working in a business that juices its profits partly by withholding care from its customers. Ed Weisbart went into medicine in the 1970s because he believed in the then-nascent idea of HMOs \u2014 self-contained insurance networks intended to keep patients\u2019 costs down by incentivizing doctors to keep them healthy with preventative care rather than saving the payouts for when patients got sick. He began to lose faith in that model after serving as the chief medical officer of an HMO outfit in Chicago in the \u201990s. One of its medical offices was humming along, he says, getting good outcomes for patients and earning a tidy profit, when a policyholder got in a car crash and discovered he had hemophilia. The infusions needed to treat the blood-clotting disorder would cost about $1 million a year, enough to flip the entire operation into the red. Weisbart began to have disturbing thoughts.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, What can we do to make him not want to come in? We could not answer the phone if we know it\u2019s him. We could make him wait an hour or two to be seen,\u201d he says, imagining he could declare victory once the patient gave up and found a new provider. Though the patient ultimately did receive treatment, Weisbart says, that is the kind of thinking the for-profit health-insurance business rewards: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happens in managed care all over the place.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Weisbart took a job with Express Scripts, the massive pharmaceutical-benefits manager, and quickly ran into similarly warped financial incentives. At the time, statins were a popular treatment for preventing heart attacks, but Weisbart couldn\u2019t sell insurance companies on the idea of paying for the drugs because the preventative benefits worked on too long a timeframe \u2014 why should insurers pay for a treatment when their policyholders were likely to switch providers by the time they started seeing any benefits? Why pass those savings along to a competitor? Rather than producing the best results through competition, Weisbart says, the country\u2019s fragmented insurance system just creates perverse business incentives: \u201cA robust public-health solution would be counterproductive for most insurance companies. That got me very disturbed, and it made me think, What am I doing here?\u201d\n\nA few years later, as the industry was working to undermine public support for the Affordable Care Act, he says the Express Scripts CEO asked him to put together a PowerPoint presentation on why health-care reform was unnecessary. Weisbart said \u201cno\u201d \u2014 not something he was in the habit of saying to the C-suite. \u201cI thought, Well, shoot, I am really on the wrong side of this dance card, and I can\u2019t keep putting my skills, such as they are, into supporting this really wrong industry,\u201d says Weisbart, who now volunteers full time for Physicians for a National Health Program, a group advocating for universal single-payer health care. \u201cSo I left.\u201d\n\n\u201cSitting in our living room drinking Champagne\u201d\n\nThe fourth former executive I spoke with requested anonymity because he thinks his former employer would bury him in expensive lawsuits if he were to go on the record for this story. Unlike the other three, the person we\u2019ll call John left the industry just recently. As a veteran physician and longtime health-policy wonk who has held executive roles in a hospital system, John took a job with a major nonprofit insurer primarily because it was the one side of the industry he hadn\u2019t yet worked on and he wanted to observe it up close. He was optimistic that he could at least push for marginal improvements to mechanisms like prior authorization. He lasted 17 months.\n\nOne day, John received a call from a spine surgeon who asked him, doctor to doctor, why his office had to deal with multiple prior-authorization denials per week when almost every single surgery ended up being approved in the end. John took that feedback to his higher-ups, along with a bold idea: Why not turn this whole thing upside down? Instead of using prior authorization for \u201ceverything\u201d and denying treatments that would likely be approved in the appeals process anyway, why not prior-authorize nothing and see if any greedy doctors prescribing unnecessary treatments emerged?\n\nHis bosses deemed it too difficult to implement, and John began to realize insurance executives are often too insulated from their own policies to understand them. At one point, a senior executive he had barely interacted with came to him when their spouse was diagnosed with cancer, \u201cpetrified\u201d that they wouldn\u2019t receive timely care through one of the insurer\u2019s own plans. \u201cAll of a sudden, when their loved one was sick,\u201d John says, \u201cthey decided it was time to get to know the chief medical officer.\u201d\n\nThat lack of concern about patients stood in contrast to the perks for executives like John. In late 2020, in the depths of the pandemic, he was attending a virtual board meeting when a delivery person showed up at his front door with his company-provided lunch. Already irked by the self-congratulatory tone of the meeting, which focused on how well the company was doing financially since so few people were getting nonurgent health care at the time, John was surprised to find a four-course French meal complete with an expensive bottle of Champagne at his doorstep. \u201cIt felt callous,\u201d he says. \u201cMy colleagues were on the front line risking their lives, and we\u2019re sitting in our living room drinking Champagne, talking about how good we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe Champagne wasn\u2019t a one-off, either \u2014 by the time John left the company, he had to buy a small wine fridge, partly just to store all the expensive bottles he\u2019d been sent. After leaving the insurance industry behind, John had some friends over on his birthday to clean out the collection. \u201cWe put it to good use,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t bring myself to open it or do anything with it while I was actually working there.\u201d\n\nThe financial incentive to deny care is at the core of the industry\u2019s rot, all four former executives argue, and it only seems to be getting worse as big insurers like UnitedHealth Group expand into more areas, including hospice care. It isn\u2019t hard, John says, to imagine the potential conflicts of interest when your insurance company also makes money from your hospice stay. \u201cThese companies are even bigger \u2014 far bigger \u2014 than they were when I was in the industry,\u201d Potter says. \u201cThey use a lot of their money on campaign contributions, on lobbying, on propaganda campaigns to protect the status quo.\u201d\n\nAs deeply entrenched as their business practices may seem, Potter says the big insurers haven\u2019t been this way for that long \u2014 only over the past 30 years or so has a majority of Americans\u2019 health care been consolidated under a few massive for-profit corporations. In that same period, the companies have perfected the art of what John calls \u201cself-dealing,\u201d buying out major players in other areas of the health-care sector to create more stopping points at which they get paid. Those points are often middleman businesses that arguably do little to improve the patient experience yet drive up the costs. Most of Cigna\u2019s $232 billion in revenue last year, for instance, came from Evernorth Health Services, a subsidiary that contains Express Scripts and the prior-authorization shop EviCore. Pharmaceutical-benefits managers, including Express Scripts, have been accused by the Federal Trade Commission of inflating drug prices, while one insider at a large, unidentified prior-authorization shop says the company sells its services to insurers by bragging about how many denials it issues for care it deems unnecessary.\n\nA broad consensus has formed that these companies are too big. Politicians in both parties have introduced prior-authorization bills in the past few years, and even President Trump has criticized PBMs, saying he plans to \u201cknock out the middleman.\u201d On a recent lobbying trip to D.C., Potter says he spoke with more Republicans than Democrats about cracking down on Medicare Advantage plans, which insurers have used to wildly overcharge the federal government.\n\nEven as the former executives and others attempt to channel revived public rage toward insurers into reform, they admit systemic overhaul remains a long way off. \u201cThings are going to have to get much worse before we can approach something like this,\u201d Howrigon says of his preferred model for a universal-coverage health-care system, before offering an analogy: \u201cSome people don\u2019t get serious about diet and exercise until after they have a heart attack. That\u2019s where we are now. I just hope we survive the heart attack.\u201d\n\nFor now, the health-care defectors\u2019 club remains small, though several of the ones I spoke with say former colleagues still working in the industry frequently reach out to secretly agree with them. In a frustrated email recently, Howrigon summed up a sentiment expressed by each of the former executives: \u201cI\u2019m tired of the stuff they get away with.\u201d\n\nWhile Potter acknowledges the risks of defection, he\u2019s made clear that he\u2019s willing to help any current insiders who might want to take a step toward becoming vocal critics of the industry, and is working with a whistleblower nonprofit, the Signals Network, to encourage more to come forward. \u201cI hope there will be more,\u201d he says, adding that the big insurers now find themselves in a more precarious situation than they\u2019ve seen \u201cin many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they have long felt, or at least have felt in recent years, that they could operate with impunity,\u201d Potter says. \u201cThey have to be thinking now that they may not be doing something they can do indefinitely.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "As he sized up a U.S. plan to strike Houthi militants in Yemen in March, Vice President JD Vance didn\u2019t think such an aggressive move was a good idea \u2014 at least not now. The vice president\u2019s initial comment in the Signal chat that has gotten so much attention this week was that such a strike would be \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, he didn\u2019t think the American public would understand why we were doing it and worried that it might cause oil prices to spike. In that message, he wrote:\n\n3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn\u2019t understand this or why it\u2019s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There\u2019s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth responded by arguing that the strike wouldn\u2019t even be about the militants the U.S. sought to kill. Instead, it was about signaling American power to the world.\n\nThough most of the commentary about the Signal group chat this past week has focused on the accidental inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg \u2014 an outrageous breach of national security protocols \u2014 the scandal has also provided us an extraordinary window into Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2019s thinking about foreign policy strategy.\n\nIt underscores how farcical Trump's pledge to be president of \"peace\" and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be.\n\nWhat it reveals is a cavalier attitude toward new open-ended bombardment campaigns. And it underscores how farcical Trump\u2019s pledge to be president of \u201cpeace\u201d and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be. Trump didn\u2019t need to drop bombs on scores of sites across the poorest country in the Middle East now or with such intensity \u2014 and his whole team admitted it.\n\nVance was not wholly opposed to the strikes, but saw them as a deviation from a narrow focus on American interests. In some ways, he seemed to be holding the strictest interpretation of \u201cAmerica First\" principles in the chat. His thinking was why attack Houthi militants if doing so wasn\u2019t that important for the U.S. economically, but could hurt U.S. consumers and politically hurt Trump?\n\nMultiple principals in the chat pushed Vance to adopt an expansive vision of U.S. national interests.\n\nHegseth argued, \u201cThis [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause.\u201d And national security adviser Michael Waltz contended: \u201cWhether it\u2019s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.\u201d\n\nIn a later exchange Vance says he defers to the group but that he hates the idea of \u201cbailing Europe out again.\u201d Hegseth replies, \u201cI fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It\u2019s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.\u201d\n\nIn the discussion, Hegseth and Waltz represent a more traditional view of America as the world\u2019s police officer. They\u2019re saying this isn\u2019t about defending the U.S. against the militants who are being targeted, and it isn\u2019t about the U.S.\u2019s own economic interests. Rather, it\u2019s an intervention on behalf of U.S. allies and a pre-emptive signal to the U.S.\u2019s nemesis in the region, Iran. It functions as a way \u201cto send a message\u201d about American geopolitical supremacy. It is the kind of argument that could easily be advanced by a Democratic liberal internationalist or a Republican neoconservative \u2014 both factions that some MAGA types have correctly lambasted as war hungry.\n\nWeeks after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel began its retaliation, Houthi rebels began launching missiles and drone attacks at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, citing Israel's bombing of Gaza and stating it wouldn't stop until \u201cIsraeli aggression stops.\" The Biden administration launched airstrikes against the Houthis in 2024, but that did not stop them. Rather, the Houthis announced a pause when Israel and Hamas struck a ceasefire deal. (In the meantime, many shipping companies have taken up routes avoiding the Red Sea, and after an initial rise in the price of shipping, those companies adapted and prices came down again this year.) Now, in light of Israel\u2019s decision to torpedo the ceasefire deal and impose a starvation blockade on the entire population of Gaza \u2014 with Trump's blessing \u2014 the Houthis had warned that they would resume missile attacks. But they hadn\u2019t yet. Multiple Pentagon officials told Military.com that the Houthis last launched an attack in December. In other words, Trump approved a pre-emptive strike, not a protective one; as Hegseth put it, the U.S. got to \"start this on our own terms.\" The U.S. has been carrying out such attacks on a daily basis since March 15 and released few details about them, and it\u2019s unclear when they\u2019ll stop.\n\nThese attacks have serious consequences for the civilian population of Yemen. Yemeni officials say the strikes have hit residential areas. Indeed, in the chat discussion in the aftermath of the strikes, Waltz appears to admit that the U.S. targeted civilian infrastructure. \u201cThe first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend\u2019s building and it\u2019s now collapsed,\u201d Waltz wrote on Signal.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Vance replied.\n\nThe Yemen Data Project, an independent nonprofit that monitors attacks in the country, reports that it \u201crecorded 53 civilian casualties in 38 U.S.-led strikes from 15 to 21 March.\u201d And according to Military.com, citing two defense officials, the Trump administration is striking a broader range of targets than President Joe Biden did and harbors \u201cless reluctance to hold off striking targets based on the casualties that may result.\u201d All this is all happening in a war-torn, destitute country where most of the population is food insecure.\n\nThere's reason to be doubtful that these attacks will deter the Houthis. \u201cThe group withstood seven years of Saudi-led airstrikes and a year of U.S. strikes under the Biden administration, which yielded little effect,\u201d Luca Nevola, a senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group, told The New York Times. Given that resilience, there\u2019s not a lot of reason to believe that Trump\u2019s apparently open-ended campaign will in fact make a huge dent using air power alone.\n\nAmerica First, as we\u2019re coming to see in Trump\u2019s second term, is not fundamentally about reducing conflict in the world; nor does it reflect a serious commitment to restraint. Since news of the Signal chat broke, Democrats and liberal commentators have slammed Trump\u2019s national security team for discussing military plans on a chat that included a journalist. They\u2019ve laughed at the misspelling of \u201cprincipals\u201d in the group chat, and derided those officials\u2019 hokey use of prayer emojis in anticipation of the strikes. Granted, it was an idiotic and concerning lapse in security protocol. However an important part of the story isn\u2019t just the lapse itself, but what it teaches us about how Trump\u2019s inner circle sees the United States\u2019 role in the world, and how that vision is contiguous with that of previous stewards of American empire. That this seems to have largely gone unnoticed speaks to how numb Americans have become to dropping bombs in the Middle East."

            "full_content": "Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin has been having a rough go at things since President Donald Trump picked the former lawyer for Jan. 6 defendants \u2014 who on the day of the attack tweeted that he was at the Capitol and relayed the \u201clove, faith and joy\u201d at the scene \u2014 to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.\n\nI wrote last month about Martin\u2019s rage over media leaks apparently coming from staffers in his office. And this week, he received fierce backlash during an appearance in one of the Blackest communities in D.C.\n\nThe Washingtonian magazine published a dispatch from Martin\u2019s trip to Anacostia, a neighborhood that is nearly 90% Black, for a discussion with local leaders about crime. On its face, this appearance seemed ripe for controversy, given that Martin is a staunch supporter of the insurrectionists who waged a Ku Klux Klan-style attack on the Capitol, with gallows and all.\n\nAnd apparently, Martin\u2019s disconnect from attendees was glaringly obvious. According to the Washingtonian, he made an attempt to drive a wedge between Anacostia residents and Africans who have benefited from foreign aid. And it didn\u2019t go over well.\n\nPer the Washingtonian:\n\nClearly a back-slapping, friendly person by nature, he began his appearance with a somewhat conciliatory tone, telling the crowd \u201cyou\u2019re the experts on what\u2019s happening in the community,\u201d and name-dropping the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site as commemorating \u201cone of the great historic folks.\u201d But he struggled to keep it relatable. By a few minutes in, he brought up the embattled USAID in what he clearly thought was a slam dunk: \u201cWhen USAID sent hundreds of millions of dollars to central Africa, didn\u2019t you ask, \u2018why didn\u2019t you send it to 7D? (the Seventh District),\u201d he asked. There was an immediate and resounding \u201cno\u201d from the crowd. \u201cYou didn\u2019t?,\u201d Martin scoffed. \u201cWell you should. I did.\u201d\n\nThis was a pretty disgusting attempt by Martin to sow division by invoking U.S. Agency for International Development cuts, which are inhibiting everything from HIV treatment to maternal health care in Africa.\n\nMartin appeared to be taking tips from his boss here: President Donald Trump peddled this same kind of \u201cforeigners are taking your money\u201d schlock, particularly to Black audiences, during last year\u2019s campaign. And the Washingtonian noted that Martin was called out on this by Cora Masters Barry, the widow of former Washington Mayor Marion Barry:\n\nA few minutes later, Cora Masters Barry, Marion Barry\u2019s widow, took issue, giving Martin the most severe dressing down of the day. \u201cYou need to learn your politics,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to learn geography, and world affairs. There\u2019s a whole different pot of money that goes to Africa that stops diseases\u2026. You don\u2019t know what you talking about, so be careful about what you say when you go places, because you show that you\u2019re not well read.\u201d\n\nOuch. She basically called Martin an ignoramus to his face. And Barry didn\u2019t stop there:\n\nBarry also pointed out that Martin, in his focus on crime, ignored the fact that DC had already made progress. \u201cYou haven\u2019t once mentioned Metropolitan [Police Department],\u201d she said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t talked about the chief of police, who\u2019s doing a great job of bringing crime down. So you can\u2019t sit there and talk about what you gonna do as if something\u2019s not being done already. What you do is you walk in and you say: \u2018what\u2019s being done and how can I help?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe reportedly received applause when she advised Martin to \u201cbe careful how you talk to us.\u201d\n\nThis seems to have been a pretty disastrous showing by Martin, whose MAGA messaging clearly goes over well with hardcore Trump supporters \u2014 and far less so with residents of Anacostia. At least those residents appear to see him more as an occupying force in D.C., which Trump has said he wants to \u201ctake over,\u201d than a helpful partner to its communities."

            "full_content": "Summary Three Yale professors are leaving the prestigious university to teach at the University of Toronto because of the direction of the country under President Trump.\n\nPhilosophy professor Jason Stanley cited concerns about academic freedom and the Trump administration's battle with higher education institutions.\n\nHistory professors Marci Shore and Timothy Snyder joined Stanley in the move to Canada to advocate for democracy and speak out against fascism.\n\nThe Trump administration recently paused federal funding to Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nCritics warn that losing elite educators to other countries could have long-term consequences for American academic leadership.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nYale philosophy professor Jason Stanley, who is leaving the prestigious Ivy League university for Toronto as the Trump administration\u2019s battle with higher education in the US continues, said mid-phone interview with CNN while walking the campus, \u201cHold on one second.\u201d\n\nA group of worried students approached the scholar as he walked the grounds of Yale Thursday in New Haven, Connecticut. Was he really leaving?, they wanted to know.\n\n\u201cI love Yale,\u201d Stanley, who has taught at the university for 12 years, reassured the students. \u201cBut Marci, Tim and I, we\u2019re gonna go defend democracy somewhere else,\u201d he said, referring to the Yale colleagues joining him in Canada.\n\nStanley set off a firestorm at the highest levels of American academia last Friday, when he decided to leave Yale and the United States largely, he said, because of the direction of the country under the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cSuddenly if you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States, you can\u2019t comment on politics if you\u2019re a professor?\u201d said Stanley, who has written books such as \u201cHow Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them\u201d and \u201cErasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Stanley, whose academic background is in social and political philosophy and epistemology. \u201cThat\u2019s not a free society.\u201d\n\nThe final straw for Stanley came after Columbia University made sweeping policy changes in an attempt to prevent the Trump administration from pulling hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding from the Ivy League institution.\n\nAmid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration and pro-Palestinian demonstrations on college campuses, Columbia was the first to experience funding cuts as President Donald Trump threatened to halt federal money going to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that started in October 2023.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just humiliating,\u201d Stanley told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re humiliating the universities and I don\u2019t see the universities standing up to it.\u201d\n\nNow Stanley, along with Yale history professors Marci Shore and her husband Timothy Snyder, are taking their teaching to the University of Toronto to advocate for democracy, speak out against fascism and teach without fear of academic capitulation to the White House, they say.\n\n\u201cThe thing about being a historian is that it\u2019s not that you know what will happen, but you know what can happen,\u201d Shore, who teaches modern European intellectual history, explained in an interview with CNN.\n\nShore said she and Snyder, who teaches history and global affairs, decided to leave after the 2024 presidential election, and the administration\u2019s threats against higher education during President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office reinforced their decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I think everyone has put their head down and gotten in line,\u201d Shore said.\n\n\u201c(But) I think a lot of people have, and I fear that university administrations will, because institutions naturally have an incentive to act in the interest of self-preservation,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Yale has not directly seen ire from the Trump administration, recent events unfolding between the administration and other Ivy League schools provide cautionary tales.\n\nIn early March, the Trump administration announced it was pausing $400 million of federal funding to Columbia University, citing the school\u2019s failure to \u201cprotect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\u201d\n\nStudents wait in long security lines outside of Columbia University as demonstrators rallied in support of Palestine on March 24, 2025. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nColumbia responded by starting to make changes demanded by the administration, such as banning face coverings during protests, boosting disciplinary policies and reviewing curriculums in subject areas like the Middle East.\n\nDuring his second week in office, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at combating antisemitism in schools and on college campuses, and last month announced a multiagency task force would \u201croot out anti-Semitic harassment\u201d on campuses.\n\nYale and Columbia were among 60 universities that received warnings from the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights earlier this month regarding \u201cpossible consequences\u201d if they fail to take adequate steps to protect Jewish students.\n\nThe office said it sent letters to universities under investigation for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act \u201crelating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination.\u201d\n\nLast week, a White House official told CNN the administration paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania, claiming it has violated an executive order barring transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nWhile Penn said as of this week it hadn\u2019t received official word of the paused funding, the school maintains it has always been in compliance with federal guidelines.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of money on the line,\u201d explained Keith Whittington, a Yale professor and cofounder of the Academic Freedom Alliance, which defends the speech of professors and higher education faculty across the country.\n\n\u201cI mean really these are practically existential threats to universities,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he noted if more elite educators decide to leave for similar reasons as the Yale professors, the universities will be weakened as well.\n\n\u201cI think from an overall American leadership position and sort of scientific research, that\u2019s a real threat,\u201d Whittington argued.\n\n\u201cIf you lose your best people who decide to go to other countries, that\u2019s going to have long-term consequences.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN, a spokesperson for Yale University wrote, \u201cYale University has been and continues to be home to world-class faculty members who are dedicated to excellence in scholarship and teaching. These faculty members conduct groundbreaking research, train aspiring leaders who will serve all sectors of society, and offer insights that can help improve the world, and the university is committed to supporting them in these endeavors.\n\n\u201cYale is proud of its global faculty community which includes faculty who may no longer work at the institution, or whose contributions to academia may continue at a different home institution. Faculty members make decisions about their careers for a variety of reasons and the university respects all such decisions,\u201d the statement continued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fear, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d reiterated Stanley regarding his decision to leave for Canada.\n\nStanley said he\u2019d rather just spend his energy fighting for democracy and against the administration\u2019s policies, rather than fighting the universities he loves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in a much better position to fight bullies,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Karina Tsui, Elizabeth Wolfe, Emma Tucker and Michelle Watson contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump took his most consequential action against federal employee unions yet late Thursday, signing an executive order aimed at ending collective bargaining for government employees whose work include national security aspects.\n\nThe expansive order applies to workers across many federal agencies, including the departments of State, Defense, Justice and Health and Human Services. It also impacts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Communications Commission, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nA fact sheet released by the White House said, \u201cThe President needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national security.\u201d\n\nThe order is aimed at stopping federal unions who have \u201cdeclared war on President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d according to the fact sheet. It noted that the largest union \u2013 the American Federation of Government Employees \u2013 has filed many grievances to \u201cblock Trump policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests,\u201d the fact sheet said, noting that the president is using authority granted by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nA guidance issued Thursday by the Office of Personnel Management said that the agencies and divisions covered by the executive order no longer need to collectively bargain with federal unions. It noted that the agencies can conduct the widespread reduction in force, or RIF, that Trump had previously ordered without regard to provisions in terminated collective bargaining agreements. Likewise, any procedural restrictions on agencies\u2019 return-to-office mandates won\u2019t be in effect after the agreements are terminated.\n\nAFGE, which represents more than 800,000 employees, condemned the move in a statement Thursday evening, noting that it affects the collective bargaining rights of more than 1 million federal employees.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s latest executive order is a disgraceful and retaliatory attack on the rights of hundreds of thousands of patriotic American civil servants\u2014nearly one-third of whom are veterans\u2014simply because they are members of a union that stands up to his harmful policies,\u201d AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\n\u201cAFGE is preparing immediate legal action and will fight relentlessly to protect our rights, our members, and all working Americans from these unprecedented attacks,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union also vowed to take swift action.\n\n\u201cThe executive order to eliminate collective bargaining rights for federal employees across the government is a brazen attempt by the administration to ensure its reckless assault on vital federal agency services can continue unimpeded,\u201d NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement. \u201cWe will vigorously challenge this illegal order in court.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Trump has sought to reshape the federal workforce. In one of his earliest moves, he ended remote work for government employees and agencies were provided guidance on how they can override union collective bargaining agreements on telework and remote work.\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security announced moves to rescind the collective bargaining agreement covering tens of thousands of transportation security officers at airports.\n\nFederal unions have fought back, filing multiple lawsuits in federal court \u2013 several of which have succeeded in stymieing Trump\u2019s agenda, at least for a short time. Lawsuits filed by AFGE and other unions have temporarily reversed the administration\u2019s laying off tens of thousands of probationary workers at certain federal agencies and blocked Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Social Security data, among other consequential rulings.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s new acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba said political prosecutors and judges are part of a \u201cbroken system\u201d that must be reformed.\n\nDuring an interview with Habba on Thursday\u2019s edition of The Alex Marlow Show podcast, Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow highlighted Habba\u2019s whirlwind rise inside Trump world and her time in the West Wing during what Habba called \u201cprobably the most epic first 100 days ever.\u201d\n\nHabba described some of the highlights during her experience as Trump\u2019s attorney since joining his legal team in the autumn of 2021.\n\n\u201cBeating Michael Cohen was probably the sweetest victory,\u201d Habba told Marlow.\n\nShe said Cohen \u201cis somebody who had the opportunity to do great things and instead got tied up in a mess of his own with his taxi medallions, et cetera, and then tried to come after President Trump.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s work with the government led to \u201cthe very public raids, the indictments\u201d against Trump, Habba said, adding that she believes her stalwart representation of Trump in that case is \u201cwhy I think he asked me to take on this new role.\u201d\n\nShe explained that her mission in her new role as a U.S. Attorney will be focused on fighting crime.\n\n\u201cMy mission is going to be the same as President Trump\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get crime off the streets. We have to be hard on crime. We have to take care of the immigration problem that the Biden administration created, get illegal immigrants out. And also, for me, in my time at the White House, I was very focused on human trafficking.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cviolent crime is, of course, going to be a priority. We want our streets safe.\u201d\n\nMarlow noted that Habba is best known for her work defending Trump in the case brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James regarding allegations that Trump had undervalued his properties for loan and tax purposes.\n\nHowever, there was \u201cno victim\u201d in that alleged crime, Habba explained, \u201cand they used a commercial law, section 6312, which is not supposed to be used in the private sector.\u201d\n\nHabba said James had \u201cdecided to butt her nose into a private sector, into a private company, into Deutsche Bank, who lost no money \u2013 made money \u2013 and was paid early; and for years and years and years, she tried to build a case. She couldn\u2019t build a case with the normal rules and laws, so she used section 6312.\u201d\n\nThe case is being appealed, but Habba warned that these lawfare tactics employed by James could become the new normal.\n\n\u201cIf you can do this to President Trump, then you can do this to anybody,\u201d she cautioned, echoing Trump\u2019s campaign message.\n\nHabba also noted that the date of one of Trump\u2019s alleged crimes took place past the statute of limitations, but the state passed legislation to change the statute.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed into law the Adult Survivors Act to grant sexual abuse victims a one-year window to file law suits against their alleged attacker even if the statute of limitations had passed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Gov. Hochul who created the Adult Survivors Act side by side with [Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll\u2019s lawyer] Robbie Kaplan to target people for one year, and who was their first person? It was Donald Trump,\u201d Habba said.\n\nThat kind of political lawfare from non-political officials must end, she believes.\n\n\u201cStepping in as a [U.S. Attorney], I can say that it\u2019s not a political position. It is a law and order position,\u201d Habba told Marlow. \u201cAnd when you make it political, when you run on getting Trump, when you start creating laws that avoid statute of limitations to get a political opponent, that is the single most un-American thing, and a real destruction of the judicial system.\u201d\n\nHabba said she is \u201cas frustrated as most Americans\u201d that those who weaponized the legal system against Trump have not faced any consequences for it. She believes this needs to be rectified.\n\n\u201cWatching consistent congressional testimony or hearings and then not seeing anything happen, that\u2019s where the enforcement offices need to step in and do their own investigations and then instruct the men in blue to arrest people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I see all the tweets, all the frustration \u2014 \u2018Why aren\u2019t we arresting people? Why aren\u2019t we arresting people?\u2019 We have to do that because we can\u2019t keep having investigations and no outcome of accountability.\u201d\n\nIn addition to overzealous and overtly political prosecutors, Habba sees broader problems with the system as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a real problem on the bench,\u201d Habba said of political judges, adding that government officials who decide \u201cwhat evidence goes in and out of court, what records you can and cannot make, as I know it, can completely ruin or destroy or change what the jury can see, what they can\u2019t see. Those decisions are so critical.\u201d\n\nShe called for reforms to the rules and ethics governing the officials who make these decisions.\n\n\u201cStart focusing on the enforcers of the law, the people that are truly the decision makers and that can really ruin somebody\u2019s life financially, putting them in jail, things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take that and mix politics into that.\u201d\n\nMarlow brought up the example of District Judge James Boasberg, who blocked Trump\u2019s deportation flights of gang members and is now handling the Signal group chat lawsuit. Boasberg and his wife are prominent Democrat donors. \u201cJust seems too crazy to be true,\u201d Marlow said.\n\nThat\u2019s just one example of the biased judges she and Trump have faced, Habba said, arguing that Congress, which created the court system, has the power to change or even defund it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that we fund these federal courts, and if it comes to it, we will play ball with you, just like you\u2019re playing with us,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s separation of powers for a reason. It\u2019s checks and balances. It\u2019s all those things. But this isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\nThe Alex Marlow Show, hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nVice President JD Vance on Friday made the highest-profile case to date for American control of Greenland during a controversial visit to the semiautonomous island, which its residents had resisted and its leaders said was unwelcome.\n\n\u201cWe want to have good relationships with everybody,\u201d Vance said during a visit to an American military installation high above the Arctic Circle. \u201cBut part of having good relations is showing your strength when you have to.\u201d\n\nIt was the clearest message yet to Greenlanders who have been watching with anxiety as President Donald Trump vows to acquire their land \u201cone way or another.\u201d Vance, who only decided in the last few days to make the trip, said Denmark had neglected its territory and that America could no longer ignore Russian and Chinese alleged designs on the island.\n\n\u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple,\u201d Vance said. \u201cYou have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.\u201d\n\nHe repeatedly claimed the island was vulnerable and that the United States had \u201cno other option\u201d than to ramp up its presence there.\n\nGreenland would be better off \u201ccoming under the United States\u2019 security umbrella than you have been under Denmark\u2019s security umbrella,\u201d he said, saying it was the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d to see changes to the island\u2019s Danish leadership.\n\nStill, he acknowledged the future of the island should be up to its residents.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback JD Vance accuses Denmark of neglecting Greenland 01:38 - Source: CNN JD Vance accuses Denmark of neglecting Greenland 01:38\n\n\u201cYes, the people of Greenland are going to have self determination. We hope that they choose to partner with the US because we\u2019re the only nation on earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security, because their security is very much our security,\u201d he said.\n\nVance\u2019s visit was a very different trip than the cultural foray White House officials had originally planned for his wife, second lady Usha Vance.\n\nInstead of viewing a dog sled race as she had originally planned, the Vances visited the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, 1,000 miles from the capital of Nuuk. Miles away from any civilian population center, they were greeted by enthusiastic troops in the sub-freezing weather.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold as sh*t here!\u201d Vance exclaimed when he arrived.\n\nWhy the VP decided to join the trip\n\nWhat the White House initially characterized as a visit by the second lady to learn more about the culture of the island, quickly became contentious earlier this week \u2013 with the outgoing leader of the semiautonomous Danish territory M\u00fate Egede describing it as \u201chighly aggressive.\u201d\n\nAs JD Vance watched the outrage over his wife\u2019s trip grow, he decided to join her, a senior White House official told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of a little bit of commotion from Danish leaders combined with Vance wanting to go for a while,\u201d said the official.\n\n\u201cI decided I didn\u2019t want her to have all that fun by herself and so I\u2019m going to join her,\u201d Vance said in a video announcing his participation earlier this week.\n\nVance\u2019s 11th-hour decision elevated the US delegation visit, with the vice president becoming the highest-ranking US official to visit Greenland, and in so doing, traveling further north than any senior American leader has ever gone on an official visit, the White House official said.\n\nBut the shortened trip also carried a more overtly militaristic tenor and kept the American visitors sequestered away from any planned protests.\n\nVance\u2019s first trip abroad \u2013 to conferences in Paris and Germany \u2013 was notable for his tough rhetoric about Europe, a viewpoint reinforced by his texts revealed this week in a private Signal chat about military action in Yemen. His message on this second trip overseas struck a similar tone.\n\nThe visit to the American military base avoided any potentially embarrassing incidents between the Vances and either members of the public or government officials, many of whom openly spoke out against Usha Vance\u2019s original plans.\n\nProtests had been planned in the capital Nuuk, where about a third of Greenlanders live, and Greenland\u2019s second largest city Sisimiut, where the dog sled race is taking place.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s talk of annexation and the visit of the Vances has united Greenlanders in defiance, with Greenlanders rallying together to protest,\u201d Dwayne Ryan Menezes, director of the UK-based think tank Polar Research and Policy Initiative, told CNN in an email.\n\n\u201cThe Vances clearly realised that if they visited Nuuk or Sisimiut, the strategy would backfire even more than it has: it would be a PR disaster, as all footage would likely feature protestors with placards of the sort we saw earlier this month (Yankee Go Home, and Make America Go Away), and would expose to the US electorate the misinformation they were fed about how enthusiastically Greenlanders wished for Greenland to join the US,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House official pushed back on that assertion, telling CNN, \u201cThe itinerary changes had nothing to do with any potential protests.\u201d\n\nThe official argued that Usha Vance\u2019s original plans were scrapped because her itinerary was not compatible with her husband\u2019s schedule.\n\nHer visit to Nuuk, for example, was off the table because Greenland was still forming its government after recent elections and did not have the officials in place to receive him, the White House official said. Meanwhile, the dogsledding race was in a remote part of Greenland, and installing the vice president\u2019s full security footprint wasn\u2019t possible on just a few days\u2019 notice, they added.\n\nA visit \u2018far away from anyone Greenlandic\u2019\n\nJust hours before the Vances were due to arrive, a new coalition government with Greenland\u2019s four leading parties was announced Friday, shutting out a staunch pro-independence party that expressed interest in working with the United States.\n\nDemokraatit party leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen will be the next prime minister and has urged unity in the face of pressure from the United States.\n\n\u201cThe coalition agreement could not have come at a better time as it will signal to the Vances the unity forged in defiance of Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric and their ill-timed visit,\u201d Menezes said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe visit to the space base was less likely to put the Vances near Greenlanders who may be expressing those opinions.\n\nUlrik Pram Gad, senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, said that Vance going to Pituffik Space Base \u201cfrom a Greenlandic perspective, is a lot less aggressive, because that\u2019s a place where Greenlanders are used to American officials. It\u2019s far away from anyone Greenlandic, basically.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Vance says media won't force Trump to fire anyone over Signal chat 01:33 - Source: CNN Vance says media won't force Trump to fire anyone over Signal chat 01:33\n\nUsha Vance has largely remained above the political fray since her husband took office, assembling a small team of staff, transitioning her three children to life at the Naval Observatory, and settling into the public role, for which she will have her own platform and responsibilities.\n\nHer original visit to Greenland for the dogsled race appeared to originate with an invitation from American Daybreak, a group founded by Tom Dans, who worked on Arctic issues in the first Trump administration.\n\n\u201cAs a sponsor and supporter of this event I encouraged and invited the Second Lady and other senior Administration officials to attend this monumental race. This visit was always intended to be purely personal in nature and in the spirit of the friendship between our two nations,\u201d Dans wrote on X, describing himself as \u201cvery disappointed by the negative and hostile reaction\u201d to the visit.\n\nOrganizers for the race said they didn\u2019t invite Usha Vance specifically, but that anyone could attend.\n\nBut residents in Sisimiut planned to silently demonstrate her visit by turning their backs to her motorcade, according to Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n\u201cWe want to show the world that we don\u2019t want to be a part of America,\u201d said Minik Lange, a resident of Sisimiut, who helped organize the protest against Vance\u2019s now-cancelled visit.\n\n\u201cWe are also aware that there are a lot of propaganda from the president to the American population that we want to be American citizens. That is one huge lie from him,\u201d Lange told CNN. \u201cAnd we see it as a very disrespectful action for the Greenlandic population. All we want is to be respected as a Greenlandic population from all sides.\u201d\n\nJakob Nordstr\u00f8m, who runs a local pilot business in Nuuk, said he thinks Greenlanders were \u201crelieved\u201d that the original visit to Sisimiut and Nuuk was cancelled. \u201cMost Greenlanders welcome tourists from the United States, but obviously this was not a tourist visit,\u201d Nordstr\u00f8m said.\n\nAmerican officials have downplayed the role potential protests played in altering plans for the trip. One person close to JD Vance said he had wanted to go to the island since Donald Trump Jr. returned from a visit earlier this year and \u201craved about how cool it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cVice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance are proud to visit the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland this Friday,\u201d said Taylor Van Kirk, Vance\u2019s press secretary.\n\nThe US Consulate in Nuuk declined to comment, referring questions to the vice president\u2019s office.\n\nAlso part of the delegation were national security adviser Mike Waltz \u2013 who has been at the center of this week\u2019s scandal over top Trump Cabinet officials discussing strikes in Yemen in a Signal chain that included a reporter \u2013 and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Lee, a vocal supporter of Trump\u2019s desire to control Greenland.\n\nWhite House officials have argued for months that the president\u2019s fixation with acquiring Greenland has dual benefits, both economic and for national security.\n\nTrump has ratcheted up his rhetoric in recent months, insisting his administration will acquire the territory despite Greenland and Denmark\u2019s leaders repeatedly making clear the island isn\u2019t for sale.\n\n\u201cWe have to have it,\u201d he said on the \u201cVINCE\u201d podcast earlier this week. \u201cAnd I think we will have it.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Lauren Kent contributed to this story."

Plus, Trump withdraws Rep. Elise Stefanik\u2019s nomination to be U.N. ambassador amid concerns over the GOP\u2019s narrow House majority. And Jonathan Allen sifts through the White House\u2019s spin on the group chat episode.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nBlack men who backed Trump approve of his presidency \u2014 but raise some concerns about DOGE\n\nBy Bridget Bowman and Ben Kamisar\n\nA new focus group with Black men who voted for Donald Trump in swing states in November showed that nearly all of them remain staunchly with him, but that the Department of Government Efficiency and his tariffs are potential pain points.\n\nThe group of 12 voters \u2014 who participated in a recent focus group observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 Deciders series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago \u2014 included six independents, four Democrats and two Republicans. Ten of them stood by their 2024 vote, with the remaining two saying they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump again if given a do-over.\n\nDOGE: The results were far more mixed when it came to Elon Musk and DOGE. Five said they approved of DOGE\u2019s actions, three said they disapproved and the rest weren\u2019t sure yet.\n\nAmong those backing DOGE, the spending audits and cuts were seen as bringing a bit of the private sector to government work, aimed at increasing efficiency of employees paid by taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cEvery company needs someone to audit them. You shouldn\u2019t be an untouchable, you shouldn\u2019t be a sacred cow,\u201d said Dorris S., a 56-year-old independent from Pennsylvania. \u201cThey\u2019re there to maximize productivity and efficiency. I used to manage restaurants, we had health inspectors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas A., a 49-year-old Democrat from Georgia who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and switched to Trump in 2024, said that while DOGE is doing \u201csome good,\u201d he\u2019s concerned about the power Trump has delegated to Musk. He also wondered if DOGE\u2019s work could be antithetical to a push to improve the economy and help everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too focused on cutting the weeds and the clutter, but he needs to focus on the economy and how to help people,\u201d he said of Trump.\n\nTariffs: Only three out of 12 participants affirmatively said Trump is making battling inflation a top priority, with those who said so largely connecting it to his threats to enact sweeping tariffs or cut government spending. The two voters who disapproved of Trump after voting for him both raised concerns about tariffs.\n\nDemocrats: Still, this group of voters was down on the Democrats, using words such as \u201cliars,\u201d \u201cuntrustworthy,\u201d \u201cungodly,\u201d \u201ca weird agenda\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d to describe the party today.\n\nRead more from the focus group \u2192\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump pulled the nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, citing concerns about the House\u2019s slim margin to enact his legislative agenda. Stefanik will remain in Congress, where Speaker Mike Johnson said she would have an unspecified leadership role.\n\nA federal judge ordered Trump administration agencies involved in a group chat on an attack on Yemen to \u201cpreserve all Signal communications between March 11 and March 15.\u201d\n\nSens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., the chair and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, formally requested the Defense Department\u2019s acting inspector general to launch an investigation into the leaked Signal chat about U.S. military strikes in Yemen.\n\nTrump threatened to place \u201cfar larger\u201d tariffs on the European Union and Canada than planned if they work together to retaliate in response to his tariffs.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it plans to cut 10,000 full-time jobs across several agencies.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a high-security prison in El Salvador where deported Venezuelans are being held.\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nSifting through the White House spin on the leaked Signal chat\n\nAnalysis by Jonathan Allen\n\nIn the days since Trump administration officials saw a group chat go public, the White House and its allies have worked hard to spin the sins.\n\nTrump has attacked the journalist who was apparently inadvertently included in the Signal thread, The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg. And the president\u2019s amplifiers have suggested the fault lies with the National Security Council for letting Goldberg in.\n\nThis telling puts National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the hot seat \u2014 absolving the rest of the senior officials in the chat \u2014 and diverts attention from the most alarming aspects of the episode.\n\nThe White House would like to gloss over that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared military operation plans against the Houthis outside of secure government communications systems.\n\nSimilarly, Trump\u2019s team would prefer if no attention was paid to the fact that several Cabinet secretaries, the White House chief of staff and a White House deputy chief of staff appeared to have chosen not to object to using a commercial app that allows users to delete messages.\n\nAdministration officials note that the strikes against the Houthis were successful, as though arriving home safely is a justification for reckless driving.\n\nWhite House officials and Attorney General Pam Bondi have insisted that none of the information was classified. That\u2019s also a distraction. Even if the information was classified, there\u2019s no world in which the White House would admit all of those people would be careless with this information. It\u2019s also irrelevant as a practical matter because Bondi would never prosecute department and agency leaders.\n\nNone of these excuses serve Trump well. They don\u2019t make him look stronger or more committed to national security.\n\nAs NBC News reported Wednesday, it\u2019s not just Democrats calling on Trump to fire someone. There are MAGA Republicans who think Trump should find someone to take the fall. If he doesn\u2019t, that risks leaving a stain on him. And there\u2019s no spinning out of that.\n\nRelated reads:\n\nTimeline: The Trump administration\u2019s shifting stance on the Signal chat debacle, by Alexandra Bacallao and Alexandra Marquez\n\nA DHS staffer faces serious punishment for accidentally adding a reporter to a group email, by Julia Ainsley\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f National implications: The Wisconsin Supreme Court race is emerging as the first big test of Democrats\u2019 anti-Elon Musk playbook as the party searches for a winning message after its loss to Trump in November.

            "full_content": "Stefanik, probably wondering if it was something she said. Photo: Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nYou have to figure Elise Stefanik has been getting pretty antsy lately. She announced way back on November 10 \u2014 so long ago that DOGE was just an evil glimmer in Elon Musk\u2019s eyes \u2014 that Donald Trump had offered her the Cabinet-level position of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. It must have seemed like a pretty sweet gig: no management responsibilities at all, but a lot of public attention (just like her predecessor Nikki Haley), and the chance to please The Boss by attacking his growing list of global enemies.\n\nThere was one catch, though: Stefanik\u2019s confirmation by the Senate (expected to be a breeze) was postponed until after April 1, when two House vacancies in Florida created by earlier Trump appointments (Matt Gaetz as attorney general, briefly, and Michael Waltz as White House national security adviser) would be filled by a special election. Before then, the fragile GOP majority in the House meant Stefanik had to stay in that chamber to supply her vote on big measures like the House budget resolution and the continuing resolution that kept the federal government running. Once those were out of the way, and two new Floridians sworn in, Stefanik would finally be able to head to the U.N. building and take the next step up the ladder that some figured would eventually make her a presidential possibility herself.\n\nBut just a few days before the Florida special elections, lightning struck, via a Trump post on Truth Social:\n\nSo instead of strutting her stuff on the international stage and burnishing her \u201crising star\u201d image, Stefanik will be stuck in the House as just another slave to Trump\u2019s every whim.\n\nWhat happened? Well, if Trump is telling the truth (never a given), there remains the fear that even with fresh troops from Florida, the margin in the House is too narrow for comfort with the \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d implementing the president\u2019s legislative agenda still on tap and not sure to reach the House floor until late spring or even summer. With Stefanik\u2019s seat vacated and with a Democratic governor of New York able to delay filling it for some time, all it would take is two or three defections (depending on absences) to screw everything up and derail tax cuts, budget cuts, a debt-limit increase, and all the other weighty items planned for the budget reconciliation bill.\n\nWhat you have to wonder is why this situation wasn\u2019t evident before Stefanik was nominated, as GOP senator Lisa Murkowski remarked shortly after the announcement:\n\nMurkowski reacting to Stefanik being pulled because of tight margins in the House.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey just realized that now?\u201d \u2014 haley talbot (@haleytalbotcnn) March 27, 2025\n\nThe perilous situation of House Republicans was actually worse at the beginning of this Congress, before two House Democrats died. Are there new jitters about Mike Johnson\u2019s ability to manage his troops? Is it possible Republicans are afraid they\u2019ll lose one of those Florida special elections, or perhaps the New York special election Stefanik\u2019s departure would have triggered? Is the myth of Trump 2.0 as a fast-moving and irresistible force crushing all opposition perhaps slightly hollow? Or is this all a ruse and the extremely ambitious House Republican Conference chair said or did something to displease the man upstairs (meaning Trump, not God)?\n\nThat\u2019s unclear, but for the moment it sucks to be Elise Stefanik. Not that long ago she was on the shortlist to become Trump\u2019s running mate and presumptive political heir. Now she\u2019s a prisoner of the House, a body that is determined to surrender all its power to Russell Vought and Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s thunderbolt taking away her nice new job included an explicit suggestion that she will \u201cjoin my administration in the future,\u201d and that\u2019s no small thing, particularly given the high likelihood that the GOP will lose control of the House in 2026 making House Republicans even less significant than they are today. But who knows what the future will bring and which jobs will be open when Stefanik\u2019s mere floor vote stops being essential? Nah, it would have been better if the New York representative had arranged to be first in line to quit her House seat after the election."

            "full_content": "Photo: Kena Betancu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIf the capitulation of Columbia University to President Donald Trump was, in retrospect, inevitable, it was still among the darker moments in the modern history of academia. A prestigious, powerful institution that was, theoretically, dedicated to the concept of academic freedom had decided, in a matter of days, it was better to do what Trump says than fight back. In exchange for keeping $400 million in federal funds, Columbia agreed to hire three dozen campus police officers who will have the power to arrest students. They will appoint a senior vice-provost with authority over the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies and the Center for Palestine Studies, and require students wearing face coverings during protests to present university identification when asked.\n\nAll of these actions \u2014 especially the hiring of a new provost \u2014 will chill speech at Columbia and inevitably impact other institutions, since the Trump administration is currently abusing civil rights law to investigate 60 colleges for alleged antisemitism. Any kind of nonviolent protest or opinion expressed that is contrary to the U.S. government\u2019s position on Israel\u2019s war in Gaza could lead to federal harassment. And green-card holders, as we now know, are no longer safe. The Trump administration, with limited resistance from Columbia, is attempting to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a protest leader and former student. These are McCarthyite tactics.\n\nWhy did Columbia fold? An Ivy League colossus famed worldwide, Columbia boasts an endowment of almost $15 billion and countless well-heeled alumni. Much of the endowment cash has strings attached, but strings, for a university, can always be played with \u2014 if $400 million is an enormous sum, it\u2019s still the sort that can be partially made up elsewhere through pieces of the endowment or future fundraisers. Certainly, the many successful and liberal graduates of Columbia would be happy to cut checks to a university that stands up to Trump.\n\nThe grimmer reality is that Columbia administrators and trustees probably wanted this. Some are simply Israel hawks who loathed the protests against the war in Gaza. None were actually violent or even reached the peaks of the 1968 anti-war occupations, but they offered optics that the elites of Columbia did not particularly like. Jewish students did complain, and if protests critical of a foreign nation-state are not, by definition, antisemitic \u2014 I am an American Jew, and Israel does not speak for me \u2014 there are always stray radicals in any large movement who spout ugly words. They deserve censure.\n\nWhat Trump has done goes far beyond that and will likely suppress debate and research around one of the more vital topics on earth. Can a Columbia professor, as an academic exercise, even teach the concept of anti-Zionism or the displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 Palestine War? Can a student feel safe to pen an anti-Netanyahu op-ed for the campus newspaper? Or peacefully hold a sign at a campus rally? Columbia\u2019s administrators have made it clear they will not support their students and faculty if the hammer of the federal government comes crashing down upon them. In fact, they\u2019ll gladly pick it up and start swinging it themselves.\n\nWhat American colleges and universities need now are wartime leaders. We do not actually live in a fascist state. Trump is not sending federal troops to colleges to lock up noncompliant administrators, and he\u2019s not jailing any faculty. He is trying to abuse immigration law to torment the most vulnerable among us \u2014 non-citizens who reside here legally. But colleges are led by American citizens. They have a duty to use their privilege to stand up to Trump. A good example of what this spirit might look like is across the northern border, where Doug Ford, the Ontario premier, has become a national hero for resisting Trump. Canada is in a vulnerable position, but Ford doesn\u2019t care. He was elected to fight for his province and he\u2019s doing just that \u2014 and other Canadian leaders have gotten the message.\n\nIt might sound trite, but it\u2019s usually true: Bullies aren\u2019t used to getting hit and will back down when challenged. Columbia\u2019s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, obviously has no appetite for a public-relations war against Trump. But other college presidents must understand that Trump is going to keep crushing them if they don\u2019t recover whatever spine they have left and begin battling for academic freedom. Many of them are obsequious bureaucrats who aren\u2019t used to such pursuits, but that is the reality now in front of them. If they don\u2019t resist \u2014 daring Trump to revoke the federal funds, and heading to the public and their alumni networks to try to raise the cash to fill the budget holes \u2014 they will, like Columbia, have done deep and possibly irreparable damage to their brands. Columbia is wagering that people will soon forget about all of this; it\u2019s an Ivy League and students will always covet an elite institution in an elite city. That\u2019s probably true. But it\u2019s also true that the richest and highest achieving do have options. Alumni can close their checkbooks or dissuade their children from going to a school that gave in so quickly to an incendiary, unpopular president.\n\nThese next months will be telling. Either American colleges and universities believe in their mission or they don\u2019t. Either they fight for academic freedom, a concept that is as central to the functioning of an educational institution as water is to the human body, or they don\u2019t \u2014 and the slow rot in our higher-education system accelerates. Trump can only subdue colleges if they let him do it. He is not an emperor; he is not even Xi or Putin. He is a culture warrior who sniffs weakness. So far, he\u2019s been right. Academic administrators have been capitulators and collaborators. Maybe, though, not all of them are. There might be a few principled leaders left. Let\u2019s see if they emerge."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA veteran AP photographer and top White House correspondent testified Thursday that the news organization has struggled to compete in its coverage of the Trump presidency since White House\u2019s decision to limit its access to presidential events, the Oval Office and Air Force One.\n\nEvan Vucci, the chief photographer for the AP in Washington, testified during a hearing in his company\u2019s legal challenge to the White House ban that since the organization has had its access severely curtailed, it\u2019s \u201creally struggling to keep up\u201d with its competitors, particularly during major news events that have happened during the opening weeks of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hurting us big time,\u201d Vucci said at one point in response to questions from the news organization\u2019s attorney, Charles Tobin. \u201cWe\u2019re basically dead in the water on major news stories.\u201d\n\nAP\u2019s chief White House correspondent, Zeke Miller, testified Thursday on the impact the limitations have had on the outlet\u2019s work, telling the court the outlet was forced to report in a \u201cdelayed fashion\u201d and that its coverage did not have \u201cthe same level of completeness.\u201d\n\nThe AP, one of the world\u2019s biggest news outlets and wire service that\u2019s used by local publications around the world, was singled out by the White House over its refusal to substitute \u201cGulf of America\u201d for \u201cGulf of Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe issue was underscored, Vucci said, during the contentious Oval Office meeting last month between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The administration\u2019s decision to ban Washington-based AP photographers and reporters from the Oval Office meant the organization had to rely on one of its foreign-based photographers to capture visuals of the event.\n\nBut that person, Vucci said, lacked the experience and skill he has that allow him to transmit photos back to his editors for wider distribution within seconds. The foreign-based photographer was able to attend the event as part of the group of reporters covering Zelensky, not Trump specifically.\n\n\u201cWe just absolutely got slammed in the play,\u201d Vucci said. \u201cWe got destroyed.\u201d\n\nVucci said during his testimony that the AP\u2019s photographs reach some 4 billion people globally and stressed that the organization\u2019s absence from certain White House events in recent weeks is meaningful to the public.\n\n\u201cAssociated Press photographers are the gold standard,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course it matters to the public. \u2026 It\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Associated Press says it was blocked over style guide 03:15 - Source: CNN Associated Press says it was blocked over style guide 03:15\n\nPressed by Tobin on what he knows about how the White House is now choosing which photographers can now attend certain White House events, Vucci said he was \u201cclueless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rhyme or reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows.\u201d\n\nUnder cross-examination by Justice Department attorney Brian Hudak, Vucci struggled to answer specific questions about how the AP was harmed financially by the White House, saying he wasn\u2019t the best person to speak to those details.\n\nAnd later, when US District Judge Trevor McFadden asked if, as an artful photographer, Vucci has changed how he snaps pictures of the president since the ban has been in effect, he pushed back strongly on the idea.\n\n\u201cMy approach doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a professional.\u201d\n\nVucci took the famous photograph of Trump raising his fist moments after surviving an assassination attempt during a campaign rally last summer. Asked about the image on Thursday by Tobin and Trump\u2019s own embrace of it, Vucci described it as \u201can iconic photograph.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing is the AP\u2019s latest shot at convincing McFadden to order the administration to restore the outlet\u2019s full access to White House events. The Trump appointee had declined in late February to issue a temporary restraining order that would have done just that. Now, Tobin is pressing the judge to issue a preliminary injunction in his client\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cAP has now spent 44 days in the penalty box,\u201d he told the judge just after the proceedings got underway.\n\nSofter questions for Trump?\n\nMiller testified that he has observed \u201csoftening\u201d of the questions asked by other outlets during presidential events since the restrictions were imposed.\n\nMiller he said had noticed, in reading transcripts and other coverage of the outlets that are participating in such pool events, that there had generally been a \u201csoftening of tone and tenor\u201d in the questions being asked of the president by other journalists in the pool.\n\nAnd since AP reporters must rely on reporting from other journalists for pool events the outlet is locked out of, Miller said it was possible that such a \u201csoftening\u201d was impacting his company\u2019s ability to adequately cover the news.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re missing out on,\u201d he said.\n\nMcFadden, who was appointed by Trump, returned to the \u201csoftening\u201d claim at the end of Miller\u2019s testimony, asking if there were specific outlets or examples he could point to.\n\nMiler did not identify any particular outlet, but said he had noticed that outlets in the pool were asking fewer questions about the \u201cnews of the day\u201d \u2013 meaning the big stories about the administration at a given time \u2013 and that some questions tended to be not on topic or irrelevant. He also recalled noticing in coverage of SpaceX\u2019s recent return of some astronauts that journalists were referring to the Gulf of Mexico as just \u201cthe gulf.\u201d Miller said it seemed they were trying to \u201cskirt around the issue.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nEver since news broke on Monday that top Trump officials discussed US military attack plans in a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has projected unflinching confidence.\n\n\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Hegseth told reporters Tuesday.\n\nBy Wednesday, however, other defense officials were increasingly skeptical of that, especially after The Atlantic magazine revealed the details that Hegseth shared in the Signal chat about the pending strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen, including the timing and types of aircraft.\n\n\u201cIt is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court-martialed for this,\u201d a defense official told CNN. \u201cMy most junior analysts know not to do this.\u201d\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz has been criticized for inviting Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg into the chat. And CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom were on the Signal chat, were grilled over two days of Congressional testimony.\n\nBut former national security and intelligence officials say it\u2019s Hegseth who looks particularly bad given the level of detail he shared.\n\n\u201cThe egregious actor here is Hegseth,\u201d said one former senior intelligence official. \u201cHe\u2019s in the bullseye now because he puts all this out on a Signal chat.\u201d\n\nInterviews with multiple current and former national security officials this week, including career military and civilian officials, reflect growing concerns about Hegseth\u2019s leadership at the Pentagon.\n\nThe group chat scandal is the latest in a series of what some officials say are examples of questionable judgment by the former Fox News host, as he has struggled to implement consistent and durable policies across the Defense Department in his first two months as secretary.\n\nSo far, several high-profile initiatives spearheaded by Hegseth inside DoD since he was confirmed in January\u2014 including several related to the southern border mission and a purge of \u201cDEI\u201d content\u2014have either been scaled back or rescinded as he has rushed to implement changes demanded by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nThe current and former officials said the rocky start underscores both Hegseth\u2019s inexperience and his freewheeling approach to leadership. Many of his orders are verbal and based on gut instinct rather than a deliberative, multi-layered process, people familiar with his methods said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a TV personality,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201c[A general officer] makes a recommendation, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 [Former Defense Secretary] Lloyd Austin would never be like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 He\u2019d be like, \u2018We\u2019ll take it under consideration.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral DoD officials told CNN that Hegseth seems more preoccupied with appearances than with substance\u2014wanting to appear more \u201clethal\u201d than his predecessor and pulling resources from elsewhere in DoD to achieve that image.\n\n\u201cYour job is to make sure that it\u2019s lethality, lethality, lethality,\u201d Hegseth told reporters late last year. \u201cEverything else is gone, everything else that distracts from that shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, troops armed with M4 assault rifles were seen guarding Hegseth\u2019s plane at Joint Base Andrews. The security posture stood in stark contrast to the agents and service members who typically greeted Austin at the Maryland base, who were usually armed only with concealed handguns.\n\nWhile unusual, a spokesperson for Air Combat Command said the posture \u201caligns with standing orders for personnel, especially when operating in official capacities such as deployments or movements during missions.\u201d\n\nIn this still from video, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks to the press on March 26. Pool\n\nAt the southern border, thousands of troops surged there by Hegseth in recent months have primarily been building barricades, putting up concertina wire, and generally \u201cjust standing around,\u201d another defense official told CNN.\n\nHegseth also earlier this month ordered the deployment of two heavily armed warships to patrol the waters near the border, where they will primarily be supporting Coast Guard operations to interdict drugs. One of the warships\u2019 most recent deployments was to the Red Sea, where it was tasked with intercepting Houthi missiles and drones.\n\nThe deployments to the border are \u201cclearly more about optics,\u201d the defense official said. The official added that diverting troops and assets to patrol a mostly peaceful border was actually drawing them away from training exercises that could improve overall combat readiness.\n\nAs for the Signal chat, Hegseth has insisted that nothing classified was shared over text, but four people familiar with the matter told CNN that the information Hegseth disclosed on the Houthi group chat was classified, despite the administration\u2019s claims to the contrary. One of the people said they saw documents sent within DoD about the operation, which were marked classified and included the same information Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat about specific weapons platforms and timing.\n\n\u201cIt was classified when it was shared below the principal level,\u201d this person said.\n\nHegseth could have declassified the information himself, but he has not said that he did. It\u2019s also unclear why information about an imminent or ongoing operation would be declassified before it was successfully completed.\n\nThe White House, for now, is standing by Hegseth in the wake of the Signal chat scandal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office of the White House on March 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump said his national security adviser Mike Waltz had taken responsibility for creating the Signal group, but the president seemed unaware of the role Hegseth played in including detailed information about airstrikes in the chat.\n\n\u201cIt was Mike, I guess, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said when questioned about which of his team was behind the chat. Earlier, the White House said a team of officials from the National Security Council and White House counsel\u2019s office were looking into the matter, assisted by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nYet while Trump said Waltz had assumed responsibility for the error, he shrugged off any culpability on the part of his defense secretary, who sent a timeline of the planned attack before it was underway.\n\n\u201cHow do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,\u201d Trump said, sounding surprised a reporter would raise the issue. Earlier, the White House said Trump had looked at Hegseth\u2019s messages that were included in the text chain published by The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a witch-hunt,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe White House on Thursday morning declined to offer an update on its internal investigation into the Signal group chat of top Trump national security officials, calling the episode a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\n\u2018This does absolutely nothing to make us stronger\u2019\n\nHegseth, who served as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, was confirmed by a razor-thin margin in January as Democrats and some Republicans pressed him on allegations of sexual misconduct, infidelity and excessive drinking in his past.\n\nIn his first appearance on the world stage as Defense Secretary, Hegseth told NATO in February that Ukrainian membership in the alliance was off the table \u2014 a statement that Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly called \u201ca rookie mistake\u201d that took away some of the US\u2019 negotiating leverage in pending ceasefire talks.\n\nHegseth later said he would not be involved in the negotiations over ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWicker is now formally asking the administration for an inspector general report on the Signal chat, plus a classified briefing from a senior official.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Wednesday called on Hegseth and other top Trump officials to own their mistakes related to Signal group chat revelations so that they are not repeated. \u201cThe important thing here is these guys, they made a mistake, they know it. They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,\u201d Thune said.\n\nAsked by CNN if he has confidence in Hegseth, Thune again did not directly answer and pointed to the success of the underlying mission. \u201cThe execution of the strike looks like pretty flawless,\u201d he said before again urging the officials to come clean.\n\nBut the strikes have not appeared to deter the Houthis. On Thursday, the Israeli military has said that sirens sounded in several parts of the country Thursday after two missiles were fired from Yemen. The Houthis took responsibility for the attack.\n\nA purge of \u201cdiversity\u201d content on Defense Department websites, mandated by Hegseth in a February memo, is being reviewed following outcry over DoD\u2019s hasty removal of historically significant articles and images. A top DoD spokesperson was reassigned over the debacle, and Hegseth\u2019s spokesperson, Sean Parnell, acknowledged last week that mistakes were made. He said DoD is now republishing some of the tens of thousands of pieces of content that were removed.\n\n\u201cOf all the things they could be doing, the places they\u2019re putting their focuses on first are really things that just don\u2019t matter \u2026 This was literally a waste of our time,\u201d a defense official told CNN of the content purge. \u201cThis does absolutely nothing to make us stronger, more lethal, better prepared.\u201d\n\nDirectives hit legal setbacks\n\nMeanwhile, military deportation flights have slowed to a trickle, because the Department of Homeland Security has not actually needed the large and expensive C-17s to help transport migrants, multiple officials said. Only one military flight per week is taking off on average, holding a handful of migrants.\n\nAnd the US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\u2014which Hegseth in January touted as a \u201cperfect place\u201d to hold as many as 30,000 migrants\u2014is nearly empty. A significant portion of the 900 troops surged there last month to handle an influx of deportees could soon be sent home, officials said.\n\nSeveral of Hegseth\u2019s directives\u2014issued at Trump\u2019s behest\u2014have also hit legal setbacks. A federal judge last week indefinitely blocked DoD\u2019s ban on transgender service members, dealing a major defeat to a controversial policy the president resurrected from his first term.\n\nAnother federal judge ordered earlier this month that DoD and other federal agencies reinstate probationary employees who were fired at the direction of the Office of Personnel Management. Defense officials warned superiors at the time that such mass firings could be illegal, CNN reported last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (L), Vice President JD Vance (C) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth participate in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in the Oval Office of the White House on February 07, 2025 Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nOne of the few directives Hegseth has put in writing, a recent strategic guidance memo overhauling the Pentagon\u2019s priorities, appeared to some defense officials like it was more about messaging than substance, amounting to a written pledge by Hegseth to fulfill several of Trump\u2019s favorite military-related promises.\n\nThe memo, reviewed by CNN, did not have a separate section detailing the threat posted by Russia, for example, but it did include vague directives to ramp up border operations and even develop credible military options related to the Panama Canal.\n\nHegseth ultimately rose to the rank of Major before leaving the National Guard in 2021, and has the least experience of any Senate-confirmed defense secretary in recent history.\n\nHis immediate predecessor Austin, a four-star general, served for 41 years and commanded US Central Command; former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper served as the Secretary of the Army before being confirmed as SecDef; and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, also a 40-year veteran and four-star general, commanded US Central Command as well before being confirmed as Trump\u2019s first secretary of defense.\n\nThe Signal chat fiasco has further highlighted Hegseth\u2019s greenness when it comes to the established protocols for dealing with a highly classified military operation involving airstrikes on a foreign country, a defense official said.\n\n\u201cThis is all indicative of his utter inexperience,\u201d the official said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Haley Britzky contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nFederal law enforcement officers captured an alleged \u201cmajor leader\u201d of the MS-13 gang Thursday morning, President Donald Trump said on social media.\n\n\u201cJust captured a major leader of MS13,\u201d he wrote. The alleged 24-year-old gang member, was arrested in the early hours of Thursday in Prince William County, Virginia.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, who was present for the raid along with FBI Director Kash Patel, said in a news conference that the man was \u201cthe leader for the East Coast, one of the top three in the entire country, right here in Virginia, living half an hour outside of Washington, DC.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is an illegal alien from El Salvador, and he will not be living in our country much longer,\u201d Bondi said.\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed Thursday afternoon in the Eastern District of Virginia, Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, a citizen of El Salvador was taken into custody Thursday on an outstanding administrative immigration warrant. He was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm. Federal agents found several firearms in the residence.\n\nNo attorney was listed for the defendant on the court documents.\n\nThe arrest was executed by a new interagency task force established by the Trump administration to target transnational organized crime and coordinate ongoing immigration enforcement efforts across Virginia. Its creation was part of a crackdown by the Trump administration on foreign gang members residing in the United States.\n\nWhile officials did not explicitly say whether the man will be deported, the administration is working to pay El Salvador to imprison immigrants that it said have committed crimes and have been expelled from the US. MS-13 deportations, particularly of leaders, who are a priority for Salvadoran officials, and Trump officials agreed, CNN has previously reported.\n\nOne such effort included the deporting C\u00e9sar Humberto L\u00f3pez-Larios, CNN reported, an alleged top leader of the MS-13 who US investigators believe has information that could implicate top Salvadoran government officials in possibly corrupt deals with the violent gang. The Justice Department quietly dropped charges against L\u00f3pez-Larios and returned him to El Salvador earlier this month."

The findings show that the United States' 25% tariffs on Canada and Canada's retaliations could inflict meaningful damage in key states for U.S. politics.\n\nThe analysis was conducted before the Republican president announced Wednesday that he was placing additional 25% tariffs on imported autos and parts starting on April 3.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of today\u2019s escalation in this destructive tariff war will not be contained to Canada, as much as the U.S. administration would like to pretend,\" said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThrowing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America\u2019s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.\u201d\n\nNearly half of what San Antonio exports, with its aerospace, auto and energy sectors, goes to Canada. About 40% of what the auto-driven Detroit area exports also goes to Canada. Trump's wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were crucial for his overall victory in November's presidential election \u2014 and Milwaukee and Pittsburgh also rank in the top 10 for exposure to a trade war with Canada.\n\nOther cities most dependent on exports to Canada include Kansas City, Missouri; Louisville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; Columbus, Ohio; Chicago; and Cleveland. All of those states aside from Illinois backed Trump in the last election.\n\nTrump has placed 25% tariffs on many goods from Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on energy products from Canada. Some of those tariffs have been suspended or delayed, though they're set to fully hit in April.\n\nCanadian leaders have warned that the United States would suffer in the form of higher prices, fewer jobs and slower growth because of the trade war. But an analysis by the Brookings Institution found that the economic pain would be more severe in Mexico and Canada because those countries are more reliant on the United States in terms of trade.\n\nTrump's stated reason for the tariffs is to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he's also said that he dislikes the trade deficit with both countries and has taunted Canada by suggesting that it could become the 51st U.S. state."

            "full_content": "We\u2019re quite a long way from 1956. Photo: Richard Meek/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images\n\nThe one constant through the years, James Earl Jones famously said as he stood in the middle of a cornfield, has been baseball. And as long as baseball has been a constant, so too has the umpire. The looming figure in blue with a booming voice and the personality of a junkyard dog has always been a unique character in the timeless nine-inning drama that is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 America\u2019s pastime. But the 2025 baseball season, which gets underway in earnest on Thursday, could serve as a curtain call for those all-too-fallible arbiters of the game.\n\nBaseball has been undergoing some pretty dramatic changes. The sport may still be timeless in a sense, but it is now timed. Spring training this year has featured another seismic twist: the chance for the pitcher, catcher, or batter to overturn the umpire\u2019s ball or strike call with a camera array called the Automatic Ball-Strike system, or ABS.\n\nSince 2008, instant replay has assisted umpires in ruling on home runs and other key plays. And since 2014, teams have been allotted two replay challenges for calls they don\u2019t like. But in any other era, the very idea of reversing an umpire\u2019s pitch call would be unthinkable. No longer. Witness Jazz Chisholm\u2019s challenge of a punch-out and his insouciant jog to first base last week before the call was officially overturned:\n\nJazz didn't even wait to see if he was correct \ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/rF2aTizST1 \u2014 Talkin' Yanks (@TalkinYanks) March 18, 2025\n\nFor now, robo-umps are in the trial phase; ABS won\u2019t debut in the regular season until 2026 at the earliest. But if this really will be the final season umpires do their primary job unassisted, what do we stand to lose as we replace one more facet of humanity? Or put another way: If players, managers, and the crowd have nothing to yell at the umpire or no reason to boo them any longer, is it still really baseball?\n\nUmpires have often relished their near-dictatorial authority and the built-in antagonism they provoke from players and coaches. There\u2019s an old quote from Bill \u201cCatfish\u201d Klem, one of the most famous umpires of all time, who said a pitch \u201cain\u2019t nothing until I call it.\u201d He might have been arrogant, but he was also correct: According to the rules, a pitch is only a strike when the umpire says it is. Yes, there are strike-zone parameters in the official rules (from \u201cthe hollow beneath the kneecaps\u201d to \u201cthe midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants,\u201d as if that clears things up), but umpires have never really followed them. The zone has always been fluid and at the umpire\u2019s capricious discretion; every baseball autobiography and retired player\u2019s podcast is full of stories of umpires, after getting into it with a certain player, retaliating with an awful call. Klem, by the way, had a habit of ejecting players just for calling him \u201cCatfish,\u201d a nickname he hated.\n\nRetired umpire Doug Harvey reveals in his wild autobiography (modestly titled They Called Me God: The Best Umpire Who Ever Lived) the often-suspected assertion that umpires \u2014 not him, though \u2014 will unfairly speed up a meaningless game so they can go home. Later in the book, Harvey describes one of the most important lessons he learned from another legendary (and hotheaded) umpire, Al Barlick: \u201cIf you make a call, hang with it.\u201d This ethos has guided umpire comportment for generations, cemented the ump\u2019s role as a lightning rod for players and fans, and enabled another cherished spectacle of baseball: the managerial ejection, from Bobby Cox\u2019s and Lou Piniella\u2019s clockworklike temper tantrums to the GOAT of baseball dismissals, courtesy of Phillip Wellman.\n\nWhile arguing and booing them is cathartic (listen to the crowd roar as Steve McMichael threatened notoriously inaccurate umpire \u00c1ngel Hern\u00e1ndez), it\u2019s ultimately at least partly a charade. The ump\u2019s \u201cOkay, you got everything out\u201d quip at the end says it all in this famous donnybrook:\n\nTechnology has complicated this delicate balance. In the aughts, baseball installed QuesTec pitch-tracking technology in every ballpark, and ESPN\u2019s K-Zone and Fox\u2019s FoxTrax (now called PitchCast) superimposed approximated strike zones onto viewers\u2019 televisions. QuesTec allowed teams and umpires to analyze every pitch, while the televised strike zone led to a Rashomon effect in which fans saw one thing and umpires another, creating (further) distrust in their work.\n\nThis explosion of data revealed to ball clubs the strike-zone biases of each umpire. Thus in the 2010s, it became standard for catchers to \u201cframe\u201d their pitches with sleight of hand that tests the limits of human perception.\n\nAnalytics determined a good framer is worth two to three wins a season. Accordingly, teams have staffed their front offices with experts like Josh Ruffin, of the Minnesota Twins, a former military data analyst with national-security clearance. The recently retired umpire Jim Reynolds, now MLB\u2019s umpire supervisor, tells a story that illustrates what a hall of mirrors ball-and-strike calling has become: \u201cI had one conversation with a Dodgers catcher \u2014 I\u2019d ball a pitch and he\u2019d be mad because their own statistics said that I should have called that a strike.\u201d\n\nUmpires had a trove of new data at their disposal too, and their accuracy improved. Since 2008, called strikes outside the zone have decreased 5.5 percent, and called balls in the zone have dropped 14.3 percent. Yet robot umpiring has seemed inevitable to many in the baseball world. The development of ABS wasn\u2019t due to one single event, according to Morgan Sword, MLB\u2019s executive vice-president of baseball operations. It came more from a desire to fix important missed calls, combined with the opportunity to try out various systems in Triple-A when MLB took over operations of the minor leagues in 2021. They tested two approaches \u2014 full ABS, in which the umpire is a passive observer and listens for a beep in his ear when a strike has been thrown, and a challenge system \u2014 and surveyed fans about it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m oversimplifying a bit, but there are two camps of fans,\u201d Sword explained. \u201cThose that believe that the camera technology exists and that we should use it to get every call exactly right. Then there\u2019s a camp that feels that baseball is a human game and part of what you\u2019re coming to see when you buy a ticket is the drama that unfolds with human officials and that baseball would be losing something if you took the home-plate-umpire judgment out.\u201d\n\nThe challenge system is a compromise, Sword said. The human element is retained for the vast majority of the game (in which each team throws 150 pitches on average), but teams can invoke the technology to intervene at important moments. Each team gets two chances a game, and if a challenge is successful, they get to keep it.\n\nTriple-A managers, who have spent two seasons working with both approaches, speak highly of the one MLB settled on.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I like about the system is that if you give the umpire immediate feedback, they can calibrate almost immediately,\u201d said Morgan Ensberg, manager of the Durham Bulls, a Tampa Bay Rays affiliate.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t put everything into the umpire\u2019s hands,\u201d said Shelley Duncan, manager of the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, a Yankees affiliate. \u201cNow, it really becomes about the players, and it\u2019s almost peaceful. As a manager, I don\u2019t have to worry about getting angry at the umpires nonstop. I mean, we\u2019ve all been to a game where somebody in the stands yells at the umpire, \u2018It\u2019s not about you. You\u2019re not the one we paid to see.\u2019 It takes that away.\u201d\n\nThe full-time ABS format had several problems. The electronic strike zones seemed different in each ballpark, said Dick Scott, manager of the Syracuse Mets, adding that the umpire\u2019s reduced role made everything awkward: \u201cWhen the hitter didn\u2019t like the call, the bench would start barking and the umpire would just point at his ear like \u2018That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling me.\u2019 It was \u2026 too generic. The challenge system is good for everybody. It makes the umpires focus. It\u2019s still pressure, but I think umpires are better than people think they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the entertainment business, and you don\u2019t want to get rid of the human element,\u201d said Toby Gardenhire, manager of the St. Paul Saints, a Minnesota Twins affiliate. \u201cBut if you get a 3-2 count in the bottom of the seventh inning with the bases loaded and the game\u2019s on the line, what you don\u2019t want is for a really bad pitch that\u2019s off the plate to get called strike three. Now at least we have the ability to make a challenge.\u201d\n\nThese managers all hinted at something without quite saying it: The interaction with an umpire \u2014 the ability to complain and be heard by a human who\u2019s in charge, rather than one who\u2019s subservient to a machine \u2014 is vital. After all, baseball is a noisy game, full of chatter. In sports where such back-and-forth isn\u2019t so integral, humans are already being replaced. Racing sports such as track and swimming surrendered most officiating to machines decades ago, and tennis has followed suit on line calls, retaining just a chair umpire. Bennis officials aren\u2019t entwined in the aesthetics of their game the way umpires are in baseball. Nor, for that matter, are referees in football, basketball, and hockey. The controversies in NFL and NBA officiating seem endless, but if their referees were replaced by technology, it\u2019s hard to believe many fans would miss their presence, even though they take over the stadium\u2019s PA system to explain calls.\n\nThe real cautionary tale of technological encroachment in sports right now involves soccer, where referees play an outsize role in matches, often deciding the outcome of a game with one call or non-call. The video assistant referee was designed to help them, yet it has worsened the viewing and playing experience. As the instant-replay system checks every goal in slow motion, it often finds insignificant fouls or violations a referee wouldn\u2019t have called in real time \u2014 to the detriment of the game. Plus, the mandatory check can take several minutes before a decision is reached, which kills the stadium vibe among fans and players in a sport known for its tense buildups and eruptions of euphoria.\n\nResearchers have found high distrust of VAR. Fans of underdog soccer teams view the technology as something stacked against them and suspect it\u2019s being used for the benefit of bigger teams and bigger stars \u2014 just as many football fans claim the Kansas City Chiefs benefit from generous refereeing. Studies have shown that fans largely view human mistakes as part of the drama and debate of the game and that VAR both drains soccer of authenticity and sanitizes it: Every sports fan learns early on that feeling cheated by incompetent refs is a timeless, comforting excuse following a loss.\n\nThat seemed to be one reason full-time ABS felt wrong. While the use of \u201crobo-umps\u201d is an admission of human fallibility, isn\u2019t fallibility central to the fun of sports in general? Any game whose outcome is certain isn\u2019t worth playing. Also, there is something undignified about a human \u2014 especially the self-assured umpire type \u2014 becoming subservient to a machine.\n\nHistorian Surekha Davies recently wrote, \u201cBy deciding what robots are for, we are defining what humans are.\u201d Human labor, with its imperfections, is increasingly viewed as a costly, unreliable obstacle to an optimized society \u2014 hence all the self-service checkout kiosks and the ubiquity of ChatGPT. But the rise of machines leaves people uneasy. To borrow from Russian literature, what umpires really represent is the same notion Dostoyevsky was getting at in Notes From Underground: embracing irrationality over utopia as the price of salvaging the soul. Free will (and its capacity for even atrocious decision-making) is what makes us human.\n\nEven though the league had enough leverage in labor negotiations with the umpires union to win the right to test and implement ABS, league officials seem mindful of what umpires bring to the game \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deep philosophical question embedded in this test that I think is causing strong reactions from baseball fans and the people around the game,\u201d Sword said. \u201cWhat is the virtue of getting every call right, exactly? And is that the goal? It\u2019s a more difficult question than you would think.\u201d\n\nJames Earl Jones\u2019s point about baseball in Field of Dreams is that it helps mark time in a changing world. And baseball\u2019s many changes throughout the past century reflect society\u2019s changes: desegregation; the cultural turn westward; and, more recently, optimization and shorter attention spans. Change has made baseball\u2019s constancy possible. But as the sport hugs technology ever closer, its greatest assets are still what they always were: wood bats, leather balls and gloves, and a bunch of humans chatting, cheering, yelling at, and booing one another."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe fear and loathing among lawyers in Washington, DC, has never been greater.\n\nAfter a series of White House executive orders threatening their business and hiring practices, several powerful Washington law firms face a defining choice: push back publicly in defense of their industry or quietly hope to avoid President Donald Trump\u2019s wrath.\n\nMany firms are afraid that if they are targeted by Trump, it could devastate their business if both clients and partners flee, reconfiguring the centers of power in Washington\u2019s most influential private industry.\n\n\u201cWe could see a shakeup like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Ivan Adler, a headhunter for lobbyists who regularly works with Washington\u2019s law firms. \u201cThis is the talk of the town. Firms are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nInterviews with nearly a dozen lawyers and legal industry professionals shed light on the quiet fear gripping many law firms with decades of history doing business in Washington.\n\nA number of major firms are strategizing behind the scenes on how to react without attracting attention in wider political conversations, according to several people in Washington\u2019s legal community. Firm leaders, sources tell CNN, want to quell fears among their lawyers, especially younger associates who may be more likely to want the firms to take a stand politically against Trump.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s executive orders have targeted four large law firms \u2013 Perkins Coie; Jenner & Block; Covington & Burling; and Paul, Weiss, Wharton, Rifkin & Garrison. Among other things, lawyers at those firms have had their national security clearances suspended \u2013 a core piece of some legal defense work.\n\nSeveral lawyers who spoke to CNN expressed disappointment with the general lack of response from the legal industry and in Paul Weiss\u2019 situation, the capitulation to Trump\u2019s targeting with the firm leader\u2019s choice to cut a deal.\n\nTrump suggested Wednesday that universities and law firms are \u201cbending\u201d to his administration\u2019s will as he\u2019s targeted top legal firms that have represented his perceived political enemies.\n\n\u201cYou see what we\u2019re doing with the colleges, and they\u2019re all bending and saying, \u2018Sir, thank you very much. We appreciate it,\u2019\u201d Trump said at a White House event marking Women\u2019s History Month. \u201cNobody can believe it, including law firms that have been so horrible, law firms that, nobody would believe this, just saying, \u2018Where do I sign? Where do I sign?\u2019 \u2026 And there\u2019s more coming, but we really are in the \u2018Golden age of America.\u2019\u201d\n\nRather than fight an executive order, the New York dealmaking powerhouse law firm Paul Weiss agreed to provide $40 million in legal work to causes backed by the White House, including veterans\u2019 assistance and countering antisemitism, according to an email chairman Brad Karp sent firmwide on Sunday that was obtained by CNN.\n\nSeveral lawyers in Washington privately griped about Karp backing down from a fight against Trump. Several dozen alumni of Paul Weiss this week also published an open letter \u201cto protest the firm\u2019s recent decision to surrender to the Trump administration,\u201d the letter said.\n\nBut some legal industry insiders weren\u2019t surprised nor were they outraged by Paul Weiss\u2019 move.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for lawyers to \u201clook at all of your options,\u201d Cari Brunelle, a legal industry consultant, told CNN. \u201cSometimes you choose to litigate, and sometimes you choose to settle. It\u2019s what you do for your clients every day.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Anderson Cooper on \u2018chilling message\u2019 Trump is sending to law firms 03:09 - Source: CNN Anderson Cooper on \u2018chilling message\u2019 Trump is sending to law firms 03:09\n\nFor instance, an amicus brief being drafted in support of Perkins Coie has gotten few signatures from leaders at other firms, several people familiar with it say.\n\nThe White House is drafting more executive orders that would target more firms, according to two people familiar with what is in the works.\n\nAt the same time, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sent letters to another handful of law firms announcing a \u201creview\u201d of their diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Retaliation for DEI initiatives has been part of the White House executive orders against law firms, making those firms contacted by the EEOC especially concerned.\n\nIf law firms don\u2019t stand together, the president would be able to \u201cwipe out any potential legal opposition,\u201d Elliot Peters of the West Coast-centric litigation firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters.\n\nPeters said he believed Trump\u2019s actions so far add to a reality where Congress no longer pushes back against the president, and as Trump also tries to silence the press.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well on our road to an authoritarian government here,\u201d he said.\n\nKeker has been one of the few major US law firms willing to make a public statement criticizing the executive orders against law firms.\n\nPerkins Coie faces major challenges\n\nThough a number of firms are potentially at risk, the situation is particularly dire for Perkins Coie, according to a number of people familiar with the matter, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe White House announced it was blacklisting a number of its lawyers from federal buildings and potentially punishing its clients if they contract with the government, sending an immediate chill across the firm\u2019s everyday operations, sources said and according to a court case the firm has brought against the administration.\n\nAgencies have pulled back from working with the law firm, and one recent meeting was canceled for the firm at the Justice Department related to an ongoing client matter, sources and the firm\u2019s lawyer have said.\n\nDane Butswinkas, an attorney representing Perkins Coie in its challenge to the executive order, told a judge recently that the White House\u2019s approach would \u201cspell the end of the law firm.\u201d\n\nDistrict Judge Beryl Howell this month ordered the administration to stop many of the ways agencies could restrict Perkins Coie lawyers, deeming much of that executive order unconstitutional.\n\nThe American Bar Association along with dozens of other voluntary lawyer groups across the country have pushed back against the reticence across the profession to speak out.\n\n\u201cWe will not stay silent in the face of efforts to remake the legal profession into something that rewards those who agree with the government and punishes those who do not,\u201d a statement on Wednesday said. \u201cWe call upon the entire profession, including lawyers in private practice from Main Street to Wall Street, as well as those in corporations and who serve in elected positions, to speak out against intimidation.\u201d\n\nEven so, the White House continued its campaign against law firms on Tuesday, announcing more restrictions.\n\nJenner & Block was targeted with another executive order partly because one of its former well-known partners, Andrew Weissmann, had been a top prosecutor on the Russia investigation around Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, according to the White House. Jenner & Block is also working on several lawsuits challenging Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nA Jenner & Block spokesman, in a statement, acknowledged the firm had been named in Tuesday\u2019s executive order but didn\u2019t indicate how the firm would respond.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients\u2019 interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher and Evan Perez contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty Images\n\nThere was a time in media when having a billionaire owner was an asset. For many outlets, this is still the case, particularly those publishing super-secretive group chats of powerful government officials who seem eager to trample on the rights of the press. But for others, like the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, both of which have seen their benefactors bend a knee to Donald Trump and sacrifice the integrity of their newspapers in the process, ownership has become a problem. A problem that the Guardian US, the American arm of the British newspaper, has exploited.\n\n\u201cAll around us, media organizations have begun to capitulate,\u201d editor Betsy Reed writes in the current fundraising appeal at the bottom of each Guardian article. \u201cThe Guardian has neither a self-interested billionaire owner nor profit-seeking corporate henchmen pressuring us to appease the rich and powerful. With the new administration boasting about its desire to punish journalists, and Trump and his allies already pursuing lawsuits against newspapers whose stories they don\u2019t like, it has never been more urgent, or more perilous, to pursue fair, accurate reporting. Can you support The Guardian today?\u201d\n\nThe asks themselves are not new. The Guardian for the past eight years has asked readers to donate in support of its journalism, a \u201creader revenue\u201d program that helps the paper exist without a paywall. But the appeals have gotten more strident \u2014 and more Trump-focused \u2014 since the Post and the L.A. Times withdrew expected endorsements for Kamala Harris last fall, and to great effect. The last week in February was the second-biggest week in U.S. reader-revenue history for The Guardian; the biggest was the week of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe Guardian US expects to hit $44 million in voluntary reader donations in the U.S. and Canada this year, up 33 percent over last year, with some people supporting on a recurring basis and others giving one-time contributions. A first-person account by a Canadian citizen detained by ICE, for example, netted $105,000 in pledged donations. These contributions account for more than 60 percent of the American operation\u2019s total revenue, which last year exceeded costs by $16 million (the rest of its revenue comes from advertising and philanthropic support from foundations). The amount that people are contributing on a pledged basis doubled in October \u2014 the month that Jeff Bezos pulled the Post\u2019s endorsement for Harris \u2014 and has stayed at that level every month since, according to internal data provided by The Guardian, which just surpassed 350,000 recurring supporters in the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur messaging does appeal to people to support our work as a kind of cause, and I think that works for a number of reasons,\u201d Reed said in a recent interview in her downtown office, \u201cbut one is that there is a real crisis of access to reliable information for people who don\u2019t want or have the means to subscribe to the New York Times. That is a real problem that we have an answer to.\u201d\n\nGuardian managing director Steve Sachs added that The Guardian\u2019s global perspective \u2014 the internal catchphrase of the U.S. operation is that it covers America for the world and the world for America \u2014 is also a draw at such a volatile moment in geopolitics. \u201cPeople are even more interested now than they were six months ago,\u201d he said. The Guardian US\u2019 audience is split 50-50 between American and global readers.\n\nThe Guardian launched its U.S. operation more than a decade ago and seemed to have a promising start, hiring high-profile columnists like Michael Wolff and Glenn Greenwald and winning a Pulitzer for reporting on widespread secret surveillance by the National Security Agency. But as the Obama era gave way to the Trump era, the close association of the Guardian US with surveillance-state reporting made it less relevant to American readers. Annual losses led to restructuring that hit the U.S. operation, once housed in an airy Soho loft, particularly hard.\n\nBut during the pandemic, the Guardian US, like other news outlets, experienced a surge in reader interest, readying it for an expansion in 2022 that included hiring Reed, formerly of The Nation and the Intercept, and Sachs, who\u2019d spent years on the business side of Time Inc. The audience has continued to grow, with Sachs noting that the site typically sees between 40 million to 50 million unique visitors a month. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a place where our audience is actually bigger in the U.S. than The Wall Street Journal\u2019s audience in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaders and organizations across the media industry have been trying to innovate in the way people can pay for news. Sachs says he\u2019s been increasingly asked about the no-paywall model, with others in the industry wondering whether they should adopt the same. \u201cIf you\u2019re creative enough, you can figure out some new things,\u201d he tells people. \u201cBut the question is, does it scale?\u201d If it\u2019s \u201canother half-million dollars, a million dollars, whatever, it\u2019s not worth the effort,\u201d he said. Other publications that were donations-focused, including Vox.com (which is owned by the same parent company as New York), have moved away to membership models as a result. \u201cThe reason I think that it works for us is we cover so much breaking news and it drives a lot of traffic, and we have the scale to make it work,\u201d Reed said. \u201cEven if we only monetize one percent, it\u2019s still a lot.\u201d Still, even scaled-up publications like the Guardian US have to contend with the fact that donations are very boom-and-bust.\n\nDespite The Guardian\u2019s strident anti-Trump fundraising pushes, its broader audience is less partisan, as is the tone of its news coverage. It\u2019s a weird line to straddle. \u201cThe appeals that you see at the bottom of articles are really framed around issues of press freedom and our identity and our structure of ownership,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThey are not appeals that say, \u2018Trump is bad, you need to support The Guardian, we are against Trump.\u2019\u201d Maybe not explicitly. But they are clearly benefitting from this moment and using the new money to hire, with expectations to continue growing its staff in the U.S. this year.\n\nThe big question is: Will it last? \u201cI mean, unfortunately, there\u2019s no shortage of global crises going on, from what\u2019s happening in the Middle East to Ukraine to what\u2019s happening in this country,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThe world is incredibly interested in the shitshow here. God, it\u2019s like they\u2019re rubbernecking at a car crash.\u201d"

We protect people, and they don\u2019t do anything for us.\u201d\n\nIt's reminiscent of Trump's hard-line slugfests over immigration in his first term, from his proposed border wall to travel bans that were unpopular with voters and a bipartisan elite. But after President Joe Biden's border policies drew backlash, Trump won enough of that fight to turn immigration into a positive issue in the 2024 election. After his return to the White House in January, the field has shifted to make trade the next frontier, with Trump imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports from Mexico, Canada and China and preparing to move forward with additional tariffs on what could be trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods. It\u2019s a high-stakes move, pitting him against not just foreign allies but also a domestic coalition of business interests, free-trade advocates and others who have thrived in the status quo.\n\nAnalysts warn of chaos: supply chain shocks, higher consumer costs and fractures among Western allies. But Trump is betting big on a future in which voters and history vindicate him as the president who finally made globalization bend to U.S. will and brought jobs back home.\n\n\u201cThe second Trump administration will really be graded on how far along he can accomplish this agenda,\u201d said Nick Iacovella, executive vice president of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which supports tariffs. \u201cIf the president is successful over these next four years, 10 to 15 years from now we will look back and there will be massive gains in the manufacturing sector of the United States. We\u2019ll see rising incomes, real household income growth will increase, our GDP will increase. We\u2019ll be a manufacturing superpower again.\u201d\n\nAt a moment of political risk for Trump, Iacovella argued that volatility in the stock market shouldn\u2019t be considered a measure of health for ordinary voters and that Democrats performed poorly in the last election despite strong returns while the last administration was in office.\n\n\u201cDuring Biden\u2019s term, the stock market increased by more than 20 points on average, and the American people overwhelmingly just voted Biden out of office and kicked Democrats out of control of Congress,\u201d Iacovella said. \u201cThey gave single-handed control to Republicans. So the American people have pretty much made their voice on this clear.\u201d\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist and one of the architects of his populist political movement, noted the political risk for Trump as he has started rolling out his tariff agenda, pointing to elections next week for Wisconsin's Supreme Court and Florida's 6th Congressional District that could reinforce or challenge the agenda.\n\n\u201cIf we lose both of those\u201d on April 1, the tariff rollout on April 2 \u201cis going to be quite different,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cYou\u2019re already seeing it right now where he is taking potentially more targeted, less blanket, reciprocity. Part of that is the political reality.\u201d\n\nBut there is also belief that the politics could shift in the long term. \"It\u2019s one thing to bring manufacturing jobs back, but he\u2019s redoing the world system,\" Bannon said. \"The tariffs are the key economic instrument needed to accomplish that.\"\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he thinks \u201cpeople will be pleasantly surprised\u201d when reciprocal tariffs are announced on April 2, saying that in \u201cmany cases,\u201d these will be \u201cless than the tariff than they have been charging us for decades.\u201d\n\nCritics warn that such tariffs could lead to higher consumer costs and disrupt global supply chains. Stephen Moore, a member of Trump\u2019s economic task force in 2020, argued this week that steel prices are already rising sharply due to tariffs and threaten to place U.S. manufacturing industries at a cost disadvantage. Trump also faces pushback from European allies and murmurs from Japan and South Korea, partners who\u2019d rather tweak the system.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s team argues the old ways were never sustainable, pointing to manufacturing decline and trade deficits. Instead, it\u2019s wagering that any short-term pain will force a realignment for which future generations will thank him.\n\nFor now, polling shows flashing red lights on Trump\u2019s trade policies. Tariffs were Trump's worst issue among seven tested in a CNN poll this month, with 61% disapproving of his handling of tariffs. Immigration, meanwhile, was his best, as it was in a recent NBC News poll. That survey found 56% of registered voters in favor of his early performance on immigration and border security.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t always the case. During his first term, Trump waded through choppy waters on immigration. An NBC News poll from July 2017 found that 47% disapproved of his immigration and border policies, with 39% in favor. Sentiment grew worse over the following months, with one of Trump\u2019s advisers acknowledging on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that \"nobody likes\" the separation of migrant children from their parents that was happening at the country\u2019s southern border. By July 2018, his handling received 41% approval, with 51% opposed.\n\nSince then, views have shifted sharply.\n\nIn a 41-page document titled \u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System,\u201d Stephen Miran, now the chairman of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in November about his decadeslong \u201cdesire to reform the global trading system and put American industry on fairer ground\u201d against the rest of the world and the range of tools his administration could use to get there, whether through tariffs or currency policy.\n\nAmid warnings that tariffs could raise prices on everyday goods for consumers, Miran told Bloomberg this week that \u201cU.S. consumers are flexible. We have options. ... Countries that sell to the United States are inflexible. They\u2019ve only got the United States to sell to. There\u2019s no alternative. So they\u2019re the ones that will bear the burden of these tariffs.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs has advised investors that the initial tariff rate may be higher than expected when new measures are announced next week, as the administration hopes to begin negotiations from a strong position.\n\nYet Trump has hinted at flexibility, saying this week that he could soften his plans for reciprocal tariffs and \u201cmay give a lot of countries breaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to charge them what they\u2019ve charged us,\u201d he told reporters Monday.\n\nUsing 2017 as the base year, the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency, assessed in a report ordered by Congress that U.S. trade deals boosted U.S. economic output by $88.8 billion, or 0.5%. They increased overall U.S. employment by 485,000 full-time equivalent jobs, or 0.3%, based on a model that assumes the economy is at its long-run full employment level. It\u2019s a modest gain that Iacovella said fuels Trump\u2019s argument that past trade policies have failed U.S. workers, whom he and others said have been harmed by decades of the status quo.\n\nAnd change is overdue, said one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate. \u201cPresident Trump knows that American workers have been thrown under the bus for too long,\u201d Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThe Trump tariffs take the \u2018kick me\u2019 sign off the backs of these workers and prioritize Americans over foreign interests.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Next week\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court race is emerging as the first big test of Democrats\u2019 anti-Elon Musk strategy as the party searches for a winning message following its loss to President Donald Trump last November.\n\nTrump\u2019s billionaire adviser has been a major player in the technically nonpartisan judicial race. Musk\u2019s super PAC has emerged as the top spender in the contest, offered $100 to Wisconsin voters to sign a petition to oppose \u201cactivist judges\" and said it would give away $1 million to a petition signer. And Musk often posts about the election on his X feed.\n\nBetween that and his polarizing efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency to slash the size of the federal government \u2014 and polling that shows he\u2019s less popular than Trump, who endorsed conservative candidate Brad Schimel last week \u2014 Democratic-aligned groups and liberal candidate Susan Crawford have made Musk a major focal point in the race\u2019s final stretch.\n\nIt\u2019s a playbook that Democrats could seek to replicate elsewhere if it\u2019s successful in one of the country\u2019s tightest battleground states.\n\n\u201cDemocrats can\u2019t win against Trump right now,\u201d Brandon Scholz, a Wisconsin Republican strategist, said. \u201cThey can still beat the hell out of Musk.\u201d\n\nScholz argued that Democrats would risk juicing conservative turnout in the off-year election by attempting to make Trump, who narrowly carried Wisconsin on his way to winning a second term in the White House, the center of their strategy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Democrats want to draw [Schimel] to Trump, because that gives MAGA voters incentive to come out to vote,\u201d Scholz added.\n\nTuesday\u2019s race will determine the state Supreme Court\u2019s ideological balance for the second time in two years \u2014 and likely along with it the future of several key issues, including abortion rights, unions and congressional maps. Crawford is a state judge in Madison who earlier worked in the Democratic administration of then-Gov. Jim Doyle, while Schimel, a state judge in Waukesha County, previously was the state\u2019s Republican attorney general.\n\nCrawford and groups supporting her have criticized Musk\u2019s money and influence on the race on the airwaves.\n\nOne television ad from the Crawford campaign, which began running on cable and broadcast in the state Tuesday, features a former assistant district attorney from Madison claiming that Musk \u201cis trying to buy this election with ads that lie about Judge Susan Crawford.\u201d Another recent Crawford campaign TV ad accused Musk of \u201ctrying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court because he knows Schimel always helps his big campaign donors.\u201d\n\nCrawford has repeatedly used Musk as a foil at campaign events, and she attributed her latest fundraising haul to grassroots donations \u201cfrom folks who don\u2019t want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters are very animated by Musk,\u201d Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why you see us mentioning Musk in the campaign.\u201d Honeyman added the Crawford campaign wasn\u2019t planning to run any ads in the race\u2019s remaining days directly mentioning Trump.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Wisconsin has also been hosting a town-hall tour across the state called \u201cPeople v. Musk,\u201d with surrogates like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz using the events as platforms to further bash Musk and DOGE.\n\nAt one such event earlier this month in Eau Claire, Walz said Wisconsinites could use their Supreme Court race ballots to convey their disapproval of Musk\u2019s work in the federal government.\n\n\u201cThis is where you send a message,\u201d he said, adding that a Crawford win would mark a rebuke to Musk and represent \u201ccleaning the house \u2014 one chunk at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd America\u2019s first chunk of cleaning is Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, April 1,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to questions about the left\u2019s attempts to tie Schimel to Musk and about whether Schimel was seeking to link himself to Trump, Schimel campaign spokesperson Jacob Fischer said in an email that \u201cthe attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nA representative for Musk and a White House spokesperson who handles inquiries regarding Musk and DOGE didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nPolling shows Musk\u2019s favorability underwater\n\nRecent polling in Wisconsin and nationally suggests that DOGE\u2019s tactics are pushing voters\u2019 patience and that Musk has emerged as a riper political target than Trump for Democrats.\n\nPolling released this month from Marquette University Law School found that more registered voters in Wisconsin (53%) viewed Musk unfavorably than favorably (41%). By contrast, the survey showed that voters in the swing state were more split on Trump\u2019s job performance (48% said they approved; 51% said they disapproved) and on whether Musk\u2019s DOGE was properly carrying out Trump\u2019s agenda (47% said it was; 53% said it wasn\u2019t).\n\nA national NBC News poll released this month offered similar findings: More voters (51%) viewed Musk negatively than positively (39%) and more held negative views on DOGE (47%) than positive (41%). Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s job approval rating was split, with 47% approving and 51% disapproving.\n\nMusk endorsed Schimel on X in January days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a suit in Wisconsin challenging a state law banning carmakers from owning dealerships. The case could end up before the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe race is the most expensive state Supreme Court campaign in U.S. history \u2014 surpassing a record set in Wisconsin in 2023 \u2014 and there\u2019s already been more than $74 million in spending by the candidates and outside groups.\n\nMusk\u2019s America PAC is the top outside spender in the race at $12 million so far \u2014 including more than $5 million since just March 18 \u2014 focused largely on canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nA GOP-aligned nonprofit group with past ties to Musk, Building America\u2019s Future, is the third-biggest outside spender in the race \u2014 the ad-tracking firm AdImpact reports the group has spent more than $6.5 million on ads there so far. While Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have both reported that Musk helped to fund the group in the past, it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019s still involved.\n\nA spokesperson who handles questions for America PAC and Building America\u2019s Future didn\u2019t respond to questions.\n\nAnd Musk himself appears to have donated $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party across two donations in February and March. (While Musk hasn\u2019t personally confirmed the donations, the filings list his name and an address previously associated with his donations to America PAC.)\n\nBut overall, Democrats hold a slight ad spending edge in the race, according to AdImpact, outpacing Republican-aligned groups $31.1 million to $26.4 million through Wednesday.\n\nThe vast majority of ad spending from the pro-Crawford side comes from her campaign, while outside groups account for the bulk of the pro-Schimel ad spending. And overall, Crawford\u2019s campaign reported spending more than $21 million through March 17, compared with $9.5 million for Schimel\u2019s campaign.\n\nAside from the high levels of spending, there's also been a surge in early voting in the race, which kicked off last week. In-person absentee voting has already exceeded total levels during Wisconsin's 2023 spring elections, while total absentee voting is on pace to push past 2023 levels in the coming days.\n\nTrump makes a late entrance\n\nEven if he hasn\u2019t been front and center, Trump, who posted on Truth Social last Friday urging Wisconsin voters to turn out early for Schimel, has still been a presence on the campaign trail in Wisconsin.\n\nSchimel\u2019s campaign launched a TV ad that went on the air Wednesday touting the endorsement. Mailers paid for and placed by America PAC, for example, tout Schimel as the candidate who will \u201csupport President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nAnd two 30-second ads, funded by the Republican State Leadership Committee, which boosts GOP candidates in nonfederal statewide races, launched Friday just hours before the president\u2019s endorsement. Both emphasize how voters in Wisconsin just months ago delivered the state for Trump \u2014 and how a Crawford win could jeopardize his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cLast year we showed up for Trump and he won,\u201d a narrator says in one of the ads. \u201cPresident Trump needs us again.\u201d\n\nBut groups on the left have yet to run ads trying to weaponize the endorsement, according to an NBC News analysis of AdImpact data.\n\nMeanwhile, Schimel\u2019s views on Trump have long been in plain view. He appeared at a campaign town hall event this month with Donald Trump Jr. and recently told a group of canvassers from the conservative group Turning Point USA that Trump needs a \u201csupport network\u201d around him to help him fight the myriad suits his administration has faced. Schimel has also supported Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cSchimel needs Trump to win. He needs every MAGA voter to turn out to win,\u201d Scholz, the GOP strategist, said. \u201cHe wants to draw close to Trump.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (March 31, 2025, 11:31 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the amount of total spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. It is more than $74 million altogether, not $86 million by outside groups alone."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court appeared sympathetic Wednesday to a series of programs geared toward expanding high-speed internet in rural and poor communities, despite a challenge from a conservative group claiming funding for that effort violates separation of powers principles.\n\nAfter nearly three hours of argument, several of the court\u2019s conservatives \u2013 along with all of its liberals \u2013 raised concerns about a ruling that could upend the way other federal agencies function, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIf the court upholds the structure of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s funding for the programs, it would represent a departure from its trend in recent years of significantly limiting the power of agencies to act without explicit approval from Congress.\n\n\u201cThese are the services that all the rest of us take for granted that you can\u2019t take for granted in rural North Dakota,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, said in summarizing her reading of the law. \u201cAnd what this program says is that rural North Dakota citizens should also get what all the rest of us have long had.\u201d\n\nCongress created the Universal Service Fund in 1996 to pay for efforts to expand broadband and phone service in rural and low-income urban parts of the country. Telecommunications companies contribute billions to that fund \u2013 a cost that is passed on to consumers \u2013 to pay for programs like E-Rate, which lowers the cost of high-speed internet for libraries and schools.\n\n\u2018We have a tax that\u2019s unlike any other tax this court has approved\u2019\n\nA conservative \u201cconsumer awareness group\u201d challenged that fund as an unconstitutional \u201cdelegation\u201d of the power of Congress to levy taxes. What\u2019s worse, the group argues, a private entity calculates the amount of money that must be contributed. The Supreme Court has not invoked the nondelegation doctrine \u2013 or the idea that Congress cannot delegate its authority \u2013 since the 1930s. It has, for decades, permitted delegations under certain conditions.\n\nConservative groups have argued the federal agencies have perverted separation-of-powers principles, allowing government agencies to take the lead on difficult choices they say should be left to lawmakers. In this case, they said, it has also allowed Congress to escape paying a political price for taxes.\n\nSeveral of the court\u2019s conservatives, including Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, pressed hard on the idea that there was little accountability for the way the government has structured the program.\n\n\u201cThis just a straight up tax without any numerical limit, any cap,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cWe have a tax that\u2019s unlike any other tax this court has approved.\u201d\n\nBut other conservatives, including Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 both key votes \u2013 seemed skeptical that putting a cap on how much the fund could raise would solve the problems critics have raised.\n\n\u201cYour position would say that a solution to the problem \u2026 could be a trillion-dollar cap,\u201d Kavanaugh said.\n\nThat number, he said, \u201ccould be very high. And then the question is: What exactly are we accomplishing?\u201d\n\nThe law allows the FCC to raise a \u201csufficient\u201d amount of money to accomplish the broad goal of universal access to telecommunications.\n\n\u201cWe would be saying, I think, if we agree with you, \u2018sufficient\u2019 is not good enough but a \u2018trillion dollar\u2019 is, and I think a lot of people would say, \u2018that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u201d Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe unusual politics of the case created a striking dynamic during the arguments Wednesday in which the court\u2019s liberal wing appeared to be siding with the attorney representing the Trump administration, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris.\n\n\u201cThe easiest parts of an argument are where you just have to say \u2018yes\u2019 to everything,\u201d Kagan quipped with Harris after she delivered a series of affirmative answers to Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nHarris faced much tougher questioning from the most stalwart conservative justices.\n\nThe Biden administration appealed a ruling from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down the funding mechanism. Under Trump, the Justice Department continued the case, warning the court in a brief that \u201cCongress has relied on this court\u2019s longstanding\u201d approach to the issue to enact legislation authorizing agencies to police unfair competition, oversee the securities industry and ensure the safety of food and drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority has in recent years hacked away at the power of federal agencies to act on their own, most recently in a 6-3 decision last year that overturned a 1984 precedent requiring courts to give deference to agency regulations in many circumstances. Federal agency power expanded dramatically after the New Deal, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, and courts had veered too far from exercising independent judgment about whether an agency had violated the law.\n\nThat decision came on the heels of a blockbuster ruling in 2022 that embraced the so-called major questions doctrine, which bars an agency from issuing a rule with major economic or political impacts absent explicit approval from Congress.\n\nA decision is expected in June."

The Breitbart News Foundation\u2019s joint investigation with the Government Accountability Institute blew the lid off of this network in Part I of this series.\n\nIn Part II of this investigation, we reveal that a still-active University of Minnesota email account of former professor Dr. Bingwen Yan is listed on official Chinese Communist Party (CCP) websites as the contact for the Overseas Chinese Service Center of Minnesota. Yan is no longer a professor at the University of Minnesota, but any communications that have been taking place on that email address in the roughly ten tears since he was could prove useful to any investigation of whether the CCP is operating another \u201cpolice station\u201d in Minnesota.\n\nAs recently as last year, the FBI busted a united front operation in Manhattan, describing it as a \u201csecret, illegal police station.\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has introduced the Expel Illegal Chinese Police Act, which would, among other things, revoke the visas of Chinese government and CCP personnel operating police stations and other illicit outfits in the United States.

Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI), who is chairman of the House Select Committee on the CCP, is one of the sponsors of Hinson\u2019s bill.\n\nDr. Bingwen Yan is the \u201cperson in charge\u201d of the Minnesota OCSC, and he has entrenched himself in Minnesota politics, donating to figures like Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and holding events where he has been prominently photographed with politicians. The former University of Minnesota professor is a scientist with multiple patents and is the founder of the Alliance of Minnesota Chinese Organizations (AMCO). During a 2017 ceremony, Yan officially became a CCP-appointed Consular Protection Liaison Officer, which deputized him to provide \u201csecurity services\u201d locally. Then in 2018, he attended a Ministry of Public Security training on \u201ccross-border remote justice services,\u201d linking him to CCP overseas operations.\n\nYang Shaowen, China\u2019s Deputy Director of the International Cooperation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, told Xinhua reporters that persons with the title of Police Liaison Officer have a dual identity as both diplomats and police officers. \u201cPolice Liaison Officer\u201d is a title that is often used by the CCP interchangeably with the \u201cConsular Protection Liaison Officer\u201d title that was conferred upon Yan, and at times it appears to be synonymous with \u201cpolice chief.\u201d\n\nThe official email address listed on official Chinese government websites as the point of contact for the Minnesota OCSC is none other than Dr. Bingwen Yan\u2019s University of Minnesota email address created more than a decade ago when he was a professor there: yanxx030@umn.edu.\n\nSee an archive of a website listing Yan\u2019s University of Minnesota email address here and screen grabs from it below:\n\nThis begs the obvious question: Has a U.S. taxpayer-funded public university email address been used to conduct CCP activity in the United States?\n\nThis is not the first time the University of Minnesota and China\u2019s United Front have been connected. A Chinese spy arrested in Taiwan in 1980 said she had been recruited into the CCP\u2019s United Front in 1977 while studying for a master\u2019s degree in microphotography at the University of Minnesota. And two of the engines of United Front work\u2014the Confucius Institutes and the widely-banned Chinese company Huawei\u2014had strong partnerships with the University of Minnesota for years until the university abruptly ended both programs in 2019 after federal criticism. The University of Minnesota also has an extensive partnership with Sun Yat-sen University, which is linked to Beijing\u2019s nuclear weapons program. The Washington Free Beacon reported that Sun Yat-sen has funneled over $3 Million to the University of Minnesota. Despite being flagged by U.S. authorities, the partnership continues.\n\nYet another \u201cred\u201d flag is that a Chinese company called Huitian (Beijing) International Logistics Co., Ltd registered its U.S. branch (HTL International Corporation) at the same official address as the Minnesota Overseas Chinese Service Center: \u201c1399 N Eustis St.\u201d\n\nHTL\u2019s website describes itself as one of the only comprehensive transport and logistics companies that is PRC-certified to ship Class 1 dangerous goods, such as explosives. It\u2019s also one of only two Chinese entities that has authority to conduct their own quality checks on import/exports of commodities passing through Chinese customs. Many of HTL\u2019s \u201cStrategic Partners\u201d are state-owned entities that have been banned in the U.S. for working with China\u2019s military. Three of these companies\u2014China Three Gorges Corp, Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and the AVIC Group\u2014are still currently listed as investment assets of the Minnesota State Board of Investment, the state agency that manages retirement funds.\n\nA 2023 report released by the U.S. Secretary of Defense describes how China\u2019s military has been actively integrating with Chinese transport companies by embedding military personnel within \u201ccivilian transportation companies (air, road, and sea) to plan and manage military transportation.\u201d\n\nSerious questions remain about the Minnesota OCSC\u2019s connections in Minnesota. Some of those answers may lie in the email traffic on a domain belonging to a public university in America\u2019s heartland.\n\nIn December 2024, the FBI announced that a Chinese-American in Brooklyn pled guilty in court for \u201chis role in audaciously establishing an undeclared police station in the heart of New York City [at the direction of MPS] and attempting to conceal the effort when approached by FBI New York.\u201d\n\nThere is arguably more smoke in Minnesota than there was in New York City when the FBI\u2019s investigation of that \u201cpolice station\u201d was started.\n\nSeamus Bruner is the Vice President and Executive Director, Research and Jedd McFatter is a Senior Research Fellow at Peter Schweizer\u2019s Government Accountability Institute.

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we dive into the latest fallout and reaction after The Atlantic published the transcript of a group chat among Trump administration officials that revealed sensitive information about military strikes in Yemen. Plus, Andrea Mitchell explains how the episode underscores a stark departure from previous administrations on national security and intelligence matters.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nWashington grapples with growing group chat fallout\n\nThe fallout from a group chat in which Trump administration officials discussed sensitive military plans that inadvertently included a journalist continued to dominate Washington on Wednesday.\n\nHere\u2019s our team\u2019s latest reporting:\n\nChat transcript released: The Atlantic published a full transcript of the messages, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth specified types of U.S. military aircraft and the timing of recent airstrikes against Houthi militias in Yemen. The texts did not include information about specific targets.\n\nTrump officials react: National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard said the leaked group text chat was a mistake but reiterated her claim that no classified information was shared on the chain as she testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe both claimed no classified material was shared in the chat.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt forcefully pushed back against The Atlantic\u2019s latest report at a briefing.\n\n\u201cWe have said all along that no classified material was sent on this messaging thread,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were no locations, no sources or methods revealed, and there were certainly no war plans discussed.\u201d\n\nFormer officials react: Information about an upcoming U.S. military attack on an adversary is typically considered classified, according to at least four former national security and intelligence officials who handled legal matters.\n\nThe former officials did not know anything specific about the status of the information in the Signal chat, but they said it would be difficult to imagine a scenario in which details of military operations would not be treated as secret and damaging if they were disclosed.\n\nLawmakers react: The incident has provoked intense criticism from Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have called for the resignations of Hegseth and Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz.\n\nSens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, respectively, said they would request an \u201cexpedited\u201d inspector general\u2019s report into the matter. Wicker also said he would ask for a classified briefing from the administration for committee members.\n\nAsked directly whether he believes the information discussed in the chat is \u2014 or should be \u2014 classified, Wicker replied: \u201cThe information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\u201d\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a retired Air Force general, has rebutted the administration\u2019s assertion that the text chain did not include \u201cclassified\u201d material or any \u201cwar plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House is in denial that this was not classified or sensitive data,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cThey should just own up to it and preserve credibility.\u201d\n\nExplainer: Signal isn\u2019t infallible, despite being one of the most secure encrypted chat apps, by Kevin Collier\n\nSignal chat highlights a sharp departure from the norm in U.S. national security\n\nAnalysis by Andrea Mitchell\n\nThere is nothing normal about it. For most national security experts outside the Trump orbit, the full text messages The Atlantic published only reinforce their outrage about discussing the Houthi operation on Signal, a commercially available app the Pentagon recently warned is being actively targeted by \u201cRussia-aligned threat groups.\u201d\n\nWidespread anger and incredulity about all this were amplified by the distinctions Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the top intelligence officials are making between \u201cwar\u201d plans and \u201cattack\u201d plans.\u201d That also extended to National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s testimony that the information in the texts was not classified.\n\nBut the Trump team\u2019s treatment of intelligence in this instance raises broader questions. Why were these conversations taking place by text instead of in the Situation Room \u2014 which is equipped to securely bring in members of the team not on site? Or in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (or SCIFs) the government sets up for national security Cabinet members in their homes? Wouldn\u2019t that create a better environment for deeper discussions about such an important military operation \u2014 the new administration\u2019s largest to date to try to protect international shipping in a critical seaway from Houthi terrorists?\n\nWhere was the discussion about possible Iranian reaction or how to notify the Israelis? Whether to engage the Europeans? Perhaps if they had been face to face, rather than texting, there would have been less posturing, such as Vice President JD Vance\u2019s criticism on the text chain that the Europeans \u2014 whom he also slammed in a speech last month in Munich \u2014 should do their part to protect international trade from Houthi attacks. Hegseth chimed in, writing, \u201cVP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It\u2019s PATHETIC.\u201d The message has fueled growing anger among European leaders at the administration.\n\nWhat is also striking is the team\u2019s virtual high-fiving via emojis \u2014 a fist bump, a flame, a flexed bicep. Meanwhile, when Gabbard was asked at a congressional hearing Wednesday about her repost on her personal X account of a Russia state media contributor, she said, \u201cI maintain my First Amendment rights to be able to express my own personal views on different issues.\u201d\n\nIt all underscores how this is a significant departure from the way previous administrations from both parties have handled national security and intelligence issues.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump said he was imposing a 25% tariff on all automobiles coming into the United States.\n\nA federal appeals court denied the administration\u2019s bid to lift a judge\u2019s order banning it from using Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people alleged to be Venezuelan gang members.\n\nTrump signed a sweeping executive order attempting a major overhaul of American elections, requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote.\n\nFederal employees across several government agencies filed a class action complaint against the Trump administration, claiming it unlawfully fired employees for DEI activities.\n\nIn remarks at a Women\u2019s History Month event at the White House, Trump said he would be known as the \u201cfertilization president.\u201d\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2696\ufe0f In the courts: The Supreme Court upheld a Biden administration effort to regulate \u201cghost gun\u201d kits that allow people to easily obtain parts needed to assemble firearms from online sellers.

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 The Signal group chat that conveyed details of the timing and weapons descriptions of a planned attack against the Houthis in Yemen included the names or initials of 18 Trump officials and, of course, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who published his account of the messages.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council has confirmed that the message thread \"appears to be authentic,\" and none of the reported participants has denied their appearance in the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee have asked the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the incident.\n\nSo who are the officials whose contacts appear in the Signal chat, and what do they do?\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz\n\nGoldberg said that on Tuesday, March 11, he received a connection request on Signal, from a user identified as Michael Waltz. That turned out to be national security adviser Michael Waltz, a top adviser to the president.\n\n\"Two days later\u2014Thursday\u2014at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group,\" Goldberg wrote. \"It was called the 'Houthi PC small group.'\"\n\nWaltz launched the group's conversation, saying, according to The Atlantic: \"Team \u2013 establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours.\"\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz speaks with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 11, 2025. Saul Loeb / AP\n\nAs national security adviser, Waltz is a presidential appointee and does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nPresident Trump told NBC he still has confidence in Waltz, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"\n\nWaltz said he took \"full responsibility\" and that he \"built\" the Signal chat group, but he also said he did not have Goldberg's contact information and he didn't know how Goldberg got into the chat. Goldberg said he received a Signal request from a user identified as \"Michael Waltz.\" And soon after, a screenshot Goldberg provided said, \"Michael Waltz added you to the group.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic. Neither the White House nor Hegseth has disputed the authenticity of Hegseth's communication, but they have insisted it doesn't constitute \"war plans.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to give a television interview outside the White House on March 21, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein / AP\n\nAs the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance\n\nVice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"\n\nSince The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance speaks at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico during a tour March 26, 2025, in Quantico, Va. Rod Lamkey / AP\n\nAs vice president, Vance is not only second in line to the presidency, but a key adviser on virtually all matters of domestic and foreign policy to the president.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"\n\nJohn Ratcliffe appears for his Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 15, 2025. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nIn his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"\n\n\"TG\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard\n\nA user called \"TG\" in the Signal chat appears to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, The Atlantic reported. In congressional testimony this week, Gabbard did not deny that she was in the message chain, but she said she was \"not directly involved\" in the part of the chat that discussed attack plans.\n\nAs the director of national intelligence, Gabbard is a Cabinet-level head of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks during a Senate Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 25, 2025, Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nGabbard testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, where she said Signal came pre-installed on government devices.\n\nSpecial envoy Steve Witkoff\n\nThe name Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, also appears in the chat.\n\nWitkoff was in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin during part of the period leading up to the attack.\n\nSources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Witkoff didn't have his personal device or government phone with him in Moscow, and that he was given access to a \"classified protected server\" by the U.S. government and was \"very careful\" about his communications while in Russia.\n\nIn his own social media post Wednesday, Witkoff said he had \"no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"\n\nWitkoff had little communication in the chat.\n\nScott B.\n\nScott B. appears to be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to The Atlantic. The Scott B. account designated someone from the Treasury Department to be his point of contact for matters related to the strike. The Treasury Department oversees things like sanctions.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles\n\nThe name of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles is a contact in the Signal group, although the screenshots The Atlantic published don't include contributions from Wiles' name.\n\nAs the White House chief of staff, Wiles is responsible for managing the president's senior staff as well as overseeing the execution of his agenda.\n\n\"MAR\" \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio\n\nThe name \"MAR\" appears twice in the contacts list. The Atlantic points out the secretary of state's full name is Marco Antonio Rubio, and \"MAR\" chimed in on behalf of the State Department.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio confirmed his presence in the chat, saying he only contributed twice.\n\n\"I can speak to myself for my presence on it \u2014 I think my role on it was just speaking for my role,\" Rubio said. \"I contributed to it twice. I identified my point of contact, which is my chief of staff. And then later on, I think three hours after the White House's official announcements have been made, I congratulated the members of the team.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio at a news conference in Jamaica on March 26, 2025. Nathan Howard / AP\n\nIn the chain, \"MAR\" designates Mike Needham, Rubio's counselor and chief of staff, to be the State Department's point of contact. Needham's account does not converse in the chat.\n\nDeputy national security adviser Alex Wong\n\nAlex Wong is Waltz' deputy. In his initial messages, Waltz said Wong was \"pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency chief of staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning.\"\n\nJoe Kent\n\nMr. Trump tapped former Green Beret Joe Kent to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, and Kent's name appears in the Signal chat. In the chat, Gabbard designated Kent to be the point of contact for her Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nOthers\n\nOthers included in the Signal chat are identified as Brian, who referred to himself in the chat as \"Brian McCormack for NSC,\" Walker Barrett, Jacob and \"SM,\" who Goldberg reported he believed to be Trump adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Mike Needham's account conversed in the Signal chat, but that account did not. The report has been updated."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA divided federal appeals court has maintained a temporary block on President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to use the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n\nThe DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled 2-1 on Wednesday that a pair of lower-court orders blocking Trump\u2019s use of the sweeping wartime authority can stand while a legal challenge to the president\u2019s invocation of the law plays out.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg\u2019s orders blocking use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations has been at the center of an escalating political and legal controversy since they were issued on the evening of March 15. Two flights of people being deported under the act took off during an emergency hearing and did not turn around, leading to ongoing questions of whether Boasberg\u2019s court order was intentionally ignored.\n\nSince then, the Justice Department and Boasberg have gone back and forth over DOJ\u2019s refusal to provide more information about the flights, and Trump suggested Boasberg should be impeached. That led to a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives the president tremendous authority to target and remove undocumented immigrants, to speed up the deportations of migrants the government has accused of being members of the gang, Tren de Aragua. The law is designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so.\n\nWednesday\u2019s appeals court ruling was unsigned. But Judges Patricia Millett, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Karen Henderson, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, wrote lengthy opinions explaining why they agreed with the court\u2019s decision.\n\nHenderson leaned into the argument that allowing Trump to use the law \u2013 even as the case proceeded \u2013 \u201crisks exiling plaintiffs to a land that is not their country of origin\u201d where they could face torture in notorious prisons.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Photographer with exclusive access to El Salvador prison explains what he witnessed 03:38 - Source: CNN Photographer with exclusive access to El Salvador prison explains what he witnessed 03:38\n\n\u201cIndeed, at oral argument before this Court, the government in no uncertain terms conveyed that \u2013 were the injunction lifted \u2013 it would immediately begin deporting plaintiffs without notice,\u201d Henderson wrote. \u201cPlaintiffs allege that the government has renditioned innocent foreign nationals in its pursuit against TdA. For example, one plaintiff alleges that he suffered brutal torture with \u2018electric shocks and suffocation\u2019 for demonstrating against the Venezuelan regime.\u201d\n\nJudge Justin Walker, who was named to the bench by Trump during his first term, dissented, focusing on a technical issue he raised during the oral arguments in the case. Walker said the claims filed by those deported needed to go to a court in Texas rather than in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Trump administration, he said, had shown \u201cthat the district court\u2019s orders threaten irreparable harm to delicate negotiations with foreign powers on matters concerning national security.\u201d\n\nAnd that harm, Walker said, \u201cplus the asserted public interest in swiftly removing dangerous aliens,\u201d outweighs the plaintiffs\u2019 desire to file the suit in Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed Boasberg\u2019s orders during a very early stage of the litigation, and it\u2019s likely that the case will arrive back at the DC Circuit in coming weeks after the judge issues a more thorough decision on the merits of Trump\u2019s use of the wartime law for these deportations.\n\nMillett seemed especially focused on the case\u2019s posture as she explained why she wanted to keep the orders at issue intact.\n\n\u201cThe district court has been handling this matter with great expedition and circumspection, and its orders do nothing more than freeze the status quo until weighty and unprecedented legal issues can be addressed through a soon-forthcoming preliminary injunction proceeding,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSiding with the administration at this juncture, Millett said, would \u201cmoot the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims by immediately removing them beyond the reach of their lawyers or the court.\u201d\n\nMillett was also critical of the Trump administration\u2019s argument that it did not violate Boasberg\u2019s order from the bench earlier this month to immediately turn around any planes carrying migrants being deported under the Alien Enemies Act. DOJ attorneys have told Boasberg that his oral command \u201cdid not amount to a binding injunction\u201d and that a written order he issued shortly after the proceedings is the controlling ruling in the matter.\n\nThat written order contained no such language about the planes and instead just said the administration was enjoined from removing the migrants subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation invoking the law while the judge\u2019s temporary restraining orders remained in effect.\n\n\u201cI leave the merits of that argument for the district court to resolve in the first instance,\u201d Millett wrote. \u201cBut the one thing that is not tolerable is for the government to seek from this court a stay of an order that the government at the very same time is telling the district court is not an order with which compliance was ever required.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeads the government wins, tails the district court loses is no way to obtain the exceptional relief of a TRO stay,\u201d she added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s John Fritze contributed to this report."

Photo: Angelina Katsanis/POLITICO/AP Photo\n\nJust when you thought jingoistic gestures couldn\u2019t get much dumber than Trump\u2019s designs on Canada and Greenland, Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert outdid her idol by suggesting that plans are underway to rename the District of Columbia \u201cthe District of America.\u201d\n\nBoebert was annoyed at Democrats for mocking Trump\u2019s determination to rename the international body of water known as the \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d for 400 years as the Gulf of America, as the Hill reported:\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) urged lawmakers to stop making fun of President Trump\u2019s decision to rename the Gulf of America, suggesting the nation\u2019s capital could undergo the same change.\n\n\u201cI would caution my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to refrain from making jokes about the Gulf of America because next up may be the District of America that we are working on,\u201d Boebert said during a Tuesday hearing for the House Natural Resources Committee.\n\nPerhaps this was an idle threat. But then again, MAGA interest in remaking the nation\u2019s capital is well established, as Trump himself noted during his recent address to Department of Justice employees:\n\nWe\u2019re cleaning up this great capital, and we\u2019re not going to have crime and we\u2019re not going to stand for crime, and we\u2019re going to take the graffiti down and we\u2019re already taken to tents down there. \u2026 We\u2019re working with the administration, and if the administration can\u2019t do the job \u2026 we\u2019re gonna have to take it back and run it through the federal government.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, exactly what problem Boebert and other Trump loyalists might have with the old name of the capital, first established as the \u201cTerritory of Columbia\u201d by George Washington\u2019s own handpicked commissioners. \u201cColumbia\u201d had already become a female symbol of the country, a predecessor to \u201cLady Liberty\u201d and a ubiquitous presence in the patriotic literature of the 19th century.\n\nIllustration: Frances Adams Halsted and V. Aderente/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe Columbia name was derived, of course, from Christopher Columbus, thought at the time to be the discoverer of America. Perhaps Boebert has \u201cwoke\u201d concerns about Columbus\u2019s murderous treatment of the Indigenous Americans he encountered? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nIt is interesting, however, that Boebert\u2019s big idea was articulated at a hearing over legislation sponsored by her frenemy Marjorie Taylor Greene to codify in law Trump\u2019s Gulf of America executive order (originally introduced even before the 47th president took office). Greene once famously referred to her former friend and ideological colleague Boebert as \u201ca little bitch\u201d for horning in on her legislative plans. So perhaps the Coloradan is returning the favor by one-upping her on renaming places. Come to think of it, \u201cColorado\u201d sounds as foreign as \u201cMexico.\u201d Maybe Trumpiana or Magarado would work better? Don\u2019t laugh \u2026"

            "full_content": "Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a surprise that it\u2019s taken Donald Trump over two months in office to extend his broad-based campaign of presidential power grabs into the familiar area of election administration. After all, the claim that Democrats have systematically rigged elections is one of the great foundational myths of the MAGA movement, speciously refuting any electoral setback Trump or his minions might experience and providing a sinister rationale for the supposed \u201copen borders\u201d policies of the Biden administration (you know, the really stupid but persistent belief that migrants were being herded across the border by Democrats and then immediately registered to vote).\n\nAs it happens, Trump\u2019s 96th executive order of 2025 finally addressed the bugaboo of phantom election fraud and arrogated to the president powers held jointly by the states (which operate federal elections) and by Congress (which has explicit constitutional powers to regulate federal elections). Congress has in turn delegated some of its regulatory functions to an independent bipartisan agency it created after the 2000 presidential-election fiasco, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which helps states purchase election technology and also provides a form that can be used anywhere in the country to register for federal elections. The president\u2019s powers in this area have traditionally been understood as strictly limited to enforcing congressional voting-rights statutes and basic constitutional rights that touch on the right to vote.\n\nNone of this precedent deterred Trump. He\u2019s ordering the EAC to begin pushing for (and reflecting in its own voter-registration system) documentary verification of citizenship, and he\u2019s enlisting federal agencies (including, rather ominously, DOGE) in policing voter rolls to expose and prohibit alleged noncitizen voting. In effect, this is an imposition by executive action of the SAVE Act that Trump and congressional Republicans pushed last year to dramatize their entirely undocumented contention that noncitizen voting was widespread. But while the evil it purports to address appears to be imaginary (or so limited as to be insignificant in the outcome of actual elections), and the requirement redundant (noncitizen voting is already illegal), the evil it would impose via burdensome paperwork requirements that will keep a lot of older and poorer citizens from exercising their right to vote is very real, as the Center for American Progress explained:\n\n[T]he legislation would require the vast majority of Americans to rely on a passport or birth certificate to prove their citizenship. While this may sound easy for many Americans, the reality is that more than 140 million American citizens do not possess a passport and as many as 69 million women who have taken their spouse\u2019s name do not have a birth certificate matching their legal name.\n\nBecause documentation would need to be presented in person, the legislation would, in practice, prevent Americans from being able to register to vote by mail; end voter registration drives nationwide; and eliminate online voter registration overnight \u2014 a service 42 states rely on. Americans would need to appear in person, with original documentation, to even simply update their voter registration information for a change of address or change in party affiliation.\n\nAs election-law expert Rick Hasen wrote after reviewing the Trump EO: \u201cThe aim here is voter suppression pure and simple.\u201d\n\nBut the order goes further, instructing the Department of Justice to enforce a congressionally established national Election Day by interfering with state mail-ballot systems. 18 states currently allow mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted subsequently (usually by a fixed deadline shortly after Election Day). Trump and other Republicans have regularly claimed without any evidence that post-election receipt of ballots filled out, sealed and mailed by Election Day is inherently fraudulent. Trump\u2019s order itself says: \u201cThis is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd.\u201d It\u2019s not like that at all, since under the systems he is attacking, the voter relinquishes control of the ballot the moment he puts it in the mail or places it in a drop-box. It\u2019s absolutely no different than voting in person before or on Election Day.\n\nTrump\u2019s motive for going after this aspect of state election administration is unclear. It could stem from research evidence that the last-cast mail ballots tend to skew Democratic (the so-called \u201cblue shift\u201d phenomenon). Or it could represent a first step toward Trump\u2019s often-stated intention to return the country to a system of in-person voting on Election Day, period.\n\nAs with so many other executive orders expanding presidential powers into previously unimagined areas of governance, this one will be subjected to judicial scrutiny. But it represents a potentially alarming signal that the administration\u2019s smash-and-grab tactics of doing as much damage as possible before the inevitable voter backlash will eventually give way to measures designed to reduce the odds that voters will have the power to stop it all."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.\n\nEarlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.\n\nWicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, left, and Sen. Jack Reed at a hearing on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, left, and Sen. Jack Reed at a hearing on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nWicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.\n\nSeparately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ordered the administration officials who were part of the Signal chat to preserve all messages exchanged on the platform from March 11 to March 15 \u2014 the time frame during which the app was used to discuss the strikes in Yemen.\n\nThe order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg represented agreement between the Justice Department and American Oversight, a watchdog group that had sued and claimed officials failed to follow federal recordkeeping laws. Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a declaration from a top lawyer at the Treasury Department who said the messages had been preserved.\n\n\"We're committed to preserving what the agencies have,\" Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer, told Boasberg.\n\nShe said the department is working with the agencies to determine the records they have and ensure they are maintained as required by law.\n\nThe judge, who has faced attacks by the president over his decision in a separate case, told the parties that the government is \"moving toward implementing what the plaintiffs seek.\"\n\n\"What I see here is a real chance to reach common ground on a number of the issues raised,\" Boasberg said.\n\nThe Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.\n\nWicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.\n\n\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.\n\nThe Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"\n\n\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"\n\nand contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty Images\n\nMike Waltz appeared on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show on Tuesday night to discuss why he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal group text about war plans. It seems the national security adviser\u2019s goal was to declare that he was taking responsibility for the debacle, while actually shifting the blame to the editor of The Atlantic and (even more nonsensically) Democrats and the Biden administration. Instead, Waltz basically delivered a live reenactment of the \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to find the guy who did this\u201d meme, minus the hot-dog costume.\n\nWaltz kicked off the interview by announcing he\u2019s \u201cnot a conspiracy theorist\u201d and immediately floating a vague conspiracy theory about how Goldberg wound up in the chat.\n\n\u201cOf all the people out there, somehow this guy who has lied about the president, who has lied to Gold Star families, lied to their attorneys and gone to Russia hoax, gone to all kinds of lengths to lie and smear the president of the United States, and he\u2019s the one that somehow gets on somebody\u2019s contact and then gets sucked into your group?\u201d Waltz said.\n\nLaura Ingraham: \"How did a Trump-hating editor of The Atlantic end up on your Signal chat?\"\n\n\n\nMike Waltz: \"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but of all the people out there, somehow this guy...he's the one that somehow gets on somebody's contact and then gets sucked into the group? pic.twitter.com/TP6HXTWPtQ \u2014 The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) March 25, 2025\n\nSo, Ingraham asked, was Waltz suggesting someone on his team added Goldberg?\n\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, yes. We\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it. We have \u2014 I just talked to Elon on the way here. We\u2019ve got the best technical minds looking at how this happened.\u201d\n\nA moment later, Elon Musk\u2019s crack team of investigators got a huge lead when Waltz conceded that he\u2019s the guy who added the journalist to the chat.\n\n\u201cLook, a staffer wasn\u2019t responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cI take full responsibility. I built the group and my job is to make sure everything is coordinated.\u201d\n\nSo Waltz was communicating with Goldberg and accidentally added him to the group text, just as we all suspected? If only it were that simple!\n\n\u201cI can tell you for 100 percent, I don\u2019t know this guy,\u201d Waltz said. \u201cI know him by his horrible reputation, and he really is the bottom scum of journalists, and I know him in the sense that he hates the president. But I don\u2019t text him, he wasn\u2019t on my phone, and we\u2019re going to figure out how this happened.\u201d\n\nMike Waltz on the Signal chat leak:\n\n\n\n\u201cI just talked to @elonmusk... we\u2019ve got the best technical minds looking at how this happened. I don\u2019t know this guy\u2014he\u2019s the bottom scum of journalists.\u201d pic.twitter.com/1TqToWQOZZ \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 25, 2025\n\nThe national security adviser then fleshed out his conspiracy theory, suggesting that Goldberg might have catfished him, on the off chance that Waltz would invite him to a high-level text thread about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\n\u201cHave you ever had somebody\u2019s contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else\u2019s number there?\u201d he asked Ingraham. \u201cSo of course I didn\u2019t see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else. Now whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical means is something we\u2019re trying to figure out.\u201d\n\nSo who broached U. S. national security via a duplicitous contact card? That\u2019s a question for the boys at DOGE, not the national security adviser:\n\nINGRAHAM: But how did it end up in your phone?\n\nWALTZ: Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out.\n\nINGRAHAM: But, that\u2019s a pretty big problem \u2026 that\u2019s disturbing.\n\nWALTZ: That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got the best technical minds, right?\n\nFinally, Ingraham \u2014 who asked surprisingly tough questions for a woman who recently nodded along as Donald Trump claimed gold paint doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 pressed Waltz again on whether he knows Goldberg.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Waltz said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup. I do now. Knew him by reputation for lying about the president over and over and over again. What I can tell you for certain \u2014 certainly wasn\u2019t reaching out or talking to him at all. Why would I?\u201d\n\nThen Waltz called Goldberg \u201cvile,\u201d accusing him once again of being a rampant liar.\n\nWaltz asks you this: What kind of person would publicly lie to the American people? Think about that for one second.\n\nMichael Waltz claimed that he\u2019s \u201cnever met, don\u2019t know, never communicated with\u201d Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a photo of Waltz standing next to Goldberg during a 2021 event at the French Embassy.\n\n\n\nThe event Waltz attended\u2014a Q&A with a French filmmaker\u2014was moderated by Goldberg. pic.twitter.com/eTqOY7xnTl \u2014 Anna Bower (@AnnaBower) March 26, 2025\n\nHere\u2019s Waltz\u2019s full interview with Ingraham:"

Eight blue states sued and a federal judge in Boston issued an order temporarily blocking the administration from freezing the funding. A federal appeals court declined to overturn that order.\n\nThe administration, in its request for an emergency intervention, claimed that it was ending the funding to the states\u2019 programs as part of Trump\u2019s crackdown on DEI initiatives. Officials sent a brief form notice to the grant awardees and did not provide specific evidence that their programs were engaged in any DEI practices.\n\nThe case is the latest where judges have reversed Trump moves to withhold federal funding already promised to various grant programs. It is also one of several lawsuits touching on the president\u2019s anti-DEI gambits. The federal district court has set a hearing in the case for Friday.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency appeals rising from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, ordered the states that sued to response by Friday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "John Lindsay campaigning in the Bronx in 1965. Photo: James Hughes/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\nDuring a raucous city-election season 60 years ago, nearly everybody in New York agreed on two things: The city was going to hell in a handbasket, and something needed to be done about it. \u201cI\u2019m running a campaign that calls for change because change is needed,\u201d liberal Republican congressman John Lindsay thundered in a debate against his Democratic opponent, comptroller Abe Beame. \u201cThere is one murder in this city every 14 hours, one rape every six hours, one theft every three minutes \u2026 100,000 middle-income families have left New York City, 18,000 jobs a year. The city is near bankruptcy. There is no long-range fiscal planning and no program planning. And the administration of which Mr. Beame has been part and parcel has to shoulder the responsibility for this.\u201d\n\nIt was true. Before becoming comptroller, Beame had been a top finance official in the three-term Democratic mayoralty of Robert Wagner, which had run its course and done little to tame, trim or transform a sprawling, sluggish, patronage-infested municipal bureaucracy. A third candidate in the race, conservative William F. Buckley, dubbed Lindsay a \u201cflamboyant idealist\u201d as a put-down, but Lindsay won by promising to apply strong medicine to agencies that clearly needed to be merged, eliminated, or overhauled. As columnist Murray Kempton put it, \u201cHe is fresh and everyone else is tired.\u201d\n\nNew Yorkers picked the tall, good-looking WASP from the East Side and assigned him the mission of curing not just the visible and all-too-familiar urban problems of poverty, discrimination, troubled schools, and violent crime. Voters had also lost faith in the ability of political leaders and a sluggish, unresponsive bureaucracy to turn things around. A major, multipart investigative series on the city\u2019s problems by the Herald-Tribune newspaper in 1965 opened with the memorable words: \u201cNew York is the greatest city in the world \u2014 and everything is wrong with it.\u201d\n\nIn New York\u2019s list of memorable, clearly consequential mayors like La Guardia, Koch, and Bloomberg, Lindsay is often given short shrift. Aside from a loop in Central Park and the newly refurbished East River Park, no major public buildings, parks, or structures bear the name of the mayor who brought New York air-conditioned subways; created the nation\u2019s first 9-1-1 emergency call system; and signed the Rent Stabilization Act, which remains the city\u2019s most important affordable-housing measure to this day. Those of us who lived in the city at the time are more likely to associate Lindsay with the many labor strikes and street riots that happened on his watch, along with a notoriously botched response to a blizzard in 1966 that left 42 people dead.\n\nBut Lindsay\u2019s two tumultuous terms provide important lessons for this year\u2019s crop of City Hall hopefuls in how to attack, and perhaps even slay, the stubborn dragons that are once again threatening to devour Gotham. (My three-part documentary series and panel discussion about the Lindsay years are online at You Decide, my podcast).\n\nThe first and most important lesson: Think big and swing for the fences. Shortly after his inauguration, Lindsay decreed the city\u2019s bureaucracy a \u201cpile of old rusty junk\u201d and moved to consolidate 50 agencies into ten \u201csuperagencies,\u201d forcing mergers by executive order when the City Council refused to go along. He created the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the Health and Hospitals Corporation and the nation\u2019s first municipal Department of Environmental Protection and successfully pushed for the merger of the New York City Transit Authority with the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority to create the modern MTA. Importantly, Lindsay also established the 59 community planning boards that give citizens a voice in how development takes place as an alternative to the political clubhouses that controlled many neighborhoods.\n\nNot every Lindsay reorganization was successful \u2014 a poorly conceived effort to simultaneously decentralize and desegregate city schools led to a paralyzing teachers\u2019 strike \u2014 but today\u2019s mayoral candidates should emulate Lindsay\u2019s creativity and willingness to redraw the city\u2019s org chart when necessary. Should the Department of Correction be merged with Probation? Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg temporarily had both departments run by a single commissioner; perhaps the move should be permanent. Should the Rikers Island jail complex be placed under control of a federal court monitor? Mayor Adams fought against the takeover at every turn, even as the number of suicides, overdoses, and other deaths of people in custody on his watch has climbed to 37.\n\nDo we need a separate, specialized agency tasked solely with addressing the complex needs of seriously mentally ill New Yorkers? And what about the idea, recently floated by Vital City, of empowering a single agency \u2014 not necessarily the NYPD \u2014 to be in charge of subway safety? If things in New York are as bad as today\u2019s candidates keep telling us they are, they should be thinking in big, broad strokes, not just doing a little tinkering here and there.\n\nThe other big Lindsay lesson is his ability to attract and inspire men and women of extraordinary talents, many of them dubbed \u201cwhiz kids,\u201d in their 20s and early 30s, whom the 44-year-old mayor entrusted with enormous power and responsibility.\n\nSeveral of these well-chosen aides went on to extraordinary careers as elected officials, including H. Carl McCall (state senator and state comptroller); Ronnie Eldrige (City Council); Elizabeth Holtzman (congress, district attorney and city comptroller); and Lindsay\u2019s human-rights commissioner, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has been the elected delegate to Congress from Washington, D.C., since 1991. Many of the whiz kids went on to run major institutions: Lindsay\u2019s chief of staff, Peter Goldmark, became the president of the Rockefeller Foundation and executive director of the Port Authority; another chief of staff, Steve Isenberg, became chairman of Newsday; press secretary Bob Laird became op-ed editor of the Daily News; and First Deputy Mayor Dick Aurelio launched NY1, the nation\u2019s first 24-hour all-news cable channel. Jay Kriegel and Sid Davidoff became the kind of behind-the-scenes fixers who spent decades nurturing, connecting, and representing all manner of public and private institutions.\n\nLindsay\u2019s bench wasn\u2019t just built on luck or Ivy-League personal connections. According to Goldmark, top hires went through an exhaustive gauntlet of interviews and background checks to assess who was hungry, smart, honest, and willing to work long hours, a process he learned from Fred Hayes, a budget expert Lindsay poached from the Johnson administration.\n\n\u201cIt was fun to be with them because they were energetic and they had a lot of ideas, and they were doing things and they loved their work,\u201d Holtzman told me. \u201cThey admired the mayor, and they all thought they were doing God\u2019s work in the city\u201d\n\n\u201cI think all of us must have felt at some point some nagging feelings that maybe we weren\u2019t old enough, wide enough, broad enough, deep enough. But hell, we were in it. We were going to give it all we got, and he trusted us,\u201d Isenberg later recalled. \u201cYou went to work every day with the most wonderful illusion you can ever have: That you could make a difference for the city.\u201d\n\nThat kind of energy, idealism, and reform spirit has been lacking in the Democratic primary campaign so far. But with just under 90 days to go, it\u2019s not too late for us all to demand that the candidates talk about major structural changes rather than small adjustments and that they promise to find the very best people to run the city\u2019s agencies and turn them loose to do God\u2019s work in a city that, 60 years after Lindsay, is in crisis once again."

The magazine redacted only the name of a CIA operative named in the text chain by CIA director John Ratcliffe. In the texts, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the series of events with specific time stamps and descriptions of the fighter jets that would be used in the operation:\n\n\u201cTEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.\n\n1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)\n\n1345: \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)\n\n1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)\n\n1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 targets)\n\n1536: F-18 2nd Strike Starts \u2013 also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.\n\nMORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)\n\nWe are currently clean on OPSEC\n\nGodspeed to our Warriors.\n\nThe planned attack commenced shortly after the messages were sent. Despite the staggering level of detail reportedly shared by Hegseth, the White House landed on a new target for its spin: The Atlantic\u2019s headline. Rather than address the content of the Hegseth text, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to the publication\u2019s use of the term attack plans in its latest report, suggesting it was walking back its earlier contention that officials shared \u201cwar plans\u201d in the group chat.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT \u2018war plans.\u2019 This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\u201d she said on social media.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who Goldberg says invited him to the Signal chat, echoed Leavitt\u2019s words in his own post. \u201cNo locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.\u201d\n\nHegseth also blasted The Atlantic\u2019s report, suggesting that the publication\u2019s reveal was far less damning than it claimed:\n\nSo, let\u2019s me get this straight. The Atlantic released the so-called \u201cwar plans\u201d and those \u201cplans\u201d include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information.\n\n\n\nThose are some really shitty war plans.\n\n\n\nThis only proves\u2026 \u2014 Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) March 26, 2025\n\nThe published text seems to conflict with the congressional testimony of top Trump national security officials who asserted under oath that specific details of the military operation weren\u2019t shared. During an exchange with Arizona senator Mark Kelly, Gabbard was asked if there was any mention of any weapon or weapon system being used in the operation in the chat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall specific names of systems or weapons being used,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s publication of the text has prompted calls for Hegseth\u2019s resignation from congressional Democrats. Kelly, a Navy combat veteran and former astronaut, said Hegseth should step down, writing, \u201cThe Signal incident is what happens when you have the most unqualified Secretary of Defense we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Pat Ryan, a New York congressman who served as an Army intelligence officer, said the details that the Defense Secretary shared would\u2019ve clearly been considered classified information. \u201cHegseth is blatantly lying (or is somehow even more clueless & incompetent than we all thought). He must resign, IMMEDIATELY. And should lawyer up,\u201d he wrote on social media.\n\nThe Signal group chat is set to receive even more scrutiny. Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, told reporters Wednesday that the panel will be asking the Trump administration to expedite an inspector general investigation into the text messages."

            "full_content": "Summary The Supreme Court upheld Biden-era regulations requiring background checks and serial numbers for ghost gun kits.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the 7-2 majority opinion that included both liberal and conservative justices.\n\nPolice submissions of ghost guns recovered at crime scenes for tracing increased from 1,600 in 2017 to 19,000 by 2021.\n\nGorsuch noted technologies like 3D printing have dramatically changed how guns are made and sold.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas dissented, arguing the law should be read more narrowly regarding weapon-parts kits.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld Biden-era federal regulations on \u201cghost guns,\u201d mail-order kits that allow people to build untraceable weapons at home \u2013 handing gun control groups a rare win at the conservative high court.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority that included both liberal and conservative justices in one of the most closely watched Supreme Court cases of the year.\n\n\u201cPerhaps a half hour of work is required before anyone can fire a shot,\u201d Gorsuch wrote. \u201cBut even as sold, the kit comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious. Really, the kit\u2019s name says it all: \u2018Buy Build Shoot.\u2019\n\nIndividuals who had purchased the weapons and several manufacturers challenged regulations created by the Biden administration in 2022 that require ghost gun makers to include serial numbers on the kits and perform background checks on people who purchase them.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives created the new regulations as police say the untraceable weapons are turning up much more frequently at crime scenes. In 2017, police submitted about 1,600 ghost guns recovered at crime scenes for tracing. Four years later, the number had grown to more than 19,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration will handle the issue going forward. Trump signed an order on February 7 requiring the Attorney General to review gun regulations imposed during the Biden administration.\n\nGorsuch cites technological advances\n\nGorsuch noted in his opinion that the way Americans think about guns has changed dramatically since 1968 when Congress approved the Gun Control Act.\n\n\u201cRecent years, however, have witnessed profound changes in how guns are made and sold,\u201d Gorsuch wrote.\n\nIn 1968, the milling equipment and materials needed to make a gun at home were far too expensive for most individuals.\n\n\u201cWith the introduction of new technologies like 3D printing and reinforced polymers, that is no longer true,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cToday, companies are able to make and sell weapon parts kits that individuals can assemble into functional firearms in their own homes.\u201d\n\nMajority has moved to the right on gun laws\n\nAsked for comment on the decision, a Justice Department spokesperson said the administration would \u201ccontinue to support and defend the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court case didn\u2019t involve the Second Amendment, though, and the Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a question about whether the Trump administration stands by the ATF regulation.\n\nThough not a Second Amendment dispute, the case put guns on the high court\u2019s docket at a time when its 6-3 conservative majority has tacked to the right on gun laws.\n\nLast year, the conservative justices court struck down a ban on bump stocks, devices that convert semi-automatic rifles into a weapons that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute, for instance.\n\nBut there had been signs that some members of the court\u2019s conservative majority saw this case differently than the one dealing with bump stocks. Even before the arguments were heard, the justices had hinted their thoughts by siding with the Biden administration on its emergency docket. On a 5-4 vote, the court allowed the regulation to remain in place while the litigation continued.\n\nThe 1968 law requires manufacturers and dealers to run background checks, keep sales records and include serial numbers on firearms. The ATF concluded during the Biden administration that the law covers the kits, which the agency said can quickly be built into functioning firearms. The rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of the kits but instead requires serial numbers and background checks on purchasers.\n\nGhost guns are kits that a user can purchase online to assemble a fully functional firearm at home. Critics say they are attractive to people who are otherwise prohibited from buying firearms because of the lack of requirement for background checks and serial numbers.\n\n\u201cGhost guns are the gun industry\u2019s way of skirting commonsense gun laws and arming dangerous people without background checks,\u201d said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center. \u201cWe are thrilled that the Supreme Court has upheld the ATF rule that treats ghost guns as what they are: guns.\u201d\n\nIn his dissent Wednesday, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the majority \u201cblesses the Government\u2019s overreach.\u201d Thomas said he reads the federal law at issue in a much narrower way that does not cover \u201cthe unfinished frames and receivers contained in weapon-parts kits.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one. But, it did not. I would adhere to the words Congress enacted,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nThe Firearms Policy Coalition, one of the gun rights groups that challenged the ATF rule, said it was disappointed with the court\u2019s \u201cmisguided decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is only one battle in a multi-generational war over the scope of government and pre-existing right to keep and bear arms,\u201d the group said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe Supreme Court cynically built up a falsework to shore up the ATF\u2019s improper rule in spite of the text and history of the statutes.\u201d\n\nDuring oral arguments in October, several of the court\u2019s conservatives and all of its liberals appeared skeptical of the notion that the kits were geared toward a tradition of gunsmithing hobbyists. Chief Justice John Roberts, in particular, brushed off the idea that building the kind of gun kits at issue was equivalent to someone working on a classic car. In other words, he seemed to say, the kits aren\u2019t designed with hobbyists in mind.\n\n\u201cDrilling a hole or two, I would think, doesn\u2019t give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends,\u201d Roberts said to the lawyer representing the kit manufacturers. \u201cMy understanding is that it\u2019s not terribly difficult for someone to do this.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy groups and five companies that manufacture the kits sued, arguing that the regulation wasn\u2019t permitted by the law. The kits aren\u2019t weapons, they said, but rather parts. A US district court in Texas threw out the rule and the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nThe information Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat of top Trump national security officials was highly classified at the time he wrote it, especially because the operation had not even started yet, according to a US defense official familiar with the operation and another source who was briefed on it afterward.\n\nThe updates Hegseth was giving in the Signal chat were the kind of real-time play-by-play that a commander would be giving to the president in a highly classified setting as the operation unfolded.\n\n\u201cThese are operational plans that are highly classified in order to protect the service members,\u201d the defense official said.\n\nA third source familiar with the matter said they saw documents sent within the Pentagon about the operation, which were marked classified and included the same information Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat about specific weapons platforms and timing.\n\n\u201cIt was classified when it was shared below the principal level,\u201d this person said.\n\nThe Atlantic on Wednesday published additional text messages from the Signal group chat, underscoring a massive breach in operational security as specific sensitive information about the Houthi attack was shared in the chat before it was carried out.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his team have repeatedly sought to downplay the sensitivity of the information shared in the Signal group in the aftermath of The Atlantic\u2019s bombshell story on Monday. While they denied there was a \u201cwar plan\u201d shared, the text messages published Wednesday offer an extremely detailed description of the coming strike, including the airplanes and drones used.\n\n\u201cIt is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court martialed for this,\u201d the defense official added. \u201cWe don\u2019t provide that level of information on unclassified systems, in order to protect the lives and safety of the servicemembers carrying out these strikes. If we did, it would be wholly irresponsible. My most junior analysts know not to do this.\u201d\n\nA former senior US military commander said the information shared would allow adversaries to evacuate targeted areas ranging from command and control centers, to communication sites and firing positions. Moreover, it would allow them to mass anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons to overwhelm US pilots.\n\n\u201cUntil the strike goes it\u2019s absolutely classified as the lives of our pilots depend on secrecy,\u201d the former commander said.\n\nThe messages also rebut the claim from Hegseth and other Trump administration officials that war plans were not discussed on the chain. In a message sent at 11:44 a.m. ET and published by The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg and Shane Harris, Hegseth shares operational details about the strikes: \u201cWeather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,\u201d Hegseth wrote.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said on Wednesday that he and the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Jack Reed, are formally asking the administration for an Inspector General report on the Signal chat for the committee to review and a classified briefing from a senior official.\n\nWicker said the information in the chat was \u201cof such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\u201d\n\nTop US officials have said the information shared in the text messages was not classified.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe, who was one of the participants in the group chat, acknowledged on Tuesday that \u201cpre-decisional strike deliberation should be conducted through classified channels.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesman Sean Parnell acknowledged on Wednesday that Hegseth shared information on the US military\u2019s strikes on Yemen while the operation was underway.\n\n\u201cThese additional Signal chat messages confirm there were no classified materials or war plans shared. The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway and had already been briefed through official channels. The American people see through the Atlantic\u2019s pathetic attempts to distract from President Trump\u2019s national security agenda,\u201d Parnell said in a statement.\n\nDetailed plans shared\n\nHegseth goes on to share the plans in extraordinary detail, according to The Atlantic:\n\n1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)\u201d\n\n\u201c1345: \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)\u201d\n\n\u201c1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)\u201d\n\n\u201c1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier \u2018Trigger Based\u2019 targets)\u201d\n\n\u201c1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts \u2013 also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.\u201d\n\nThat information, according to The Atlantic, was received \u201ctwo hours before the scheduled start of the bombing of Houthi positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this information \u2014 particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen \u2014 had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face,\u201d Goldberg and Harris wrote.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz later texted to confirm that the target was in a building that collapsed and the strike was successful.\n\n\u201cThe first target \u2013 their top missile guy \u2013 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend\u2019s building and it\u2019s now collapsed,\u201d Waltz wrote at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nAnd later in the day, Hegseth confirmed to the group that more strikes were coming.\n\n\u201cGreat job all. More strikes ongoing for hours tonight, and will provide full initial report tomorrow. But on time, on target, and good readouts so far,\u201d he said.\n\nThe release of the messages appeared to undercut Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s testimony on Tuesday, where she said it was to her knowledge that weapons packages, targets and timing weren\u2019t part of the conversations in the Signal chat.\n\nGabbard on Wednesday doubled down on the administration\u2019s insistence that no classified information was shared in the now-infamous chat.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the president, National Security Advisor stated, no classified information was shared,\u201d Gabbard told the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cThere were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared. This was a standard update to the national security cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region.\u201d\n\nShe also said Hegseth was ultimately responsible for deciding what in that conversation should or should not have been classified: \u201cUltimately, the Secretary of Defense holds the authority to classify or declassify.\u201d\n\nGoldberg said on Wednesday the magazine decided to redact a sensitive piece of information out of their follow-up article.\n\n\u201cWe did redact one piece of information because we felt, on our own, that we felt it was best to do. And the CIA asked us, but, you know, at a certain point, the administration is saying that there\u2019s nothing classified or secret or sensitive in these so at a certain point, I just felt, you know, let our readers decide for themselves,\u201d he said on MSNBC of the decision to publish the rest of the information.\n\nTrump and White House downplay sensitivity\n\nTrump distanced himself from the Signal chat when asked Wednesday afternoon if he still believes that the information shared was not classified, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure, you have to ask the various people involved,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump also said Waltz had assumed responsibility for the error, but he shrugged off any culpability on the part of Hegseth, who sent the timeline of the planned attack before it was underway.\n\n\u201cHow do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,\u201d Trump said, sounding surprised a reporter would raise the issue. Earlier, the White House said Trump had looked at Hegseth\u2019s messages that were included in the text chain published by The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a witch-hunt,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMoments after The Atlantic published the text messages, the White House continued to push back and seek to discredit Goldberg\u2019s reporting, though the National Security Council has verified the authenticity of the text thread.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT \u2018war plans.\u2019 This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post to social media.\n\nLeavitt is also pushing back against concerns that Steve Witkoff, the president\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, who was on the group chat, was receiving the texts while in Moscow. Witkoff, she said, \u201cwas provided a secure line of communication by the U.S. Government, and it was the only phone he had in his possession while in Moscow,\u201d going on to shift blame to the media.\n\nGoldberg criticized Leavitt\u2019s response to the news during his MSNBC appearance and said \u201cshe\u2019s just playing some sort of weird semantic game.\u201d\n\nCNN military analyst retired Col. Cedric Leighton said the details have \u201call the elements of a war plan, and what that means is, all of these elements mean that this stuff is classified. Full stop. There is no question this is classified.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto, Michael Williams, Morgan Rimmer, Ted Barrett and Kit Maher contributed reporting."

And when it emerged that Joe Biden kept classified documents at his private home and office, DoJ (under Biden himself) appointed a special counsel who concluded Biden had \u201cwillfully retained and disclosed classified materials\u201d but, on balance, should not be charged.\n\nYet when our nation\u2019s top defense and national security officials group-chatted in the widely available Signal app about the operational details of an imminent military strike in plain view of a national journalist? Nothing.\n\nThis will be the new normal. Under the halting, distracted leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Justice Department has made no mention thus far of the Signal scandal, which dominated headlines all week. It\u2019s certain that Bondi and everyone else in DoJ leadership knows what happened. Yet I feel confident predicting that the Justice Department won\u2019t lift a finger to investigate this mess.\n\nEven now, at the start of this story, the end is already plain. Nobody\u2019s getting indicted or even meaningfully investigated by the Justice Department. There\u2019s my bold prediction. If I\u2019m wrong \u2014 if DoJ does open up an actual criminal investigation here (ass-covering window dressing doesn\u2019t count) \u2014 then throw this article back in my face and have a laugh.\n\nI\u2019m not going to be that former-prosecutor guy who reads a couple of stories in the press and declares definitively that it\u2019s the crime of the century and we need immediate indictments. Typically, as here, when a story breaks, we know some key facts but don\u2019t yet have all the necessary details. And real-world prosecution is more complex than a simple paint-by-numbers approach in which we tick off the legal elements and declare the case proved. Prosecutors need to exercise discretion beyond the technical requirements and to consider the practical prospects and impact of a criminal charge.\n\nSo it\u2019s a bit much to declare right now that people ought to be indicted. But there\u2019s more than enough in the public record to justify \u2014 to require, even \u2014 the opening of a criminal investigation to dig down and gather the necessary facts.\n\nWe know Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally invited to join a high-level Signal group chat between the vice-president, the Defense secretary, the secretary of State, the national security adviser, and others about sensitive military and national security operations. Based on Goldberg\u2019s reporting alone, prosecutors should consider the federal law that criminalizes mishandling of sensitive government information.\n\nThat law gives us three primary elements that must be proved to support a criminal charge.\n\nFirst, the information must \u201crelat[e] to the national defense.\u201d Goldberg is careful in his article not to disclose sensitive operational details, but he reveals that the Signal text chain contained information about planning for a then-imminent military attack on the Houthi militia in Yemen. After the story broke, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sputtered furiously that he had not texted \u201cwar plans\u201d to anybody, but that clever (if not very smart) attempt at wordplay fails on its face. Hegseth is either outright lying \u2014 the National Security Council has confirmed the authenticity of the texts reported in Goldberg\u2019s article \u2014 or he\u2019s playing a lawyerly game in which he secretly assigns some highly specific, inapplicable definition to a term (war plans) and then maintains that whatever happened doesn\u2019t meet his special criteria for it. (Perhaps in his view it\u2019s not a \u201cwar plan\u201d without a declared war. Who knows?) The fact is the texts related in detail to the targets, weapons, and sequencing of a military strike \u2014 which eventually happened precisely as the participants had discussed it. We can check this box easily.\n\nSecond, the information must have been \u201cremoved from its proper place of custody.\u201d Again, this looks straightforward. A Signal group text (with a journalist attached) is plainly not the \u201cproper place of custody\u201d for any classified information, never mind for specific military attack plans. I recently connected with an 82-year-old on a work project; when I asked how he would like to stay in touch, he casually replied, \u201cOh, just text me on Signal.\u201d This isn\u2019t exactly ironclad legal canon, but generally speaking, if an 82-year-old and I (who, for years, would find the CNN webpage by Googling \u201cCNN\u201d and then clicking the top search result) are using Signal to chat, then it\u2019s not sufficiently secure for the highest levels of the U.S. military and national security apparatus.\n\nThe third requirement is the trickiest: that a person acted with \u201cgross negligence.\u201d Most criminal statutes require some level of intentionality, but this is the rare federal law that creates a crime based on, essentially, outrageous sloppiness. Here\u2019s where we need more information: How did the Signal text chain start? For how long was it operational? Were the participants using government-issued or private phones? Did anybody express misgivings about the security risk, or was anybody so warned? Why did the participants choose to communicate through the same means as a pack of old college buddies in a fantasy-football league?\n\nThe reality is we\u2019ll likely never learn the answers to these key questions. Or more precisely, DoJ will never learn. I expect journalists will continue to pursue the story and develop even more information. It\u2019s a perfect see-no-evil approach for Bondi and her brass. If they never open a case and never take a look, they\u2019ll never have all the facts needed to make a potentially difficult prosecutorial call. Blissful ignorance can have its virtues in regular life, but it\u2019s not an ideal touchstone for the United States Department of Justice.\n\nBondi is to be forgiven here because heaven knows her attention has been focused on other pressing matters of state: releasing binders full of pointless documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein; pursuing law firms that have the gall to represent interests the president finds \u201cvexatious\u201d; publicly fawning over Elon Musk and DOGE and vowing to chase their tormentors to the ends of the earth; throwing out the Eric Adams indictment because he has promised to be a good, compliant mayor; and hosting pep rallies at which the president casually refers to prosecutors as \u201chorrible people,\u201d \u201cscum,\u201d \u201cderanged,\u201d and \u201cthugs.\u201d How can one attorney general manage all that and still have time to assign a pressing national security investigation to the Justice Department\u2019s own National Security Division?\n\nSo whether or not anyone in the Signal group-chat crew ought to be indicted, I can say this much without hesitation: Somebody needs to take a look. And I can say this even more confidently: Nobody will."

There are the emojis \u2014 fist, flag, flame \u2014 celebrating the first strikes in Yemen outlined earlier in the conversation. There is the Reuters photo of a girl in Saada allegedly injured in the strikes, which targeted Houthi leaders across Yemen but which officials claim killed civilians, too. Emoji, airstrike.\n\nAnd there are faces craned over phones, gently illuminated, while thumbs tap away, hashing out the cases for and against a life-and-death bombing campaign, a situation room reduced to the size of a chat window. J.D. Vance making a J.D. Vance face at his screen as he types, tagging Pete Hegseth, \u201cif you think we should do it let\u2019s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.\u201d Pete Hegseth in phone-mantis posture considering how to respond before settling on \u201cI fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It\u2019s PATHETIC,\u201d then spamming everyone with official-sounding logs about OPSEC. Maybe between messages they yank their X feeds for a fresh batch of notifications, start crafting their next tweets, or Google their own names. At some point, their phones go back into their pockets. In a narrow but undeniable way, the government is a bunch of people in a group chat now, just like everything else.\n\nPeace Through Strength, every single day. pic.twitter.com/3HmVZv2HSb \u2014 Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) March 15, 2025\n\nChatting is as old as networked computing, but the total dominance of the group text is a product of the smartphone era. In 2009, WhatsApp was a cheaper alternative to SMS; by 2014, it was worth $16 billion to Facebook. Now, the chat, rather than the feed, is the standard structure of internet sociality. In the mid-aughts, work-chat platforms like Campfire were a niche product for software developers and early remote workers. Today, hundreds of millions of people work, and modulate their performance of work, in chat windows. Bartenders are being asked to keep up with their Slack messages. A lot of cultural and media phenomena are chat stories in disguise, smuggling side channels that are sometimes more significant than their subjects: Streaming is chat; podcasts can be chat; Substack is sort of chat; \u201cinfluencers\u201d are chat; porn is chat; \u201cReddit is back\u201d is also a story about Discord. Zoomers chat one way while boomers WhatsApp another. The tech industry\u2019s next big thing is automated chat.\n\nThe rise of chat \u2014 and, specifically, the group chat \u2013 was a ground-up phenomenon. In the context of social media, it was a way to reestablish privacy and control as well as a way to reassert human group dynamics, good and bad, collaborative and exclusionary, but more familiar than algorithmic. In workplaces, it was an obvious, if ultimately sort of complicated, progression from email. That backchannel culture would seep into the broader culture was inevitable. Still, it\u2019s something to behold.\n\nWhat\u2019s somewhat newer is the arrival of the group chat as a site of elite coordination. Once you start looking for it, though, you see it everywhere. Last year, in the New York Times, Sophie Haigney noted their frequent appearances in major news stories, including the Dominion lawsuits in which Fox News hosts talked election denial, the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. More recently, they\u2019ve been implicated in Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s trans purge at the NSA (Gabbard was also a member of \u201cHouthi PC small group\u201d), the successful campaign to punish Columbia student protesters organized in part by influential group-chatting alums, and, more recently, Elon Musk\u2019s government-dismantling task force. According to The Wall Street Journal, an early staffer claimed, \u201cWithin 2 minutes of talking to the final interviewer for DOGE, [I was asked] if I wanted to join. I said \u2018yes.\u2019 Then he said \u2018cool\u2019 and I was in multiple Signal groups.\u201d Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bragged in January that the \u201cDOGE team is using Slack, which is very exciting.\u201d\n\nThe main story here is obviously what Trump officials were talking about (conducting lethal military operations) and how they were talking about it (just as they do in public, with maximum focus on and deference to Trump). But seeing them chat is still wild. It also makes Trump-administration dynamics extremely legible to chat-brained civilians, as John Ganz points out at Unpopular Front. \u201cStephen Miller is the voice of the president in this chat and everyone immediately defers to him,\u201d he writes, while Pete Hegseth is \u201cclearly the least respected member of the chat.\u201d I\u2019d add that Vance \u2014 the person in the group most likely to be simmering in a bunch of weird group chats of his own and probably the only one here to have seen the inside of a Discord channel \u2014 is a recognizable type as well: the tedious and insecure debater that everyone knows how to humor and ignore.\n\nI was admin of this gc. There were no high schoolers lol. Most of the participants were 20-somethings who worked in politics or media and Vance would occasionally pop in to update us on his campaign, thank us for our support, answer questions, or clown one of us, like in the\u2026 \u2014 Michael Foster (@realmfoster) April 4, 2024\n\n2011\u2019s Osama bin Laden Situation Room photo was instantly iconic. But it was also, with a bit of distance, sort of deflating, all the legitimizing ceremony and process of the state, the might of the military, and the dark alluring myths of the special forces rendered as a bunch of officials, including the president, crowded into a too-small room to watch TV. In 2025, we once again encounter the American empire in all its majesty: a bunch of Fox News personalities giving themselves text neck \u2014 and giving one another emoji props \u2014 as they repeat talking points in a group text in front of a bunch of people they secretly hate."

            "full_content": "A year or so before the most recent election of Donald Trump, I read a newly-released book that, while little-noticed upon publication, opened a window on the new era of America politics, outlining virtually every issue that Trump would raise on his march to the presidency while detailing the powerful structural and institutional obstacles he would face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a time of cowardice on racial issues, the book was forthright, noting that America\u2019s black political leadership has been \u201ccourted, coddled and fawned upon by the press as no other assemblage of politicians in history. Even today it is kowtowed to by the Democratic Party in a manner and approaching the servile.\u201d The book attacked the hypocrisy of \u201cupper-middle class bureaucrats and judges\u201d who mouthed politically correct slogans while sending their children to schools far away from minorities.\n\nIt noted the moral bankruptcy of current civil rights leaders and how they advocate for discrimination against whites rather than equal treatment: \u201cEqual rights have been replaced by the demand for equal reward,\u201d the author noted, blasting the left\u2019s misuse of the 14th amendment as \u201cgrounds for upholding executive action discriminating against white males.\u201d\n\nBut the author also understood that the challenges conservatives faced were structural, driven by an iron triangle of media, bureaucracy, and the courts: \u201cMore and more,\u201d the author declared, \u201cwe are governed by an unelected oligarchy of bureaucrats, judges and press guided by their own ideology and insulated from the electorate.\u201d\n\nHe called out the radicalism of the left, blaming their demands for absolute fealty to the party line as \u201cless characteristic of pressure groups in a democracy than of the militant wing of the Chinese Communist party\u201d [during the Cultural Revolution].\n\nAnticipating DOGE, he noted the corruption of the liberal deep state and the malicious motives of its progenitors: \u201cIt was designed that way\u2026 The leviathan welfare state is\u2026 a pyramid to ambition masquerading as altruism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he understood that mass firings were necessary because dismissing a few bureaucrats would not stop systemic resistance to Trump: \u201cbureaucracy [is] crawling with potential martyrs who would salivate over the chance to win prestige, publicity, plaudits and guaranteed careers this most liberal of cities provides automatically to those who managed to get themselves fired for zealotry.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd crucially, the author understood the necessity of wiping out the NGO empire behind much of the corruption, encouraging the business community to \u201cattack the loopholes of the left, [and] the big foundations and to demand and know why it is that corporate taxes are going to subsidize tax free public policy institutes and \u2018public interest law firms\u2019 which use their privileged positions as a base from which to launch assaults on business.\u201d He understood that rather than reflecting the public interest, these firms represented \u201conly their own ideology. They are among the nation's new unelected elite determining the course of this country. . .\u201d\n\nFinally, he called for an assertive foreign policy based on the national interest against the wishes of liberal intellectuals who believe that \u201cregardless of who is elected to office its own perception of what is moral and immoral should prevail over any asserted pragmatic national interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhile clear-eyed about the structural challenges facing any conservative president, the author saw, as Trump sees, the left\u2019s fundamental weakness: \u201ca great gulf in America between the upper middle class progressives and the average citizen,\u201d and he called the leftist establishment \u201csoft at its core. [They are] intellectuals who have no hold on the political allegiance of the working or middle class. Much of the esteem in which academics were once held was erased by their squalid performance when confronted by the militants of the student left in the last decade.\u201d\n\nAnd he understood the necessity, for any right-wing strategy to be successful, of capturing the White House:\n\nonly the president has a podium of sufficient elevation, a microphone of adequate power, to give America's attention on the issues the national press ignores. Only the White House has the discipline and resources to conduct siege warfare against the bureaucracy. Only the president can transform the Supreme Court justices who will slam shut the book belatedly on this unfortunate era of government by decree, and the presidency remains the only repository of national power and authority remotely within the reach of the right.\n\nThe book made clear that success required a candidate to break from party constraints and run on an \u201cindependent conservative ticket for president running free of and against the establishments both national parties. The objective would not only be the capture of the presidency but the realignment of the nation's political parties.\u201d\n\nThe problem with the book, as some readers may have guessed, is not that it was wrong, but that it was far too early. Every passage and phrase quoted above does not actually come from a \u201cnewly-released\u201d book, but from Conservatives Votes, Liberal Victories: Why the Right has Failed, the now largely-forgotten first book written by a then little-known, 36-year-old ex-senior staffer of the Nixon administration, Patrick Buchanan. The book was published 50 years ago, long before Buchanan was a household name, and even longer before he would launch several presidential campaigns that would strike fear in the hearts of the GOP establishment.\n\nReading such an acute diagnosis of our political ailments today from an author writing a half century ago is exhilarating, but also terrifying, because it highlights a few discomfiting facts: First, the problems we face were seen by clear-eyed conservatives such as Buchanan decades ago. Second, we\u2019ve made almost no fundamental progress over the last half century in tackling them. It also makes clear that anyone who is pushing any version of a return to \u201ctraditional conservatism\u201d from the MAGA agenda is at best a dupe of the liberals and at worst a cowardly or malicious actor, willfully ignorant of a half century of political and policy failure, and afraid to take the difficult steps that Buchanan outlined decades ago and that Trump and his team are actually undertaking now.\n\nIn other words, for several decades there were figures on the right who knew what needed to be done. Either we just didn\u2019t listen to them\u2014or those who did lacked the power or the will to turn that knowledge into action.\n\nThat is why President Trump is the perfect actor for this political moment. Because what Trump has in spades is exactly the sort of iron will and unquenchable desire for victory that previous GOP leaders have lacked. That was why the voters chose him.\n\nWhile there are always new insights to be gained as we face new situations, Buchanan\u2019s book shows that what we fundamentally have lacked are not insights but men and women with the courage to put those insights into action. That means we need to make sure the administration selects personnel, nominates judges, and forges alliances with congressional leaders not solely on the basis of their having the boldest and most brilliant ideas (though of course good ideas are important!) but based on their willingness to be maximally disagreeable in the fight against the leftist leviathan\u2014even when the leviathan turns up the heat to uncomfortable levels.\n\nIn our current political moment, the primary value that writers and policy analysts can provide is not some brilliant new intellectual synthesis, but steady and unflinching encouragement that will help fortify the wills of Trump and his administration, and to let them know that when they are being attacked most brutally, that is likely the surest sign they are doing a good job.\n\nBuchanan outlined the problem a half century ago\u2014Trump has arrived to provide our first chance at a real solution.\n\nAs for the rest of us who wish to help him, what is required is not mere cleverness\u2014but something rarer and much more important: courage."

Darrell Issa (R-CA) \u2013 March 29, 2025\n\nThus far, Trump\u2019s administration has been subjected to 15 nationwide injunctions, USA Today reported. Nationwide injunctions were also rampant during Trump\u2019s first term, according to an April 2024 Harvard Law Review article. Of the at least 127 nationwide injunctions issued from 1963 through 2023, 64 came in the first Trump term.\n\nBoyle noted that leftist groups will essentially \u201cshop\u201d for a specific court in hopes of getting a favorable judge and therefore a favorable ruling with a national injunction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way our Founders intended the court system to work,\u201d he told Issa.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Issa responded. \u201cAs a matter of fact, when our founders created in the Constitution the Supreme Court, they let Congress decide how many people would be on that court, and completely allowed us to decide if, in the future, there were going to be additional and lower courts. So although we often call them all Article III courts, the fact is: Only the Supreme Court is a constitutional court. All of the other courts are a creation of Congress, and so they\u2019re really statutory courts and\u2026 should be limited to that.\u201d\n\nBoyle asked Issa for his thoughts on how the bill would play out in the Senate, which has its version of a similar bill, should it make its way out of the House. Republicans would need seven Democrats or independents who caucus with them at a minimum to help them reach a key 60-vote threshold to jump a procedural hurdle called \u201ccloture\u201d and allow a floor vote on the bill.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in the Senate, of course, is that they do have to put together a number of Democrats. But one of the things about this bill is it\u2019s balanced. This bill would have the same effect if the next Obama, or Biden, or any other Democrat president came in and was doing their executive action,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt would allow for a judge to make a decision based on a plaintiff in front of them, but not allow them to immediately stop the president nationally, unless there was, as in one case, for example, in the last administration, you know, 16 attorneys general who all filed. Well, that would be a multiple, and we plan for that. So this is balanced.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it is something that should have Democrats come in,\u201d the congressman continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect Democrat leadership to do it, but we do expect a number of the more thoughtful Democrats to go \u2018This is long term good for the country,\u2019 but that\u2019s something that Senator Thune and others are going to have to wrestle with, because partisan politics often eliminates the support for good things.\u201d\n\nIssa noted that even in a hypothetical scenario in which the legislation does not make it out of Congress, Congressional Republicans\u2019 focus on the matter could prod the Supreme Court to rein in district judges itself.\n\n\u201cEven if this were to hypothetically not get through the Senate or be delayed, the court could begin to take notice that if they don\u2019t act, we will,\u201d Issa explained. \u201cAnd a lot of times, Chief Justice Roberts, on behalf of the court, takes notice of what we\u2019re doing, as he did with some of the ethics questions and so on, and then does something to do it. So we\u2019re hoping that we get a two-for, that this legislation causes them to look solidly at the fact that the court should have been slapping down these judges with quick actions and citing that they\u2019ve exceeded their jurisdiction, and we\u2019re hoping it\u2019ll do that. But if they don\u2019t, Chairman Jordan, the rest of us in support of our president, are going to make sure that we do.\u201d\n\nIssa also laid out some other actions worth considering after the No Rogue Rulings Act.\n\n\u201cOne of them is a venue definition that would narrow the amount of times that these individuals can shop\u2026You know right now, they\u2019re getting in front of judges all over the country, as far away as Hawaii, on things that clearly occurred in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we believe that we can define that in a way in which those would be thrown out simply as not allowed to be brought in these diverse areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next one is the speed with which the president gets appeal,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know, if you\u2019re on death row, you get immediate access to a Supreme Court justice before they can pull the final button. We have a similar situation in which the urgency on which the President should be able to appeal directly to the court in the case of one of these should be based on, you know, the administration\u2019s determination of need and damage.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that he is working with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) on \u201cconstitutionally appropriate\u201d measures."

Then he pompously added, \u201cAt this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists.\u201d\n\nWhat makes this reversal even juicier is that Daniels personally chose Ruffin saying: \u201cAmber\u2019s unique talents are the ideal fit for this current political and cultural climate.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHer perspective will fit right in with the dinner\u2019s tradition of honoring the freedom of the press while roasting the most powerful people on all sides of the aisle and the journalists who cover them.\u201d\n\nGee, wonder what changed?\n\nThe regime media are not doing this to focus on journalism or the First Amendment because these gangsters do not believe in either of those things. When they are not launching hoaxes, they are aggressively looking to bully and intimidate people who disagree with them into silence.\n\nThese people are villains who hate us and once a year they all come together for this insufferable dinner to self-congratulate each other for thinking the same way. The only way you\u2019d get me in that room is if I could bring a sock full of manure inside and get a tetanus shot afterward.\n\nThe WHCA blinked. That\u2019s what happened here. Trust in the corporate media is at record lows, and the last thing these left-wing losers and liars needed was three days of blowback for once again pretending to be objective while they use Their Big Stupid Night to belittle and smear Republicans.\n\nAnd this tells you the power New Media has now. At long last, these villains are scared of us, worried about us, fearing our narratives.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m sorry the WHCA canceled Ruffin. Anything the media do to further disgrace, expose, and discredit themselves is a gift.\n\nJohn Nolte\u2019s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nEmployees at the United States Institute of Peace received termination letters Friday evening as the Trump administration continues to reimagine the role of the US abroad and dramatically dismantle key parts of the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nA vast majority of the non-profit\u2019s staff received termination notices Friday evening, said a source who was terminated and who requested anonymity to speak freely without jeopardizing their severance package.\n\n\u201cEveryone received a personal letter that outlined that they were terminated as of March 28 and that health care would end March 31,\u201d the source said, noting that employees would be paid for work done through Friday, as well as for any remaining vacation time.\n\nThe institute, which was founded during the Reagan administration, \u201cpromotes research, policy analysis, education, and training on international peace and conflict resolution in an effort to prevent and resolve violent conflicts, and to promote post-conflict stability,\u201d according to a description on usa.gov. Its official website has been taken down.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in February taking aim at the Institute of Peace, an effort, the order said, to \u201cdramatically reduce the size of the Federal Government, while increasing its accountability to the American people.\u201d\n\nGeorge Foote, who was counsel to the US Institute of Peace until he was dismissed by DOGE, is now involved in litigation aimed at convincing a judge to recognize that the US government and DOGE\u2019s efforts to dismiss top officials at the organization is illegal.\n\nThe suit was filed in DC District Court after DOGE personnel, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to USIP\u2019s building earlier this month after originally being turned away.\n\nFoote told CNN in a phone interview on Saturday that all papers in the case will be filed by April 25. From there, the judge can either decide the case or call for a hearing, which would be held the week of April 28.\n\nThe source said that while the mass firing, first reported by CBS News, was not entirely unexpected, it was disappointing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously disappointing and a bit of a contradiction for a president who wants to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Every olive branch was extended to the president and his representatives that we wanted to work with this administration like we worked with seven prior \u2013 including his own during his first administration,\u201d the source said.\n\nTrump himself has expressed hope that he be remembered as a \u201cpeacemaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That\u2019s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier,\u201d he said in his inaugural address.\n\nUnlike the administration\u2019s efforts to slash government agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, the US Institute of Peace is an independent, non-profit organization that receives its $55 million in annual funding through Congress, meaning its staffers are not subject to the protections afforded to federal workers. Between 50 and 75 of its employees worked overseas as of Friday, per Foote.\n\n\u201cPeace is an ongoing process, and there\u2019s no way a $55 million-a-year investment is going to bring peace to the world, but they do an awful lot with that $55 million,\u201d Foote said.\n\nIt also has a nearly $80 million endowment, he said. It is unclear what would happen to that endowment funding, as well as the institute\u2019s headquarters in Washington\u2019s Foggy Bottom neighborhood, which is often rented for large-scale parties and weddings.\n\nAsked for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN, \u201cTaxpayers don\u2019t want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded \u2018research institute\u2019 that has failed to deliver peace. President Trump ended the era of forever wars and established peace in his first term, and he is carrying out his mandate to eliminate bloat and save taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nFoote pointed to the institute\u2019s work advising the National Security Council about policy issues and a senior military advisers group that discusses peace-building techniques to prevent wars. He also noted the institute\u2019s research on conflict minerals in Africa, its fight against Chinese influence on those critical minerals, its human trafficking studies in Cambodia, and its peace-building work in Papua New Guinea, among other efforts.\n\nThere are five carved doves in the foyer at USIP headquarters, Foote said, each bearing the name of a staff member who died in a conflict zone.\n\n\u201cGinny Bouvier is one of them. Ginny was in the jungles of Colombia \u2013 she contracted a disease down there. She died of it. We flew her home, but she passed away at Georgetown Hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nFoote continued, \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of work that people of USIP have done. These are not faceless bureaucrats. They\u2019re not people just living on the public dime.\n\nThey\u2019re not bloat or waste. They are bringing peace to the world and preventing the need for American military intervention and making the world and country safe for American military, American corporations, American citizens.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Jennifer and Pete Hegseth in Poland on Valentine\u2019s Day. Photo: Andrzej Iwanczuk/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth isn\u2019t just accidentally group chatting with a magazine editor about upcoming airstrikes \u2014 he\u2019s bringing his family members to work, too. The scandal-plagued self-proclaimed \u201cwar fighter\u201d has brought his wife, former Fox & Friends producer Jennifer Rauchet Hegseth, to at least two meetings with foreign military counterparts during which sensitive information was discussed, according to The Wall Street Journal. He\u2019s also keeping his brother close. The Journal and Associated Press report that Phil Hegseth, Pete\u2019s younger brother, has been hired for a key role in the Pentagon. And while making politics an officially family affair is hardly a novel concept in Trump administrations, it\u2019s not common for people at the Pentagon.\n\nPer the Journal\u2019s sources, Hegseth brought his wife to high-level meetings at NATO headquarters in Brussels (where allied defense officials discussed the war in Ukraine) and at the Pentagon (with the U.K.\u2019s two top defense officials). The Journal emphasizes how weird this was:\n\nA secretary can invite anyone to meetings with visiting counterparts, but attendee lists are usually carefully limited to those who need to be there and attendees are typically expected to possess security clearances given the delicate nature of the discussions, according to defense officials and people familiar with the meeting. There is often security near the meeting space to keep away uninvited attendees.\n\n[Jennifer Hegseth] isn\u2019t a Defense Department employee, defense officials said. It isn\u2019t uncommon for spouses of senior officials to possess low-level security clearances, but a Pentagon spokesperson declined to say whether Jennifer has one. Jennifer didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHer presence at the meetings did not go unnoticed by foreign defense officials, although some apparently had no idea who she was.\n\nHegseth\u2019s little brother has been tagging along, too, but in a more official capacity. Former podcast producer Phil Hegseth has joined the Pentagon as \u201csenior adviser to the secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and liaison officer to the Defense Department,\u201d the AP reports. In that role, he has joined his older brother for a Pentagon meeting with UFC champion Conor McGregor as well as on trips to Guantanamo Bay and Asia. A Defense Department spokesperson told the AP that Phil is \u201cone of a number of talented DHS liaisons to DoD\u201d and that he\u2019s currently \u201cconducting touch points with U.S. Coast Guard officials on the secretary\u2019s Indo-Pacific trip.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time they\u2019ve worked together, per the AP:\n\nBased on Phil Hegseth\u2019s publicly available r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his past experience includes founding his own podcast-production company, Embassy and Third, and working on social media and podcasts at the Hudson Institute. It\u2019s not the first time Phil Hegseth has worked alongside his older brother. When Pete Hegseth was CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, a nonprofit that fell into financial difficulty during his time there, he paid his brother $108,000 to do media relations for the organization, according to federal tax records.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Phil Hegseth\u2019s job title and said this \u201cinteragency mission is part of Mr. Hegseth\u2019s preview,\u201d presumably meaning \u201cpurview.\u201d\n\nNo, it\u2019s not normal for a defense secretary\u2019s brother to get senior-level Pentagon gigs. It\u2019s also against federal law for a government official to hire, promote, or recommend their relatives for a job underneath them, though it\u2019s possible the Hegseth brothers could avoid breaking that law if Phil is only considered a DHS employee. Pete Hegseth is also currently overseeing an effort to fire as many as 76,000 members of the Pentagon\u2019s civilian workforce (who are all other people\u2019s family members).\n\nThe reports about Hegseth\u2019s wife and brother have come to light amid a particularly damaging week for the defense secretary, whose handling of military secrets is now under widespread scrutiny in the aftermath of the Signal group-chat debacle. Pictures have also emerged of an Islamophobic tattoo Hegseth got on his arm, though it seems highly unlikely that will matter to anyone in this White House. And Pentagon officials also told CNN this week that Hegseth, as defense secretary, is indeed coming across as a superficial former-television personality who is out of his depth:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a TV personality,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201c[A general officer] makes a recommendation, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 [Former defense secretary] Lloyd Austin would never be like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 He\u2019d be like, \u2018We\u2019ll take it under consideration.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral DoD officials told CNN that Hegseth seems more preoccupied with appearances than with substance \u2014 wanting to appear more \u201clethal\u201d than his predecessor and pulling resources from elsewhere in DoD to achieve that image.\n\nMaybe it will all end with the launch of the Hegseth family\u2019s new reality show.\n\nThis post has been updated."

Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 on Friday visited the Pituffick Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, in Greenland. The trip had been scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danges who were not consulted about the original itinerary. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance arrives to board Air Force Two after touring the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on March 28, 2025. JIM WATSON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"\n\nMr. Trump has eyed the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders.\n\nThe president told NBC News in an interview on Saturday that \"we'll get Greenland,\" saying there's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" while adding that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nEarlier Saturday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen posted a video on social media scolding the Trump administration, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.\n\n\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, center, poses with second lady Usha Vance, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, his wife, former homeland security adviser, Julia Nesheiwat, left, and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, right, as they tour the U.S. military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, Friday, March 28, 2025. Jim Watson / AP\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \"a good and strong ally.\"\n\nVivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's foreign minister told CBS News she wants cooperation with the U.S., not domination.\n\n\"You just don't take over. You speak and you talk. That's all politics is about,\" she said.\n\nDanish King Frederik X posted on Facebook: \"We live in an altered reality. There should be no doubt that my love for Greenland and my connectedness to the people of Greenland are intact.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, \"back off, USA\" Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.\n\nCross-political support demonstration for Greenland and Greenlanders in front of Greenland's representation in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, Friday, March 28, 2025. Thomas Traasdahl / AP\n\nL\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.\n\nThe 1951 agreement \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" the foreign minister said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"\n\nL\u00f8kke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.\n\nThe second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president announced Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.\n\nA recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s major military mission at the southern border focused on reducing immigration and drug flows has already cost taxpayers more than $300 million, according to sources briefed on data from the Defense Department comptroller \u2014 even as the administration has vowed to slash the size of government and cut 8 percent from the department\u2019s budget.\n\nIn just the first month, the Pentagon spent roughly $250 million dollars, a source briefed on the cost and two other people familiar with the matter told CNN, including deportation flights on US military aircraft, the deployment of thousands of additional troops and the expansion of detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nAs of March 12, it had spent $328 million. The DoD Comptroller briefed lawmakers on the costs earlier this month, the sources all said.\n\n\u201cWe saw that and we were like woah \u2013 that\u2019s high,\u201d a defense official said.\n\nIf spending continues at the same pace \u2014 and it seems poised to do with the addition of two warships to the region and administration officials vowing to expand operations \u2014 it would put the military on track to spend more than $2 billion in the first year of operations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re drunk on [Overseas Contingency Operations] money,\u201d another official said, referring to funding set aside for military operations that isn\u2019t part of the base budget.\n\nThe cost of the military operation, not previously reported, underscores the Trump administration\u2019s determination to move as quickly as possible to shift the enforcement of the US southern border \u2014 traditionally a domestic law enforcement function \u2014 into a military mission.\n\nThe total cost of the operation across the federal government remains unclear. Those figures do not include money spent by the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community and other agencies who have also surged government assets to the border, where President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency.\n\nThe administration sees those growing costs \u2014 which for now must be moved from other government programs because Congress has not directed new funding to the border \u2014 as necessary to combat what Trump has termed an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants and fentanyl.\n\nUnder Trump, the intelligence community for the first time listed cartels as the first threat facing the country in its annual threat review. And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a memo outlining his priorities for the Pentagon, labeled defending the US homeland from \u201cunlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking\u201d as the military\u2019s \u201cforemost priority.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that the Trump administration is inflating the nature of the threat relative to other priorities \u2014 like countering China and Russia or combatting terrorism \u2014 and that shifting military assets away from those efforts risks national security.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland Security has for years looked to the Pentagon for assistance in times of border crisis, the latest surge also comes against the backdrop of very few border crossings. Migrant crossings dramatically declined after an executive action by former President Joe Biden last summer that clamped down on asylum. They have continued to plummet, with only a couple of hundred people illegally crossing the US-Mexico border daily, according to Homeland Security officials.\n\nInside the military commands responsible for carrying out Trump\u2019s strategy, officials say the ballooning mission is often throwing expensive defense resources at problems that either already had law enforcement solutions or weren\u2019t a problem to begin with.\n\nA number of high-profile initiatives have already been scaled back, either because they were too expensive to have the military do them or because they weren\u2019t needed in the first place.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re not even building a plan\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even building a plan. It\u2019s almost, like, they\u2019re just like, here\u2019s more toys. Go do something,\u201d the second defense official said.\n\nDefense officials said the costs are only expected to rise as the Pentagon attempts to execute on Hegseth\u2019s directive to make the border the \u201cforemost priority,\u201d potentially putting them beyond what was spent in Trump\u2019s first administration, when annual spending on military activities at the border was estimated to have cost between $1 billion and $2 billion. \u200b\n\nAs of March 1, there were around 9,000 active duty troops at the border, according to US Northern Command. A second defense official said the troops have primarily been building barricades, putting up concertina wire, and generally \u201cjust standing around.\u201d\n\nThe US military last week deployed two warships to patrol near the border, which will add significantly to costs. And it surged surveillance flights on the border and in international airspace around the Baja Peninsula beginning in February.\n\nThe administration has also been considering a plan to have Northern Command take command of a swath of territory along the border by designating it as a military installation, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n\nMigrants who cross in this area would be put into \u201cholding\u201d for trespassing onto a military property, until the Department of Homeland Security could arrive to pick them up and deport them \u2014 putting the military in the position of effectively detaining migrants, something it is traditionally a law enforcement function. The military is prohibited from carrying out domestic law enforcement under the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, but by describing the zone as a \u201cholding\u201d area, DoD could feasibly circumvent that law.\n\nThis photo from the US Navy shows the holding tents that were build for detaining migrants at the US Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in February. U.S. Navy/AFN Guantanamo Bay Public Affairs/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, a number of early efforts have sputtered.\n\nMilitary deportation flights have slowed to a trickle because the Department of Homeland Security has not actually needed the large and expensive military C-17s to help transport migrants, multiple officials said. Only one military flight per week is taking off on average, holding a handful of migrants.\n\nAnd the US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\u2014which Hegseth in January touted as a \u201cperfect place\u201d to hold as many as 30,000 migrants\u2014is nearly empty. A significant portion of the 900 troops surged there last month to handle an influx of deportees could soon be sent home, officials said.\n\nThe deployments to the border are \u201cclearly more about optics,\u201d a defense official said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez and Angelica Franganillo Diaz contributed to this story."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nWith an unelected billionaire taking a wrecking ball to the administrative state and the president\u2019s Cabinet giving away national secrets, it can be easy to forget that the president is treating the crypto industry like an open-source ATM.\n\nYou may remember that Donald Trump launched a novelty cryptocurrency in January \u2014 followed by one for the First Lady \u2014 making over $100 million off trading fees. But just this month, Trump\u2019s business interests also announced the launch of a third cryptocurrency, a murky crypto SPAC plan from Trump Media executives, and a crypto investment fund with a major exchange two days after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the end of a formal probe into the company. With Trump\u2019s crypto ventures speeding up, I spoke with Corey Frayer \u2014 a senior adviser to former SEC chair Gary Gensler \u2014 about crypto\u2019s new attitude under a lax regulatory environment and the \u201cunthinkable\u201d conflicts of interest that could still be on their way.\n\nSince you left the SEC in January, what has been the greatest change you\u2019ve seen so far?\n\nI would say the very first change was the political retribution against the staff at the SEC who had worked on crypto policy. A great example is that one of the top crypto litigators was reassigned to the IT department.\n\nIt sends the message that the decisions of financial regulators aren\u2019t guided by independent expertise in the markets; they are generated by a desired policy outcome dictated by politics. Plus the dismissal of important and well-founded enforcement actions has sent a message to the markets that the largest firms and platforms can do whatever they like without fear of accountability. Investors and the little guys are on their own.\n\nThis week, Trump\u2019s family announced a stablecoin the day before Republicans introduced new legislation on that type of cryptocurrency. Then his team also launched a new ETF with Crypto.com a day before the SEC ended its probe of that company. It\u2019s confusing to me why the president needs an ETF or a stablecoin.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not confusing in the context of this president. Crypto has just been another addition to the portfolio of conflicts of interest that Trump and his family have.\n\nTrump\u2019s businesses have been riddled with conflicts of interest since he entered politics. How much different are his crypto interests?\n\n\ufeffThere are many avenues in crypto where this creates what would\u2019ve been otherwise-unthinkable incentives and conflicts for the most powerful office in the United States.\n\nWe saw that Justin Sun made an enormous investment in Trump\u2019s business World Liberty Financial after the election. Then his case was dismissed by the SEC that had recently come under the leadership of a Trump appointee. We saw it with the news that World Liberty Financial was engaging in negotiations with Binance, whose former CEO had pleaded guilty to criminal charges. There does seem to be a huge advantage to being associated with Trump businesses in terms of being released from enforcement cases.\n\nAs someone concerned with investor protection, what would you like to see Democrats do here to counter this?\n\nDemocrats should be in unified opposition to anything that puts the economy and investors and consumers at risk.\n\nHave we seen that unified opposition over the past two months?\n\nWith regard to crypto? No, not at all. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee supported a stablecoin bill that legitimizes crypto but also holds it to a far lesser standard than almost any other part of the financial system.\n\nI\u2019m wondering how much more could the president get out of crypto? Do you see this expansion continuing until the market tanks or he is checked somehow?\n\nYeah, I mean, Trump knows a good grift when he sees one. There are a lot of people who have said that Trump doesn\u2019t really understand crypto. And while that may be true at a technological level, I don\u2019t think I have ever seen anyone so quickly master the pump-and-dump business model of crypto like he did with his meme coin.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen anything so far, and I think it would be delusional to think that if the SEC isn\u2019t even going to continue prosecuting fraud charges that there will be any credible oversight and accountability of the crypto industry.\n\nDo you see Trump\u2019s crypto interests bleeding over into other aspects of his administration?\n\n\ufeffIt has been reported that HUD, for example, is considering moving to crypto and stablecoins for some of its grant issuance. USAID \u2014 what\u2019s left of USAID \u2014 may look to pay out some of its grants and other obligations in stablecoin. You have this dangerous and extremely unpopular technology that the president is in a position to force adoption over. So there are a lot of people who are going to be put in harm\u2019s way, even if they didn\u2019t choose to expose themselves to the volatility and dangers of the crypto markets.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting philosophical point. If the government is forcing Americans to be exposed to crypto, it\u2019s very much in contradiction to the original decentralized vision of this form of currency.\n\nDespite the crypto community claiming it wanted to be outside the purview of the government, it has banged down the door to be part of the mainstream financial system with the approval of the bitcoin ETF and dozens of filings that have come into the SEC since Inauguration Day. There is no remainder of the crypto ethos except for a desire to benefit from the lack of government oversight and regulation.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "It\u2019s that time again! Photo: Graeme Sloan/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nBoth parties have plenty of reasons to look forward to next year\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans can test out the MAGA hypothesis that Donald Trump is building a new majority coalition that will last for decades. Democrats will rely on the more plausible historical precedent that the president\u2019s party almost always loses ground in midterms.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait until 2026 for some electoral tests of Trump 2.0 and its counterrevolutionary chaos. This year will offer an assortment of special and off-year contests of considerable importance in themselves, which may also provide leading indicators of elections to come. Here\u2019s an overview in chronological order:\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court\n\nThe first cookie on the plate is a big one: an off-year judicial election in the battleground state of Wisconsin (the closest state in the country in 2024; Trump carried it by a margin of 0.86 percent). Whichever side wins this race will have a majority on the seven-judge court, where liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority. Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate and Dane County judge, is facing Brad Schimel, the conservative Waukesha County judge.\n\nCrawford is a former Democratic gubernatorial aid who has been an outspoken defender of abortion rights and critic of Republican voter-ID laws. Schimel has campaigned with Donald Trump Jr. and Charlie Kirk and posed with a huge inflatable image of Jr.\u2019s dad. So there\u2019s no mistaking the contrast, or the potential stakes, including litigation over election rules and possibly a re-redistricting of Wisconsin congressional seats.\n\nBut it\u2019s the massive spending surrounding this race that underlines its national significance. The last big Wisconsin Supreme Court race in 2023, won by liberal candidate Janet Protasiewicz, smashed national records for judicial contests as total spending reached $51 million. This year\u2019s spending has already topped $90 million and will likely reach $100 million in the last week. While both candidates have received significant outside help via direct and independent contributions (Crawford has gotten indirect donations from Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker and global right-wing devil figure George Soros), it has been Schimel\u2019s heavy support from DOGE warlord Elon Musk that has electrified the matchup, as PBS Wisconsin reports:\n\nTwo groups funded by Musk have so far spent more than $13 million on the race, according to a tally by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice \u2014 with plans to spend around $20 million total.\n\nMusk donated another $2 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party on March 20, the same day the party gave $1.2 million to Schimel\u2019s campaign.\n\nSome of the money is going directly in the pockets of voters: One Musk group is paying Wisconsin voters $100 for signing a petition opposing \u201cjudicial activism,\u201d and Musk himself handed over two $1 million checks to voters after a Democratic bid to have them declared illegal vote-buying failed in the courts.\n\nTeam Crawford is delighted with the not-very-popular Musk\u2019s high visibility in Schimel\u2019s campaign, offering voters a chance to \u201csend a message\u201d to Musk and Trump about their ongoing demolition of federal programs and personnel. Increasingly the election is being described as a \u201creferendum on Elon Musk,\u201d an impression Musk himself is promoting by saying the contest \u201ccould determine the fate of the country\u201d or even \u201cthe entire destiny of humanity.\u201d Even if it doesn\u2019t tilt the Wisconsin election, the results could help determine the political fate of Musk and DOGE.\n\nCongressional special elections\n\nThere are currently four vacant seats in the House of Representatives with a fifth a near-certainty. Special elections will be held in Florida to fill two of them (vacated by onetime attorney-general nominee Matt Gaetz and Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz) on April 1, the same day as the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. While both districts at play are heavily Republican, Democratic candidates are benefiting from massive small-donor contributions, as NBC News reports:\n\nGay Valimont, a gun-control activist who is running in Florida\u2019s First Congressional District, raised nearly $6.4 million from January 9 to March 12, five times more than Republican Jimmy Patronis, Florida\u2019s chief financial officer, according to new fundraising reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAnd Josh Weil, a teacher running in the Sixth District, raised $9.3 million, a haul more than 16 times larger than Republican state senator Randy Fine.\n\nWeil, in fact, was within four points of Fine\u2013less than the margin of error\u2013in a survey by St. Pete Polls this week, with Democrats out-performing Republicans in early voting despite a 2-1 disadvantage in registered voters. The possibility of a loss in this race may have had something to do, in fact, with Trump\u2019s decision to cancel Elise Stefanik\u2019s nomination to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations because her vote is needed.\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t need unlikely victories to make a splash, however: Since Trump carried the First District by 37 points last year and the Sixth District by 30 points, a respectable underdog showing would raise both eyebrows and currently depressed grassroots Democratic spirits. Punchbowl News suggests \u201canything less than a 20-point victory should raise alarm bells in GOP leadership ranks.\u201d\n\nSpecial elections for the seats of two recently deceased Democrats, Arizona\u2019s Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Texas\u2019s Sylvester Turner, will also be held this year. The Arizona election is scheduled for September 23; the Texas election date has yet to be established. Both districts are solidly Democratic but could see significant Republican efforts given recent Trump gains among Latino and Black voters.\n\nTwo big gubernatorial races\n\nRegularly scheduled off-year gubernatorial elections are often viewed as bellwethers for future national-political developments. This year\u2019s contests are in New Jersey and Virginia, where the incumbents (Democrat Phil Murphy in the former and Republican Glenn Youngkin in the latter) are term-limited. While these states are considered \u201cblue\u201d (New Jersey last went Republican in a presidential election in 1988, and Virginia last turned red in 2004), Republicans have found reason for optimism in both recently.\n\nIn the last New Jersey gubernatorial election in 2021, the heavily favored Murphy got a scare from Republican Jack Ciattarelli. And in 2024, Trump cut his 11.9 percent 2020 deficit in the Garden State to 5.9 percent. So local Republicans are optimistic. Ciattarelli is running again as a Trump loyalist, as is former radio-talk-show host Bill Spadea, while former legislative leader Jon Bramnick has been critical of the president. Democrats have a large field of credible candidates to succeed Murphy, including two members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation (Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer), two major-city mayors (Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City), a teachers-union president (Sean Spiller), and a former state legislative leader (Stephen Sweeney). Key factors in the race include how civil or uncivil the Democratic primary race becomes, and whether Trump\u2019s record damages the GOP brand in the state. The primary is in June.\n\nVirginia\u2019s gubernatorial race is less complicated. Former Democratic representative Abigail Spanberger, a nationally prominent centrist from north-central Virginia, is the presumptive nominee for her party. On the Republican side, the front-runner, incumbent Republican lieutenant governor Winsome Earle-Sears, drew relatively late opposition from two rivals who claim she is inadequately conservative; one is media magnet, conspiracy theorist, and former state senator Amanda Chase, who likes to call herself \u201cTrump in high heels.\u201d Earle-Sears is the strong favorite but will have to spend time and money best saved for November.\n\nRepublicans are hoping Youngkin\u2019s relatively strong popularity (and upset win in 2021) carries over to his successor, and also note that Trump improved on his 2020 performance in the Commonwealth significantly in 2024 (losing by 5.7 percent as opposed to 10.1 percent in 2020). But Virginia has a long history of electing governors from the party that does not control the White House, and Republicans could also suffer from backlash against Trump-Musk budget and personnel cuts in vote-rich Northern Virginia with its large number of federal employees and contractors.\n\nMayoral races, including the big one\n\nThere are a host of mayoral races in 2025 in cities ranging from Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, and Miami in the South to Cleveland, Detroit, Minneapolis, and St. Louis in the Midwest and Oakland and Seattle on the West Coast. Most major cities are Democratic-run with limited Republican competition, though three holding elections this year do currently have GOP mayors (Fort Worth, Miami, and Omaha). But national politics have a way of influencing local elections in times like these, and that\u2019s definitely true of the mayoral race that will draw the most national attention: New York\u2019s. Perhaps the Big Apple\u2019s Trump-influenced sort-of-Democratic incumbent Eric Adams has little hopes for reelection, but other Democrats will run as potential thorns in the president\u2019s side, and one prominent candidate, former governor Andrew Cuomo, has his own cozy relationships with Republicans (not to mention sexual-harassment complaints and a history of offending voters one at a time) to overcome.\n\nBallot initiatives\n\n2025 looks to be a quiet year for ballot initiatives, in part because the abortion-rights (and in a few states, abortion ban) measures that convulsed the country after the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 have reached their likely culmination for a while (mostly because many states with abortion bans and Republican legislatures don\u2019t allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments). At the moment, only two states have certified statewide ballot measures this year: Wisconsin, where Republican lawmakers put a voter-ID initiative on the ballot for the April 1 Supreme Court election in order to goose conservative turnout; Ohio, which has a bond initiative. But on March 27, Louisiana had a special election where four fairly technical constitutional amendments sponsored by Republican Governor Jeff Landry and approved by the legislature all lost badly, in part because they were poorly explained. The broad-based voter coalition that defeated Landry\u2019s initiatives could be an indicator that low public trust will make ballot measures difficult this year.\n\nNew measures could be certified later this year, and it\u2019s entirely possible we\u2019ll see more special elections for open congressional or important down-ballot offices. At every step of the way, and right on down to dogcatcher races, the turbulent record of the second Trump administration will be at least a minor, and in many elections a major, factor in the outcome.\n\nThis piece has been updated."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the most senior liberal on the Supreme Court, advocated for a \u201cfearlessly independent\u201d judiciary during remarks Friday, telling an audience in Washington that she is worried about \u201cstandards that are being changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s troubling so many right now is many of the standards that are being changed \u2026 were norms that governed officials into what was right and wrong,\u201d Sotomayor told an audience at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cOnce norms are broken then you\u2019re shaking some of the foundation of the rule of law,\u201d she added.\n\nSotomayor did not directly mention President Donald Trump, who along with his allies have flirted with defying court orders that have temporarily blocked him from enforcing some of his executive actions. But Sotomayor, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2009, was clear that she was speaking about current events.\n\n\u201cThe fact that some of our public leaders are lawyers advocating or making statements challenging the rule of law tells me that fundamentally our law schools are failing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOnce we lose our common norms, we\u2019ve lost the religion of law completely,\u201d she said.\n\nSotomayor\u2019s remarks came hours after the Trump administration filed its latest emergency appeal to the high court, asking the justices to let it temporarily enforce the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport certain immigrants. In that case, US District Judge James Boasberg is looking into whether the administration violated his order to temporarily halt deportations under the wartime authority.\n\nThe members of the high court have largely avoided discussing Trump and the legal whirlwind that has followed his first weeks in office. But Chief Justice John Roberts earlier this month pushed back on Trump in rare and short statement amid threats of impeaching judges who ruled against the White House.\n\n\u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\u201d Roberts, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, said in a statement. \u201cThe normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\u201d\n\nSotomayor offered more subtle remarks in February, telling an audience in Miami that she had faith the judicial system will withstand attacks.\n\n\u201cCourt decisions stand,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether one particular person chooses to abide by them or not, it doesn\u2019t change the foundation that it\u2019s still a court order that someone will respect at some point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the faith that I have in our system,\u201d she said."
