            "full_content": "Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) told Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Saturday that his legislation, the \u201cNo Rogue Rulings Act,\u201d would be a \u201cfirst step\u201d in reining in \u201crogue actors\u201d by limiting federal district court judges\u2019 power to issue nationwide injunctions.\n\nIssa\u2019s appearance on the program comes as federal district judges, like Judge James Boasberg in Washington, DC, have ruled against key Trump executive orders with nationwide injunctions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first step, and I tell everyone, we\u2019re going to be taking many steps to rein in these rogue actors,\u201d Issa told Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle. \u201cThis particular one limits their ability to do nationwide injunctions.\u201d\n\nThe House is set to vote on the legislation next week.\n\nIssa stressed that the district courts were not established by the Constitution, but by Congress to prevent the Supreme Court from being overloaded by cases, adding that district courts were meant to take plaintiffs in their districts.\n\n\u201cWhen Congress created\u2013not the constitution\u2013when Congress created the lower courts, they did so to help alleviate from the Supreme Court how many cases went to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they did so\u2013the word District Court has a meaning\u2013they did so for them to take plaintiffs in their district, people and parties who have a Nexus, and make a decision for their district, with the clear understanding that after they made their decision, and somebody in another district made their decision, if there was some ambiguity, then the\u2026 appellate courts, and Supreme Court would step in.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, what they\u2019ve decided is, instead of nine men and women in Washington being the spokesperson, the final decision-maker for the country, that they were going to do it,\u201d Issa added. \u201cIt\u2019s outside their jurisdiction, and although it should have been reined in by the Justices of the Supreme Court, since they haven\u2019t, we will, and we\u2019ll continue to do so because it\u2019s not just here, but a number of other activities that these judges are doing that have to be pushed back. And we have to do it, not based on one judge who we might be able to impeach, but rather on as many as 100 or 200 of these 700 judges that think that their mandate is as large as the Supreme Court\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\nLISTEN:\n\nBreitbart \u00b7 Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) \u2013 March 29, 2025\n\nThus far, Trump\u2019s administration has been subjected to 15 nationwide injunctions, USA Today reported. Nationwide injunctions were also rampant during Trump\u2019s first term, according to an April 2024 Harvard Law Review article. Of the at least 127 nationwide injunctions issued from 1963 through 2023, 64 came in the first Trump term.\n\nBoyle noted that leftist groups will essentially \u201cshop\u201d for a specific court in hopes of getting a favorable judge and therefore a favorable ruling with a national injunction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way our Founders intended the court system to work,\u201d he told Issa.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Issa responded. \u201cAs a matter of fact, when our founders created in the Constitution the Supreme Court, they let Congress decide how many people would be on that court, and completely allowed us to decide if, in the future, there were going to be additional and lower courts. So although we often call them all Article III courts, the fact is: Only the Supreme Court is a constitutional court. All of the other courts are a creation of Congress, and so they\u2019re really statutory courts and\u2026 should be limited to that.\u201d\n\nBoyle asked Issa for his thoughts on how the bill would play out in the Senate, which has its version of a similar bill, should it make its way out of the House. Republicans would need seven Democrats or independents who caucus with them at a minimum to help them reach a key 60-vote threshold to jump a procedural hurdle called \u201ccloture\u201d and allow a floor vote on the bill.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in the Senate, of course, is that they do have to put together a number of Democrats. But one of the things about this bill is it\u2019s balanced. This bill would have the same effect if the next Obama, or Biden, or any other Democrat president came in and was doing their executive action,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt would allow for a judge to make a decision based on a plaintiff in front of them, but not allow them to immediately stop the president nationally, unless there was, as in one case, for example, in the last administration, you know, 16 attorneys general who all filed. Well, that would be a multiple, and we plan for that. So this is balanced.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it is something that should have Democrats come in,\u201d the congressman continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect Democrat leadership to do it, but we do expect a number of the more thoughtful Democrats to go \u2018This is long term good for the country,\u2019 but that\u2019s something that Senator Thune and others are going to have to wrestle with, because partisan politics often eliminates the support for good things.\u201d\n\nIssa noted that even in a hypothetical scenario in which the legislation does not make it out of Congress, Congressional Republicans\u2019 focus on the matter could prod the Supreme Court to rein in district judges itself.\n\n\u201cEven if this were to hypothetically not get through the Senate or be delayed, the court could begin to take notice that if they don\u2019t act, we will,\u201d Issa explained. \u201cAnd a lot of times, Chief Justice Roberts, on behalf of the court, takes notice of what we\u2019re doing, as he did with some of the ethics questions and so on, and then does something to do it. So we\u2019re hoping that we get a two-for, that this legislation causes them to look solidly at the fact that the court should have been slapping down these judges with quick actions and citing that they\u2019ve exceeded their jurisdiction, and we\u2019re hoping it\u2019ll do that. But if they don\u2019t, Chairman Jordan, the rest of us in support of our president, are going to make sure that we do.\u201d\n\nIssa also laid out some other actions worth considering after the No Rogue Rulings Act.\n\n\u201cOne of them is a venue definition that would narrow the amount of times that these individuals can shop\u2026You know right now, they\u2019re getting in front of judges all over the country, as far away as Hawaii, on things that clearly occurred in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we believe that we can define that in a way in which those would be thrown out simply as not allowed to be brought in these diverse areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next one is the speed with which the president gets appeal,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know, if you\u2019re on death row, you get immediate access to a Supreme Court justice before they can pull the final button. We have a similar situation in which the urgency on which the President should be able to appeal directly to the court in the case of one of these should be based on, you know, the administration\u2019s determination of need and damage.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that he is working with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) on \u201cconstitutionally appropriate\u201d measures."

Then he pompously added, \u201cAt this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists.\u201d\n\nWhat makes this reversal even juicier is that Daniels personally chose Ruffin saying: \u201cAmber\u2019s unique talents are the ideal fit for this current political and cultural climate.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHer perspective will fit right in with the dinner\u2019s tradition of honoring the freedom of the press while roasting the most powerful people on all sides of the aisle and the journalists who cover them.\u201d\n\nGee, wonder what changed?\n\nThe regime media are not doing this to focus on journalism or the First Amendment because these gangsters do not believe in either of those things. When they are not launching hoaxes, they are aggressively looking to bully and intimidate people who disagree with them into silence.\n\nThese people are villains who hate us and once a year they all come together for this insufferable dinner to self-congratulate each other for thinking the same way. The only way you\u2019d get me in that room is if I could bring a sock full of manure inside and get a tetanus shot afterward.\n\nThe WHCA blinked. That\u2019s what happened here. Trust in the corporate media is at record lows, and the last thing these left-wing losers and liars needed was three days of blowback for once again pretending to be objective while they use Their Big Stupid Night to belittle and smear Republicans.\n\nAnd this tells you the power New Media has now. At long last, these villains are scared of us, worried about us, fearing our narratives.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m sorry the WHCA canceled Ruffin. Anything the media do to further disgrace, expose, and discredit themselves is a gift.\n\nJohn Nolte\u2019s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nEmployees at the United States Institute of Peace received termination letters Friday evening as the Trump administration continues to reimagine the role of the US abroad and dramatically dismantle key parts of the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nA vast majority of the non-profit\u2019s staff received termination notices Friday evening, said a source who was terminated and who requested anonymity to speak freely without jeopardizing their severance package.\n\n\u201cEveryone received a personal letter that outlined that they were terminated as of March 28 and that health care would end March 31,\u201d the source said, noting that employees would be paid for work done through Friday, as well as for any remaining vacation time.\n\nThe institute, which was founded during the Reagan administration, \u201cpromotes research, policy analysis, education, and training on international peace and conflict resolution in an effort to prevent and resolve violent conflicts, and to promote post-conflict stability,\u201d according to a description on usa.gov. Its official website has been taken down.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in February taking aim at the Institute of Peace, an effort, the order said, to \u201cdramatically reduce the size of the Federal Government, while increasing its accountability to the American people.\u201d\n\nGeorge Foote, who was counsel to the US Institute of Peace until he was dismissed by DOGE, is now involved in litigation aimed at convincing a judge to recognize that the US government and DOGE\u2019s efforts to dismiss top officials at the organization is illegal.\n\nThe suit was filed in DC District Court after DOGE personnel, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to USIP\u2019s building earlier this month after originally being turned away.\n\nFoote told CNN in a phone interview on Saturday that all papers in the case will be filed by April 25. From there, the judge can either decide the case or call for a hearing, which would be held the week of April 28.\n\nThe source said that while the mass firing, first reported by CBS News, was not entirely unexpected, it was disappointing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously disappointing and a bit of a contradiction for a president who wants to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Every olive branch was extended to the president and his representatives that we wanted to work with this administration like we worked with seven prior \u2013 including his own during his first administration,\u201d the source said.\n\nTrump himself has expressed hope that he be remembered as a \u201cpeacemaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That\u2019s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier,\u201d he said in his inaugural address.\n\nUnlike the administration\u2019s efforts to slash government agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, the US Institute of Peace is an independent, non-profit organization that receives its $55 million in annual funding through Congress, meaning its staffers are not subject to the protections afforded to federal workers. Between 50 and 75 of its employees worked overseas as of Friday, per Foote.\n\n\u201cPeace is an ongoing process, and there\u2019s no way a $55 million-a-year investment is going to bring peace to the world, but they do an awful lot with that $55 million,\u201d Foote said.\n\nIt also has a nearly $80 million endowment, he said. It is unclear what would happen to that endowment funding, as well as the institute\u2019s headquarters in Washington\u2019s Foggy Bottom neighborhood, which is often rented for large-scale parties and weddings.\n\nAsked for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN, \u201cTaxpayers don\u2019t want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded \u2018research institute\u2019 that has failed to deliver peace. President Trump ended the era of forever wars and established peace in his first term, and he is carrying out his mandate to eliminate bloat and save taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nFoote pointed to the institute\u2019s work advising the National Security Council about policy issues and a senior military advisers group that discusses peace-building techniques to prevent wars. He also noted the institute\u2019s research on conflict minerals in Africa, its fight against Chinese influence on those critical minerals, its human trafficking studies in Cambodia, and its peace-building work in Papua New Guinea, among other efforts.\n\nThere are five carved doves in the foyer at USIP headquarters, Foote said, each bearing the name of a staff member who died in a conflict zone.\n\n\u201cGinny Bouvier is one of them. Ginny was in the jungles of Colombia \u2013 she contracted a disease down there. She died of it. We flew her home, but she passed away at Georgetown Hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nFoote continued, \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of work that people of USIP have done. These are not faceless bureaucrats. They\u2019re not people just living on the public dime.\n\nThey\u2019re not bloat or waste. They are bringing peace to the world and preventing the need for American military intervention and making the world and country safe for American military, American corporations, American citizens.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

Photo: Andrzej Iwanczuk/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth isn\u2019t just accidentally group chatting with a magazine editor about upcoming airstrikes \u2014 he\u2019s bringing his family members to work, too. The scandal-plagued self-proclaimed \u201cwar fighter\u201d has brought his wife, former Fox & Friends producer Jennifer Rauchet Hegseth, to at least two meetings with foreign military counterparts during which sensitive information was discussed, according to The Wall Street Journal. He\u2019s also keeping his brother close. The Journal and Associated Press report that Phil Hegseth, Pete\u2019s younger brother, has been hired for a key role in the Pentagon. And while making politics an officially family affair is hardly a novel concept in Trump administrations, it\u2019s not common for people at the Pentagon.\n\nPer the Journal\u2019s sources, Hegseth brought his wife to high-level meetings at NATO headquarters in Brussels (where allied defense officials discussed the war in Ukraine) and at the Pentagon (with the U.K.\u2019s two top defense officials). The Journal emphasizes how weird this was:\n\nA secretary can invite anyone to meetings with visiting counterparts, but attendee lists are usually carefully limited to those who need to be there and attendees are typically expected to possess security clearances given the delicate nature of the discussions, according to defense officials and people familiar with the meeting. There is often security near the meeting space to keep away uninvited attendees.\n\n[Jennifer Hegseth] isn\u2019t a Defense Department employee, defense officials said. It isn\u2019t uncommon for spouses of senior officials to possess low-level security clearances, but a Pentagon spokesperson declined to say whether Jennifer has one. Jennifer didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHer presence at the meetings did not go unnoticed by foreign defense officials, although some apparently had no idea who she was.\n\nHegseth\u2019s little brother has been tagging along, too, but in a more official capacity. Former podcast producer Phil Hegseth has joined the Pentagon as \u201csenior adviser to the secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and liaison officer to the Defense Department,\u201d the AP reports. In that role, he has joined his older brother for a Pentagon meeting with UFC champion Conor McGregor as well as on trips to Guantanamo Bay and Asia. A Defense Department spokesperson told the AP that Phil is \u201cone of a number of talented DHS liaisons to DoD\u201d and that he\u2019s currently \u201cconducting touch points with U.S. Coast Guard officials on the secretary\u2019s Indo-Pacific trip.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time they\u2019ve worked together, per the AP:\n\nBased on Phil Hegseth\u2019s publicly available r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his past experience includes founding his own podcast-production company, Embassy and Third, and working on social media and podcasts at the Hudson Institute. It\u2019s not the first time Phil Hegseth has worked alongside his older brother. When Pete Hegseth was CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, a nonprofit that fell into financial difficulty during his time there, he paid his brother $108,000 to do media relations for the organization, according to federal tax records.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Phil Hegseth\u2019s job title and said this \u201cinteragency mission is part of Mr. Hegseth\u2019s preview,\u201d presumably meaning \u201cpurview.\u201d\n\nNo, it\u2019s not normal for a defense secretary\u2019s brother to get senior-level Pentagon gigs. It\u2019s also against federal law for a government official to hire, promote, or recommend their relatives for a job underneath them, though it\u2019s possible the Hegseth brothers could avoid breaking that law if Phil is only considered a DHS employee. Pete Hegseth is also currently overseeing an effort to fire as many as 76,000 members of the Pentagon\u2019s civilian workforce (who are all other people\u2019s family members).\n\nThe reports about Hegseth\u2019s wife and brother have come to light amid a particularly damaging week for the defense secretary, whose handling of military secrets is now under widespread scrutiny in the aftermath of the Signal group-chat debacle. Pictures have also emerged of an Islamophobic tattoo Hegseth got on his arm, though it seems highly unlikely that will matter to anyone in this White House. And Pentagon officials also told CNN this week that Hegseth, as defense secretary, is indeed coming across as a superficial former-television personality who is out of his depth:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a TV personality,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201c[A general officer] makes a recommendation, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 [Former defense secretary] Lloyd Austin would never be like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 He\u2019d be like, \u2018We\u2019ll take it under consideration.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral DoD officials told CNN that Hegseth seems more preoccupied with appearances than with substance \u2014 wanting to appear more \u201clethal\u201d than his predecessor and pulling resources from elsewhere in DoD to achieve that image.\n\nMaybe it will all end with the launch of the Hegseth family\u2019s new reality show.\n\nThis post has been updated."

Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 on Friday visited the Pituffick Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, in Greenland. The trip had been scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danges who were not consulted about the original itinerary. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance arrives to board Air Force Two after touring the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on March 28, 2025. JIM WATSON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"\n\nMr. Trump has eyed the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders.\n\nThe president told NBC News in an interview on Saturday that \"we'll get Greenland,\" saying there's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" while adding that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nEarlier Saturday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen posted a video on social media scolding the Trump administration, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.\n\n\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, center, poses with second lady Usha Vance, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, his wife, former homeland security adviser, Julia Nesheiwat, left, and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, right, as they tour the U.S. military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, Friday, March 28, 2025. Jim Watson / AP\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \"a good and strong ally.\"\n\nVivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's foreign minister told CBS News she wants cooperation with the U.S., not domination.\n\n\"You just don't take over. You speak and you talk. That's all politics is about,\" she said.\n\nDanish King Frederik X posted on Facebook: \"We live in an altered reality. There should be no doubt that my love for Greenland and my connectedness to the people of Greenland are intact.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, \"back off, USA\" Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.\n\nCross-political support demonstration for Greenland and Greenlanders in front of Greenland's representation in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, Friday, March 28, 2025. Thomas Traasdahl / AP\n\nL\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.\n\nThe 1951 agreement \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" the foreign minister said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"\n\nL\u00f8kke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.\n\nThe second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president announced Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.\n\nA recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States."

Reagan signed a law formally establishing the institute as \"an independent, nonprofit corporation.\"\n\nIn a statement to CBS News on Saturday, the White House press deputy secretary, Anna Kelly, said: \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s major military mission at the southern border focused on reducing immigration and drug flows has already cost taxpayers more than $300 million, according to sources briefed on data from the Defense Department comptroller \u2014 even as the administration has vowed to slash the size of government and cut 8 percent from the department\u2019s budget.\n\nIn just the first month, the Pentagon spent roughly $250 million dollars, a source briefed on the cost and two other people familiar with the matter told CNN, including deportation flights on US military aircraft, the deployment of thousands of additional troops and the expansion of detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nAs of March 12, it had spent $328 million. The DoD Comptroller briefed lawmakers on the costs earlier this month, the sources all said.\n\n\u201cWe saw that and we were like woah \u2013 that\u2019s high,\u201d a defense official said.\n\nIf spending continues at the same pace \u2014 and it seems poised to do with the addition of two warships to the region and administration officials vowing to expand operations \u2014 it would put the military on track to spend more than $2 billion in the first year of operations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re drunk on [Overseas Contingency Operations] money,\u201d another official said, referring to funding set aside for military operations that isn\u2019t part of the base budget.\n\nThe cost of the military operation, not previously reported, underscores the Trump administration\u2019s determination to move as quickly as possible to shift the enforcement of the US southern border \u2014 traditionally a domestic law enforcement function \u2014 into a military mission.\n\nThe total cost of the operation across the federal government remains unclear. Those figures do not include money spent by the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community and other agencies who have also surged government assets to the border, where President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency.\n\nThe administration sees those growing costs \u2014 which for now must be moved from other government programs because Congress has not directed new funding to the border \u2014 as necessary to combat what Trump has termed an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants and fentanyl.\n\nUnder Trump, the intelligence community for the first time listed cartels as the first threat facing the country in its annual threat review. And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a memo outlining his priorities for the Pentagon, labeled defending the US homeland from \u201cunlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking\u201d as the military\u2019s \u201cforemost priority.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that the Trump administration is inflating the nature of the threat relative to other priorities \u2014 like countering China and Russia or combatting terrorism \u2014 and that shifting military assets away from those efforts risks national security.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland Security has for years looked to the Pentagon for assistance in times of border crisis, the latest surge also comes against the backdrop of very few border crossings. Migrant crossings dramatically declined after an executive action by former President Joe Biden last summer that clamped down on asylum. They have continued to plummet, with only a couple of hundred people illegally crossing the US-Mexico border daily, according to Homeland Security officials.\n\nInside the military commands responsible for carrying out Trump\u2019s strategy, officials say the ballooning mission is often throwing expensive defense resources at problems that either already had law enforcement solutions or weren\u2019t a problem to begin with.\n\nA number of high-profile initiatives have already been scaled back, either because they were too expensive to have the military do them or because they weren\u2019t needed in the first place.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re not even building a plan\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even building a plan. It\u2019s almost, like, they\u2019re just like, here\u2019s more toys. Go do something,\u201d the second defense official said.\n\nDefense officials said the costs are only expected to rise as the Pentagon attempts to execute on Hegseth\u2019s directive to make the border the \u201cforemost priority,\u201d potentially putting them beyond what was spent in Trump\u2019s first administration, when annual spending on military activities at the border was estimated to have cost between $1 billion and $2 billion. \u200b\n\nAs of March 1, there were around 9,000 active duty troops at the border, according to US Northern Command. A second defense official said the troops have primarily been building barricades, putting up concertina wire, and generally \u201cjust standing around.\u201d\n\nThe US military last week deployed two warships to patrol near the border, which will add significantly to costs. And it surged surveillance flights on the border and in international airspace around the Baja Peninsula beginning in February.\n\nThe administration has also been considering a plan to have Northern Command take command of a swath of territory along the border by designating it as a military installation, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n\nMigrants who cross in this area would be put into \u201cholding\u201d for trespassing onto a military property, until the Department of Homeland Security could arrive to pick them up and deport them \u2014 putting the military in the position of effectively detaining migrants, something it is traditionally a law enforcement function. The military is prohibited from carrying out domestic law enforcement under the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, but by describing the zone as a \u201cholding\u201d area, DoD could feasibly circumvent that law.\n\nThis photo from the US Navy shows the holding tents that were build for detaining migrants at the US Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in February. U.S. Navy/AFN Guantanamo Bay Public Affairs/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, a number of early efforts have sputtered.\n\nMilitary deportation flights have slowed to a trickle because the Department of Homeland Security has not actually needed the large and expensive military C-17s to help transport migrants, multiple officials said. Only one military flight per week is taking off on average, holding a handful of migrants.\n\nAnd the US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\u2014which Hegseth in January touted as a \u201cperfect place\u201d to hold as many as 30,000 migrants\u2014is nearly empty. A significant portion of the 900 troops surged there last month to handle an influx of deportees could soon be sent home, officials said.\n\nThe deployments to the border are \u201cclearly more about optics,\u201d a defense official said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez and Angelica Franganillo Diaz contributed to this story."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nWith an unelected billionaire taking a wrecking ball to the administrative state and the president\u2019s Cabinet giving away national secrets, it can be easy to forget that the president is treating the crypto industry like an open-source ATM.\n\nYou may remember that Donald Trump launched a novelty cryptocurrency in January \u2014 followed by one for the First Lady \u2014 making over $100 million off trading fees. But just this month, Trump\u2019s business interests also announced the launch of a third cryptocurrency, a murky crypto SPAC plan from Trump Media executives, and a crypto investment fund with a major exchange two days after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the end of a formal probe into the company. With Trump\u2019s crypto ventures speeding up, I spoke with Corey Frayer \u2014 a senior adviser to former SEC chair Gary Gensler \u2014 about crypto\u2019s new attitude under a lax regulatory environment and the \u201cunthinkable\u201d conflicts of interest that could still be on their way.\n\nSince you left the SEC in January, what has been the greatest change you\u2019ve seen so far?\n\nI would say the very first change was the political retribution against the staff at the SEC who had worked on crypto policy. A great example is that one of the top crypto litigators was reassigned to the IT department.\n\nIt sends the message that the decisions of financial regulators aren\u2019t guided by independent expertise in the markets; they are generated by a desired policy outcome dictated by politics. Plus the dismissal of important and well-founded enforcement actions has sent a message to the markets that the largest firms and platforms can do whatever they like without fear of accountability. Investors and the little guys are on their own.\n\nThis week, Trump\u2019s family announced a stablecoin the day before Republicans introduced new legislation on that type of cryptocurrency. Then his team also launched a new ETF with Crypto.com a day before the SEC ended its probe of that company. It\u2019s confusing to me why the president needs an ETF or a stablecoin.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not confusing in the context of this president. Crypto has just been another addition to the portfolio of conflicts of interest that Trump and his family have.\n\nTrump\u2019s businesses have been riddled with conflicts of interest since he entered politics. How much different are his crypto interests?\n\n\ufeffThere are many avenues in crypto where this creates what would\u2019ve been otherwise-unthinkable incentives and conflicts for the most powerful office in the United States.\n\nWe saw that Justin Sun made an enormous investment in Trump\u2019s business World Liberty Financial after the election. Then his case was dismissed by the SEC that had recently come under the leadership of a Trump appointee. We saw it with the news that World Liberty Financial was engaging in negotiations with Binance, whose former CEO had pleaded guilty to criminal charges. There does seem to be a huge advantage to being associated with Trump businesses in terms of being released from enforcement cases.\n\nAs someone concerned with investor protection, what would you like to see Democrats do here to counter this?\n\nDemocrats should be in unified opposition to anything that puts the economy and investors and consumers at risk.\n\nHave we seen that unified opposition over the past two months?\n\nWith regard to crypto? No, not at all. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee supported a stablecoin bill that legitimizes crypto but also holds it to a far lesser standard than almost any other part of the financial system.\n\nI\u2019m wondering how much more could the president get out of crypto? Do you see this expansion continuing until the market tanks or he is checked somehow?\n\nYeah, I mean, Trump knows a good grift when he sees one. There are a lot of people who have said that Trump doesn\u2019t really understand crypto. And while that may be true at a technological level, I don\u2019t think I have ever seen anyone so quickly master the pump-and-dump business model of crypto like he did with his meme coin.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen anything so far, and I think it would be delusional to think that if the SEC isn\u2019t even going to continue prosecuting fraud charges that there will be any credible oversight and accountability of the crypto industry.\n\nDo you see Trump\u2019s crypto interests bleeding over into other aspects of his administration?\n\n\ufeffIt has been reported that HUD, for example, is considering moving to crypto and stablecoins for some of its grant issuance. USAID \u2014 what\u2019s left of USAID \u2014 may look to pay out some of its grants and other obligations in stablecoin. You have this dangerous and extremely unpopular technology that the president is in a position to force adoption over. So there are a lot of people who are going to be put in harm\u2019s way, even if they didn\u2019t choose to expose themselves to the volatility and dangers of the crypto markets.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting philosophical point. If the government is forcing Americans to be exposed to crypto, it\u2019s very much in contradiction to the original decentralized vision of this form of currency.\n\nDespite the crypto community claiming it wanted to be outside the purview of the government, it has banged down the door to be part of the mainstream financial system with the approval of the bitcoin ETF and dozens of filings that have come into the SEC since Inauguration Day. There is no remainder of the crypto ethos except for a desire to benefit from the lack of government oversight and regulation.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "It\u2019s that time again! Photo: Graeme Sloan/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nBoth parties have plenty of reasons to look forward to next year\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans can test out the MAGA hypothesis that Donald Trump is building a new majority coalition that will last for decades. Democrats will rely on the more plausible historical precedent that the president\u2019s party almost always loses ground in midterms.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait until 2026 for some electoral tests of Trump 2.0 and its counterrevolutionary chaos. This year will offer an assortment of special and off-year contests of considerable importance in themselves, which may also provide leading indicators of elections to come. Here\u2019s an overview in chronological order:\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court\n\nThe first cookie on the plate is a big one: an off-year judicial election in the battleground state of Wisconsin (the closest state in the country in 2024; Trump carried it by a margin of 0.86 percent). Whichever side wins this race will have a majority on the seven-judge court, where liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority. Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate and Dane County judge, is facing Brad Schimel, the conservative Waukesha County judge.\n\nCrawford is a former Democratic gubernatorial aid who has been an outspoken defender of abortion rights and critic of Republican voter-ID laws. Schimel has campaigned with Donald Trump Jr. and Charlie Kirk and posed with a huge inflatable image of Jr.\u2019s dad. So there\u2019s no mistaking the contrast, or the potential stakes, including litigation over election rules and possibly a re-redistricting of Wisconsin congressional seats.\n\nBut it\u2019s the massive spending surrounding this race that underlines its national significance. The last big Wisconsin Supreme Court race in 2023, won by liberal candidate Janet Protasiewicz, smashed national records for judicial contests as total spending reached $51 million. This year\u2019s spending has already topped $90 million and will likely reach $100 million in the last week. While both candidates have received significant outside help via direct and independent contributions (Crawford has gotten indirect donations from Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker and global right-wing devil figure George Soros), it has been Schimel\u2019s heavy support from DOGE warlord Elon Musk that has electrified the matchup, as PBS Wisconsin reports:\n\nTwo groups funded by Musk have so far spent more than $13 million on the race, according to a tally by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice \u2014 with plans to spend around $20 million total.\n\nMusk donated another $2 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party on March 20, the same day the party gave $1.2 million to Schimel\u2019s campaign.\n\nSome of the money is going directly in the pockets of voters: One Musk group is paying Wisconsin voters $100 for signing a petition opposing \u201cjudicial activism,\u201d and Musk himself handed over two $1 million checks to voters after a Democratic bid to have them declared illegal vote-buying failed in the courts.\n\nTeam Crawford is delighted with the not-very-popular Musk\u2019s high visibility in Schimel\u2019s campaign, offering voters a chance to \u201csend a message\u201d to Musk and Trump about their ongoing demolition of federal programs and personnel. Increasingly the election is being described as a \u201creferendum on Elon Musk,\u201d an impression Musk himself is promoting by saying the contest \u201ccould determine the fate of the country\u201d or even \u201cthe entire destiny of humanity.\u201d Even if it doesn\u2019t tilt the Wisconsin election, the results could help determine the political fate of Musk and DOGE.\n\nCongressional special elections\n\nThere are currently four vacant seats in the House of Representatives with a fifth a near-certainty. Special elections will be held in Florida to fill two of them (vacated by onetime attorney-general nominee Matt Gaetz and Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz) on April 1, the same day as the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. While both districts at play are heavily Republican, Democratic candidates are benefiting from massive small-donor contributions, as NBC News reports:\n\nGay Valimont, a gun-control activist who is running in Florida\u2019s First Congressional District, raised nearly $6.4 million from January 9 to March 12, five times more than Republican Jimmy Patronis, Florida\u2019s chief financial officer, according to new fundraising reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAnd Josh Weil, a teacher running in the Sixth District, raised $9.3 million, a haul more than 16 times larger than Republican state senator Randy Fine.\n\nWeil, in fact, was within four points of Fine\u2013less than the margin of error\u2013in a survey by St. Pete Polls this week, with Democrats out-performing Republicans in early voting despite a 2-1 disadvantage in registered voters. The possibility of a loss in this race may have had something to do, in fact, with Trump\u2019s decision to cancel Elise Stefanik\u2019s nomination to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations because her vote is needed.\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t need unlikely victories to make a splash, however: Since Trump carried the First District by 37 points last year and the Sixth District by 30 points, a respectable underdog showing would raise both eyebrows and currently depressed grassroots Democratic spirits. Punchbowl News suggests \u201canything less than a 20-point victory should raise alarm bells in GOP leadership ranks.\u201d\n\nSpecial elections for the seats of two recently deceased Democrats, Arizona\u2019s Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Texas\u2019s Sylvester Turner, will also be held this year. The Arizona election is scheduled for September 23; the Texas election date has yet to be established. Both districts are solidly Democratic but could see significant Republican efforts given recent Trump gains among Latino and Black voters.\n\nTwo big gubernatorial races\n\nRegularly scheduled off-year gubernatorial elections are often viewed as bellwethers for future national-political developments. This year\u2019s contests are in New Jersey and Virginia, where the incumbents (Democrat Phil Murphy in the former and Republican Glenn Youngkin in the latter) are term-limited. While these states are considered \u201cblue\u201d (New Jersey last went Republican in a presidential election in 1988, and Virginia last turned red in 2004), Republicans have found reason for optimism in both recently.\n\nIn the last New Jersey gubernatorial election in 2021, the heavily favored Murphy got a scare from Republican Jack Ciattarelli. And in 2024, Trump cut his 11.9 percent 2020 deficit in the Garden State to 5.9 percent. So local Republicans are optimistic. Ciattarelli is running again as a Trump loyalist, as is former radio-talk-show host Bill Spadea, while former legislative leader Jon Bramnick has been critical of the president. Democrats have a large field of credible candidates to succeed Murphy, including two members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation (Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer), two major-city mayors (Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City), a teachers-union president (Sean Spiller), and a former state legislative leader (Stephen Sweeney). Key factors in the race include how civil or uncivil the Democratic primary race becomes, and whether Trump\u2019s record damages the GOP brand in the state. The primary is in June.\n\nVirginia\u2019s gubernatorial race is less complicated. Former Democratic representative Abigail Spanberger, a nationally prominent centrist from north-central Virginia, is the presumptive nominee for her party. On the Republican side, the front-runner, incumbent Republican lieutenant governor Winsome Earle-Sears, drew relatively late opposition from two rivals who claim she is inadequately conservative; one is media magnet, conspiracy theorist, and former state senator Amanda Chase, who likes to call herself \u201cTrump in high heels.\u201d Earle-Sears is the strong favorite but will have to spend time and money best saved for November.\n\nRepublicans are hoping Youngkin\u2019s relatively strong popularity (and upset win in 2021) carries over to his successor, and also note that Trump improved on his 2020 performance in the Commonwealth significantly in 2024 (losing by 5.7 percent as opposed to 10.1 percent in 2020). But Virginia has a long history of electing governors from the party that does not control the White House, and Republicans could also suffer from backlash against Trump-Musk budget and personnel cuts in vote-rich Northern Virginia with its large number of federal employees and contractors.\n\nMayoral races, including the big one\n\nThere are a host of mayoral races in 2025 in cities ranging from Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, and Miami in the South to Cleveland, Detroit, Minneapolis, and St. Louis in the Midwest and Oakland and Seattle on the West Coast. Most major cities are Democratic-run with limited Republican competition, though three holding elections this year do currently have GOP mayors (Fort Worth, Miami, and Omaha). But national politics have a way of influencing local elections in times like these, and that\u2019s definitely true of the mayoral race that will draw the most national attention: New York\u2019s. Perhaps the Big Apple\u2019s Trump-influenced sort-of-Democratic incumbent Eric Adams has little hopes for reelection, but other Democrats will run as potential thorns in the president\u2019s side, and one prominent candidate, former governor Andrew Cuomo, has his own cozy relationships with Republicans (not to mention sexual-harassment complaints and a history of offending voters one at a time) to overcome.\n\nBallot initiatives\n\n2025 looks to be a quiet year for ballot initiatives, in part because the abortion-rights (and in a few states, abortion ban) measures that convulsed the country after the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 have reached their likely culmination for a while (mostly because many states with abortion bans and Republican legislatures don\u2019t allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments). At the moment, only two states have certified statewide ballot measures this year: Wisconsin, where Republican lawmakers put a voter-ID initiative on the ballot for the April 1 Supreme Court election in order to goose conservative turnout; Ohio, which has a bond initiative. But on March 27, Louisiana had a special election where four fairly technical constitutional amendments sponsored by Republican Governor Jeff Landry and approved by the legislature all lost badly, in part because they were poorly explained. The broad-based voter coalition that defeated Landry\u2019s initiatives could be an indicator that low public trust will make ballot measures difficult this year.\n\nNew measures could be certified later this year, and it\u2019s entirely possible we\u2019ll see more special elections for open congressional or important down-ballot offices. At every step of the way, and right on down to dogcatcher races, the turbulent record of the second Trump administration will be at least a minor, and in many elections a major, factor in the outcome.\n\nThis piece has been updated."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the most senior liberal on the Supreme Court, advocated for a \u201cfearlessly independent\u201d judiciary during remarks Friday, telling an audience in Washington that she is worried about \u201cstandards that are being changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s troubling so many right now is many of the standards that are being changed \u2026 were norms that governed officials into what was right and wrong,\u201d Sotomayor told an audience at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cOnce norms are broken then you\u2019re shaking some of the foundation of the rule of law,\u201d she added.\n\nSotomayor did not directly mention President Donald Trump, who along with his allies have flirted with defying court orders that have temporarily blocked him from enforcing some of his executive actions. But Sotomayor, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2009, was clear that she was speaking about current events.\n\n\u201cThe fact that some of our public leaders are lawyers advocating or making statements challenging the rule of law tells me that fundamentally our law schools are failing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOnce we lose our common norms, we\u2019ve lost the religion of law completely,\u201d she said.\n\nSotomayor\u2019s remarks came hours after the Trump administration filed its latest emergency appeal to the high court, asking the justices to let it temporarily enforce the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport certain immigrants. In that case, US District Judge James Boasberg is looking into whether the administration violated his order to temporarily halt deportations under the wartime authority.\n\nThe members of the high court have largely avoided discussing Trump and the legal whirlwind that has followed his first weeks in office. But Chief Justice John Roberts earlier this month pushed back on Trump in rare and short statement amid threats of impeaching judges who ruled against the White House.\n\n\u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\u201d Roberts, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, said in a statement. \u201cThe normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\u201d\n\nSotomayor offered more subtle remarks in February, telling an audience in Miami that she had faith the judicial system will withstand attacks.\n\n\u201cCourt decisions stand,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether one particular person chooses to abide by them or not, it doesn\u2019t change the foundation that it\u2019s still a court order that someone will respect at some point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the faith that I have in our system,\u201d she said."
