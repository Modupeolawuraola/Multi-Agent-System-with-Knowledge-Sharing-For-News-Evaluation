            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we bring you the findings from our new focus group of Black men who voted for Donald Trump in 2024. Plus, Trump withdraws Rep. Elise Stefanik\u2019s nomination to be U.N. ambassador amid concerns over the GOP\u2019s narrow House majority. And Jonathan Allen sifts through the White House\u2019s spin on the group chat episode.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nBlack men who backed Trump approve of his presidency \u2014 but raise some concerns about DOGE\n\nBy Bridget Bowman and Ben Kamisar\n\nA new focus group with Black men who voted for Donald Trump in swing states in November showed that nearly all of them remain staunchly with him, but that the Department of Government Efficiency and his tariffs are potential pain points.\n\nThe group of 12 voters \u2014 who participated in a recent focus group observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 Deciders series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago \u2014 included six independents, four Democrats and two Republicans. Ten of them stood by their 2024 vote, with the remaining two saying they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump again if given a do-over.\n\nDOGE: The results were far more mixed when it came to Elon Musk and DOGE. Five said they approved of DOGE\u2019s actions, three said they disapproved and the rest weren\u2019t sure yet.\n\nAmong those backing DOGE, the spending audits and cuts were seen as bringing a bit of the private sector to government work, aimed at increasing efficiency of employees paid by taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cEvery company needs someone to audit them. You shouldn\u2019t be an untouchable, you shouldn\u2019t be a sacred cow,\u201d said Dorris S., a 56-year-old independent from Pennsylvania. \u201cThey\u2019re there to maximize productivity and efficiency. I used to manage restaurants, we had health inspectors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas A., a 49-year-old Democrat from Georgia who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and switched to Trump in 2024, said that while DOGE is doing \u201csome good,\u201d he\u2019s concerned about the power Trump has delegated to Musk. He also wondered if DOGE\u2019s work could be antithetical to a push to improve the economy and help everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too focused on cutting the weeds and the clutter, but he needs to focus on the economy and how to help people,\u201d he said of Trump.\n\nTariffs: Only three out of 12 participants affirmatively said Trump is making battling inflation a top priority, with those who said so largely connecting it to his threats to enact sweeping tariffs or cut government spending. The two voters who disapproved of Trump after voting for him both raised concerns about tariffs.\n\nDemocrats: Still, this group of voters was down on the Democrats, using words such as \u201cliars,\u201d \u201cuntrustworthy,\u201d \u201cungodly,\u201d \u201ca weird agenda\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d to describe the party today.\n\nRead more from the focus group \u2192\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump pulled the nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, citing concerns about the House\u2019s slim margin to enact his legislative agenda. Stefanik will remain in Congress, where Speaker Mike Johnson said she would have an unspecified leadership role.\n\nA federal judge ordered Trump administration agencies involved in a group chat on an attack on Yemen to \u201cpreserve all Signal communications between March 11 and March 15.\u201d\n\nSens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., the chair and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, formally requested the Defense Department\u2019s acting inspector general to launch an investigation into the leaked Signal chat about U.S. military strikes in Yemen.\n\nTrump threatened to place \u201cfar larger\u201d tariffs on the European Union and Canada than planned if they work together to retaliate in response to his tariffs.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it plans to cut 10,000 full-time jobs across several agencies.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a high-security prison in El Salvador where deported Venezuelans are being held.\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nSifting through the White House spin on the leaked Signal chat\n\nAnalysis by Jonathan Allen\n\nIn the days since Trump administration officials saw a group chat go public, the White House and its allies have worked hard to spin the sins.\n\nTrump has attacked the journalist who was apparently inadvertently included in the Signal thread, The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg. And the president\u2019s amplifiers have suggested the fault lies with the National Security Council for letting Goldberg in.\n\nThis telling puts National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the hot seat \u2014 absolving the rest of the senior officials in the chat \u2014 and diverts attention from the most alarming aspects of the episode.\n\nThe White House would like to gloss over that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared military operation plans against the Houthis outside of secure government communications systems.\n\nSimilarly, Trump\u2019s team would prefer if no attention was paid to the fact that several Cabinet secretaries, the White House chief of staff and a White House deputy chief of staff appeared to have chosen not to object to using a commercial app that allows users to delete messages.\n\nAdministration officials note that the strikes against the Houthis were successful, as though arriving home safely is a justification for reckless driving.\n\nWhite House officials and Attorney General Pam Bondi have insisted that none of the information was classified. That\u2019s also a distraction. Even if the information was classified, there\u2019s no world in which the White House would admit all of those people would be careless with this information. It\u2019s also irrelevant as a practical matter because Bondi would never prosecute department and agency leaders.\n\nNone of these excuses serve Trump well. They don\u2019t make him look stronger or more committed to national security.\n\nAs NBC News reported Wednesday, it\u2019s not just Democrats calling on Trump to fire someone. There are MAGA Republicans who think Trump should find someone to take the fall. If he doesn\u2019t, that risks leaving a stain on him. And there\u2019s no spinning out of that.\n\nRelated reads:\n\nTimeline: The Trump administration\u2019s shifting stance on the Signal chat debacle, by Alexandra Bacallao and Alexandra Marquez\n\nA DHS staffer faces serious punishment for accidentally adding a reporter to a group email, by Julia Ainsley\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f National implications: The Wisconsin Supreme Court race is emerging as the first big test of Democrats\u2019 anti-Elon Musk playbook as the party searches for a winning message after its loss to Trump in November.

            "full_content": "Stefanik, probably wondering if it was something she said. Photo: Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nYou have to figure Elise Stefanik has been getting pretty antsy lately. She announced way back on November 10 \u2014 so long ago that DOGE was just an evil glimmer in Elon Musk\u2019s eyes \u2014 that Donald Trump had offered her the Cabinet-level position of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. It must have seemed like a pretty sweet gig: no management responsibilities at all, but a lot of public attention (just like her predecessor Nikki Haley), and the chance to please The Boss by attacking his growing list of global enemies.\n\nThere was one catch, though: Stefanik\u2019s confirmation by the Senate (expected to be a breeze) was postponed until after April 1, when two House vacancies in Florida created by earlier Trump appointments (Matt Gaetz as attorney general, briefly, and Michael Waltz as White House national security adviser) would be filled by a special election. Before then, the fragile GOP majority in the House meant Stefanik had to stay in that chamber to supply her vote on big measures like the House budget resolution and the continuing resolution that kept the federal government running. Once those were out of the way, and two new Floridians sworn in, Stefanik would finally be able to head to the U.N. building and take the next step up the ladder that some figured would eventually make her a presidential possibility herself.\n\nBut just a few days before the Florida special elections, lightning struck, via a Trump post on Truth Social:\n\nSo instead of strutting her stuff on the international stage and burnishing her \u201crising star\u201d image, Stefanik will be stuck in the House as just another slave to Trump\u2019s every whim.\n\nWhat happened? Well, if Trump is telling the truth (never a given), there remains the fear that even with fresh troops from Florida, the margin in the House is too narrow for comfort with the \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d implementing the president\u2019s legislative agenda still on tap and not sure to reach the House floor until late spring or even summer. With Stefanik\u2019s seat vacated and with a Democratic governor of New York able to delay filling it for some time, all it would take is two or three defections (depending on absences) to screw everything up and derail tax cuts, budget cuts, a debt-limit increase, and all the other weighty items planned for the budget reconciliation bill.\n\nWhat you have to wonder is why this situation wasn\u2019t evident before Stefanik was nominated, as GOP senator Lisa Murkowski remarked shortly after the announcement:\n\nMurkowski reacting to Stefanik being pulled because of tight margins in the House.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey just realized that now?\u201d \u2014 haley talbot (@haleytalbotcnn) March 27, 2025\n\nThe perilous situation of House Republicans was actually worse at the beginning of this Congress, before two House Democrats died. Are there new jitters about Mike Johnson\u2019s ability to manage his troops? Is it possible Republicans are afraid they\u2019ll lose one of those Florida special elections, or perhaps the New York special election Stefanik\u2019s departure would have triggered? Is the myth of Trump 2.0 as a fast-moving and irresistible force crushing all opposition perhaps slightly hollow? Or is this all a ruse and the extremely ambitious House Republican Conference chair said or did something to displease the man upstairs (meaning Trump, not God)?\n\nThat\u2019s unclear, but for the moment it sucks to be Elise Stefanik. Not that long ago she was on the shortlist to become Trump\u2019s running mate and presumptive political heir. Now she\u2019s a prisoner of the House, a body that is determined to surrender all its power to Russell Vought and Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s thunderbolt taking away her nice new job included an explicit suggestion that she will \u201cjoin my administration in the future,\u201d and that\u2019s no small thing, particularly given the high likelihood that the GOP will lose control of the House in 2026 making House Republicans even less significant than they are today. But who knows what the future will bring and which jobs will be open when Stefanik\u2019s mere floor vote stops being essential? Nah, it would have been better if the New York representative had arranged to be first in line to quit her House seat after the election."

            "full_content": "Photo: Kena Betancu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIf the capitulation of Columbia University to President Donald Trump was, in retrospect, inevitable, it was still among the darker moments in the modern history of academia. A prestigious, powerful institution that was, theoretically, dedicated to the concept of academic freedom had decided, in a matter of days, it was better to do what Trump says than fight back. In exchange for keeping $400 million in federal funds, Columbia agreed to hire three dozen campus police officers who will have the power to arrest students. They will appoint a senior vice-provost with authority over the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies and the Center for Palestine Studies, and require students wearing face coverings during protests to present university identification when asked.\n\nAll of these actions \u2014 especially the hiring of a new provost \u2014 will chill speech at Columbia and inevitably impact other institutions, since the Trump administration is currently abusing civil rights law to investigate 60 colleges for alleged antisemitism. Any kind of nonviolent protest or opinion expressed that is contrary to the U.S. government\u2019s position on Israel\u2019s war in Gaza could lead to federal harassment. And green-card holders, as we now know, are no longer safe. The Trump administration, with limited resistance from Columbia, is attempting to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a protest leader and former student. These are McCarthyite tactics.\n\nWhy did Columbia fold? An Ivy League colossus famed worldwide, Columbia boasts an endowment of almost $15 billion and countless well-heeled alumni. Much of the endowment cash has strings attached, but strings, for a university, can always be played with \u2014 if $400 million is an enormous sum, it\u2019s still the sort that can be partially made up elsewhere through pieces of the endowment or future fundraisers. Certainly, the many successful and liberal graduates of Columbia would be happy to cut checks to a university that stands up to Trump.\n\nThe grimmer reality is that Columbia administrators and trustees probably wanted this. Some are simply Israel hawks who loathed the protests against the war in Gaza. None were actually violent or even reached the peaks of the 1968 anti-war occupations, but they offered optics that the elites of Columbia did not particularly like. Jewish students did complain, and if protests critical of a foreign nation-state are not, by definition, antisemitic \u2014 I am an American Jew, and Israel does not speak for me \u2014 there are always stray radicals in any large movement who spout ugly words. They deserve censure.\n\nWhat Trump has done goes far beyond that and will likely suppress debate and research around one of the more vital topics on earth. Can a Columbia professor, as an academic exercise, even teach the concept of anti-Zionism or the displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 Palestine War? Can a student feel safe to pen an anti-Netanyahu op-ed for the campus newspaper? Or peacefully hold a sign at a campus rally? Columbia\u2019s administrators have made it clear they will not support their students and faculty if the hammer of the federal government comes crashing down upon them. In fact, they\u2019ll gladly pick it up and start swinging it themselves.\n\nWhat American colleges and universities need now are wartime leaders. We do not actually live in a fascist state. Trump is not sending federal troops to colleges to lock up noncompliant administrators, and he\u2019s not jailing any faculty. He is trying to abuse immigration law to torment the most vulnerable among us \u2014 non-citizens who reside here legally. But colleges are led by American citizens. They have a duty to use their privilege to stand up to Trump. A good example of what this spirit might look like is across the northern border, where Doug Ford, the Ontario premier, has become a national hero for resisting Trump. Canada is in a vulnerable position, but Ford doesn\u2019t care. He was elected to fight for his province and he\u2019s doing just that \u2014 and other Canadian leaders have gotten the message.\n\nIt might sound trite, but it\u2019s usually true: Bullies aren\u2019t used to getting hit and will back down when challenged. Columbia\u2019s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, obviously has no appetite for a public-relations war against Trump. But other college presidents must understand that Trump is going to keep crushing them if they don\u2019t recover whatever spine they have left and begin battling for academic freedom. Many of them are obsequious bureaucrats who aren\u2019t used to such pursuits, but that is the reality now in front of them. If they don\u2019t resist \u2014 daring Trump to revoke the federal funds, and heading to the public and their alumni networks to try to raise the cash to fill the budget holes \u2014 they will, like Columbia, have done deep and possibly irreparable damage to their brands. Columbia is wagering that people will soon forget about all of this; it\u2019s an Ivy League and students will always covet an elite institution in an elite city. That\u2019s probably true. But it\u2019s also true that the richest and highest achieving do have options. Alumni can close their checkbooks or dissuade their children from going to a school that gave in so quickly to an incendiary, unpopular president.\n\nThese next months will be telling. Either American colleges and universities believe in their mission or they don\u2019t. Either they fight for academic freedom, a concept that is as central to the functioning of an educational institution as water is to the human body, or they don\u2019t \u2014 and the slow rot in our higher-education system accelerates. Trump can only subdue colleges if they let him do it. He is not an emperor; he is not even Xi or Putin. He is a culture warrior who sniffs weakness. So far, he\u2019s been right. Academic administrators have been capitulators and collaborators. Maybe, though, not all of them are. There might be a few principled leaders left. Let\u2019s see if they emerge."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA veteran AP photographer and top White House correspondent testified Thursday that the news organization has struggled to compete in its coverage of the Trump presidency since White House\u2019s decision to limit its access to presidential events, the Oval Office and Air Force One.\n\nEvan Vucci, the chief photographer for the AP in Washington, testified during a hearing in his company\u2019s legal challenge to the White House ban that since the organization has had its access severely curtailed, it\u2019s \u201creally struggling to keep up\u201d with its competitors, particularly during major news events that have happened during the opening weeks of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hurting us big time,\u201d Vucci said at one point in response to questions from the news organization\u2019s attorney, Charles Tobin. \u201cWe\u2019re basically dead in the water on major news stories.\u201d\n\nAP\u2019s chief White House correspondent, Zeke Miller, testified Thursday on the impact the limitations have had on the outlet\u2019s work, telling the court the outlet was forced to report in a \u201cdelayed fashion\u201d and that its coverage did not have \u201cthe same level of completeness.\u201d\n\nThe AP, one of the world\u2019s biggest news outlets and wire service that\u2019s used by local publications around the world, was singled out by the White House over its refusal to substitute \u201cGulf of America\u201d for \u201cGulf of Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe issue was underscored, Vucci said, during the contentious Oval Office meeting last month between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The administration\u2019s decision to ban Washington-based AP photographers and reporters from the Oval Office meant the organization had to rely on one of its foreign-based photographers to capture visuals of the event.\n\nBut that person, Vucci said, lacked the experience and skill he has that allow him to transmit photos back to his editors for wider distribution within seconds. The foreign-based photographer was able to attend the event as part of the group of reporters covering Zelensky, not Trump specifically.\n\n\u201cWe just absolutely got slammed in the play,\u201d Vucci said. \u201cWe got destroyed.\u201d\n\nVucci said during his testimony that the AP\u2019s photographs reach some 4 billion people globally and stressed that the organization\u2019s absence from certain White House events in recent weeks is meaningful to the public.\n\n\u201cAssociated Press photographers are the gold standard,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course it matters to the public. \u2026 It\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Associated Press says it was blocked over style guide 03:15 - Source: CNN Associated Press says it was blocked over style guide 03:15\n\nPressed by Tobin on what he knows about how the White House is now choosing which photographers can now attend certain White House events, Vucci said he was \u201cclueless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rhyme or reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows.\u201d\n\nUnder cross-examination by Justice Department attorney Brian Hudak, Vucci struggled to answer specific questions about how the AP was harmed financially by the White House, saying he wasn\u2019t the best person to speak to those details.\n\nAnd later, when US District Judge Trevor McFadden asked if, as an artful photographer, Vucci has changed how he snaps pictures of the president since the ban has been in effect, he pushed back strongly on the idea.\n\n\u201cMy approach doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a professional.\u201d\n\nVucci took the famous photograph of Trump raising his fist moments after surviving an assassination attempt during a campaign rally last summer. Asked about the image on Thursday by Tobin and Trump\u2019s own embrace of it, Vucci described it as \u201can iconic photograph.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing is the AP\u2019s latest shot at convincing McFadden to order the administration to restore the outlet\u2019s full access to White House events. The Trump appointee had declined in late February to issue a temporary restraining order that would have done just that. Now, Tobin is pressing the judge to issue a preliminary injunction in his client\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cAP has now spent 44 days in the penalty box,\u201d he told the judge just after the proceedings got underway.\n\nSofter questions for Trump?\n\nMiller testified that he has observed \u201csoftening\u201d of the questions asked by other outlets during presidential events since the restrictions were imposed.\n\nMiller he said had noticed, in reading transcripts and other coverage of the outlets that are participating in such pool events, that there had generally been a \u201csoftening of tone and tenor\u201d in the questions being asked of the president by other journalists in the pool.\n\nAnd since AP reporters must rely on reporting from other journalists for pool events the outlet is locked out of, Miller said it was possible that such a \u201csoftening\u201d was impacting his company\u2019s ability to adequately cover the news.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re missing out on,\u201d he said.\n\nMcFadden, who was appointed by Trump, returned to the \u201csoftening\u201d claim at the end of Miller\u2019s testimony, asking if there were specific outlets or examples he could point to.\n\nMiler did not identify any particular outlet, but said he had noticed that outlets in the pool were asking fewer questions about the \u201cnews of the day\u201d \u2013 meaning the big stories about the administration at a given time \u2013 and that some questions tended to be not on topic or irrelevant. He also recalled noticing in coverage of SpaceX\u2019s recent return of some astronauts that journalists were referring to the Gulf of Mexico as just \u201cthe gulf.\u201d Miller said it seemed they were trying to \u201cskirt around the issue.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nEver since news broke on Monday that top Trump officials discussed US military attack plans in a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has projected unflinching confidence.\n\n\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Hegseth told reporters Tuesday.\n\nBy Wednesday, however, other defense officials were increasingly skeptical of that, especially after The Atlantic magazine revealed the details that Hegseth shared in the Signal chat about the pending strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen, including the timing and types of aircraft.\n\n\u201cIt is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court-martialed for this,\u201d a defense official told CNN. \u201cMy most junior analysts know not to do this.\u201d\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz has been criticized for inviting Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg into the chat. And CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom were on the Signal chat, were grilled over two days of Congressional testimony.\n\nBut former national security and intelligence officials say it\u2019s Hegseth who looks particularly bad given the level of detail he shared.\n\n\u201cThe egregious actor here is Hegseth,\u201d said one former senior intelligence official. \u201cHe\u2019s in the bullseye now because he puts all this out on a Signal chat.\u201d\n\nInterviews with multiple current and former national security officials this week, including career military and civilian officials, reflect growing concerns about Hegseth\u2019s leadership at the Pentagon.\n\nThe group chat scandal is the latest in a series of what some officials say are examples of questionable judgment by the former Fox News host, as he has struggled to implement consistent and durable policies across the Defense Department in his first two months as secretary.\n\nSo far, several high-profile initiatives spearheaded by Hegseth inside DoD since he was confirmed in January\u2014 including several related to the southern border mission and a purge of \u201cDEI\u201d content\u2014have either been scaled back or rescinded as he has rushed to implement changes demanded by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nThe current and former officials said the rocky start underscores both Hegseth\u2019s inexperience and his freewheeling approach to leadership. Many of his orders are verbal and based on gut instinct rather than a deliberative, multi-layered process, people familiar with his methods said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a TV personality,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201c[A general officer] makes a recommendation, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 [Former Defense Secretary] Lloyd Austin would never be like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, go do it.\u2019 He\u2019d be like, \u2018We\u2019ll take it under consideration.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral DoD officials told CNN that Hegseth seems more preoccupied with appearances than with substance\u2014wanting to appear more \u201clethal\u201d than his predecessor and pulling resources from elsewhere in DoD to achieve that image.\n\n\u201cYour job is to make sure that it\u2019s lethality, lethality, lethality,\u201d Hegseth told reporters late last year. \u201cEverything else is gone, everything else that distracts from that shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, troops armed with M4 assault rifles were seen guarding Hegseth\u2019s plane at Joint Base Andrews. The security posture stood in stark contrast to the agents and service members who typically greeted Austin at the Maryland base, who were usually armed only with concealed handguns.\n\nWhile unusual, a spokesperson for Air Combat Command said the posture \u201caligns with standing orders for personnel, especially when operating in official capacities such as deployments or movements during missions.\u201d\n\nIn this still from video, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks to the press on March 26. Pool\n\nAt the southern border, thousands of troops surged there by Hegseth in recent months have primarily been building barricades, putting up concertina wire, and generally \u201cjust standing around,\u201d another defense official told CNN.\n\nHegseth also earlier this month ordered the deployment of two heavily armed warships to patrol the waters near the border, where they will primarily be supporting Coast Guard operations to interdict drugs. One of the warships\u2019 most recent deployments was to the Red Sea, where it was tasked with intercepting Houthi missiles and drones.\n\nThe deployments to the border are \u201cclearly more about optics,\u201d the defense official said. The official added that diverting troops and assets to patrol a mostly peaceful border was actually drawing them away from training exercises that could improve overall combat readiness.\n\nAs for the Signal chat, Hegseth has insisted that nothing classified was shared over text, but four people familiar with the matter told CNN that the information Hegseth disclosed on the Houthi group chat was classified, despite the administration\u2019s claims to the contrary. One of the people said they saw documents sent within DoD about the operation, which were marked classified and included the same information Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat about specific weapons platforms and timing.\n\n\u201cIt was classified when it was shared below the principal level,\u201d this person said.\n\nHegseth could have declassified the information himself, but he has not said that he did. It\u2019s also unclear why information about an imminent or ongoing operation would be declassified before it was successfully completed.\n\nThe White House, for now, is standing by Hegseth in the wake of the Signal chat scandal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office of the White House on March 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump said his national security adviser Mike Waltz had taken responsibility for creating the Signal group, but the president seemed unaware of the role Hegseth played in including detailed information about airstrikes in the chat.\n\n\u201cIt was Mike, I guess, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said when questioned about which of his team was behind the chat. Earlier, the White House said a team of officials from the National Security Council and White House counsel\u2019s office were looking into the matter, assisted by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nYet while Trump said Waltz had assumed responsibility for the error, he shrugged off any culpability on the part of his defense secretary, who sent a timeline of the planned attack before it was underway.\n\n\u201cHow do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,\u201d Trump said, sounding surprised a reporter would raise the issue. Earlier, the White House said Trump had looked at Hegseth\u2019s messages that were included in the text chain published by The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a witch-hunt,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe White House on Thursday morning declined to offer an update on its internal investigation into the Signal group chat of top Trump national security officials, calling the episode a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\n\u2018This does absolutely nothing to make us stronger\u2019\n\nHegseth, who served as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, was confirmed by a razor-thin margin in January as Democrats and some Republicans pressed him on allegations of sexual misconduct, infidelity and excessive drinking in his past.\n\nIn his first appearance on the world stage as Defense Secretary, Hegseth told NATO in February that Ukrainian membership in the alliance was off the table \u2014 a statement that Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly called \u201ca rookie mistake\u201d that took away some of the US\u2019 negotiating leverage in pending ceasefire talks.\n\nHegseth later said he would not be involved in the negotiations over ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWicker is now formally asking the administration for an inspector general report on the Signal chat, plus a classified briefing from a senior official.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Wednesday called on Hegseth and other top Trump officials to own their mistakes related to Signal group chat revelations so that they are not repeated. \u201cThe important thing here is these guys, they made a mistake, they know it. They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,\u201d Thune said.\n\nAsked by CNN if he has confidence in Hegseth, Thune again did not directly answer and pointed to the success of the underlying mission. \u201cThe execution of the strike looks like pretty flawless,\u201d he said before again urging the officials to come clean.\n\nBut the strikes have not appeared to deter the Houthis. On Thursday, the Israeli military has said that sirens sounded in several parts of the country Thursday after two missiles were fired from Yemen. The Houthis took responsibility for the attack.\n\nA purge of \u201cdiversity\u201d content on Defense Department websites, mandated by Hegseth in a February memo, is being reviewed following outcry over DoD\u2019s hasty removal of historically significant articles and images. A top DoD spokesperson was reassigned over the debacle, and Hegseth\u2019s spokesperson, Sean Parnell, acknowledged last week that mistakes were made. He said DoD is now republishing some of the tens of thousands of pieces of content that were removed.\n\n\u201cOf all the things they could be doing, the places they\u2019re putting their focuses on first are really things that just don\u2019t matter \u2026 This was literally a waste of our time,\u201d a defense official told CNN of the content purge. \u201cThis does absolutely nothing to make us stronger, more lethal, better prepared.\u201d\n\nDirectives hit legal setbacks\n\nMeanwhile, military deportation flights have slowed to a trickle, because the Department of Homeland Security has not actually needed the large and expensive C-17s to help transport migrants, multiple officials said. Only one military flight per week is taking off on average, holding a handful of migrants.\n\nAnd the US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\u2014which Hegseth in January touted as a \u201cperfect place\u201d to hold as many as 30,000 migrants\u2014is nearly empty. A significant portion of the 900 troops surged there last month to handle an influx of deportees could soon be sent home, officials said.\n\nSeveral of Hegseth\u2019s directives\u2014issued at Trump\u2019s behest\u2014have also hit legal setbacks. A federal judge last week indefinitely blocked DoD\u2019s ban on transgender service members, dealing a major defeat to a controversial policy the president resurrected from his first term.\n\nAnother federal judge ordered earlier this month that DoD and other federal agencies reinstate probationary employees who were fired at the direction of the Office of Personnel Management. Defense officials warned superiors at the time that such mass firings could be illegal, CNN reported last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (L), Vice President JD Vance (C) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth participate in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in the Oval Office of the White House on February 07, 2025 Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nOne of the few directives Hegseth has put in writing, a recent strategic guidance memo overhauling the Pentagon\u2019s priorities, appeared to some defense officials like it was more about messaging than substance, amounting to a written pledge by Hegseth to fulfill several of Trump\u2019s favorite military-related promises.\n\nThe memo, reviewed by CNN, did not have a separate section detailing the threat posted by Russia, for example, but it did include vague directives to ramp up border operations and even develop credible military options related to the Panama Canal.\n\nHegseth ultimately rose to the rank of Major before leaving the National Guard in 2021, and has the least experience of any Senate-confirmed defense secretary in recent history.\n\nHis immediate predecessor Austin, a four-star general, served for 41 years and commanded US Central Command; former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper served as the Secretary of the Army before being confirmed as SecDef; and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, also a 40-year veteran and four-star general, commanded US Central Command as well before being confirmed as Trump\u2019s first secretary of defense.\n\nThe Signal chat fiasco has further highlighted Hegseth\u2019s greenness when it comes to the established protocols for dealing with a highly classified military operation involving airstrikes on a foreign country, a defense official said.\n\n\u201cThis is all indicative of his utter inexperience,\u201d the official said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Haley Britzky contributed to this report."

The alleged 24-year-old gang member, was arrested in the early hours of Thursday in Prince William County, Virginia.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, who was present for the raid along with FBI Director Kash Patel, said in a news conference that the man was \u201cthe leader for the East Coast, one of the top three in the entire country, right here in Virginia, living half an hour outside of Washington, DC.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is an illegal alien from El Salvador, and he will not be living in our country much longer,\u201d Bondi said.\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed Thursday afternoon in the Eastern District of Virginia, Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, a citizen of El Salvador was taken into custody Thursday on an outstanding administrative immigration warrant. He was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm. Federal agents found several firearms in the residence.\n\nNo attorney was listed for the defendant on the court documents.\n\nThe arrest was executed by a new interagency task force established by the Trump administration to target transnational organized crime and coordinate ongoing immigration enforcement efforts across Virginia. Its creation was part of a crackdown by the Trump administration on foreign gang members residing in the United States.\n\nWhile officials did not explicitly say whether the man will be deported, the administration is working to pay El Salvador to imprison immigrants that it said have committed crimes and have been expelled from the US. MS-13 deportations, particularly of leaders, who are a priority for Salvadoran officials, and Trump officials agreed, CNN has previously reported.\n\nOne such effort included the deporting C\u00e9sar Humberto L\u00f3pez-Larios, CNN reported, an alleged top leader of the MS-13 who US investigators believe has information that could implicate top Salvadoran government officials in possibly corrupt deals with the violent gang. The Justice Department quietly dropped charges against L\u00f3pez-Larios and returned him to El Salvador earlier this month."

The findings show that the United States' 25% tariffs on Canada and Canada's retaliations could inflict meaningful damage in key states for U.S. politics.\n\nThe analysis was conducted before the Republican president announced Wednesday that he was placing additional 25% tariffs on imported autos and parts starting on April 3.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of today\u2019s escalation in this destructive tariff war will not be contained to Canada, as much as the U.S. administration would like to pretend,\" said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThrowing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America\u2019s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.\u201d\n\nNearly half of what San Antonio exports, with its aerospace, auto and energy sectors, goes to Canada. About 40% of what the auto-driven Detroit area exports also goes to Canada. Trump's wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were crucial for his overall victory in November's presidential election \u2014 and Milwaukee and Pittsburgh also rank in the top 10 for exposure to a trade war with Canada.\n\nOther cities most dependent on exports to Canada include Kansas City, Missouri; Louisville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; Columbus, Ohio; Chicago; and Cleveland. All of those states aside from Illinois backed Trump in the last election.\n\nTrump has placed 25% tariffs on many goods from Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on energy products from Canada. Some of those tariffs have been suspended or delayed, though they're set to fully hit in April.\n\nCanadian leaders have warned that the United States would suffer in the form of higher prices, fewer jobs and slower growth because of the trade war. But an analysis by the Brookings Institution found that the economic pain would be more severe in Mexico and Canada because those countries are more reliant on the United States in terms of trade.\n\nTrump's stated reason for the tariffs is to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he's also said that he dislikes the trade deficit with both countries and has taunted Canada by suggesting that it could become the 51st U.S. state."

That practice is typical among federal courts.\n\nBoasberg is also currently overseeing the case challenging Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, where he has been fighting with the Justice Department to obtain more information on deportation flights that left the US in possible defiance of a court order.\n\nTrump and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, have repeatedly criticized Boasberg for his handling of the migrants case, even calling for his impeachment, drawing a rebuke from much of the legal community, including Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe Signal chat case is likely to draw their attention to the judge again if Boasberg pushes for more information from top administration officials or orders a change in agencies\u2019 approach to using encrypted apps.\n\nThis post has been updated with more about the judge."

Photo: Richard Meek/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images\n\nThe one constant through the years, James Earl Jones famously said as he stood in the middle of a cornfield, has been baseball. And as long as baseball has been a constant, so too has the umpire. The looming figure in blue with a booming voice and the personality of a junkyard dog has always been a unique character in the timeless nine-inning drama that is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 America\u2019s pastime. But the 2025 baseball season, which gets underway in earnest on Thursday, could serve as a curtain call for those all-too-fallible arbiters of the game.\n\nBaseball has been undergoing some pretty dramatic changes. The sport may still be timeless in a sense, but it is now timed. Spring training this year has featured another seismic twist: the chance for the pitcher, catcher, or batter to overturn the umpire\u2019s ball or strike call with a camera array called the Automatic Ball-Strike system, or ABS.\n\nSince 2008, instant replay has assisted umpires in ruling on home runs and other key plays. And since 2014, teams have been allotted two replay challenges for calls they don\u2019t like. But in any other era, the very idea of reversing an umpire\u2019s pitch call would be unthinkable. No longer. Witness Jazz Chisholm\u2019s challenge of a punch-out and his insouciant jog to first base last week before the call was officially overturned:\n\nJazz didn't even wait to see if he was correct \ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/rF2aTizST1 \u2014 Talkin' Yanks (@TalkinYanks) March 18, 2025\n\nFor now, robo-umps are in the trial phase; ABS won\u2019t debut in the regular season until 2026 at the earliest. But if this really will be the final season umpires do their primary job unassisted, what do we stand to lose as we replace one more facet of humanity? Or put another way: If players, managers, and the crowd have nothing to yell at the umpire or no reason to boo them any longer, is it still really baseball?\n\nUmpires have often relished their near-dictatorial authority and the built-in antagonism they provoke from players and coaches. There\u2019s an old quote from Bill \u201cCatfish\u201d Klem, one of the most famous umpires of all time, who said a pitch \u201cain\u2019t nothing until I call it.\u201d He might have been arrogant, but he was also correct: According to the rules, a pitch is only a strike when the umpire says it is. Yes, there are strike-zone parameters in the official rules (from \u201cthe hollow beneath the kneecaps\u201d to \u201cthe midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants,\u201d as if that clears things up), but umpires have never really followed them. The zone has always been fluid and at the umpire\u2019s capricious discretion; every baseball autobiography and retired player\u2019s podcast is full of stories of umpires, after getting into it with a certain player, retaliating with an awful call. Klem, by the way, had a habit of ejecting players just for calling him \u201cCatfish,\u201d a nickname he hated.\n\nRetired umpire Doug Harvey reveals in his wild autobiography (modestly titled They Called Me God: The Best Umpire Who Ever Lived) the often-suspected assertion that umpires \u2014 not him, though \u2014 will unfairly speed up a meaningless game so they can go home. Later in the book, Harvey describes one of the most important lessons he learned from another legendary (and hotheaded) umpire, Al Barlick: \u201cIf you make a call, hang with it.\u201d This ethos has guided umpire comportment for generations, cemented the ump\u2019s role as a lightning rod for players and fans, and enabled another cherished spectacle of baseball: the managerial ejection, from Bobby Cox\u2019s and Lou Piniella\u2019s clockworklike temper tantrums to the GOAT of baseball dismissals, courtesy of Phillip Wellman.\n\nWhile arguing and booing them is cathartic (listen to the crowd roar as Steve McMichael threatened notoriously inaccurate umpire \u00c1ngel Hern\u00e1ndez), it\u2019s ultimately at least partly a charade. The ump\u2019s \u201cOkay, you got everything out\u201d quip at the end says it all in this famous donnybrook:\n\nTechnology has complicated this delicate balance. In the aughts, baseball installed QuesTec pitch-tracking technology in every ballpark, and ESPN\u2019s K-Zone and Fox\u2019s FoxTrax (now called PitchCast) superimposed approximated strike zones onto viewers\u2019 televisions. QuesTec allowed teams and umpires to analyze every pitch, while the televised strike zone led to a Rashomon effect in which fans saw one thing and umpires another, creating (further) distrust in their work.\n\nThis explosion of data revealed to ball clubs the strike-zone biases of each umpire. Thus in the 2010s, it became standard for catchers to \u201cframe\u201d their pitches with sleight of hand that tests the limits of human perception.\n\nAnalytics determined a good framer is worth two to three wins a season. Accordingly, teams have staffed their front offices with experts like Josh Ruffin, of the Minnesota Twins, a former military data analyst with national-security clearance. The recently retired umpire Jim Reynolds, now MLB\u2019s umpire supervisor, tells a story that illustrates what a hall of mirrors ball-and-strike calling has become: \u201cI had one conversation with a Dodgers catcher \u2014 I\u2019d ball a pitch and he\u2019d be mad because their own statistics said that I should have called that a strike.\u201d\n\nUmpires had a trove of new data at their disposal too, and their accuracy improved. Since 2008, called strikes outside the zone have decreased 5.5 percent, and called balls in the zone have dropped 14.3 percent. Yet robot umpiring has seemed inevitable to many in the baseball world. The development of ABS wasn\u2019t due to one single event, according to Morgan Sword, MLB\u2019s executive vice-president of baseball operations. It came more from a desire to fix important missed calls, combined with the opportunity to try out various systems in Triple-A when MLB took over operations of the minor leagues in 2021. They tested two approaches \u2014 full ABS, in which the umpire is a passive observer and listens for a beep in his ear when a strike has been thrown, and a challenge system \u2014 and surveyed fans about it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m oversimplifying a bit, but there are two camps of fans,\u201d Sword explained. \u201cThose that believe that the camera technology exists and that we should use it to get every call exactly right. Then there\u2019s a camp that feels that baseball is a human game and part of what you\u2019re coming to see when you buy a ticket is the drama that unfolds with human officials and that baseball would be losing something if you took the home-plate-umpire judgment out.\u201d\n\nThe challenge system is a compromise, Sword said. The human element is retained for the vast majority of the game (in which each team throws 150 pitches on average), but teams can invoke the technology to intervene at important moments. Each team gets two chances a game, and if a challenge is successful, they get to keep it.\n\nTriple-A managers, who have spent two seasons working with both approaches, speak highly of the one MLB settled on.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I like about the system is that if you give the umpire immediate feedback, they can calibrate almost immediately,\u201d said Morgan Ensberg, manager of the Durham Bulls, a Tampa Bay Rays affiliate.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t put everything into the umpire\u2019s hands,\u201d said Shelley Duncan, manager of the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, a Yankees affiliate. \u201cNow, it really becomes about the players, and it\u2019s almost peaceful. As a manager, I don\u2019t have to worry about getting angry at the umpires nonstop. I mean, we\u2019ve all been to a game where somebody in the stands yells at the umpire, \u2018It\u2019s not about you. You\u2019re not the one we paid to see.\u2019 It takes that away.\u201d\n\nThe full-time ABS format had several problems. The electronic strike zones seemed different in each ballpark, said Dick Scott, manager of the Syracuse Mets, adding that the umpire\u2019s reduced role made everything awkward: \u201cWhen the hitter didn\u2019t like the call, the bench would start barking and the umpire would just point at his ear like \u2018That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling me.\u2019 It was \u2026 too generic. The challenge system is good for everybody. It makes the umpires focus. It\u2019s still pressure, but I think umpires are better than people think they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the entertainment business, and you don\u2019t want to get rid of the human element,\u201d said Toby Gardenhire, manager of the St. Paul Saints, a Minnesota Twins affiliate. \u201cBut if you get a 3-2 count in the bottom of the seventh inning with the bases loaded and the game\u2019s on the line, what you don\u2019t want is for a really bad pitch that\u2019s off the plate to get called strike three. Now at least we have the ability to make a challenge.\u201d\n\nThese managers all hinted at something without quite saying it: The interaction with an umpire \u2014 the ability to complain and be heard by a human who\u2019s in charge, rather than one who\u2019s subservient to a machine \u2014 is vital. After all, baseball is a noisy game, full of chatter. In sports where such back-and-forth isn\u2019t so integral, humans are already being replaced. Racing sports such as track and swimming surrendered most officiating to machines decades ago, and tennis has followed suit on line calls, retaining just a chair umpire. Bennis officials aren\u2019t entwined in the aesthetics of their game the way umpires are in baseball. Nor, for that matter, are referees in football, basketball, and hockey. The controversies in NFL and NBA officiating seem endless, but if their referees were replaced by technology, it\u2019s hard to believe many fans would miss their presence, even though they take over the stadium\u2019s PA system to explain calls.\n\nThe real cautionary tale of technological encroachment in sports right now involves soccer, where referees play an outsize role in matches, often deciding the outcome of a game with one call or non-call. The video assistant referee was designed to help them, yet it has worsened the viewing and playing experience. As the instant-replay system checks every goal in slow motion, it often finds insignificant fouls or violations a referee wouldn\u2019t have called in real time \u2014 to the detriment of the game. Plus, the mandatory check can take several minutes before a decision is reached, which kills the stadium vibe among fans and players in a sport known for its tense buildups and eruptions of euphoria.\n\nResearchers have found high distrust of VAR. Fans of underdog soccer teams view the technology as something stacked against them and suspect it\u2019s being used for the benefit of bigger teams and bigger stars \u2014 just as many football fans claim the Kansas City Chiefs benefit from generous refereeing. Studies have shown that fans largely view human mistakes as part of the drama and debate of the game and that VAR both drains soccer of authenticity and sanitizes it: Every sports fan learns early on that feeling cheated by incompetent refs is a timeless, comforting excuse following a loss.\n\nThat seemed to be one reason full-time ABS felt wrong. While the use of \u201crobo-umps\u201d is an admission of human fallibility, isn\u2019t fallibility central to the fun of sports in general? Any game whose outcome is certain isn\u2019t worth playing. Also, there is something undignified about a human \u2014 especially the self-assured umpire type \u2014 becoming subservient to a machine.\n\nHistorian Surekha Davies recently wrote, \u201cBy deciding what robots are for, we are defining what humans are.\u201d Human labor, with its imperfections, is increasingly viewed as a costly, unreliable obstacle to an optimized society \u2014 hence all the self-service checkout kiosks and the ubiquity of ChatGPT. But the rise of machines leaves people uneasy. To borrow from Russian literature, what umpires really represent is the same notion Dostoyevsky was getting at in Notes From Underground: embracing irrationality over utopia as the price of salvaging the soul. Free will (and its capacity for even atrocious decision-making) is what makes us human.\n\nEven though the league had enough leverage in labor negotiations with the umpires union to win the right to test and implement ABS, league officials seem mindful of what umpires bring to the game \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deep philosophical question embedded in this test that I think is causing strong reactions from baseball fans and the people around the game,\u201d Sword said. \u201cWhat is the virtue of getting every call right, exactly? And is that the goal? It\u2019s a more difficult question than you would think.\u201d\n\nJames Earl Jones\u2019s point about baseball in Field of Dreams is that it helps mark time in a changing world. And baseball\u2019s many changes throughout the past century reflect society\u2019s changes: desegregation; the cultural turn westward; and, more recently, optimization and shorter attention spans. Change has made baseball\u2019s constancy possible. But as the sport hugs technology ever closer, its greatest assets are still what they always were: wood bats, leather balls and gloves, and a bunch of humans chatting, cheering, yelling at, and booing one another."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe fear and loathing among lawyers in Washington, DC, has never been greater.\n\nAfter a series of White House executive orders threatening their business and hiring practices, several powerful Washington law firms face a defining choice: push back publicly in defense of their industry or quietly hope to avoid President Donald Trump\u2019s wrath.\n\nMany firms are afraid that if they are targeted by Trump, it could devastate their business if both clients and partners flee, reconfiguring the centers of power in Washington\u2019s most influential private industry.\n\n\u201cWe could see a shakeup like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Ivan Adler, a headhunter for lobbyists who regularly works with Washington\u2019s law firms. \u201cThis is the talk of the town. Firms are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nInterviews with nearly a dozen lawyers and legal industry professionals shed light on the quiet fear gripping many law firms with decades of history doing business in Washington.\n\nA number of major firms are strategizing behind the scenes on how to react without attracting attention in wider political conversations, according to several people in Washington\u2019s legal community. Firm leaders, sources tell CNN, want to quell fears among their lawyers, especially younger associates who may be more likely to want the firms to take a stand politically against Trump.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s executive orders have targeted four large law firms \u2013 Perkins Coie; Jenner & Block; Covington & Burling; and Paul, Weiss, Wharton, Rifkin & Garrison. Among other things, lawyers at those firms have had their national security clearances suspended \u2013 a core piece of some legal defense work.\n\nSeveral lawyers who spoke to CNN expressed disappointment with the general lack of response from the legal industry and in Paul Weiss\u2019 situation, the capitulation to Trump\u2019s targeting with the firm leader\u2019s choice to cut a deal.\n\nTrump suggested Wednesday that universities and law firms are \u201cbending\u201d to his administration\u2019s will as he\u2019s targeted top legal firms that have represented his perceived political enemies.\n\n\u201cYou see what we\u2019re doing with the colleges, and they\u2019re all bending and saying, \u2018Sir, thank you very much. We appreciate it,\u2019\u201d Trump said at a White House event marking Women\u2019s History Month. \u201cNobody can believe it, including law firms that have been so horrible, law firms that, nobody would believe this, just saying, \u2018Where do I sign? Where do I sign?\u2019 \u2026 And there\u2019s more coming, but we really are in the \u2018Golden age of America.\u2019\u201d\n\nRather than fight an executive order, the New York dealmaking powerhouse law firm Paul Weiss agreed to provide $40 million in legal work to causes backed by the White House, including veterans\u2019 assistance and countering antisemitism, according to an email chairman Brad Karp sent firmwide on Sunday that was obtained by CNN.\n\nSeveral lawyers in Washington privately griped about Karp backing down from a fight against Trump. Several dozen alumni of Paul Weiss this week also published an open letter \u201cto protest the firm\u2019s recent decision to surrender to the Trump administration,\u201d the letter said.\n\nBut some legal industry insiders weren\u2019t surprised nor were they outraged by Paul Weiss\u2019 move.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for lawyers to \u201clook at all of your options,\u201d Cari Brunelle, a legal industry consultant, told CNN. \u201cSometimes you choose to litigate, and sometimes you choose to settle. It\u2019s what you do for your clients every day.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Anderson Cooper on \u2018chilling message\u2019 Trump is sending to law firms 03:09 - Source: CNN Anderson Cooper on \u2018chilling message\u2019 Trump is sending to law firms 03:09\n\nFor instance, an amicus brief being drafted in support of Perkins Coie has gotten few signatures from leaders at other firms, several people familiar with it say.\n\nThe White House is drafting more executive orders that would target more firms, according to two people familiar with what is in the works.\n\nAt the same time, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sent letters to another handful of law firms announcing a \u201creview\u201d of their diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Retaliation for DEI initiatives has been part of the White House executive orders against law firms, making those firms contacted by the EEOC especially concerned.\n\nIf law firms don\u2019t stand together, the president would be able to \u201cwipe out any potential legal opposition,\u201d Elliot Peters of the West Coast-centric litigation firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters.\n\nPeters said he believed Trump\u2019s actions so far add to a reality where Congress no longer pushes back against the president, and as Trump also tries to silence the press.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well on our road to an authoritarian government here,\u201d he said.\n\nKeker has been one of the few major US law firms willing to make a public statement criticizing the executive orders against law firms.\n\nPerkins Coie faces major challenges\n\nThough a number of firms are potentially at risk, the situation is particularly dire for Perkins Coie, according to a number of people familiar with the matter, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe White House announced it was blacklisting a number of its lawyers from federal buildings and potentially punishing its clients if they contract with the government, sending an immediate chill across the firm\u2019s everyday operations, sources said and according to a court case the firm has brought against the administration.\n\nAgencies have pulled back from working with the law firm, and one recent meeting was canceled for the firm at the Justice Department related to an ongoing client matter, sources and the firm\u2019s lawyer have said.\n\nDane Butswinkas, an attorney representing Perkins Coie in its challenge to the executive order, told a judge recently that the White House\u2019s approach would \u201cspell the end of the law firm.\u201d\n\nDistrict Judge Beryl Howell this month ordered the administration to stop many of the ways agencies could restrict Perkins Coie lawyers, deeming much of that executive order unconstitutional.\n\nThe American Bar Association along with dozens of other voluntary lawyer groups across the country have pushed back against the reticence across the profession to speak out.\n\n\u201cWe will not stay silent in the face of efforts to remake the legal profession into something that rewards those who agree with the government and punishes those who do not,\u201d a statement on Wednesday said. \u201cWe call upon the entire profession, including lawyers in private practice from Main Street to Wall Street, as well as those in corporations and who serve in elected positions, to speak out against intimidation.\u201d\n\nEven so, the White House continued its campaign against law firms on Tuesday, announcing more restrictions.\n\nJenner & Block was targeted with another executive order partly because one of its former well-known partners, Andrew Weissmann, had been a top prosecutor on the Russia investigation around Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, according to the White House. Jenner & Block is also working on several lawsuits challenging Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nA Jenner & Block spokesman, in a statement, acknowledged the firm had been named in Tuesday\u2019s executive order but didn\u2019t indicate how the firm would respond.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients\u2019 interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher and Evan Perez contributed to this report."

For many outlets, this is still the case, particularly those publishing super-secretive group chats of powerful government officials who seem eager to trample on the rights of the press. But for others, like the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, both of which have seen their benefactors bend a knee to Donald Trump and sacrifice the integrity of their newspapers in the process, ownership has become a problem. A problem that the Guardian US, the American arm of the British newspaper, has exploited.\n\n\u201cAll around us, media organizations have begun to capitulate,\u201d editor Betsy Reed writes in the current fundraising appeal at the bottom of each Guardian article. \u201cThe Guardian has neither a self-interested billionaire owner nor profit-seeking corporate henchmen pressuring us to appease the rich and powerful. With the new administration boasting about its desire to punish journalists, and Trump and his allies already pursuing lawsuits against newspapers whose stories they don\u2019t like, it has never been more urgent, or more perilous, to pursue fair, accurate reporting. Can you support The Guardian today?\u201d\n\nThe asks themselves are not new. The Guardian for the past eight years has asked readers to donate in support of its journalism, a \u201creader revenue\u201d program that helps the paper exist without a paywall. But the appeals have gotten more strident \u2014 and more Trump-focused \u2014 since the Post and the L.A. Times withdrew expected endorsements for Kamala Harris last fall, and to great effect. The last week in February was the second-biggest week in U.S. reader-revenue history for The Guardian; the biggest was the week of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe Guardian US expects to hit $44 million in voluntary reader donations in the U.S. and Canada this year, up 33 percent over last year, with some people supporting on a recurring basis and others giving one-time contributions. A first-person account by a Canadian citizen detained by ICE, for example, netted $105,000 in pledged donations. These contributions account for more than 60 percent of the American operation\u2019s total revenue, which last year exceeded costs by $16 million (the rest of its revenue comes from advertising and philanthropic support from foundations). The amount that people are contributing on a pledged basis doubled in October \u2014 the month that Jeff Bezos pulled the Post\u2019s endorsement for Harris \u2014 and has stayed at that level every month since, according to internal data provided by The Guardian, which just surpassed 350,000 recurring supporters in the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur messaging does appeal to people to support our work as a kind of cause, and I think that works for a number of reasons,\u201d Reed said in a recent interview in her downtown office, \u201cbut one is that there is a real crisis of access to reliable information for people who don\u2019t want or have the means to subscribe to the New York Times. That is a real problem that we have an answer to.\u201d\n\nGuardian managing director Steve Sachs added that The Guardian\u2019s global perspective \u2014 the internal catchphrase of the U.S. operation is that it covers America for the world and the world for America \u2014 is also a draw at such a volatile moment in geopolitics. \u201cPeople are even more interested now than they were six months ago,\u201d he said. The Guardian US\u2019 audience is split 50-50 between American and global readers.\n\nThe Guardian launched its U.S. operation more than a decade ago and seemed to have a promising start, hiring high-profile columnists like Michael Wolff and Glenn Greenwald and winning a Pulitzer for reporting on widespread secret surveillance by the National Security Agency. But as the Obama era gave way to the Trump era, the close association of the Guardian US with surveillance-state reporting made it less relevant to American readers. Annual losses led to restructuring that hit the U.S. operation, once housed in an airy Soho loft, particularly hard.\n\nBut during the pandemic, the Guardian US, like other news outlets, experienced a surge in reader interest, readying it for an expansion in 2022 that included hiring Reed, formerly of The Nation and the Intercept, and Sachs, who\u2019d spent years on the business side of Time Inc. The audience has continued to grow, with Sachs noting that the site typically sees between 40 million to 50 million unique visitors a month. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a place where our audience is actually bigger in the U.S. than The Wall Street Journal\u2019s audience in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaders and organizations across the media industry have been trying to innovate in the way people can pay for news. Sachs says he\u2019s been increasingly asked about the no-paywall model, with others in the industry wondering whether they should adopt the same. \u201cIf you\u2019re creative enough, you can figure out some new things,\u201d he tells people. \u201cBut the question is, does it scale?\u201d If it\u2019s \u201canother half-million dollars, a million dollars, whatever, it\u2019s not worth the effort,\u201d he said. Other publications that were donations-focused, including Vox.com (which is owned by the same parent company as New York), have moved away to membership models as a result. \u201cThe reason I think that it works for us is we cover so much breaking news and it drives a lot of traffic, and we have the scale to make it work,\u201d Reed said. \u201cEven if we only monetize one percent, it\u2019s still a lot.\u201d Still, even scaled-up publications like the Guardian US have to contend with the fact that donations are very boom-and-bust.\n\nDespite The Guardian\u2019s strident anti-Trump fundraising pushes, its broader audience is less partisan, as is the tone of its news coverage. It\u2019s a weird line to straddle. \u201cThe appeals that you see at the bottom of articles are really framed around issues of press freedom and our identity and our structure of ownership,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThey are not appeals that say, \u2018Trump is bad, you need to support The Guardian, we are against Trump.\u2019\u201d Maybe not explicitly. But they are clearly benefitting from this moment and using the new money to hire, with expectations to continue growing its staff in the U.S. this year.\n\nThe big question is: Will it last? \u201cI mean, unfortunately, there\u2019s no shortage of global crises going on, from what\u2019s happening in the Middle East to Ukraine to what\u2019s happening in this country,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThe world is incredibly interested in the shitshow here. God, it\u2019s like they\u2019re rubbernecking at a car crash.\u201d"

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's immigration policies were deeply unpopular in his first term. Now, immigration is the area in which voters most approve of his second-term performance.\n\nTrump's advisers are betting that his gamble on tariffs will pay off in a similar way in time, rewriting the political rules, as well as global rules, to the United States' lasting advantage, they say \u2014 as Trump faces broad skepticism over the issue in current polling.\n\nTariffs on major U.S. trading partners, including close allies, have been a defining feature of Trump's second term, and more are coming: He has declared April 2 America\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d to establish reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners that have their own levies on U.S. imports, overturning decades of policy \u2014 and threatening chaos for businesses around the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office, predicting that the tariffs would bring in \u201ctens of billions\u201d of dollars. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ripped off on trade. We\u2019ve been ripped off on military. We protect people, and they don\u2019t do anything for us.\u201d\n\nIt's reminiscent of Trump's hard-line slugfests over immigration in his first term, from his proposed border wall to travel bans that were unpopular with voters and a bipartisan elite. But after President Joe Biden's border policies drew backlash, Trump won enough of that fight to turn immigration into a positive issue in the 2024 election. After his return to the White House in January, the field has shifted to make trade the next frontier, with Trump imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports from Mexico, Canada and China and preparing to move forward with additional tariffs on what could be trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods. It\u2019s a high-stakes move, pitting him against not just foreign allies but also a domestic coalition of business interests, free-trade advocates and others who have thrived in the status quo.\n\nAnalysts warn of chaos: supply chain shocks, higher consumer costs and fractures among Western allies. But Trump is betting big on a future in which voters and history vindicate him as the president who finally made globalization bend to U.S. will and brought jobs back home.\n\n\u201cThe second Trump administration will really be graded on how far along he can accomplish this agenda,\u201d said Nick Iacovella, executive vice president of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which supports tariffs. \u201cIf the president is successful over these next four years, 10 to 15 years from now we will look back and there will be massive gains in the manufacturing sector of the United States. We\u2019ll see rising incomes, real household income growth will increase, our GDP will increase. We\u2019ll be a manufacturing superpower again.\u201d\n\nAt a moment of political risk for Trump, Iacovella argued that volatility in the stock market shouldn\u2019t be considered a measure of health for ordinary voters and that Democrats performed poorly in the last election despite strong returns while the last administration was in office.\n\n\u201cDuring Biden\u2019s term, the stock market increased by more than 20 points on average, and the American people overwhelmingly just voted Biden out of office and kicked Democrats out of control of Congress,\u201d Iacovella said. \u201cThey gave single-handed control to Republicans. So the American people have pretty much made their voice on this clear.\u201d\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist and one of the architects of his populist political movement, noted the political risk for Trump as he has started rolling out his tariff agenda, pointing to elections next week for Wisconsin's Supreme Court and Florida's 6th Congressional District that could reinforce or challenge the agenda.\n\n\u201cIf we lose both of those\u201d on April 1, the tariff rollout on April 2 \u201cis going to be quite different,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cYou\u2019re already seeing it right now where he is taking potentially more targeted, less blanket, reciprocity. Part of that is the political reality.\u201d\n\nBut there is also belief that the politics could shift in the long term. \"It\u2019s one thing to bring manufacturing jobs back, but he\u2019s redoing the world system,\" Bannon said. \"The tariffs are the key economic instrument needed to accomplish that.\"\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he thinks \u201cpeople will be pleasantly surprised\u201d when reciprocal tariffs are announced on April 2, saying that in \u201cmany cases,\u201d these will be \u201cless than the tariff than they have been charging us for decades.\u201d\n\nCritics warn that such tariffs could lead to higher consumer costs and disrupt global supply chains. Stephen Moore, a member of Trump\u2019s economic task force in 2020, argued this week that steel prices are already rising sharply due to tariffs and threaten to place U.S. manufacturing industries at a cost disadvantage. Trump also faces pushback from European allies and murmurs from Japan and South Korea, partners who\u2019d rather tweak the system.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s team argues the old ways were never sustainable, pointing to manufacturing decline and trade deficits. Instead, it\u2019s wagering that any short-term pain will force a realignment for which future generations will thank him.\n\nFor now, polling shows flashing red lights on Trump\u2019s trade policies. Tariffs were Trump's worst issue among seven tested in a CNN poll this month, with 61% disapproving of his handling of tariffs. Immigration, meanwhile, was his best, as it was in a recent NBC News poll. That survey found 56% of registered voters in favor of his early performance on immigration and border security.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t always the case. During his first term, Trump waded through choppy waters on immigration. An NBC News poll from July 2017 found that 47% disapproved of his immigration and border policies, with 39% in favor. Sentiment grew worse over the following months, with one of Trump\u2019s advisers acknowledging on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that \"nobody likes\" the separation of migrant children from their parents that was happening at the country\u2019s southern border. By July 2018, his handling received 41% approval, with 51% opposed.\n\nSince then, views have shifted sharply.\n\nIn a 41-page document titled \u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System,\u201d Stephen Miran, now the chairman of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in November about his decadeslong \u201cdesire to reform the global trading system and put American industry on fairer ground\u201d against the rest of the world and the range of tools his administration could use to get there, whether through tariffs or currency policy.\n\nAmid warnings that tariffs could raise prices on everyday goods for consumers, Miran told Bloomberg this week that \u201cU.S. consumers are flexible. We have options. ... Countries that sell to the United States are inflexible. They\u2019ve only got the United States to sell to. There\u2019s no alternative. So they\u2019re the ones that will bear the burden of these tariffs.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs has advised investors that the initial tariff rate may be higher than expected when new measures are announced next week, as the administration hopes to begin negotiations from a strong position.\n\nYet Trump has hinted at flexibility, saying this week that he could soften his plans for reciprocal tariffs and \u201cmay give a lot of countries breaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to charge them what they\u2019ve charged us,\u201d he told reporters Monday.\n\nUsing 2017 as the base year, the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency, assessed in a report ordered by Congress that U.S. trade deals boosted U.S. economic output by $88.8 billion, or 0.5%. They increased overall U.S. employment by 485,000 full-time equivalent jobs, or 0.3%, based on a model that assumes the economy is at its long-run full employment level. It\u2019s a modest gain that Iacovella said fuels Trump\u2019s argument that past trade policies have failed U.S. workers, whom he and others said have been harmed by decades of the status quo.\n\nAnd change is overdue, said one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate. \u201cPresident Trump knows that American workers have been thrown under the bus for too long,\u201d Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThe Trump tariffs take the \u2018kick me\u2019 sign off the backs of these workers and prioritize Americans over foreign interests.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Next week\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court race is emerging as the first big test of Democrats\u2019 anti-Elon Musk strategy as the party searches for a winning message following its loss to President Donald Trump last November.\n\nTrump\u2019s billionaire adviser has been a major player in the technically nonpartisan judicial race. Musk\u2019s super PAC has emerged as the top spender in the contest, offered $100 to Wisconsin voters to sign a petition to oppose \u201cactivist judges\" and said it would give away $1 million to a petition signer. And Musk often posts about the election on his X feed.\n\nBetween that and his polarizing efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency to slash the size of the federal government \u2014 and polling that shows he\u2019s less popular than Trump, who endorsed conservative candidate Brad Schimel last week \u2014 Democratic-aligned groups and liberal candidate Susan Crawford have made Musk a major focal point in the race\u2019s final stretch.\n\nIt\u2019s a playbook that Democrats could seek to replicate elsewhere if it\u2019s successful in one of the country\u2019s tightest battleground states.\n\n\u201cDemocrats can\u2019t win against Trump right now,\u201d Brandon Scholz, a Wisconsin Republican strategist, said. \u201cThey can still beat the hell out of Musk.\u201d\n\nScholz argued that Democrats would risk juicing conservative turnout in the off-year election by attempting to make Trump, who narrowly carried Wisconsin on his way to winning a second term in the White House, the center of their strategy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Democrats want to draw [Schimel] to Trump, because that gives MAGA voters incentive to come out to vote,\u201d Scholz added.\n\nTuesday\u2019s race will determine the state Supreme Court\u2019s ideological balance for the second time in two years \u2014 and likely along with it the future of several key issues, including abortion rights, unions and congressional maps. Crawford is a state judge in Madison who earlier worked in the Democratic administration of then-Gov. Jim Doyle, while Schimel, a state judge in Waukesha County, previously was the state\u2019s Republican attorney general.\n\nCrawford and groups supporting her have criticized Musk\u2019s money and influence on the race on the airwaves.\n\nOne television ad from the Crawford campaign, which began running on cable and broadcast in the state Tuesday, features a former assistant district attorney from Madison claiming that Musk \u201cis trying to buy this election with ads that lie about Judge Susan Crawford.\u201d Another recent Crawford campaign TV ad accused Musk of \u201ctrying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court because he knows Schimel always helps his big campaign donors.\u201d\n\nCrawford has repeatedly used Musk as a foil at campaign events, and she attributed her latest fundraising haul to grassroots donations \u201cfrom folks who don\u2019t want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters are very animated by Musk,\u201d Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why you see us mentioning Musk in the campaign.\u201d Honeyman added the Crawford campaign wasn\u2019t planning to run any ads in the race\u2019s remaining days directly mentioning Trump.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Wisconsin has also been hosting a town-hall tour across the state called \u201cPeople v. Musk,\u201d with surrogates like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz using the events as platforms to further bash Musk and DOGE.\n\nAt one such event earlier this month in Eau Claire, Walz said Wisconsinites could use their Supreme Court race ballots to convey their disapproval of Musk\u2019s work in the federal government.\n\n\u201cThis is where you send a message,\u201d he said, adding that a Crawford win would mark a rebuke to Musk and represent \u201ccleaning the house \u2014 one chunk at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd America\u2019s first chunk of cleaning is Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, April 1,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to questions about the left\u2019s attempts to tie Schimel to Musk and about whether Schimel was seeking to link himself to Trump, Schimel campaign spokesperson Jacob Fischer said in an email that \u201cthe attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nA representative for Musk and a White House spokesperson who handles inquiries regarding Musk and DOGE didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nPolling shows Musk\u2019s favorability underwater\n\nRecent polling in Wisconsin and nationally suggests that DOGE\u2019s tactics are pushing voters\u2019 patience and that Musk has emerged as a riper political target than Trump for Democrats.\n\nPolling released this month from Marquette University Law School found that more registered voters in Wisconsin (53%) viewed Musk unfavorably than favorably (41%). By contrast, the survey showed that voters in the swing state were more split on Trump\u2019s job performance (48% said they approved; 51% said they disapproved) and on whether Musk\u2019s DOGE was properly carrying out Trump\u2019s agenda (47% said it was; 53% said it wasn\u2019t).\n\nA national NBC News poll released this month offered similar findings: More voters (51%) viewed Musk negatively than positively (39%) and more held negative views on DOGE (47%) than positive (41%). Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s job approval rating was split, with 47% approving and 51% disapproving.\n\nMusk endorsed Schimel on X in January days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a suit in Wisconsin challenging a state law banning carmakers from owning dealerships. The case could end up before the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe race is the most expensive state Supreme Court campaign in U.S. history \u2014 surpassing a record set in Wisconsin in 2023 \u2014 and there\u2019s already been more than $74 million in spending by the candidates and outside groups.\n\nMusk\u2019s America PAC is the top outside spender in the race at $12 million so far \u2014 including more than $5 million since just March 18 \u2014 focused largely on canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nA GOP-aligned nonprofit group with past ties to Musk, Building America\u2019s Future, is the third-biggest outside spender in the race \u2014 the ad-tracking firm AdImpact reports the group has spent more than $6.5 million on ads there so far. While Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have both reported that Musk helped to fund the group in the past, it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019s still involved.\n\nA spokesperson who handles questions for America PAC and Building America\u2019s Future didn\u2019t respond to questions.\n\nAnd Musk himself appears to have donated $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party across two donations in February and March. (While Musk hasn\u2019t personally confirmed the donations, the filings list his name and an address previously associated with his donations to America PAC.)\n\nBut overall, Democrats hold a slight ad spending edge in the race, according to AdImpact, outpacing Republican-aligned groups $31.1 million to $26.4 million through Wednesday.\n\nThe vast majority of ad spending from the pro-Crawford side comes from her campaign, while outside groups account for the bulk of the pro-Schimel ad spending. And overall, Crawford\u2019s campaign reported spending more than $21 million through March 17, compared with $9.5 million for Schimel\u2019s campaign.\n\nAside from the high levels of spending, there's also been a surge in early voting in the race, which kicked off last week. In-person absentee voting has already exceeded total levels during Wisconsin's 2023 spring elections, while total absentee voting is on pace to push past 2023 levels in the coming days.\n\nTrump makes a late entrance\n\nEven if he hasn\u2019t been front and center, Trump, who posted on Truth Social last Friday urging Wisconsin voters to turn out early for Schimel, has still been a presence on the campaign trail in Wisconsin.\n\nSchimel\u2019s campaign launched a TV ad that went on the air Wednesday touting the endorsement. Mailers paid for and placed by America PAC, for example, tout Schimel as the candidate who will \u201csupport President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nAnd two 30-second ads, funded by the Republican State Leadership Committee, which boosts GOP candidates in nonfederal statewide races, launched Friday just hours before the president\u2019s endorsement. Both emphasize how voters in Wisconsin just months ago delivered the state for Trump \u2014 and how a Crawford win could jeopardize his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cLast year we showed up for Trump and he won,\u201d a narrator says in one of the ads. \u201cPresident Trump needs us again.\u201d\n\nBut groups on the left have yet to run ads trying to weaponize the endorsement, according to an NBC News analysis of AdImpact data.\n\nMeanwhile, Schimel\u2019s views on Trump have long been in plain view. He appeared at a campaign town hall event this month with Donald Trump Jr. and recently told a group of canvassers from the conservative group Turning Point USA that Trump needs a \u201csupport network\u201d around him to help him fight the myriad suits his administration has faced. Schimel has also supported Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cSchimel needs Trump to win. He needs every MAGA voter to turn out to win,\u201d Scholz, the GOP strategist, said. \u201cHe wants to draw close to Trump.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (March 31, 2025, 11:31 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the amount of total spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. It is more than $74 million altogether, not $86 million by outside groups alone."
