            "full_content": "Elon Musk and Sen. Mark Kelly sparred on social media Monday, with the tech billionaire calling the Arizona Democrat a \u201ctraitor\u201d over a series of posts in support of Ukraine and its people.\n\nKelly said in his initial post Sunday that his trip over the weekend to the war-torn country, where he met with military members, nurses and others, had reaffirmed his commitment to not give up on the Ukrainian people. He added that any peace deal with Russia \u201chas to protect Ukraine\u2019s security and can\u2019t be a giveaway\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nKelly also criticized President Donald Trump, saying he was \u201ctrying to weaken Ukraine\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a traitor,\u201d Musk wrote on X on Monday, the platform he owns, in response to Kelly\u2019s posts.\n\n\u201cTraitor? Elon, if you don\u2019t understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do,\u201d Kelly responded.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe senator's trip came shortly after the Trump administration paused military aid to Ukraine in the wake of an explosive meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over what they called his lack of gratitude for U.S. assistance in the three years since Russia invaded his country.\n\nKelly also shot back at Musk, the head of SpaceX and architect of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, while speaking to reporters Monday on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s slashed and burned the federal government to make room for a giant tax cut for billionaires like himself. I\u2019ve sworn an oath to this country, I\u2019ve flown in combat, I served in the Navy for 25 years. It appears to me the oath that Elon Musk stands by is the oath to billionaires to make their lives easier, not the American people, not veterans,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a serious guy. He should go back to building rockets.\u201d\n\nKelly said that his Ukraine visit was emotional at times, and that he believes Putin needs to come out of any deal feeling like it was a \"bad deal\" for him.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is set to attend talks with Zelenskyy in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Rubio and other U.S. officials previously met with a Russian delegation to discuss peace negotiations.\n\nIn addition to efforts to drastically reduce U.S. government spending, Musk has faced criticism in the past over Ukraine.\n\nIn 2023, Musk thwarted a Ukraine attack on Russia's navy, and suggested in a Twitter poll in 2022 that Ukraine should allow Russia to take control of Crimea, among other concessions, as part of a peace deal.\n\nThe fiery exchange is not the first time Kelly and the tech billionaire turned Trump adviser have engaged in a public spat.\n\nLast month, Musk called Kelly a \u201cDem donor shill\u201d in a post criticizing his twin brother, also a former astronaut, and the Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen.\n\n\u201cHey @ElonMusk, when you finally get the nerve to climb into a rocket ship, come talk to the three of us,\u201d Kelly fired back."

            "full_content": "Love may be blind, but political differences can still be a deal-breaker.\n\nSuch was the case for two contestants on season 8 of Netflix\u2019s popular reality show \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Contestants Sara Carton and Virginia Miller shocked fans during last week\u2019s season finale when both turned down their respective matches, Ben Mezzenga and Devin Buckley.\n\nBoth women cited differences in political views as the key reasons for their reluctance, which has reignited discourse online about whether romantic relationships can thrive without political compatibility. Some viewers called out Carton and Miller for not wanting to be with their partners because they aren\u2019t \u201cwoke.\u201d Others praised them for staying true to their values.\n\nIn recent years, politics and dating has continued to be a hot topic, especially as the country has become more politically and culturally divided. A recent report from the Survey Center on American Life, a nonpartisan research group, found that \u201c73% of college-educated single women would be less likely to date a Trump supporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d which this season centered on Minneapolis residents, explores whether or not people can fall in love before they ever see each other in person. In \u201cpods,\u201d contestants date one other, talking through a wall for hours on end, and then meet face to face only after a proposal. They then spend the next few weeks deciding whether they want to go through with the wedding, which is all documented on camera.\n\nUntil recently, the show\u2019s storylines had largely ignored politics.\n\nLast season, which featured Washington, D.C., couples and was filmed before the presidential election, was the first time would-be couples asked each other explicitly how they voted.\n\nThis time around, political conversations were featured even more prominently as part of Carton\u2019s and Miller\u2019s journeys. Their decisions proved to be flashpoints online, with conservative figures like Tomi Lahren and Laura Ingraham criticizing Carton.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find him a nice, conservative 20-something girl,\u201d Ingraham wrote on X, sharing Lahren\u2019s clip of Carton and Mezzenga at the altar. \u201cHe\u2019ll look back and laugh at this.\u201d\n\nClaire Fallon and Emma Gray, co-hosts of the pop culture podcast \u201cLove To See It,\u201d said the season was a reminder that \u201creality TV is a reflection of our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is interesting how we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening in the dating market nationally right now play out repeatedly on this season,\u201d Fallon said in the most recent episode of the podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s like how are we supposed to settle down and get married if all of our options are people who are so opposed to the politics that matter to us?\u201d\n\nDuring the \u201cpods,\u201d Carton, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, told many of her suitors that her sister is a lesbian. Carton said she looks for a partner who believes in LGBTQ rights. She also asked some about their views on the Black Lives Matter movement, sharing that she got more engaged in social issues after the murder of George Floyd in her home city.\n\nHer match, Ben Mezzenga, a 28-year-old developer, said that he goes to church often but that he has \u201cno discomfort around that community at all,\u201d referring to LGBTQ people. He said he was \u201cignorant\u201d about politics and the BLM movement.\n\nIn real life, after their engagement but before the wedding, Mezzenga is seen meeting Carton\u2019s sister. Her sister appears hesitant that the two are made for each other. Carton also goes to church with Mezzenga to learn more about his beliefs and perspective.\n\nUltimately, at the altar, Carton turned Mezzenga down. \u201cBen, I love you so much,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always wanted a partner to be on the same wavelength. So today, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe tells her mom and sister after she leaves the ceremony that she worried that there was \u201cno curiosity coming from his side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked him about Black Lives Matter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m no expert, but when I asked him about it, he\u2019s like, \u2018I guess I never really thought too much about it.\u2019 That affected me.\u201d\n\nMezzenga is seen praying with his friends after Carton rejects him. During the reunion, he touched on Carton\u2019s reasons for saying no.\n\n\u201cI knew coming into this experience I definitely have had privilege in my life, and it\u2019s something I wasn\u2019t proud of and something I knew I needed to grow. And then coming into this I knew it was important to Sara in the pods. And so I wanted to be vulnerable and be like, \u2018Hey, I haven\u2019t given it much thought.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m embarrassed the way that our conversation had gone at the beginning there, but then we had great conversations about it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s just a definite impact on me, and I have Sara to thank for that. I know it\u2019s kind of sad that it took someone to make me think that way.\u201d\n\nCarton said that the two tried to date after the show wrapped to see whether they could make things work but that Mezzenga stopped talking to her until he eventually \u201csent scripted apologies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Miller, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, and Buckley, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had largely avoided talking politics until the 10th episode of the season, when they shared a candid on-camera conversation.\n\nBuckley said he wasn\u2019t \u201csuper big into politics\u201d and noted that his family typically has conservative views. Miller said that she didn\u2019t mind if the two shared different political opinions but that it would be \u201ckind of alarming\u201d if he was \u201cway on the other side of the spectrum\u201d on political issues that matter to her.\n\nAt the altar, Buckley said, \u201cI do,\u201d but Miller said, \u201cI love you so much, but I\u2019m just not ready.\u201d In her confessional during the finale, she mentioned politics but didn\u2019t elaborate further \u2014 until the reunion episode that aired Sunday.\n\n\u201cDevin told me a lot about his core values, something that he did not want to talk about on camera,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI still to this day don\u2019t feel really comfortable telling you Devin\u2019s views. But I will be very clear about mine. I 100% support the LGBTQ community. I also believe that women should have the decision to choose if they want to have an abortion or not. I also believe different religions should be valued. \u2026 These were really important things to me.\u201d\n\nBuckley, in response, said that in a relationship he can \u201clook past certain things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that you can be together and have a relationship and not completely agree on everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think a big thing for me, as a Christian, is to love everyone, regardless of how I feel about something.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Monday! It\u2019s another shutdown week in Washington. We have the latest on where things stand ahead of Friday\u2019s government funding deadline. Plus, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy headed to Saudi Arabia, Alexander Smith examines how the country has become an unexpected diplomatic force.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe two big questions looming over the shutdown fight\n\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: Congress is racing to avoid a government shutdown days out from the funding deadline.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson released a stopgap bill over the weekend to keep the government\u2019s lights on through the end of September. The measure, which Democrats had no part in crafting, includes an increase in military spending and a reduction in nondefense money, as Sahil Kapur, Scott Wong and Frank Thorp V report.\n\nIt will need to pass the GOP-led House and Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump before midnight Friday to avert a shutdown.\n\nThere are two major questions that will determine whether that becomes a reality.\n\nCan Johnson unite House Republicans? Johnson is eyeing a Tuesday vote in the House on the continuing resolution \u2014 and says he\u2019s relying solely on the support of Republicans to pass it.\n\nThat\u2019s a tall order in the House, where Republicans hold a 218-214 majority. That means Johnson can afford only one defection, assuming all Democrats oppose the bill and all members are present. And he\u2019s already likely lost one vote: Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has made clear he won\u2019t support the stopgap bill.\n\nThe challenge for Johnson will be keeping other conservative fiscal hawks in the fold, as well as Republicans who would prefer to see a bigger boost for defense spending. As he did during his speaker\u2019s race and the budget resolution vote earlier this year, Johnson has a key voice in his corner: Trump, who has publicly urged congressional Republicans to support the continuing resolution.\n\nSome House Democrats could end up supporting the bill and give Johnson more breathing room, but the party\u2019s leaders in the chamber are against the measure.\n\nWill Senate Democrats vote for it? If the bill manages to make its way out of the House, the pressure would then fall on Senate Democrats.\n\nRepublicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they will need support from Democrats to cross the 60-vote threshold. And like in the House, a Kentucky Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, has already said he will vote against it.\n\nDemocrats have demanded guardrails on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s attempts to slash federal spending, and they are under pressure from their base to more forcefully stand up to the administration.\n\nThe stopgap funding bill is one of the few major pieces of legislation they will have some leverage on this year in GOP-controlled Washington. But voting down the measure and allowing a shutdown, even if it occurs under a Republican trifecta, could cause even more pain for the federal workforce and those who rely on government services.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nPoll: Do you think the government will shut down? Vote in our poll:\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nAhead of Rubio-Zelenskyy summit, Saudi Arabia emerges as an unlikely global powerbroker\n\nBy Alexander Smith\n\nSaudi Arabia will host a key summit Tuesday between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is trying to repair relations with Washington following his disastrous Oval Office bust-up with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nIt\u2019s another soft-power coup for a country that has deliberately cultivated a reputation as a diplomatic go-between. Whether it\u2019s hosting American officials for negotiations to end the Ukraine war, orchestrating talks about the future of Gaza or rolling out the red carpet for Trump\u2019s first foreign trip, Saudi Arabia has emerged in recent years as an unlikely global powerbroker.\n\nLess than five years ago, then-presidential hopeful Joe Biden called the kingdom a \u201cpariah\u201d and, even after significant reforms, rights groups say the authoritarian Gulf state still has an \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record.\n\nTuesday\u2019s summit comes as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is attempting to transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s image from a deeply conservative, oil-rich theocracy whose officials murdered the American-based Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, into a regional giant built on diplomacy, business, tourism, entertainment and sports.\n\nTrump revealed last week that the first foreign visit of his second term would be to Saudi Arabia, just as it was during his first administration. As then, he said that, in return, the Saudis had agreed to invest a bonanza sum in American businesses, this time $1 trillion.\n\nThis relationship has raised questions about ties between Riyadh and the Trump family. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the former chair of the Senate Finance Committee, last year raised \u201cobvious conflicts of interest concerns\u201d about Saudi Arabia\u2019s $2 billion investment in a fund run by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has denied any such conflict.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMore on the Russia-Ukraine war: Courtney Kube, Kristen Welker and Carol E. Lee report that Trump has told aides that a minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine won\u2019t be enough to restart aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.\n\nTrump wants assurances that Zelenskyy is willing to make concessions in peace talks with Russia, such as giving up territory. And he wants Zelenskyy to make some movement toward elections in Ukraine and possibly toward stepping down as his country\u2019s leader.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \u2753 Who is Amy Gleason?

            "full_content": "As Democrats attempt to rebound from an underwhelming showing in the 2024 election, California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna is not only taking stock of the stinging defeat last fall, but also taking shots at his own political party.\n\nAfter watching Democrats swap nominees and struggle to deliver a cohesive message to voters in the last campaign cycle, Khanna told ABC News in an exclusive interview that he believes a political reform agenda focused on combating corruption \"is what we should run on in 2026\" and laments the political costs that came as Democrats campaigned on other priorities in 2024.\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Khanna said, adding he \"didn't hear any political reform agenda\" from President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris during their respective presidential campaigns. \"Trump became the outsider. It was a mistake we didn't run on the theme of reform. Getting money and lobbyists out of politics -- that should be our mantle.\"\n\nNow, Khanna is introducing the Drain The Swamp Act, which would permanently prohibit White House officials from accepting gifts from lobbyists -- reinstating a Biden-era mandate that established ethics and lobbying rules for appointees in the administration.\n\n\"Anti-corruption has to be core to rebuilding the Democratic brand,\" Khanna, serving in his fifth term, said. \"Democrats need to be seen as owning the mantle of reform.\"\n\nRep. Ro Khanna at the Capitol, Dec. 4, 2024. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images\n\nKhanna said he finds it striking that one of President Donald Trump's first acts of his second term was to sign an executive order to overturn Biden's order -- creating the impetus to craft an agenda that takes aim at Washington's revolving door between lobbyists and lawmakers.\n\n\"It's part of a broader sense that Democrats have to run on anti-corruption,\" Khanna said, complaining that the Democratic Party enabled Trump to \"co-opt\" the \"drain the swamp\" theme of anti-corruption. Khanna said it has cost his party not only two presidential elections in 2016 and 2024, but also majority control of Congress.\n\n\"We need to be zealous,\" Khanna said -- explaining his vision for a five-point anti-corruption agenda.\n\nKhanna wants to ban former members of Congress from ever lobbying Congress, and he wants to impose 12-year term limits for members and 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices.

Khanna also advocates for a \"binding code of ethics\" for Supreme Court justices amid ethics pressure on the court.\n\nA view of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, June 29, 2024. Kevin Mohatt/Reuters, FILES\n\n\"If Democrats want to rebuild, start with anti-political corruption,\" Khanna stressed, adding he has received a positive reception from a range of people such as billionaire Mark Cuban and even Republican voters who are supportive of his pledge to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nKhanna also calls for a ban on members of Congress and their families from holding and trading individual stocks during the member's tenure in office, as well as a ban on members of Congress and candidates running for House or Senate seats from accepting contributions from political action committees.\n\nAs for his own future political interest -- whether reelection, the California governor's mansion or even the White House in 2028 -- Khanna is keeping his cards close, but his options open.\n\n\"Ro believes that anti-corruption and economic patriotism need to be the driving themes of the Democratic Party for 2026 and 2028, regardless of who gets into the fray or leads the party,\" Sarah Drory, a Khanna spokeswoman, told ABC when asked about the congressman's political prospects.\n\nNevertheless, Khanna's profile continues to grow as he faces voters and weighs his future options -- sometimes even before Republican audiences on Fox News or in GOP-held districts.\n\nAfter Trump delivered a joint address to Congress last week, Khanna went on \"Fox News Sunday\" and admitted that it \"was not a good look\" as Democrats protested not only the president, but also rejected the invited guests in the First Lady's box.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an address to a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4, 2025.

Instead, we're talking about our own behavior. And that's a distraction from us getting out our economic message.\"\n\nKhanna will also hold three in-person town hall meetings during a \"Benefits Over Billionaires\" tour on March 23 in GOP-held districts, where his anti-corruption agenda will take stage alongside his progressive bona fides.\n\n\"It's smart to have a clear message,\" Khanna told ABC News. \"We're the party that's going to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\""

            "full_content": "Marco Rubio\u2019s going along to get along. Photo: Saul Loeb/Reuters\n\nLast week there was a now-infamous Trump Cabinet meeting in which (as we know from some intrepid New York Times reporting) Elon Musk clashed with high-ranking administration officials, most notably Secretary of State Marco Rubio:\n\nMr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubio\u2019s control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting on Thursday in front of President Trump and around 20 others \u2014 details of which have not been reported before \u2014 Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest. \u2026\n\nMr. Musk was unimpressed. He told Mr. Rubio he was \u201cgood on TV,\u201d with the clear subtext being that he was not good for much else. Throughout all of this, the president sat back in his chair, arms folded, as if he were watching a tennis match.\n\nAfter the argument dragged on for an uncomfortable time, Mr. Trump finally intervened to defend Mr. Rubio as doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d Mr. Rubio has a lot to deal with, the president said. He is very busy, he is always traveling and on TV, and he has an agency to run. So everyone just needs to work together.\n\nThis nasty incident was followed by Trump suggesting that his agency appointees, rather than DOGE, would be making spending and personnel cuts going forward, which was widely hailed in media outlets as a sign of a long-awaited collision between Musk and Trump. But then Trump proceeded to undermine the \u201cMusk has been put on a leash\u201d narrative by telling reporters (per Politico) that \u201che wanted cuts, and that Musk would remain a power center: \u2018If they can cut, it\u2019s better. And if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd now, just a few days after Musk was supposedly \u201creined in\u201d by Trump, Politico is reporting that Marco Rubio is very formally bending the knee to DOGE and even thanking Musk for the kick in the ass to gut foreign-aid programs:\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the United States is canceling 83 percent of programs at the United States Agency for International Development, thanking Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE team for its work amid reports of friction between the two men.\n\n\u201cThe 5200 contracts that are now canceled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio said in a post to X, the social media platform owned by Musk. \u201cThank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more likely than not that Trump\u2019s alleged brushback pitch aimed at Musk was mostly a ruse to deceive the federal courts and the public about who\u2019s at the wheel of his administration\u2019s effort to demolish the federal government and get rid of much of its workforce. But the other important thing to understand is that in the end it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Elon Musk, Russ Vought, Marco Rubio, congressional Republicans, or Trump himself who is pulling the trigger on any particular act of nihilistic destruction. They\u2019re all aiming in the same direction, which is a radically reduced, decapitated, and demoralized public sector dominated by a gang of corrupt billionaires who will receive their ultimate reward in big tax cuts later this year, paid for by the very budget cuts Republicans are now administering by any means necessary."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe United States wants to hear what concessions Ukraine would be willing to make in negotiations to end the war with Russia, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said ahead of a high-stakes meeting between the two nations on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe really want to sort of ascertain where they stand on this and what they\u2019re willing to do in order to achieve peace,\u201d Rubio told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe discussions in the Saudi port city of Jeddah comes as the relationship between Washington and Kyiv is at its lowest point since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago. Following a contentious Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the US announced a \u201cpause\u201d on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Russia has continued its deadly barrage of attacks against Ukraine in the time since that suspension was put in place.\n\nThe move followed weeks of antagonism by Trump towards Zelensky that has seen the US president repeat Kremlin talking points blaming Kyiv for the war and after Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff sat down in Riyadh with a high-level Russian delegation \u2013 and without Ukrainian participation.\n\nSpeaking Monday, Rubio said the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s meeting \u201cwill be key\u201d to whether the pause in military aid and intelligence sharing is lifted.\n\n\u201cI think if we emerge there with a good meeting that we feel good about and can report back to the president, then I think decisions will be made in regards to the pause,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN has reported that the US is still sharing intelligence with Ukraine that can help its troops defend themselves but has \u201cscaled back\u201d sharing any intelligence that Kyiv could use for offensive targeting of Russian forces, according to two US defense officials.\n\n\u201cMy hope is we\u2019re going to have a really good meeting tomorrow, and we\u2019ll be in a different place very soon,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nRubio and Waltz, who are slated to meet with the Ukrainian national security adviser, foreign minister, and defense minister, will be \u201cin listening mode,\u201d the top US diplomat said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve suffered greatly, and their people have suffered greatly, and it\u2019s hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions, but that\u2019s the only way this is going to end, to prevent more suffering,\u201d Rubio said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cnot going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do.\u201d\n\nThe top US diplomat acknowledged that the moves Ukraine would be willing to make \u201cmay be incompatible with what the Russians are willing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to find out. We\u2019re not going to find out on X. We\u2019re not going to find out, you know, on media, press conferences. We have to find out in rooms that are closed,\u201d Rubio added, just over a week since the meeting between Trump and Zelensky went off the rails in front of cameras.\n\nRubio said the conversation would not be overly detailed \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map\u201d \u2013 but that the US aims to \u201cget a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible for them and what they would need in return and then find out what the Russian position is in that regard. And that\u2019ll give us a pretty good assessment of how far apart we truly are.\u201d\n\nIn a post on X last Thursday, Zelensky said he hoped the meeting would be \u201cmeaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cUkraine has been seeking peace since the very first moment of the war, and we have always stated that the war continues solely because of Russia. Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing those steps,\u201d he said. Zelensky is not expected to attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting, although he is in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a separate post last Tuesday, Zelensky said the way the Oval Office meeting ended was \u201cregrettable.\u201d He proposed, as a first phase to end the war, \u201cthe release of prisoners and truce in the sky \u2014 ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure \u2014 and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal,\u201d he said.\n\nOn a minerals deal between the US and Ukraine \u2013 which had been largely negotiated before the Oval Office meeting \u2013 Zelensky said \u201cUkraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format.\u201d\n\nRubio, however, said Monday he did not necessarily expect the agreement to be finalized on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still more details to work out,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "A view shows MMR vaccine at the City of Lubbock Health Department in Lubbock, Texas, U.S. February 27, 2025. Photo: Annie Rice/Reuters\n\nIn a recent profile at the Bulwark, Shane DiGiovanna described his life with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a rare genetic disease that causes much of his skin to shear off from his body, damages his hearing, and gives him cancer. It\u2019s difficult for him to eat, let alone work. Gene therapy could offer a solution one day, but as DiGiovanna said, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk \u201ccould devastate the next decade of research and development of a cure for RDEB \u2014 my holy grail \u2026 Just keep in mind that the weak and marginalized include infants and children who are missing most of their skin and suffering through extreme and utterly pointless pain.\u201d\n\nWhen powerful men threaten funding for cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s research, they aren\u2019t just eliminating scientific jobs. They\u2019re putting people like DiGiovanna in danger.\n\nAs he confronts the administration\u2019s war on scientific research, DiGiovanna must worry too about Medicaid, which covers much of his care and is poised for significant cuts. Even the medical professionals who provide his care are at risk: A beloved nurse is an immigrant, and although he is an American citizen now, DiGiovanna knows that he is still threatened by Vice-President J.D. Vance\u2019s ultranationalist rhetoric. Aspects of DiGiovanna\u2019s story will be familiar to anyone with a chronic illness or disability in America; it certainly was to me. I also have a rare genetic disease and though my condition is not as painful or life-altering as RDEB, it still means that I am acutely aware that the advancements and supports that make my life easier are in significant danger. As a journalist, I try to understand the roots of this war on science and public health; as a patient, it is difficult for me to grasp why anyone would turn away from the vaccinations, antibiotics, and research that have saved untold lives. People like DiGiovanna and I are exceptional in the sense that our conditions are rare, but we don\u2019t live our lives in isolation. The same forces that threaten us are going to come for everyone else, too.\n\nBehind the war on science and public health lies a total hostility to the simple notion of a social contract. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to harm our children or [risk] the potential to harm our children so that we can save yours,\u201d an anti-vaxx mother in west Texas told the Washington Post last week. That\u2019s selfish, and dangerous too. One unvaccinated child has already died of measles in Texas and the outbreak may have claimed another life in New Mexico. But if we\u2019re going to defend public health, we have to identify its real enemies, and there\u2019s a difference between a Texas mother and someone like Kennedy, who\u2019s made a living and a reputation on the bodies of the dead. His anti-vaccine rhetoric already has a body count. In the years before my diagnosis and after, I learned that I couldn\u2019t bootstrap my way into health. I needed help: care that I could afford, paid sick leave, and stable housing. America guarantees none of the above.\n\nFor decades the pro-business right has said that we don\u2019t need a social contract; that it is even an impediment to true prosperity. Instead we have liberty, which is to say choice, and that is a seductive story even though it\u2019s based on a lie. A figure like Kennedy fits neatly within the Trump administration because he preaches individual responsibility over the public good. To Kennedy, the solution to chronic disease is a vitamin, or a stint on a farm, not sound science or public-health institutions. He and his allies agree that the market must be free \u2014 to profit, coerce, and kill. Science can\u2019t flourish in such an environment, nor can public health. Both are at constant risk from a ruthless system that demands constant human sacrifice from the very people it claims to help. It\u2019s not strange, then, that conspiracy theories can be so attractive, since they often begin with a certain base recognition that something is wrong. Anti-vaxx mothers in Texas are at war with the social contract because they believe their children are in danger. They\u2019re wrong about vaccines, but there are real predators in our midst. Pharmaceuticals are expensive, and so is health care in general. Why trust the system if it doesn\u2019t work for you anyway?\n\nBut cod-liver oil can\u2019t cure measles, and beef tallow isn\u2019t healthier than seed oils. They offer the illusion of control in a hostile world. People who put their trust in conspiracies and lies may discover what Shane DiGiovanna already knows \u2014 that we all need science to be healthy. Disability is not divine punishment but a condition that can befall anyone, especially if they are poor. \u201cEveryone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick,\u201d Susan Sontag famously wrote. \u201cAlthough we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.\u201d Without a safety net that works, science will falter and the kingdom of the sick will only expand. The price is human life."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nPolice across the United States are investigating a series of attacks on Tesla showrooms, charging stations and Tesla vehicles, as vitriol escalates against CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThere have also been peaceful protests at many Tesla locations, which involve demonstrators carrying signs and chanting \u201cElon Musk has got to go\u201d in response to the slashing of federal jobs and budgets by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThough the protests have been peaceful, there have also been widespread reports of vandalism. While there have been no reports of injuries, the incidents pose a potential financial problem for Tesla. The company faces declining sales for the first time due to increased competition and backlash over Musk\u2019s contentious role in the Trump administration.\n\nOn March 3, seven charging stations in a mall outside of Boston were set on fire just after 1 a.m. local time.\n\nOn Thursday, police outside of Portland, Oregon, responded to gunshots fired at a Tesla showroom at about 1:45 a.m. local time. Investigators say at least seven shots were fired, damaging three cars and shattering windows. One bullet went through an office wall and into a computer monitor.\n\nShattered windows of a Tesla showroom that was shot up by an unknown vandal on March 6. Tigard Police Department/AP\n\n\u201cWhile the motivation for this has not been confirmed, we are aware that other Tesla dealerships have been targeted across Oregon and the nation for political reasons,\u201d police in Tigard, Oregon, said in a statement.\n\nLucy Grace Nelson of Colorado faces a federal charge of malicious destruction of property for allegedly vandalizing a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado, in late January and February. Nelson allegedly spray-painted words including \u201cNazi\u201d on vehicles and the windows of the store, and threw Molotov cocktails during one of the incidents, according to police. She was arrested near the store on February 24 with more Molotov cocktails inside her car. If convicted, Nelson could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThere have also been numerous complaints about damage to Tesla vehicles on social media. Police in Brookline, Massachusetts, posted a video on X of one individual defending his tagging of a Tesla vehicle as \u201cfree speech.\u201d Musk, a self-described free speech absolutist who owns X and is Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder, reposted the police post with the comment: \u201cDamaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!\u201d\n\nAnd when someone recently posted a photo of the word \u201cNazi\u201d spray-painted on a Tesla charging station, the X account for Tesla Charging responded, \u201cWe will press charges for vandalism at superchargers.\u201d\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on the various attacks or the protests.\n\nOn Sunday, Musk posted on X: \u201cHeartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices.\u201d\n\nThe attacks risk scaring away potential Tesla buyers who might not object to Musk\u2019s politics but fear their car could be vandalized, said Gordon Johnson, founder of GLJ Research, who has long held a very bearish view of Tesla stock. He said no one wants to spend money on a Tesla only to have it vandalized.\n\nTesla just reported its first drop in annual sales in its history, and there are indications that sales could be down again this quarter. While overall electric vehicle sales in Europe surged by 34% in January, sales of Teslas plummeted 50%. Tesla\u2019s sales fell 29% in China \u2014 the company\u2019s second largest market after the United States \u2014 in the first two months of the year, according to Reuters.\n\nAnd Tesla\u2019s US sales dropped 16% between December and January, according to an estimate from Cox Automotive.\n\nWeak sales have hurt the value of Tesla shares, which had climbed 91% after Election Day, peaking just before Christmas, as investors anticipated Musk and his electric car company would be big winners in Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nThose gains, and more, have been wiped away since their recent highs. Shares fell about 14% in midday trading Monday and have now lost 10% since their closing price on Election Day."

            "full_content": "Mahmoud Khalil speaking to members of the media at Columbia University, June 1, 2024. Photo: Jeenah Moon/Reuters\n\nOn Saturday, Palestinian activist and former Columbia University grad student Mahmoud Khalil, who played a significant role in the Gaza protests at Columbia last year, was arrested by federal immigration authorities. According to his attorney, Khalil is a legal permanent resident but is currently being detained despite his status and no specific charges have been detailed. A judge has temporarily blocked Khalil\u2019s deportation pending further action on his motion challenging his detention.\n\nThe dramatic action came just days after President Donald Trump signaled his administration\u2019s plan to crack down on student protests \u2014 raising the specter of deportation for those in the country on a visa as well as the revocation of federal funds for the colleges and universities themselves. Khalil\u2019s arrest has been condemned by many local political leaders and championed by members of Trump\u2019s administration and its allies. Here\u2019s what we know so far.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nOn Saturday evening, Khalil was approached at his home by Department of Homeland Security agents. According to Khalil\u2019s attorney, Amy Greer, the agents proceeded to detain Khalil and threatened his wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, with arrest as well. The apartment building in which Khalil lives with his wife is owned by the university.\n\nOn Friday, the ACLU released video footage Khalil\u2019s wife recorded during the arrest:\n\nThis footage of ICE arresting Palestinian activist and Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil was just released by the ACLU.\n\n\n\nICE: \u201cStop resisting\u201d\n\n\n\nKhalil's wife: \u201cHe\u2019s not resisting\u201d pic.twitter.com/Fk5oG5demO \u2014 Zeteo (@zeteo_news) March 14, 2025\n\nGreer told the Associated Press that one of the agents told her over the phone that they were following orders from the State Department to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. When Greer told them that Khalil possessed a green card and was a legal permanent resident, the agent said they were revoking that instead.\n\nAccording to Greer, Khalil\u2019s family was told that he was transported to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, but they were later informed that he wasn\u2019t there after an attempted visit. As of Monday, according to ICE\u2019s online detainee locator, Khalil is being held at a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana.\n\nIn a statement issued late Monday, Greer called Khalil\u2019s transfer to Louisiana from New York a \u201cblatantly improper but familiar tactic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat transfer should be reversed, and the process of challenging the outrageous attempt to revoke legal-permanent-resident status for someone who has never committed a crime, and who has simply expressed his political opinions,\u201d she said.\n\nKhalil\u2019s legal team has since filed a habeas corpus petition and U.S. district judge Jesse Furman, who was assigned the matter, has blocked Khalil\u2019s removal pending action on the filing. During a hearing on the case on Wednesday, the government argued that the New York federal court should not have jurisdiction over Khalil\u2019s case because he was moved to Louisiana when his petition was filed. NBC News reports that the judge ordered both sides to submit arguments on jurisdiction and said Khalil and his attorneys will be allowed two privileged phone calls after his legal team claimed that they\u2019ve lacked access to him since his detention. Khalil will remain detained in the meantime.\n\nWho is Mahmoud Khalil?\n\nReuters reports that Khalil was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and received his green card last year after arriving in the United States on a student visa in 2022. He completed his studies for a master\u2019s of public administration degree at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs in 2024 and was set to receive his degree in May.\n\nKhalil was a lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the student-led coalition advocating for the school\u2019s divestment from Israel. The group had come under fire for its on-campus protests of the ongoing war in Gaza, particularly their Gaza Solidarity Encampment that was subjected to numerous raids by local law enforcement last year. Drop-Site News reports that Khalil participated in a sit-in at the Barnard College\u2019s Milstein Center on Wednesday, protesting the school\u2019s recent expulsion of several students for taking part in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nThe AP also reports that Khalil had been under investigation by the Office of Institutional Equity, a newly created university office intended to address reports of harassment and discrimination, due to his involvement with CUAD. \u201cI have around 13 allegations against me; most of them are social-media posts that I had nothing to do with,\u201d Khalil told the AP. \u201cThey just want to show Congress and right-wing politicians that they\u2019re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.\u201d\n\nZeteo reported Monday that Khalil had emailed Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong last Friday with concerns for his safety after being subjected to a \u201cvicious, coordinated, and dehumanizing doxxing campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir attacks have incited a wave of hate, including calls for my deportation and death threats. I have outlined the wider context below, yet Columbia has not provided any meaningful support or resources in response to this escalating threat,\u201d he wrote, according to emails obtained by the outlet.\n\nReuters spoke to Noor Abdalla, Khalil\u2019s wife who is eight months pregnant with their first child. She said she hopes that her husband will be released by the child\u2019s birth. \u201cI think it would be very devastating for me and for him to meet his first child behind a glass screen,\u201d Abdalla said.\n\nWhat has the Trump administration said?\n\nSo far, the Trump administration hasn\u2019t articulated what charges, if any, that Khalil is being detained on. Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, confirmed Khalil\u2019s arrest in a statement, saying that it was done in coordination with the State Department and alleging that Khalil \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE and the Department of State are committed to enforcing President Trump\u2019s executive orders and to protecting U.S. national security,\u201d she said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio echoed McLaughlin\u2019s words on social media, making it clear that Khalil\u2019s detention was an intentional move from the Trump administration. \u201cWe will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,\u201d he wrote, sharing a link to a news article about Khalil.\n\nTrump denounced Khalil as a \u201cRadical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\u201d in a Truth Social post on Monday and said that there are more arrests to come. \u201cWe know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d he said.\n\nTroy Edgar, the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, defended Khalil\u2019s detention in an interview with NPR. \u201cThis is somebody we\u2019ve invited and allowed the student to come into the country, and he\u2019s put himself in the middle of the process of basically pro-Palestinian activity. And at this point, like I said, the secretary of State can review his visa process at any point and revoke it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union condemned Khalil\u2019s arrest as an affront to his right to free speech. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s detention of Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 a green-card holder studying in this country legally \u2014 is targeted, retaliatory, and an extreme attack on his First Amendment rights,\u201d executive director Donna Lieberman said in a statement.\n\nAssemblymember Zohran Mamdani, who is running in the New York City mayoral race, also called for Khalil\u2019s immediate release, noting his arrest was a \u201cblatant assault on the First Amendment and a sign of advancing authoritarianism under Trump.\u201d Mamdani attempted to confront border czar Tom Homan over Khalil\u2019s arrest at the state capitol on Wednesday, shouting, \u201cHow many New Yorkers will you detain without charge?\u201d\n\nLetitia James, the state attorney general, said Monday that she is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about Khalil\u2019s arrest and detention and that her office is currently monitoring the situation and is also in contact with his legal representation.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez denounced Khalil\u2019s detention and said it raised concerns about how much further the Trump administration could go. \u201cIf the federal government can disappear a legal US permanent resident without reason or warrant, then they can disappear US citizens too. Anyone - left, right, or center - who has highlighted the importance of constitutional rights + free speech should be sounding the alarm now,\u201d she wrote on X.\n\nNBC News reports that protesters plan to hold a demonstration at New York City\u2019s Federal Plaza on Monday, calling for Khalil\u2019s release.\n\nWhat about Khalil\u2019s green card? Is it legal to detain him?\n\nThough Rubio has stated that the United States will begin revoking green cards, his ability to do so appears legally dubious. Typically, an immigration judge is tasked with determining whether a person\u2019s legal-resident status can be revoked, following allegations of criminal activity or fraudulent activities in the application process. \u202aIn a series of tweets on Bluesky, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick\u202c, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, said that the State Department lacks the authority to unilaterally revoke a green card.\n\n\u201cWhile the State Department CAN revoke *visas* with very little legal process involved, stripping someone of a green card is done by DHS (not the State Department) and requires filing formal charges alleging a violation of immigration law and a removal hearing in front of an immigration judge,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHowever, Reichlin-Melnick noted that an aspect of the Immigration and Nationality Act could allow for a non-citizen to be deported if the secretary of State deems them deportable on national-security grounds.\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN reported that Rubio appeared to have invoked a foreign-policy provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to detain Khalil.\n\nHave any other activists been detained by the Trump administration?\n\nKhalil was not the only Columbia student whom authorities sought out over the weekend. The Associated Press reports that federal immigration agents attempted to take an international student into custody but weren\u2019t able to enter her apartment. Student Workers of Columbia, a university union that represents the unidentified woman, told the outlet that the ICE agents attempted to enter her home without a warrant. On Friday, the DHS announced that it had arrested a second Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, who is also Palestinian.\n\nLast week, Trump indicated that going after campus activists is a top priority for his administration and that he intends to penalize the institutions themselves for allowing the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cAll Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests. Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nOn March 7, the Trump administration announced that it had canceled $400 million in federal grants and contracts with Columbia University, citing the school\u2019s \u201ccontinued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Trump promises to bring down groceries prices at an August 15, 2024 press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey. Photo: Adam Gray/Getty Images\n\nThe high cost of living was one of the primary reasons that Donald Trump was elected to the presidency. Trump himself said in a December interview with NBC News, \u201cI won on groceries,\u201d explaining, \u201cWhen you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t just promise to implement policies that would gradually ease economic concerns; throughout 2024, he said that if American voted for him, prices would fall rapidly.\n\n\u201cWhen I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One,\u201d Trump declared in August, underscoring his point by standing between tables filled with unrefrigerated milk, meat, and other groceries.\n\nSeven weeks into the second Trump administration, grocery prices haven\u2019t gone down. So Trump is trying a new strategy: urging Americans to quit complaining and trust that he\u2019ll eventually make them \u201cso rich.\u201d\n\nSaturday on Truth Social, Trump shared a Daily Caller article titled \u201cShut Up About Egg Prices \u2014 Trump Is Saving Consumers Millions.\u201d\n\nIn the piece, Charlie Kirk claimed that Trump bears zero responsibility for the high price of eggs (that is, of course, all Joe Biden\u2019s fault). Then Kirk argued that Trump will be \u201csaving consumers million\u201d \u2014 even if that isn\u2019t happening yet \u2014 listing off various Trump economic proposals. Many of these policies have yet to be implemented, but Kirk said struggling Americans just need to be patient:\n\nReversing four years of economic malpractice will take time to reverse, but the building blocks of America\u2019s next great low-inflation, high-wage growth boom have already been laid \u2014 and soon enough, so too will the eggs.\n\nThe Kirk article is actually three weeks old and egg prices are still high (while the average cost of a dozen eggs dropped about a dollar in the past month, the USDA still predicts egg prices will go up 40 percent this year). But Americans\u2019 economic woes go far beyond eggs. There are concerns that Trump\u2019s trade war will raise the cost of everything from food to cars to gasoline. In recent weeks, Trump rolled out his long-awaited tariffs against Canada and Mexico, partly suspended them, then said they were back on. Markets tumbled in response, raising fears that Trump\u2019s chaotic economic movies could spark a recession.\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday, Maria Bartiromo directly asked Trump if we should expect a recession this year. He declined to rule out that possibility.\n\n\u201cI hate to predict things like that,\u201d Trump said on Fox Sunday Morning Futures. \u201cThere is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America.\u201d\n\nBartiromo: \u201cAre you expecting a recession this year?\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump: \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we are doing is very big.\u201d pic.twitter.com/gwC10SKFX1 \u2014 The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) March 9, 2025\n\nTrump dismissed recession concerns again on Sunday evening. On Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump, \u201cAre you worried about a recession?\u201d noting, \u201cMaria Bartiromo asked you, and you kind of hesitated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, of course you hesitate,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cAll I know is this: We\u2019re gonna take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we\u2019re gonna become so rich you\u2019re not gonna know where to spend all that money. I\u2019m telling you \u2014 you just watch! We\u2019re gonna have jobs, we\u2019re gonna have factories, it\u2019s gonna be great.\u201d\n\nOn Truth Social, Trump shared a video of his response \u2014 which was edited to remove the bit where refused to rule out a recession again \u2014 with the caption, \u201cWe\u2019re going to become so rich, you\u2019re not gonna know where to spend all that money. I\u2019m telling you\u2014just watch!\u201d\n\nStocks tumbled again on Monday after Trump\u2019s talk about a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d that seemingly will involve more economic hardship. But you can\u2019t really blame the president for that. None of this would be happening if Americans would just stop complaining about how they can\u2019t afford groceries or weather a recession and focus on real problems \u2014 like how they\u2019re going to spend all that extra money Trump will put in their pocket at some indefinite point in the future."

            "full_content": "Viewers watched with shock and dismay as cringeworthy political moments blew up multiple couples\u2019 engagements on Season 8 of Netflix\u2019s Love Is Blind reality dating show.\n\nHere are seven jaw-dropping moments in which women ended their engagements to men they claimed to \u201clove\u201d due to them believing the grooms were not woke enough for marriage.\n\nOne bride, Sara Carton left her fianc\u00e9 Ben Mezzenga stranded at the altar over his lack of interest in Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ issues, and the COVID vaccine, as well as for his church being too \u201ctraditional.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI love you so much, but I\u2019ve always wanted a partner to be on the same wavelength, and so, today I can\u2019t [marry you],\u201d Carton told Mezzenga at the altar, before walking away, laughing.\n\nAfter leaving the wedding ceremony and getting into a vehicle, Carton can be heard telling her mother and her lesbian sister, Lisa, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I feel kind of dumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Carton continued. \u201cI was really excited about Ben. He\u2019s such a great person and I just, like\u2026 I just hope I made the right decision.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Carton explained that she had asked Mezzenga about his opinion on \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m no expert, but, like, when I asked him about it, he was like, \u2018I guess I\u2019ve never really thought too much about it.\u2019 That affected me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked him, too, like, what his church\u2019s views are [on LGBTQ issues], and he said he didn\u2019t know,\u201d the bride added. \u201cSo then I watched a sermon online \u2014 about sexual identity, and it was traditional.\u201d\n\nCarton also told Love is Blind producers that she suspected Mezzenga had a difference of opinion on \u201cequality, religion, [and] the vaccine,\u201d which, in part, caused her to her to walk away from her would-be marriage.\n\nIn another clip, Love is Blind dating contestant Virginia Miller can be heard telling her fianc\u00e9, Devin Buckley, that she is \u201cjust not ready\u201d to marry him, leaving him sobbing at the altar.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nBoth Miller and Buckley\u2019s parents can be seen sobbing as the bride exits the wedding ceremony, upon realizing their dreams of their children getting married have been shattered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d a child asks, to which Buckley\u2019s father replies by whispering \u201cShe said \u2018No'\u201d into the young girl\u2019s ear.\n\nMiller\u2019s father then embraces Buckley, telling the abandoned groom, \u201cYou\u2019re a very good man. I\u2019m disappointed also.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about why she chose not to marry Buckley, Miller cited the groom having grown up in a \u201cconservative household,\u201d and noted that she took offense when Buckley asked her if she voted with her \u201cfaith in mind\u201d during an earlier conversation in which she revealed to her fianc\u00e9 that she is pro-abortion.\n\nIn a scene from an earlier episode, Miller is seen talking to Buckley about conservatives with apparent contempt, using air quotes around \u201cconservative\u201d and calling herself Christian, before going on a rant about how \u201cpeople\u201d should have abortion rights.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ARmastrangelo/status/1896326630953427036\n\nWhen Buckley lightly challenges Miller, asking if she tries to align her voting with her faith, the 34-year-old replies, \u201cI do think that I make decisions from my faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people should have abortion rights,\u201d Miller smiled. \u201cI think gay people should have rights \u2014 all those things. And it\u2019s hard, because all of those things are, like, becoming political conversations again. And I just thought we were so far past that, but we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it is an interesting time to live in the United States,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cBecause I thought people were gonna be able to have abortions. I didn\u2019t know we had to go back and debate that one again.\u201d\n\nBuckley is noticeably silent while Miller rants about abortion, prompting her to ask, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d to which he replies by disclosing his belief that a man should be able to state \u201chis opinion\u201d on whether or not his unborn child is killed.\n\nMiller then asks Buckley if he would vote \u201cthe same\u201d when they go to the polls, to which her fianc\u00e9 responds by asking, \u201cIf we voted differently, what would that mean to you? You wouldn\u2019t be okay with that?\u201d\n\nAfter a brief pause, Miller answers that she may find that revelation \u201ckind of alarming.\u201d\n\nBuckley then comments that \u201cIt would depend on the candidates for me,\u201d to which Miller replies by pushing back, claiming, \u201cUsually when they\u2019re a part of certain Party, it\u2019s because of those core things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about your family? How do they vote?\u201d Miller asks, to which her fianc\u00e9 responds by revealing \u201cThey vote conservative, because they are on the side of what they\u2019re teaching are for their religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy family does not vote that way, but they\u2019re black,\u201d Miller replies, to which Buckley responds, \u201cWell, my dad is black.\u201d\n\nIn another scene, before Carton and Mezzenga\u2019s forthcoming failed wedding ceremony, Carton is seen incessantly pressuring her fianc\u00e9 to talk about LGBTQ issues, and questioning his church\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d views on the topic, even suggesting he find another church to attend.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nMezzenga replies by trying to convey to Carton that he would like to mind his own business, stating, \u201cI know what my views are, but who am I to say that I\u2019m right and every else is wrong? It\u2019s not my job to convince someone.\u201d\n\nBut Carton, who appears taken aback by Mezzenga\u2019s statement, asks her fianc\u00e9, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018not your job\u2019 to tell people they\u2019re wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mezzenga replies. \u201cBut all I know is this is a community that I feel connected to.\u201d\n\nCarton then suggests that she never \u201cenvisioned\u201d her significant other being a churchgoer, adding, \u201cI want to bring you to Pride,\u201d and noting that while she knows Mezzenga would meet her halfway by attending LGBTQ-related events, she feels she cannot reciprocate the compromise when it comes to his church.\n\n\u201cI want everyone to be loved for who they are, like, that\u2019s what makes the world so beautiful, is the diversity,\u201d Carton ironically states, to which Mezzenga responds by reminding his fianc\u00e9 that he agrees, and would attend Pride events with her.\n\nMezzenga then tells Carton that the topic of LGBTQ has \u201ccome up so much\u201d in their relationship, and he feels it \u201cminimizes\u201d all the other things that they do have in common with one another.\n\nCarton then bizarrely informs Mezzenga that she wants a husband who thinks exactly the way she does, with no dissenting thoughts in his mind, saying, \u201cI always just assumed I would meet a guy who aligns in every single aspect.\u201d\n\nIn another scene, the couple is seen at a bar with Carton\u2019s sister, Lisa, and Lisa\u2019s girlfriend, Kelsie, where the lesbian couple lectures them about LGBTQ issues and Mezzenga\u2019s alleged \u201cprivilege.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nIn the clip, Carton can be heard assuring Lisa and Kelsie that if she goes to church with Mezzenga, she will make sure the church \u201caccepts\u201d LGBTQ. But that didn\u2019t appear to be good enough for Kelsie, who then lectured the couple about the word \u201cacceptance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the word \u2018acceptance\u2019 because it\u2019s like there\u2019s something wrong with us that you have to accept,\u201d Kelsie said, to which Carton responded by immediately displaying subservience and giving her sister\u2019s girlfriend the opportunity to police her speech, asking, \u201cWhat word should I use then?\u201d\n\nKelsie then bizarrely states that she \u201chates\u201d it when churches say \u201cWe accept everybody.\u201d\n\nMezzenga is then seen trying to placate the lesbian couple by saying he is \u201cfiscally conservative but socially liberal,\u201d but that, too, is not good enough for Kelsie, who then lectures Carton, saying her \u201cprivileged\u201d fianc\u00e9 is likely still voting in a way that hinders her \u201crights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are things that women experience that men do not in this world and in this country,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHow you vote maters, and there are things that we have to consider [as a lesbian couple] that you guys don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people that are fiscally conservative and socially liberal that probably vote differently than you, and that impacts your rights,\u201d Kelsie lectured Carton, adding, \u201cI think you guys need to have serious conversations about politics, because he\u2019s in a different privilege bucket than you\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAt the Love is Blind \u201creunion\u201d \u2014 which aired on Sunday \u2014 where the cast members reconvene one year later to catch up on what has happened in their lives since being on the show and reflect on their experiences, Miller doubled down on her decision to leave Buckley at the altar due to him having different political views.\n\n\u201cDevin told me a lot about his core values, something that he did not want to talk about on camera,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cI still, to this day, don\u2019t really feel comfortable telling you Devin\u2019s views, but I will be really clear about mine.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI 100 percent support the LGBTQ community,\u201d Miller elaborated. \u201cI also believe that women should have the decision to choose if they want to have an abortion or not.\u201d\n\nBuckley replied by stating, \u201cI can look past certain things, and I think that you can be together and have a relationship and not completely agree on everything, and I think a big thing with me, as a Christian, is to love everyone.\u201d\n\nIn another clip from the reunion episode, Mezzenga can be seen bizarrely apologizing for his so-called \u201cprivilege.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI knew coming into this experience, I definitely have had privilege in my life, and it\u2019s something that I wasn\u2019t proud of,\u201d Mezzenga said, adding that he needs to \u201cgrow\u201d and is \u201cembarrassed\u201d by how his and Carton\u2019s conversations unfolded on the show.\n\nAnother outlandish clip from the reunion episode shows Love is Blind host Nick Lachey grilling Mezzenga about his relationship with his church and demanding that the dating show contestant explain himself.\n\n\u201cYou said you couldn\u2019t remember your church\u2019s stance on gay marriage,\u201d Lachey said, before asking Mezzenga, \u201cWas that true? You simply couldn\u2019t remember, or was it maybe that you just didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the reality of your church\u2019s stance on gay marriage?\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cYeah, it was honestly that I didn\u2019t remember, because I didn\u2019t ever need to know, because there wasn\u2019t really anyone in my life that it really pertained to, and it wasn\u2019t something on my head,\u201d Mezzenga replied, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe cringeworthy moment was noticeably topped off with Mezzenga\u2019s fellow castmates glaring at him in apparent contempt as he delivered his answer.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the clip of Carton leaving Mezzenga at the altar went viral on X, where Love is Blind viewers slammed the bride for ditching her groom over his lack of interest in Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ issues, and the COVID vaccine, as well as for his church being too \u201ctraditional.\u201d\n\nViewers, meanwhile, congratulated the groom for having \u201cdodged a bullet\u201d by not getting married to his \u201cinsufferable\u201d bride.\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

            "full_content": "Behind Mike Johnson lurks Elon Musk. Photo: Anna Moneymaker\n\nLike most observers, I vacillate regularly as to whether House Speaker Mike Johnson is an unexpectedly shrewd legislative tactician or is instead Mr. Magoo, a bumbling backwoods pol who survives strictly by blind luck and subservience to Donald Trump. But as Congress moves this week toward a possible government shutdown, there are fresh signs that Johnson knows what he\u2019s doing \u2014 or at least is listening to advisers or executive-branch paymasters who know what they are doing. He\u2019s devising a trap for congressional Democrats that is leaving them irresolute and possibly more powerless than ever.\n\nA stopgap spending bill enacted after a lot of difficulty last December expires on March 14. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, it looked as though the effort to keep the government operating past that date would be an existential crisis for congressional Republicans, divided as always between the hard-core House Freedom Caucus members (and their Senate counterparts) lusting for deep cuts in domestic spending and swing-district House members (and their own Senate counterparts) fearful of backlash to unpopular cuts. But since then, the executive branch via both Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE and Russ Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget \u2014 sometimes operating through Trump\u2019s agency appointees and sometimes on their own \u2014 has rushed ahead with spending cuts and personnel firings on a vast scale, asserting powers that have triggered equally vast litigation over their constitutionality.\n\nSuddenly, the right-wing pressure for achieving the demolition of the hated federal government (or at least the portions not devoted to deporting immigrants or intimidating Canada, Panama, and Greenland) via cuts in congressional spending bills has been relaxed significantly. And so it\u2019s been easier for Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to line up votes for the continuing resolution (or CR, a measure extending current appropriations until the end of the fiscal year) that Trump himself recently endorsed.\n\nBut in anticipation of another close House vote in which Democrats cannot be counted on to help keep the government open, Johnson added conservative sweeteners to the CR, which isn\u2019t \u201cclean\u201d (i.e., a simple extension of current funding levels for everything) as advertised but instead adds immediate money for defense and mass deportation and cuts domestic spending by $13 billion. House Democrats already inclined to vote \u201cno\u201d on the CR because it contains no language forcing the executive branch to actually spend the money appropriated (which would restrict the power of DOGE or OMB to unilaterally \u201cfreeze\u201d spending, cancel grants or contracts, or fire personnel) now have even less motivation to keep the government open. And over the weekend, Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries officially opposed the not-so-clean CR and Democrats began \u201cwhipping\u201d a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nIf Johnson can\u2019t wrangle his troops into near-unanimous support for his dirty CR (and Trump is leaning on them pretty hard), then it\u2019s possible the government will shut down on March 14 and Republicans will get at least a good share of the blame since they control both congressional chambers. But if they do get the CR through the House and the fight shifts to the Senate, the political situation will be entirely different. To kill the CR, Democrats would have to launch a filibuster, and in that circumstance it would be much easier for Republicans to blame them for shutting down the federal government \u2014 despite the clear intention of the Trump administration to keep gutting the government if it remains open. If just seven Senate Democrats choose to join Republicans (or all but Rand Paul, who is demanding deeper cuts; he has effectively matched with Democrat John Fetterman, who has vowed to vote to avoid a shutdown), the CR will pass.\n\nIf Senate Democrats are put to the challenge and subsequently cave, they will have more than likely forfeited any real Democratic leverage for the remainder of 2025 beyond stirring up public unhappiness with Trump 2.0. Appropriations aside, most of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda will be enacted via a gigantic budget-reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered. So the decision not to deploy a filibuster on the one crucial occasion it is available will represent an admission of powerlessness that won\u2019t make rank-and-file Democrats happy.\n\nOne of the problems Democrats in both chambers face is a misalignment of messaging at this moment. House Democrats appear to have decided the fight against Medicaid cuts being threatened in the upcoming budget-reconciliation bill is the most politically salient argument they can make. But the CR doesn\u2019t have any Medicaid cuts. And even if they find a way to shift the messaging to the threat posed by executive usurpation of congressional spending authority, is that an argument that will offset dismay over the government shutting down? Josh Marshall addressed this problem compellingly:\n\nIf you won\u2019t provide the votes [to keep the government open], what are you demanding exactly? What\u2019s necessary to get the votes to open it back up? I hear vague references to the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to cut it. I think you need to say, Elon\u2019s got to go. He\u2019s unpopular. Everyone understands what that means since they hear about him every day. But they just haven\u2019t been making that case. And without that case, it\u2019s probably not sustainable politically. Of course, you might not lay that groundwork if you weren\u2019t planning to go to the mat over it anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit late in the day for House and Senate Democrats to come together on an \u201cElon\u2019s got to go\u201d message for filibustering a CR that is necessary to keep even a gutted federal government operating. So the trap being sprung by Republicans is to cast Democrats as the bad guys in a government-shutdown saga thoroughly controlled by Trump and his minions and allies on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nPerhaps by admitting their powerlessness to do anything about it will ultimately expose Republicans to danger on the grounds that everything happening in Washington is their show, which means they \u201cown\u201d all the negative consequences down the road. But if \u201cwe can\u2019t do anything\u201d is how congressional Democrats choose to respond to their base\u2019s demand to do something, they should at a minimum say it in one voice instead of flailing around in divided opposition to a spending measure they know will be enacted. More generally, getting outfoxed by Mike Johnson is a really bad look for a party already on the defensive."

Carney is not a member of Parliament and has never held public office or won an election for anything before Sunday, but nonetheless crushed his opponents, running away with almost 86 percent of the vote. The results were especially embarrassing for former Deputy Prime Minister Chyrstia Freeland, whose betrayal of Trudeau in a fiery resignation letter in December is largely believed to have led to Trudeau\u2019s announcement a month later that he would step down after a decade in power. Freeland came in second with eight percent support.\n\nFollowing his victory on Sunday, Carney delivered a speech that alternated awkwardly from calling for change in his country to urging Canadians to vote for the party that has controlled the government for the past decade. He extensively praised Trudeau, congratulating him for having \u201ccombined strength and compassion every day as a fighter for Canada.\n\n\u201cYou have led us through some of the hardest challenges that this nation has ever faced,\u201d Carney said to Trudeau. \u201cI pledge to you and to all Canadians that I will follow their example.\u201d\n\nPoilievre spoke before Carney, but anticipated his connections to Trudeau and used them as an argument against voting for him during remarks at an event in London, Ontario.\n\n\u201cAfter they\u2019ve caused all this damage \u2013 a sneaky trick tonight, they\u2019re going to try to get elected for a fourth term,\u201d Poilievre said. \u201cA fourth term by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic adviser Mark Carney. Carney\u2019s advice drove up taxes, housing costs, and food prices while he personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States.\u201d\n\nPoilievre appeared to seek to capitalize on anti-American sentiment in Canada, fueled by the ongoing conflict over tariffs between Trudeau and Trump.\n\n\u201cWorking for Trudeau, Carney made Canada weaker and poorer,\u201d he accused. \u201cWorking for himself, Carney made the United States richer and stronger \u2013 and, for the first time in our history, Canada will have a sneaky prime minister with millions of dollars of financial interests that go directly against our national interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump will have a big smile on his face as he exploits all of Carney\u2019s many conflicts to attack Canadian workers and Canadian jobs,\u201d Poilievre predicted.\n\nTrudeau has yet to formally resign, but that move will result in Carney assuming the prime ministership. Carney\u2019s ascent will mark a rare period in a parliamentary system in which the prime ministership will be held by someone who is not a member of Parliament and has never been elected to the Parliament, or any other office. Following Carney\u2019s installation as prime minister, Parliament has until the end of October to call for a general election to replace sitting members of Parliament and, if the Liberals lose, the prime minister.\n\nParliament has been paralyzed under a procedure known as \u201cprorogation\u201d since January, when Trudeau froze the legislative branch of the Canadian government to allow his increasingly unpopular party to replace him. Prorogation is set to conclude on March 24, but may end sooner if the Liberals request an end to the period.\n\nCarney\u2019s resume includes stints as the head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England and aiding Trudeau in longtime informal advisory roles, including advising Trudeau\u2019s disastrous response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic (Carney later publicly condemned the response that he reportedly advised). He has a longstanding relationship with Harvard university, including graduating from the school and sending his daughter, currently a freshman, to Harvard College. Carney stepped down this weekend from a seat on Harvard\u2019s second-highest governing board to formally enter Canadian politics.\n\nCarney has also developed a voice as one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate change alarmism activists, describing alleged climate change as a \u201cgreat test\u201d of post-pandemic focus on human values.\n\n\u201c[C]limate change is an issue that (i) involves the entire world, from which no one will be able to self-isolate; (ii) is predicted by science to be the central risk tomorrow; and (iii) we can only address if we act in advance and in solidarity,\u201d Carney wrote in a column for The Economist in April 2020.\n\nIn February 2021, Carney predicted that, thanks to alleged climate change, \u201cfrom a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.\u201d\n\nPoilievre has been campaigning against \u201ccarbon tax\u201d Carney for weeks. While the Conservative Party was leading both Liberals and the fellow leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) combined for weeks at the beginning of the year, more recent polls indicate that Conservatives are losing support as the left attempts to associate Conservatives with President Trump\u2019s tariff push. This has left the Conservatives in the uncomfortable position of campaigning against Trump while calling for nationalist conservative policies akin to what Trump has promoted for America.\n\n\u201cCommon Sense Conservatives condemn President Trump\u2019s massive, unjust and unjustified tariffs which will damage both American and Canadian economies,\u201d Poilievre proclaimed in February.\n\n\u201cWe share the longest undefended border and fought alongside Americans in two world wars, Korea and Afghanistan, where 158 of our brave men and women died helping the U.S. avenge the 9/11 attacks,\u201d he continued in remarks at the time. \u201cThere is no justification whatsoever for these tariffs, this treatment.\u201d\n\nPoilievre has proposed deregulating the extremely onerous process governing inter-provincial commerce in Canada to foster more domestic trade and make Canada less dependent on America in response to the tariff threat.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

Buckley, Jr., the founder of the conservative editorial magazine National Review.\n\nBuckley, a leading voice for the modern conservative movement, founded National Review in 1955 to publish conservative commentary and analysis focused on politics, current events and culture. The magazine still exists today and publishes 12 magazines annually, in addition to its daily news site.\n\nThe stamp features a graphite and charcoal portrait of Buckley, drawn by Dale Stephanos, according to the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nHistorian George Nash described Buckley as \"arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century\" in 2008 following Buckley\u2019s death.\n\n\"For an entire generation he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure,\" Nash wrote in National Review.\n\nThe magazine forged together several ideological branches and provided an outlet for views including free-market capitalism, libertarianism, traditionalism and anti-communism, according to the Bill of Rights Institute.\n\nWILLIAM F. BUCKLEY: RIGHT FROM THE START\n\nIn addition to spearheading National Review, Buckley also hosted the Emmy Award\u2013winning television program \"Firing Line\" from 1966 to 1999, which became well-known for its ideological diversity of guests ranging from former President Ronald Reagan, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, economist Friedrich Hayek, scholar Noam Chomsky and liberal author Gore Vidal.\n\n\"The success and long run of Firing Line proved that there was a place on television for civilized debate between conflicting ideologies that could entertain and inform the American public,\" according to Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.\n\nThe public policy think tank, led by former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, houses a massive videotape collection of \"Firing Line\u2019s\" more than 1,500 episodes, in addition to program preparation materials, photographs, transcripts and sound recordings.\n\nBuckley, a devout Catholic, also authored dozens of books, including \"God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of \u2018Academic Freedom,\u2019\" published in 1951, about his experience attending Yale University. The book offered a harsh assessment of Yale\u2019s secular academic climate, and Time magazine cited it in 2011 as one of the top 100 \"best and most influential\" books written in English since 1923.\n\nJAMES ROSEN: BILL BUCKLEY AND THE DEATH OF \u2018TRANS-IDEOLOGICAL\u2019 FRIENDSHIPS\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks, who launched his career as an intern with National Review, wrote after Buckley\u2019s death in 2008 that Buckley\u2019s \"greatest talent was friendship,\" and that the conservative icon was an avid writer of letters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"His second great talent was leadership,\" Brooks wrote in the New York Times. \"As a young man, he had corralled the famously disputatious band of elders who made up the editorial board of National Review. He changed the personality of modern conservatism, created a national movement and expelled the crackpots from it.\"\n\n\"He loved liberty and felt it must be constrained by the invisible bonds of the transcendent order,\" Brooks wrote."

He\u2019s such a great person and I just, like\u2026 I just hope I made the right decision.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Carton explained that she had asked Mezzenga about his opinion on \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d adding, \u201cand I\u2019m no expert, but, like, when I asked him about it, he was like, \u2018I guess I\u2019ve never really thought too much about it.\u2019 That affected me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked him, too, like, what his church\u2019s views are [on LGBTQ issues], and he said he didn\u2019t know,\u201d the bride added. \u201cSo then I watched a sermon online \u2014 about sexual identity, and it was traditional.\u201d\n\nCarton also told Love is Blind producers that she suspected Mezzenga had a difference of opinion on \u201cequality, religion, [and] the vaccine,\u201d which, in part, caused her to her to walk away from the altar.\n\nA slew of social media users and prominent conservatives took to X to proclaim that Mezzenga had \u201cdodged a bullet.\u201d They also blasted Carton for walking away from her own marriage over trivial woke issues.\n\n\u201cBest thing that never happened to this guy,\u201d Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk reacted, adding, \u201cDodged a bullet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat dude dodged a bullet,\u201d conservative comedy duo Kevin Hodge and Keith Hodge echoed, adding a laughing-crying emoji.\n\n\u201cThis woman turned down her fianc\u00e9 at the altar because of his views on the BLM movement, sexual identity, and the vaccine. This man just dodged a bullet,\u201d conservative activist Isabella DeLuca resounded.\n\n\u201cIs there anything more annoying than a liberal white woman?\u201d Tomi Lahren Is Fearless host Tomi Lahren inquired.\n\n\u201cThis young man dodged a bullet,\u201d ACT for America founder Brigitte Gabriel proclaimed.\n\n\u201cHe dodged a 50 cal bullet,\u201d another X user specified.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find him a nice, conservative 20-something girl. He\u2019ll look back and laugh at this,\u201d Fox news host Laura Ingraham declared.\n\n\u201cThis man just avoided a life of misery,\u201d conservative commentator Collin Rugg surmised, adding, \u201cCongrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis girl on Love Is Blind said NO at the alter because of BLM, the vaccine, and sexuality,\u201d conservative influencer Morgonn McMichael reacted, adding, \u201cLiberal women are INSUFFERABLE & MISERABLE.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watched the wedding episode of love is blind season 8 and I cannot believe Sara is not marrying Ben because he doesn\u2019t care for BLM,\u201d another X user laughed.\n\n\u201cBiggest dating mistake I made as an on-and-off single guy for 20 years in NYC was thinking you can get around values/beliefs. Trust me guys, no matter how hot she is, if she hates America and freedom, it won\u2019t work, isn\u2019t worth it,\u201d Buck Sexton added.\n\n\u201cMinneapolis white women are crazy.

But I had to stop watching mid-season because this young woman was so insufferable.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wanted this nice, midwestern Christian young man to conform to her TQ+ radical ideology,\u201d the X user added.\n\nAnother called Carton \u201ca walking caricature of performative wokeness,\u201d adding, \u201cHer entire identity seems to hinge entirely on her sister\u2019s sexuality and a laundry list of social justice buzzwords, rather than any discernible depth or authenticity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about principle and more about clinging to a trendy ideology that crumbles under scrutiny \u2014 woke nonsense masquerading as moral superiority,\u201d the X user added.\n\nAnother X user suspected Carton\u2019s lesbian sister, Lisa, of being \u201cjealous of Sara\u2019s straight happiness\u201d and engaging in \u201csabotaging\u201d behavior.\n\n\u201cSara from Love is Blind is desperately trying to appease her sister\u2019s ideology instead of her owns. Pretty clear she\u2019s been grilled down by her sister on what \u2018her\u2019 views should be,\u201d another wrote.\n\nNotably, a scene from an earlier Love is Blind episode features Lisa and her girlfriend, Kelsie, lecturing Carton and Mezzenga about LGBTQ issues and Mezzenga\u2019s alleged \u201cprivilege.\u201d\n\nIn the clip, Carton can be heard assuring Lisa and Kelsie that if she goes to church with Mezzenga, she will make sure the church \u201caccepts\u201d LGBTQ. But that didn\u2019t appear to be good enough for Kelsie, who then lectured the couple about the word \u201cacceptance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the word \u2018acceptance\u2019 because it\u2019s like there\u2019s something wrong with us that you have to accept,\u201d Kelsie said, to which Carton responded by immediately displaying subservience and giving her sister\u2019s girlfriend the opportunity to police her speech, asking, \u201cWhat word should I use then?\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nKelsie then bizarrely states that she \u201chates\u201d it when churches say \u201cWe accept everybody.\u201d\n\nMezzenga is then seen trying to placate the lesbian couple by saying he is \u201cfiscally conservative but socially liberal,\u201d but that, too, is not good enough for Kelsie, who then lectures Carton, saying her \u201cprivileged\u201d fianc\u00e9 is likely still voting in a way that hinders her \u201crights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are things that women experience that men do not in this world and in this country,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHow you vote maters, and there are things that we have to consider [as a lesbian couple] that you guys don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people that are fiscally conservative and socially liberal that probably vote differently than you, and that impacts your rights,\u201d Kelsie lectured Carton, adding, \u201cI think you guys need to have serious conversations about politics, because he\u2019s in a different privilege bucket than you\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday said it would review a Colorado law that bars mental health professionals from practicing \u201cconversion therapy\u201d for minors, a discredited practice that attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nKaley Chiles, a licensed counselor and practicing Christian, challenged that law under the First Amendment, claiming that her patients voluntarily seek out her services.\n\nChiles, who was represented by the religious group Alliance Defending Freedom, argued that the laws enacted in Colorado and more than 19 other states \u201csilence counselors\u2019 ability to express views their clients seek.\u201d But state officials countered that they may regulate the medical treatment of patients.\n\n\u201cA professional\u2019s treatment of her patients and clients is fundamentally different, for First Amendment purposes, from laypersons\u2019 interactions with each other,\u201d Colorado officials said.\n\nThe case, similar to one the Supreme Court rejected in late 2023 from a licensed marriage and family counselor in Washington state, echoes another high profile case pending on the docket. In US v. Skrmetti, Tennessee is defending a ban on puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender youth on the grounds that the state had broad power to regulate medicine.\n\nIn that case, the court\u2019s conservatives signaled during oral arguments in December that they were prepared to defer to state lawmakers on such bans. A decision is expected by July.\n\nCritics say conversion therapy \u2013 which attempts to convert people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning \u2013 into straight or cisgender people, causes serious emotional harm and can have deadly results.\n\nChiles sued over the Colorado law in 2022. A federal district court denied her request to temporarily suspend its enforcement and the Denver-based 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision. Chiles appealed to the Supreme Court in November.\n\nIn a similar appeal rejected by the high court in 2023, three conservative justices \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas \u2013 said they would have considered the case.\n\nUnder the state law, Thomas wrote in five-page opinion, \u201clicensed counselors cannot voice anything other than the state-approved opinion on minors with gender dysphoria without facing punishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the court declines to take this particular case, I have no doubt that the issue it presents will come before the court again,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cWhen it does, the court should do what it should have done here: grant certiorari to consider what the First Amendment requires.\u201d\n\nAlito said in a brief dissent in 2023 that the court should have taken up the case to address an issue that lower courts have been divided on.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, 20 States and the District of Columbia have adopted laws prohibiting or restricting the practice of conversion therapy,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cIt is beyond dispute that these laws restrict speech, and all restrictions on speech merit careful scrutiny.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report."

But Trump again failed to mention a critical fact.\n\nThose high tariffs kick in only after the US has hit a certain Trump-negotiated quantity of tariff-free dairy sales to Canada each year \u2013 and as the US dairy industry acknowledges, the US is not hitting its allowed zero-tariff maximum in any category of dairy product.\n\nIn many categories, notably including milk, the US is not even at half of the zero-tariff maximum.\n\n\u201cIn practice, these tariffs are not actually paid by anyone,\u201d Al Mussell, an expert on Canadian agricultural trade, said in an email Friday.\n\nTrump also made a claim that is simply false. He told reporters Friday that the situation with Canadian dairy tariffs was \u201cwell taken care of\u201d at the time his first presidency ended, \u201cbut under Biden, they just kept raising it.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Canada did not raise its dairy tariffs under then-President Joe Biden, as official Canadian documents show and industry groups on both sides of the border confirmed to CNN. The tariffs Trump was denouncing Friday were left in place by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which Trump negotiated, signed in 2018 and has since touted as \u201cthe best trade deal ever made.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to CNN\u2019s Friday request for comment.\n\nTrump vowed Friday to retaliate against Canada with new US dairy tariffs in the coming days, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday on NBC that the president\u2019s response to Canada on dairy will actually come on April 2, the day Trump has said he will impose reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world.\n\nTrump\u2019s USMCA left Canada\u2019s high dairy tariffs in place\n\nTrump did achieve dairy concessions from Canada.\n\nCanada has for decades irked US lawmakers with \u201csupply management\u201d policies that support Canadian farmers and protect its dairy, egg and poultry industries from foreign competition.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s USMCA, Canada guaranteed it wouldn\u2019t apply any tariffs to specific amounts of US imports per year in 14 dairy categories, such as milk, cream, cheese, ice cream, butter and cream powder, and yogurt and buttermilk. These new US-specific quotas, which Canada agreed to increase over time, gave American farmers and companies more access to the Canadian market.\n\nBut the USMCA didn\u2019t get Canada to lower the tariffs that apply to imports above the quota thresholds. And contrary to Trump\u2019s Friday claim, those tariffs didn\u2019t spike under Biden.\n\nMussell, senior research fellow at the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute and research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems, pointed CNN to Canada\u2019s published tariff lists for 2025, 2020 (the last calendar year of Trump\u2019s first term) and 2017 (the first calendar year of Trump\u2019s first term, before the USMCA was in place). They show the dairy tariff levels were the same each year for imports above the zero-tariff maximums \u2013 for example, 298.5% for above-maximum butter and 245.5% for above-maximum cheddar cheese.\n\nThose tariff levels are eye-popping, and they certainly function as major trade barriers above the zero-tariff quota maximums. (Mussell noted: \u201cThe US has precisely this same system for its dairy market. It has tariff-rate quotas, and beyond that volume, very stiff tariffs and almost no imports.\u201d) But the International Dairy Foods Association, which represents the American dairy manufacturing and marketing industry, pointed out Friday that the US is not at Canada\u2019s zero-tariff maximum in any category.\n\nBecky Rasdall Vargas, the organization\u2019s senior vice president of trade and workforce policy, argued in an interview that Canada is to blame for the inability of the US to get to the maximums, saying Canada is unfairly deploying obstacles that make it \u201charder and harder\u201d for the US to sell into the Canadian market. She said that while \u201cwe don\u2019t love the tariffs,\u201d the primary issue is that \u201cwe can never even fill the quota to begin with\u201d because Canada is using administrative tactics to deny the US the market access it is supposed to have under the USMCA.\n\nWe won\u2019t try to adjudicate this complex debate, which the Biden administration and the Canadian government battled out at a USMCA dispute resolution panel. Regardless, Trump\u2019s assertion that Canada kept hiking its dairy tariffs when Biden was in charge is just not true.\n\n\u2018Almost all\u2019 US agricultural exports to Canada face no tariffs\n\nCanada\u2019s protectionism over its dairy, egg and poultry industries is an exception, not the norm.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture notes on its website that under the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which preceded Trump\u2019s USMCA, \u201calmost all\u201d US agricultural exports to Canada, and vice versa, faced no tariffs or quotas. The USMCA kept in place that zero-tariff, zero-quota trade while securing greater US access to the smattering of Canadian markets that are governed by supply management.\n\nAnd while Trump claimed in February that \u201cthey don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part,\u201d Canada is actually the world\u2019s second-largest export market for US agricultural products as a whole, according to the US Department of Agriculture, purchasing about $28.4 billion worth in 2024.\n\nCanada is also the second-largest US export market for dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024. That figure has grown steadily over the past decade, from about $625.5 million in 2015."

            "full_content": "In a memoir set to be published Tuesday, a former Facebook employee lays out allegations of misconduct at the company, including claims of sexual harassment and what she says were incomplete statements to Congress about Facebook\u2019s relationship with China.\n\nSarah Wynn-Williams says in the book and in an exclusive interview with NBC News that she faced retaliation from the company after she reported sexual harassment by her boss, Joel Kaplan, who at the time was a vice president for global public policy. Kaplan has since become chief global affairs officer, serving as the company\u2019s public face in Washington and other world capitals.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, said in a statement Sunday that the book includes \u201cfalse accusations about our executives.\u201d The company confirmed that Wynn-Williams accused Kaplan of sexual harassment, but it said an investigation cleared him in 2017.\n\nFormer Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan, Sarah Wynn-Williams and Elliot Schrage. Courtesy Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nWynn-Williams was fired that year. She said she believes the decision was retaliation after she complained about Kaplan. Meta says she was fired for \u201cpoor performance and toxic behavior.\u201d Elliot Schrage, who was one of Wynn-Williams\u2019 supervisors, said in a statement that he fired her \u201cbased on her repeated failures\u201d to address performance concerns such as \u201cindecision, shifting focus, and failure to execute on hiring\u201d on the policy leadership team.\n\nWynn-Williams is a former director of global public policy, making her one of the highest-ranking former Facebook employees to come forward as a critic of the company. Hired in 2011, when the company\u2019s public policy team was small, she managed a growing staff and oversaw government relations for entire continents, including Asia and South America. She reported to corporate vice presidents and had direct contact with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer.\n\nWynn-Williams also alleges that Sandberg crossed professional lines with her and another employee in a way that made her uncomfortable.\n\nThe memoir covers the six-plus years when Wynn-Williams, a former New Zealand diplomat, met foreign officials and accompanied Zuckerberg and other top executives as they met in person with presidents and prime ministers.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, then Facebook's chief operating officer, and Elliot Schrage, its vice president of global communications and public policy, on Capitol Hill in 2017. James Lawler Duggan / Reuters file\n\nIn the memoir, \u201cCareless People,\u201d to be published by Flatiron Books, she alleges that Facebook ignored internal alarms about possible damage to human rights and democracy as it pursued unrelenting growth, including in China, during a crucial period in the company\u2019s history.\n\nShe said in the interview that she was speaking out because she sees Meta repeating the same mistakes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a moment now where technology CEOs and political leaders around the world are joining forces and compounding their influence, compounding their power, and that\u2019s got consequences for everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople need to understand what has actually gone on.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the memoir, Wynn-Williams says, she filed a whistleblower complaint last year with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that Meta misled investors. NBC News has reviewed the complaint. An SEC spokesperson said Friday that the commission does not comment on potential investigations into whistleblower submissions or actions taken in response to them.\n\nMeta criticized the memoir and rejected her accusations.\n\n\u201cThis is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nSarah Wynn-Williams in New York on Thursday. Elise Wrabetz / NBC News\n\nThe company also accused Wynn-Williams of being \u201can anti-Facebook activist.\u201d Since she left Facebook, she has advocated publicly for the company\u2019s shareholders to adopt new policies regarding sexual harassment and China.\n\n\u201cWhistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,\u201d the company said.\n\nThrough her attorney, Wynn-Williams said Meta was \u201ctrying to mislead the public\u201d through its statements about her and the book.\n\nIn anticipation of the book, Meta filed an emergency request for a hearing before an arbitrator Saturday, arguing that Wynn-Williams had violated a nondisparagement agreement and seeking \u201cinjunctive relief barring disparagement.\u201d Jonathan Cohn, a Meta lawyer, wrote in a letter to the publisher, Flatiron Books, on Friday that the book\u2019s marketing suggested it would contain \u201coverheated, false, and potentially defamatory allegations,\u201d and he asked for a chance to make revisions.\n\nFlatiron Books defended its process, saying in a statement: \u201cThis book is a first person narrative account of what the author herself witnessed. We thoroughly vetted the book. We have no obligation to give Meta or anyone else the opportunity to shut down her story.\u201d It also accused Meta of trying to \u201cinstitute a gag order to silence our author.\u201d\n\nA person who appears in the book, former Meta spokesperson Debbie Frost, broadly criticized its contents Sunday on the Meta-owned social media app Threads, saying that \u201ca bunch of the stories are exaggerated or just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d A second Meta employee who worked with Wynn-Williams, Tessa Lyons, now an Instagram vice president, said on Threads that the book was \u201cdishonest and distorted.\u201d\n\nThe book chronicles what Wynn-Williams describes as Zuckerberg\u2019s halting evolution from a software-focused engineer and political novice into an executive who micromanaged content moderation decisions about far-flung countries and considered his own run for president. Wynn-Williams cites firsthand experience from meetings and quotes from strategy memos, emails and dozens of other corporate documents, many of which she provided to NBC News.\n\nJoel Kaplan, Mark Zuckerberg and Sarah Wynn-Williams. Courtesy Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nThe book is being published two months after Zuckerberg promoted Kaplan to be Meta\u2019s chief liaison to the Trump administration and other governments. Kaplan was White House deputy chief of staff for former President George W. Bush.\n\nIn 2016, as part of an email chain about Wynn-Williams\u2019 U.S. citizenship test, Kaplan asked her whether the test included the phrase \u201cdirty sanchez,\u201d a sexual slang phrase and racial slur, according to the book and a copy of the email seen by NBC News.\n\nWynn-Williams also described Kaplan\u2019s asking her after childbirth \u201cwhere are you bleeding from?\u201d and telling her at a company event that she looked \u201csultry.\u201d She writes that she considered Kaplan\u2019s behavior to be inappropriate and that she believed the investigation in 2017 was unfairly turned back on her.\n\nThen-President George W. Bush meets with members of his economic team, including White House deputy chief of staff for policy Joel Kaplan, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on July 27, 2007. Martin H. Simon / Pool via Getty Images file\n\nA member of Wynn-Williams\u2019 family, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared professional repercussions, said in an interview Sunday that they remember Wynn-Williams telling them in 2017 about the \u201cbleeding\u201d question and the \u201csultry\u201d comment. This person said Wynn-Williams was uncomfortable at the time with Kaplan\u2019s behavior.\n\nMeta said in its statement Sunday that the investigation \u201cdetermined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.\u201d Meta said the investigation involved 17 witness interviews over 42 days and that the company reviewed every document she provided.\n\nKaplan did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Joel Kaplan, then its vice president for global public policy, in Paris in 2018. Aurelien Morissard / IP3 / Getty Images file\n\nWynn-Williams writes that she was also uncomfortable with how Sandberg crossed what Wynn-Williams considered professional boundaries. Sandberg, the company\u2019s No. 2 executive, has been heralded as a champion of women, especially women in business, because of her success and her 2013 book, \u201cLean In,\u201d and she has advocated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. Sandberg wrote a second book, \u201cOption B,\u201d after her husband, Dave Goldberg, died suddenly in 2015.\n\nAccording to Wynn-Williams and the SEC whistleblower complaint, Sandberg repeatedly insisted that she join Sandberg in sharing a bed on a private jet as they traveled from Davos, Switzerland, to California in January 2016. Wynn-Williams, who was pregnant at the time, writes that she considered the demand to be inappropriate and mortifying and that she refused. She writes that Sandberg resented her refusal and told her at the end of the flight, \u201cYou should have got into bed.\u201d She writes that, later, she felt marginalized by Sandberg at work.\n\nA person who was on the plane said in an interview Sunday that they recall everyone on the plane, including Sandberg and other staff members, encouraging Wynn-Williams to get some sleep. This person said they did so because Wynn-Williams was visibly pregnant and they were concerned about her health, not for any other reason. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said they recall the plane as having multiple beds.\n\nAnother person who knew Wynn-Williams at the time, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Wynn-Williams told them about what happened on the plane not long afterward.\n\nIn the book and in the SEC complaint, Wynn-Williams writes that Sandberg further created an uncomfortable working environment when she instructed a different employee to purchase $13,000 worth of lingerie for Sandberg and the employee. NBC News has reviewed copies of those emails. The employee declined to comment.\n\nSandberg, through her family foundation, declined to comment on the memoir. She stepped down as Meta\u2019s chief operating officer in 2022 and left the company\u2019s board of directors last year.\n\nKumiko Hidaka, Vivian Tokai, Debbie Frost, Atsushi Iwashita, Sarah Wynn-Williams and Sheryl Sandberg. Courtesy Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nWynn-Williams is the latest whistleblower to emerge from a decade of scandals at Meta involving the company\u2019s impact on elections, violent polarization, teenage mental health and privacy. Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, testified before Congress in 2021 after she released documents showing internal dissent over company policies.\n\nThe memoir lands at a sensitive time for Meta as it stares down regulators around the globe. The company is locked in antitrust fights in the United States, with the European Union and in India, while Zuckerberg has pivoted Meta\u2019s politics to the right to align more closely with President Donald Trump.\n\nMeta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, is pouring vast sums of money into the international race to develop artificial intelligence \u2014 a contest that also involves China.\n\nWynn-Williams arrived at the company in 2011 as it was making its debut on the world stage. The Arab Spring protests fueled in part by social media had just begun, and Facebook did not have established relationships with most governments or international organizations. The scrutiny Facebook would receive for inflaming tensions that contributed to massacres in places such as Myanmar and Sri Lanka was still years away.\n\nHer background fit what Facebook lacked: A native of New Zealand and a lawyer and a diplomat by training, she had worked for the New Zealand government at its embassy in Washington and at United Nations headquarters in New York.\n\nFormer Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Mark Zuckerberg and Sarah Wynn-Williams. Courtesy Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nBut while she joined the company with optimism about its mission, she said, the choices made by executives, including Zuckerberg and Sandberg, eventually soured her.\n\n\u201cThey really could have chosen to do it all differently and fix so much of what\u2019s been destructive about Facebook,\u201d she writes. Instead, she calls the app \u201can incredibly valuable tool for the most autocratic, oppressive regimes.\u201d\n\nWynn-Williams writes that persuading Zuckerberg to meet international leaders was a challenge. A night owl who preferred wearing T-shirts, he would rarely take meetings before noon and did not want to wear clothing appropriate for the occasions, she writes. Asked at one point whether he wanted to meet the prime minister of New Zealand, Wynn-Williams says, Zuckerberg brusquely dismissed the idea \u2014 not realizing the politician was standing next to him.\n\nIn the memoir, Wynn-Williams describes Zuckerberg as fumbling his way through various encounters: getting snubbed by the prime minister of Canada, refusing to prepare before he met the president-elect of Indonesia, arriving late for an event with the president of Colombia, ad-libbing part of a speech to the U.N. General Assembly and getting turned down when he asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to name his unborn child.\n\n\u201cInitially, he would not want a briefing longer than a text message,\u201d Wynn-Williams said in the interview. But by the end of her tenure, she said, \u201che couldn\u2019t get enough information about politics and how it worked.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Zuckerberg has rarely appeared in public with world leaders. Though he attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in January and hosted a party to celebrate the event, he is more likely to be seen with mixed martial arts fighters or famous musicians.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol rotunda on Jan. 20. Kenny Holston / Pool via Getty Images\n\nThe book includes anecdotes that Wynn-Williams says show snippets of Zuckerberg\u2019s personality, gathered while she traveled with him: his belief that Andrew Jackson was the greatest American president, his interest in collecting wine from the Jackson era in the 1830s, his desire to have a \u201ctribe\u201d of children and his professed ignorance that Facebook employees were letting him win at the board game Settlers of Catan.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to win that way?\u201d she quotes herself asking Zuckerberg during one game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not winning that way,\u201d she says he responded.\n\nWynn-Williams writes that she believes many of Meta\u2019s mistakes in recent years could have been avoided. She writes that Facebook failed to act on warnings before 2016 about how politicians were using it to sway voters with half-truths.\n\nWynn-Williams says Facebook is defined by \u201clethal carelessness,\u201d claiming executives failed to respond appropriately to knowledge that Facebook inflamed global tensions and instability. She cites Facebook\u2019s role in fueling ethnic hatred and massacres, including in Myanmar, where Facebook has acknowledged that it failed to take down posts inciting violence even though the posts violated its terms of service. Wynn-Williams said the company had dragged its feet for years on hiring staff members to help moderate content from Myanmar, the site of what the U.N. calls a genocide.\n\nThe memoir goes into depth about a major question that hung over Facebook at the time: whether it would do business in China, where the government had banned its apps as part of its vast system of censorship. Facebook called its multiyear effort, starting in 2014, to persuade the Chinese government to allow the use of their apps \u201cProject Aldrin,\u201d after astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Various parts of the effort \u2014 including the building of China-specific censorship tools \u2014 have leaked over time.\n\nWynn-Williams cites or quotes from dozens of internal records about the project, some of which were reported Sunday by The Washington Post.\n\nShe writes that Zuckerberg committed to the idea of re-entering China in 2014 because he wanted to grow Facebook\u2019s user base, and she writes that Facebook had little regard for the concessions it would need to make to the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no acknowledgment at all of the moral complexity of working in an authoritarian country that surveils its own citizens and doesn\u2019t allow free speech,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cChina is, in Mark\u2019s eyes, just the end of a to-do list, the last major project to tackle,\u201d she adds.\n\n\"Careless People\" by Sarah Wynn-Williams. Elise Wrabetz / NBC News\n\nIn a series of Slack screenshots seen by NBC News, Facebook employees in 2017 discuss building specific tools to present to China\u2019s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China. The employees discuss tests they could perform for the regulators to build trust in Facebook\u2019s ability to run content-blocking tools.\n\nTheir work is echoed in several other internal documents, seen by NBC News, that include Facebook employees discussing the specifics of what they are building to show the Cyberspace Administration. Facebook employees spoke with Chinese regulators about how a censorship system could work and about what Facebook needed to do to win approval to release its apps there, according to the book and documents seen by NBC News.\n\nWynn-Williams says that the next year, when U.S. lawmakers asked Facebook about its China plans, the company shared less than it knew. Facebook submitted unsigned written testimony in 2018 to three Senate committees saying it was \u201cnot in a position to know\u201d how China would seek to apply its laws to a theoretical Facebook China service \u2014 without mentioning its years of research and negotiations.\n\nZuckerberg said in 2019 that he had largely given up the idea of operating apps in China, saying in an address about free expression that Facebook and China \u201ccould never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there.\u201d\n\nBut Meta does make huge amounts of money from China. Meta said last year that, in 2023, 10% of its revenue came from China-based advertisers trying to reach people who use Meta\u2019s apps \u2014 a figure that equals about $1 billion a month."

            "full_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe lack of a defined, public and overarching plan for President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency effort to drastically shrink the federal workforce has meant that information has seeped out here and there.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if there is a set of goals the administration is trying to reach other than simply to cut government.\n\nTo connect the dots of what\u2019s happening, I reached out to Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan and nonprofit group that advocates for good government.\n\nIt would be one thing, he told me, if workers were being cut intentionally, but it seems indiscriminate and arbitrary.\n\nInstead of \u201cReady, aim, fire,\u201d he said, it\u2019s \u201cfire, fire fire.\u201d\n\nThat should concern Americans, he argued, since the government belongs to everyone.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re watching right now is arson of a public asset, which is our federal government,\u201d Stier said.\n\nExcerpts of our full conversation, conducted by phone, are below.\n\nMissing the forest for the trees\n\nWOLF: First, please just help Americans see the see the forest on DOGE and all of these changes we\u2019re reading about.\n\nSTIER: I think the most important way of thinking about this is really fundamentally about the purpose of our government. Is it there to look out for the public good or the private interests of the office holder of the day.\n\nThat, to me, is what should be the overall narrative for people.\n\nWe had a system 140 years plus ago called the spoils system. It was the system of to the victor goes the spoils. Whoever was president got to put in place loyalists and partisans in federal jobs, and it resulted in corruption and incompetence, and ultimately in the assassination of President (James) Garfield in 1881 by a disgruntled job seeker.\n\nThat led to the system we have today of non-political, merit-based civil service, and the basic proposition that presidents were there to serve the public\u2019s will and to follow the rule of law.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is the deconstruction of that system that has served us well for 140 years \u2013 not perfectly, but well.\n\nThere are certainly lots of things that we can do better in government. Our government needs to be modernized. But what we\u2019re seeing now, in terms of the return to the spoils system, is going in the exactly wrong direction.\n\nBut Trump is also talking about a return to a merit system\n\nWOLF: There\u2019s an irony here since Trump, in his address to a joint session of Congress, was talking about how he is returning to a merit system by doing away with diversity programs, some of which have been in place since the 1960s. How do you refute his argument that this purging of the workforce is actually a return to the to the merit system?\n\nSTIER: It\u2019s important not to confuse different elements of what\u2019s going on here. There is this variety of excuses being offered as to the changes that are taking place, and one of those is this notion of getting rid of DEI. Whatever the merits are of that \u2013 and I don\u2019t even think we need to get into that \u2013 things that are happening to our government now are, at best, infinitesimally, tangentially related to DEI.\n\nThe firings of what are called probationary workers, who are basically the new workers in the federal government, are arbitrary with no cohesive plan, with no focus on poor performers, no focus on job occupations, that has nothing to do with DEI. The firing of Inspectors General, the people who are tasked with getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse in our government, across the government, that has nothing to do with DEI. The firing of the head of the Office of Special Counsel, that has nothing to do with DEI. That\u2019s somebody who\u2019s supposed to make sure that whistleblowers who are finding waste, fraud and abuse have a place to go.\n\nThe things that he has done in all these areas are about making the government more pliant to his wishes.\n\nThe public will pay a price for what\u2019s already happened\n\nWOLF: You talked about the Office of Special Counsel. The head of that office is fighting for his job in court. He\u2019s also brought to the Merit Systems Protection Board the firing of 5,000 USDA workers. Is there an opportunity for the system, essentially, to work despite Trump\u2019s efforts, or have we already seen irreparable harm to the bureaucracy?\n\nSTIER: It\u2019s not over yet. There\u2019s certainly opportunities to redress the problems that have been created. Honestly, the plans that have been described so far would take us even further down this road. The plans we\u2019re seeing are the firing of 90,000 VA workers and other parts of the government. The courts have stepped in to stop some of the things that are clearly illegal, and they can make things better, but they don\u2019t fix them. When people are fired illegally and they\u2019re given their job back, at least temporarily, they\u2019ve still been fired.\n\n(CNN has reported on a plan to cut more than 70,000 workers at VA.)\n\n\u2018Worse than amateur hour\u2019\n\nWOLF: These larger plans are coming out to us in drips and drabs. Why is it a problem that we don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s ultimate plan for the government is?\n\nSTIER: There does not appear to be a strategy. What we\u2019re seeing right now is not ready, aim, fire; but fire, fire, fire.\n\nThere does not appear to be justification for the cuts that have been made. There\u2019s no appropriate preparation, and it\u2019s being done in a way that is most hurtful to the people involved.\n\nIt is worse than amateur hour.\n\nWe\u2019re hearing drips and drabs of plans to fire people or to make cuts but no justification for why those cuts, why those people being fired, and no evidence that it\u2019s been either thoughtfully constructed or thoughtfully done. In fact, it\u2019s the reverse.\n\n\u201cArson of a public asset\u201d\n\nWOLF: This is not being done with transparency, so what should Americans assume is the end game of the White House here?\n\nSTIER: When you\u2019re dealing with public assets, there\u2019s a responsibility, there\u2019s an obligation for those in power to be transparent. And this, in itself, is a major violation of their responsibility as public leaders.\n\nCongress has been absent. Congress should be demanding the exact information that we\u2019re talking about right now. It should be asking for the strategy, the plans, the justification, and they deserve it as much as the larger public does.\n\nThis is important, because these are public assets. What we\u2019re watching right now is arson of a public asset, which is our federal government. There should be a pretty high bar to justify that.\n\nThere\u2019s some rationalization that this is about saving money, when in fact, the costs are clearly going to be far larger than anything that\u2019s actually saved, and even their statement of savings is demonstrably proven wrong.\n\nThere\u2019s a cost to cutting\n\nWOLF: Why is the cost of this effort going to be more than the savings?\n\nSTIER: Fundamentally look at the firings themselves. They\u2019re firing people illegally, who are now having to be rehired. The human cost is enormous. You\u2019ve got thousands of people who are fired that have to protect their rights and get rehired, at least temporarily. The people who are defending the illegal actions of President Trump\u2019s personnel are our civil servants, and where there\u2019s liability, back pay, etc. it\u2019s going to be the American taxpayer that pays them.\n\nThe probationary folks, the new employees that are getting fired are the newest in to the federal government. They cost north of $5,000 a person to recruit, to hire and to train these new employees. That\u2019s all wasted money for no strategic reason, no analysis. What we\u2019re seeing is a little bit similar to someone saying, I saved money because I stopped paying my electric bill. Are you going to sit in the dark, or are you actually doing something that makes the whole system better?\n\nNo precedent for Elon Musk in government\n\nWOLF: What is your view of Elon Musk and DOGE\u2019s involvement in this?\n\nSTIER: It comes back to transparency point. We\u2019ve never had anything remotely like this before, where you have a private individual with enormous financial interest in the decision making of the government, making large across-the-board decisions in the government with no protections against ensuring that the use of public authorities is for the public good rather than his private input.\n\nOur government is a public asset and the use of government authority should only be for public interest. Understanding that he\u2019s pulling the strings when he has no business doing so, given his business, given the fact that he himself has not been confirmed by the Senate, or even really a full time federal employee.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on this. There is historical precedent going back to the 1930s that justifies the existence of these independent agencies, that is the law today. Can this Supreme Court overturn it? They could, but it\u2019s the law of the day today.\n\nThe normal way we would proceed in these circumstances would be to assume these things are constitutional until the Supreme Court changed the law. But that is not where we are right now.\n\nThe Framers wouldn\u2019t have imagined many of the complexities we have in this world that that justified the creation of these entities. You look at something like the Federal Reserve, which is one of the independent entities. Pretty much all economists would say that the independence that exists for the Federal Reserve is really very good for our well-being as a country and for our economy.\n\nThis is another example where this president is trying to become the king and is trying to seize power across the board. His motivations have to be questioned when it\u2019s not just those independent agencies he\u2019s going after, but he\u2019s going after folks like the inspector generals and the head of the Office of Special Counsel. There is no there\u2019s no justification for doing that that is aligned with the well-being of the American people. It is just bad for them, because what you\u2019re losing are the people who are actually there responsible for getting at waste, fraud and abuse."

            "full_content": "Photo: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nNew York City\u2019s mayoral race received a significant jolt earlier this month with the news that former governor Andrew Cuomo was officially challenging Mayor Eric Adams for his seat in an attempted comeback following his abrupt resignation years prior. He joins an already crowded field of state legislators \u2014 Jessica Ramos, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani as well as current and former comptrollers Brad Lander and Scott Stringer, among others. That number grew even more as City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams announced her bid for mayor, adding another moderate voice to the race.\n\nI recently spoke with Dr. Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, about Cuomo\u2019s entry into the race, whether he could pull from Mayor Adams\u2019s moderate base, and if his bid could present a new opportunity for the other challengers in the race.\n\nThere\u2019s been this impression that Andrew Cuomo is inevitable, with him leading in the polls even before he jumped into the mayoral race. Is this just a result of coming into this with a high name ID as the former governor, or is this a true signal that this is Cuomo\u2019s race to lose?\n\nI think it might be his race to lose. I mean, obviously, New Yorkers appear to be very frustrated with Eric Adams and the current administration. It doesn\u2019t appear that New Yorkers have coalesced around an opposition candidate who has been running thus far. So it\u2019s left space for them to find him attractive because, let\u2019s be clear, on a lot of measures, many of Eric Adams\u2019s policies have been a success. It\u2019s just the perception of corruption and incompetence that is plaguing his administration. So people are looking for an alternative \u2014 in a personality, in a person \u2014 but not necessarily in the policies. And that\u2019s why people are clamoring toward an Andrew Cuomo, because it\u2019s, in many ways, much of Eric Adams\u2019s policies, just in different packaging.\n\nAnd Cuomo is entering this race as a more moderate candidate, putting him in direct competition with Eric Adams.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not great for Eric Adams. But don\u2019t forget, we still have, most likely, a very low turnout race and a low-information race as to how ranked-choice voting works. I think the name recognition is huge for Andrew Cuomo. I think there\u2019ll be a lot of money spent on his behalf. I think there\u2019ll be a lot of money spent to make sure that Andrew Cuomo does not succeed. There are many people who want him to explain himself about COVID, about nursing homes, about sexual harassment. I mean, he does have some negatives in his column. But, by and large, New York isn\u2019t a progressive city, so a moderate candidate is appealing. And, again, it\u2019s not as though Andrew Cuomo was deviating from many of Eric Adams\u2019s policies. He\u2019s just presenting a different moderate alternative to Eric Adams.\n\nThroughout his career, Cuomo has cultivated relationships in the Black community and leaned on those through his reelections as well as during this attempted comeback. Many of those same voters and leaders helped to propel Mayor Adams to victory during his first campaign. Is there a sense that Cuomo could pull Black voters from Adams, or has his appeal in this regard been overstated?\n\nI think it\u2019s both. Yes, in some sectors, there are people who are frustrated with Eric Adams, and they think he is squandering a real opportunity and real potential, and so that\u2019s where Cuomo can pick up. But don\u2019t forget, now that Adrienne Adams is in the race, and also the fact that Zellnor Myrie has been making inroads with Black communities in his various races, it\u2019s not as binary as it may appear between Mayor Adams and Cuomo. There are other alternatives, significant ones at that.\n\nI also think the passing of NAACP New York State Conference president Hazel Dukes is huge, because Andrew Cuomo has gone to the Black community, yes, for campaigns, but he\u2019s also run to the Black community when he\u2019s been in trouble. And, by and large, Hazel Dukes and many Black leaders in Harlem, in particular, have been very forgiving, and they have contextualized the complexity that is Andrew Cuomo. I think that he was possibly hoping that he would have the tacit support of Hazel Dukes or, if nothing else, if she couldn\u2019t give it explicitly, she could help direct certain resources and support in his direction. That is no longer an option. And so, how he renegotiates some of his relationships with Black leaders, many of whom are older Black leaders who had a lot of love and admiration and respect for his father, which kind of translated to Andrew Cuomo \u2014 I think he\u2019ll have to figure that out.\n\nThough Adrienne Adams will likely have more of an uphill battle with her late entry, what do you think she brings to the race?\n\nI mean, if her policies are more moderate, essentially she\u2019s saying we have two highly flawed candidates in Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, and if you like some of their policies, I\u2019m presenting similar policy prescriptions, just without the baggage. Without the harassment, without the bullying, the list goes on and on. In her sort of campaign speech, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m a mother and a wife and just a girl from Queens, and, essentially, I like to do my job, build coalitions, and have no drama. And there are a lot of New Yorkers who just want that. They just want people to go to work. I don\u2019t want to hear about you at the club. I don\u2019t want to hear about you touching women. I don\u2019t want to hear about you bullying people. I don\u2019t want to hear about corruption and a few million dollars missing here from a book deal or you\u2019re surrounding yourself with friends that are taking bribes, allegedly. Like, I just want someone to do their job. We already have enough chaos at the federal level, and I think that will be appealing to a lot of New Yorkers since there is so much instability at the federal level. They want as much stability in the city as possible.\n\nBut if she, Cuomo, and Mayor Adams are all pulling from the same base of moderate voters, can she outrank those bigger names?\n\nWe still have four months, right? And it\u2019s New York politics, so a lot can change in four months. This is depending on if she can raise money, if she can get signatures to actually be on the stage. As of now, Jessica Ramos does not have the money to be on the stage. So we don\u2019t have any women who would be on the stage, presumably. And we also have three men who would be on the stage in Stringer, Adams, and Cuomo, who have all had sexual-misconduct allegations lobbied against them.\n\nFor the few people who are paying attention in the voting-eligible population that does decide to participate on June 24, if they\u2019re tuning into debates and Adrienne Adams is the only woman on the stage, there are ways that she can frame policy issues from a gendered perspective, which we\u2019ve seen effectively done. There are ways that she could frame their accusations in a way that sort of signals not just, you know, the Me Too movement, but just the level of distraction that some of these gentlemen could bring to the office. And, again, the shadow of Donald Trump is hanging over this election. So it\u2019s not just who could get resources from an erratic president. It\u2019s who could stay focused in a time where New York needs a mayor to be as focused as possible.\n\nThe field for this race was already crowded before Cuomo and Speaker Adams joined, largely featuring less-well-known state legislators and city officials. How do these new challengers potentially change the calculations for them, especially considering how unpredictable ranked-choice elections can be?\n\nIf anything, I think it just inspires them to stay in the race and double down. I mean, if you\u2019ve got eight-to-one matching funds, you never know what can happen in a New York City election. We had the looming court cases of Eric Adams that, thus far, have gone away, but not permanently. We do know that Andrew Cuomo had a bit of a bump, obviously, coming in, but we don\u2019t know what groups are going to organize against him, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s nursing homes, whether it\u2019s money, whether it\u2019s Me Too, right? There are a lot of moving parts. Even though I think of the Venn diagram of, say, Scott Stringer and Brad Lander overlapping quite a bit in a low-turnout, low-information election, why not stay in? If not for this year, who knows what it could do four years from now?\n\nYou\u2019re seeing different candidates trying to make their mark, especially with Cuomo jumping in. Myrie has a website calling out the governor over Trump. Mamdani has had a really strong social-media presence. Could Cuomo\u2019s entry actually be an opportunity for some of these other candidates?\n\nI mean, you have sort of two different villains now to talk about, right? We\u2019ve been talking about Eric Adams. We\u2019ve been talking about the questions of: Is he able to lead? Is he focused? All of those issues we\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time. This can galvanize some of the lesser-known candidates to actually have a new foil to talk about some of their own policy issues.\n\nNow that Andrew Cuomo is in, he\u2019s also going to have to answer some hard questions. It\u2019s one thing when it\u2019s speculation. But they\u2019re already questions of: Does he really live in New York? Does he know New York? He\u2019s going to get questions about the minutiae of New York. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who knows Albany better than Andrew Cuomo, but I\u2019m not sold that he knows New York City. And so, with the shadow of Donald Trump behind this election, it\u2019s who can get the most for New York City. Is it going to be a brash, bullying tactic? Is it going to be, you know, you get more with honey as opposed to vinegar? But we don\u2019t know. I mean, obviously, Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo, and Donald Trump have all known each other for a very, very long time and have worked together in various capacities. So there are a lot of moving parts, active moving parts, that are still unknown, and we\u2019ll sort of see how they play out in the next four months.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this push from some groups advocating for voters to not rank both Cuomo and Mayor Adams on their ballots and focus on more progressive challengers like Lander, Stringer, or Mamdani. Last time, we saw Kathryn Garcia and Andrew Yang form an alliance in the race. Could we see a similar move this time around, especially considering Speaker Adams and Cuomo joining the race?\n\nI\u2019m curious. I\u2019m not sold that that\u2019s a winning strategy. I mean, obviously, it wasn\u2019t a winning strategy. Neither one became mayor. But I do wonder if maybe we won\u2019t see a tag team like we saw with Garcia and Yang, but more of \u201canyone but Adams and Cuomo.\u201d So I\u2019m curious if that will sort of catch hold. It doesn\u2019t matter how you rank Brad or Zellnor or Zohran or Adrienne or Scott, it\u2019s just whatever you do, don\u2019t put the sort of two Queens boys on their ballot. And again, as I keep saying, it\u2019s the shadow of Donald Trump hovering over this election. And it will be interesting to see if Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo sort of get linked to this kind of, the three Queens boys. You know, Trump, Cuomo, Adams \u201ccan\u2019t play in the sandbox well with others,\u201d \u201ca lot of potential to do good, but they choose not to.\u201d There are a lot of conversations that could link the three in their quasi-similar personality styles at times. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if that\u2019s a strategy that some candidates go for or if it\u2019s something else."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nFederal judges hearing Trump administration litigation have increasingly gone beyond the case at hand to reflect on potential threats to democracy or offer dramatic assertions about the state of America.\n\nDemocratic and Republican appointees alike, these judges are giving voice to a simmering concern in judicial circles about the erosion of constitutional norms during the first weeks of the second Trump administration.\n\nBut in doing so, they are breaking with a culture of judicial restraint and defying the current reluctance in many quarters to cross President Donald Trump.\n\nThese judicial voices are rare, to be sure, but they are growing in number.\n\n\u201cAn American President is not a king,\u201d a federal judge in Washington, DC, slipped into an opinion on late Thursday.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge in Rhode Island hearing a dispute over a government-wide freeze on funding invoked America\u2019s founding \u201cafter enduring an eight-year war against a monarch\u2019s cruel reign\u201d and added a cautionary footnote: \u201cThis is what it all comes down to: we may choose to survive as a country by respecting our Constitution, the laws and norms of political and civil behavior. \u2026 Or, we may ignore these things at our peril.\u201d\n\nA judge in Seattle declared in a separate case, \u201cIt has become ever-more apparent that to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals.\u201d\n\nCurrent and retired federal judges told CNN they are watching the emerging pattern with trepidation. Some are heartened by jurists raising their voices, but others believe judges should be particularly restrained in today\u2019s polarized atmosphere.\n\nSupreme Court justices, for their part, have avoided broader statements about Trump\u2019s initiatives or the way he is wielding power.\n\nAnd Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative who has consistently sided with the Trump administration over the years, fired a warning of sorts to federal district court judges last week.\n\nAlito, joined by three other justices on the right wing, declared in a dissenting opinion that US District Judge Amir Ali, who\u2019d temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s freeze on billions in foreign aid, had engaged in \u201can act of judicial hubris.\u201d Alito said he was \u201cstunned\u201d that the majority had let the judge\u2019s order stand.\n\nThe US Supreme Court is seen in Washington, DC, on March 2, 2025. Tierney L Cross/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMore than 100 cases have been filed against Trump\u2019s executive orders and policies since he took office on January 20, and in many cases, judges are moving slowly and hewing to the discrete issues at hand.\n\nIt is still difficult to know how much of a check the third branch will be on the executive; the Republican-led Congress has demonstrated the legislative branch\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThese judicial voices of distress \u2014 at the first level of the three-tier federal bench \u2014 may indicate increased scrutiny for Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nOr they might, more truly, reveal developing friction within the federal bench over how to respond to Trump\u2019s unparalleled effort to expand executive power in modern times.\n\nFederal judges, appointed for life, follow canons of impartiality. A real dilemma exists among those who wear the robe over how freely to speak their mind.\n\nAnother factor is how much fire they might provoke. Trump\u2019s allies already have been publicly calling out individual judges who have ruled against the administration\u2019s moves to overhaul the government.\n\n\u201cHigh-ranking government officials (appointed and elected) have made repeated calls for the impeachment of judges who issue opinions with which the government does not agree,\u201d American Bar Association President William Bay said in a statement last week. \u201cThere have been calls to impeach \u2018corrupt judges\u2019 with no effort to produce evidence of the so called \u2018corruption.\u2019\u201d\n\nBay added that such acts of intimidation \u201care designed to cow our country\u2019s judges,\u201d and he called on fellow lawyers to be more vocal. \u201cWho will speak for the judiciary? Who will protect our system of justice? If we don\u2019t speak now, when will we speak?\u201d\n\nUS District Judge John Coughenour, of Seattle, hearing a challenge to Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship, was one of the first judges to level a broader admonition.\n\nWhen he indefinitely blocked the executive order, Coughenour, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, maintained Trump was playing \u201cpolicy games.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or simply ignore, whether that be for political or personal gain,\u201d Coughenour said in early February as he announced his order from the bench. \u201cIn this courtroom and under my watch, the rule of law is a bright beacon which I intend to follow.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, a district court judge in Maryland similarly blocked Trump\u2019s attempt to undermine birthright citizenship, but without the scalding criticism of Trump.\n\nJudge Deborah Boardman, an appointee of President Joe Biden, wrote that Trump\u2019s directive \u201cflouts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, conflicts with binding Supreme Court precedent, and runs counter to our 250-year history of citizenship by birth.\u201d\n\nJudge William Alsup in San Francisco, reviewing a challenge to the Office of Personal Management and mass firings of probationary employees, drew national notice for his alarm at the administration\u2019s approach: \u201cHow could so much of the workforce be amputated suddenly overnight?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so irregular and so widespread and so aberrant in the history of our country,\u201d he added.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of Bill Clinton, referred to an employee who\u2019d received a \u201cglowing\u201d report five days before termination for poor performance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not right in our country, is it, that we run our agencies with lies like that and stain somebody\u2019s record for the rest of their life? Who is going to want to work in a government that would do that to them?\u201d\n\nIn one of the most expansive reflections on the Trump litigation, US District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, looked to founding history as he said a Trump freeze on congressionally appropriated funds to states for social services \u201cfundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe begin by restating the American government principles learned during critical civics education lessons in our youth,\u201d McConnell, an appointee of Barack Obama, wrote in the case brought by nearly two dozen states seeking to ensure disbursement of appropriated grants, loans and other federal assistance.\n\n\u201cOur founders, after enduring an eight-year war against a monarch\u2019s cruel reign from an ocean away, understood too well the importance of a more balanced approach to governance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey constructed three co-equal branches of government, each tasked with their own unique duties, but with responsibilities over the other branches as a check in order to ensure that no branch overstepped their powers, upsetting the balance of the fledgling constitutional republic.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said the Trump administration had \u201cput itself above Congress\u201d as it blocked the appropriated funds, adding that the move would significantly disrupt critical health, education and other public assistance programs.\n\nIn another remarkable gesture, McConnell lifted a caution from an earlier case in his district: \u201cThis is what it all comes down to: we may choose to survive as a country by respecting our Constitution, the laws and norms of political and civic behavior, and by educating our children on civics, the rule of law, and what it really means to be an American, and what America means. Or, we may ignore these things at our \u2026 peril.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s Thursday rejection of the administration\u2019s attempt to halt appropriated funds followed a similar order, on February 25, by US District Judge Loren AliKhan, a Biden appointee, in Washington, DC.\n\nIn her order blocking the administration\u2019s pause on the disbursement of financial assistance, she referred to the \u201cnationwide chaos and paralysis\u201d the administration had generated, but she declined to offer a larger assessment of this moment in history.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell, also in Washington, DC, did not hold back Thursday night as she declared Trump\u2019s firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board, an \u201cillegal act.\u201d\n\nTrump has tried to remove several officials at independent agencies.\n\n\u201cThe President seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme,\u201d Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote.\n\nAnd she insisted, in one of the more attention-getting lines of recent litigation, \u201cAn American President is not a king \u2014 not even an \u2018elected\u2019 one \u2014 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP\n\nA few weeks into Donald Trump\u2019s second term, a MAGA-supporting acquaintance asked me why the left seemed \u201cso unbelievably demoralized.\u201d He was not (merely) gloating; he was curious. \u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t last,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut for now it\u2019s just sort of a bewildering sensation to feel like you\u2019re doing politics with no opposition.\u201d There was a note of pity in his voice.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. The first signs of life from the dazed Democrats following the inauguration were not exactly encouraging: Joining a protest outside the Treasury on February 4, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer held hands with California representative Maxine Waters \u2014 an icon of the resistance to Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and chanted \u201cWe will win!\u201d several times before seeming to realize the implausibility of his boast. Interrupting himself, he leaned into the mic and rephrased: \u201cWe won\u2019t rest! We won\u2019t rest!\u201d\n\nShortly after, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waved the white flag. Smug, offended, and baffled all at once, he asked reporters, \u201cWhat leverage do we have? Republicans have repeatedly lectured America: They control the House, the Senate, and the presidency. It\u2019s their government.\u201d As if we hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\nRarely inspiring, party leaders are selected for their capacity to find consensus, manipulate parliamentary machinery, and fundraise. Ask anyone why Jeffries is minority leader: He brings home the bacon. Schumer once had a salty, outer-borough pique that did some work to counter Trump, but his mien today is weary and distracted. In the middle of a January presser charging the president with having \u201cplunged the country into chaos,\u201d Schumer turned his attention to his ringing cell phone, then told the crowd that his grandson had lost a tooth. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big occasion,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the lethargy has deeper roots. Chastened by Trump\u2019s victory, Democrats seem to lack the courage of their convictions, if they even know what those convictions are. Politically and literally geriatric, they keep doddering into rooms and forgetting why they were heading there in the first place. The fierce cultural politics that defined the party in Trump\u2019s first term are out of favor. Biden\u2019s pro-labor populism didn\u2019t work. The liberals are sidelined; the ascendant moderates offer warmed-over Clintonism and Cold War nostalgia. The base wants more spirited dissent, but cautious electeds fear being associated with disruption. (The various spectacles during Trump\u2019s speech to Congress \u2014 Al Green\u2019s sincerity notwithstanding \u2014 felt both anachronistic and vaguely embarrassing.) All that marching around is a flavor of \u201cwoke.\u201d And wokeness, they say, cost them the election.\n\nLike many political losers before him, Jeffries is indulging in the blithe comfort of not being responsible. If the Democrats are powerless to stop Trump, he reasons, they can\u2019t be blamed for the consequences. And maybe, when the real pain starts, the public will pine once again for the party of order, the adults in the room. On February 25, James Carville made this logic explicit in a New York Times op-ed: \u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead. Allow the Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us.\u201d Sounding very much like a divorced parent desperate to win back our affection from \u201cfun dad,\u201d Carville wrote, \u201cJust when they\u2019ve pushed themselves to the brink and it appears they could collapse the global economy, come in and save the day.\u201d\n\nIt is a particularly liberal delusion that a party should be rewarded for its powerlessness. If it were ever plausible, Trump has put that notion to rest. Power must be met with power. As political currency, responsibility and competence have lost their value. (Blame inflation.) Dad gave the kids too much candy, but the sugar high may never wear off.\n\nAt least two Democratic senators seem to understand this new reality: Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Both are contesting Trump\u2019s status as the sole protagonist in D.C. and articulating a more urgent vision for the opposition. Sanders landed the first blow against Carville\u2019s rope-a-dope scheme. \u201cThe problem is the Democrats have been playing dead for too many years,\u201d he said on Meet the Press, citing bleak markers of inequality and poverty. \u201cI don\u2019t think you play dead. I think you stand up for the working class of this country.\u201d\n\nSanders has taken this message \u2014 the same one he\u2019s been peddling for 50 years \u2014 on the road with his Fighting Oligarchy tour, holding rallies in swing districts with Republican incumbents in the hopes of pressuring them to vote against cuts to Medicaid and other services. The energy of these events, his staff said, significantly exceeds what they saw in the fall when Sanders was campaigning for Kamala Harris. As the senator told me via email, \u201cTrumpism will not be defeated inside the D.C. beltway.\u201d\n\nMurphy, in a phone call, was more generous toward leadership\u2019s perspective, describing its theory of power, in which it is reserved and opportunistically released, as \u201ctraditional.\u201d But ultimately, he said, the past ten years were a victory for a different model, one in which \u201cpower is a muscle, and if you use it every day, your message is not hurt by repetition and by constant volume. It is helped.\u201d If Democrats don\u2019t exercise that muscle, Trump is left to do what he does best: monopolize our every waking moment. What\u2019s more, Murphy suggested, Democrats imperil their credibility if they don\u2019t treat Trump\u2019s threats with alarm. \u201cYou lack sincerity if you said during the campaign that if voters elected him, he was going to destroy democracy, and then once he gets sworn in, you\u2019re not acting as if it\u2019s a moment of existential crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy\u2019s sense of crisis, like my own, has been cultivated by exposure to the ideas of the \u201cnew right.\u201d During the Biden years, he undertook a study of MAGA\u2019s more florid intellectual currents. The movement he saw \u201cwas tapped into the spiritual emotional crisis that the country was going through in a way the left wasn\u2019t and was planning for 2025,\u201d he said. It was \u201cdeeply radicalized\u201d and motivated by an overwhelming enmity. If Murphy was quicker than most Democrats to recognize the \u201cexistential\u201d danger of Trump 2.0, it\u2019s because he knew it would be this movement running the show. \u201cThey don\u2019t really think that democracy has much use any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy\u2019s actual message, however, is similar to Sanders\u2019s. Murphy may be concerned about what new-right intellectuals like Michael Anton or Darren Beattie are doing in the White House (both are State Department advisers), but most Americans don\u2019t care. \u201cRight now, we have to be laser focused on telling people the story of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kleptocratic billionaire takeover of our government that can only occur by the destruction of our democracy.\u201d\n\nDefending democracy, as such, didn\u2019t much profit Biden or Harris. Democracy can feel like an abstraction \u2014 or worse, when it fails to provide. But if Democrats don\u2019t take the threat seriously, they risk not only their credibility but the means to contest for power in the future. Their trouble is that they\u2019re undergoing an identity crisis \u2014 reimagining how to build an electoral majority \u2014 while needing to protect our constitutional order and vital services from psychopathic billionaire arsonists and con men. They\u2019re driving the ambulance and repainting it at the same time. It\u2019s not an easy task. But a populist message that names the enemies, and links them to the public\u2019s deprivation, is a good start.\n\nI sometimes think the reason Democrats are so despised is that everyone across the political spectrum, whether they know it or not, has high expectations for the party. (Some weird, unconscious hangover from New Deal hegemony, perhaps.) Republicans expect them to be good-faith opponents, moderates expect them to be pragmatic, liberals expect them to be ardent champions of rights, and the left and labor expect them to be sincere egalitarians. The Democrats are barely any of these things now. They could be again, but they\u2019ll have to learn: In American politics, you win or you lose. Righteous defeat gets you nowhere. There is no dignity dividend."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA top acting State Department official deleted at least half a dozen tweets that ridiculed his now boss, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, including ones calling him \u201clow IQ\u201d and repeating a false rumor about Rubio\u2019s sexuality.\n\nThe deleted tweets from Darren Beattie, the acting under secretary of state for public diplomacy, were uncovered as part of a CNN review of his social media and include a mixture of insults and harsh attacks against Rubio.\n\nBeattie, who was fired from his role as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration after CNN\u2019s KFile revealed he attended a conference featuring White nationalists, made a series of attacks over the years against other Republicans, including a number of offensive, homophobic and racist comments.\n\nThough Beattie left up several of his most inflammatory posts, he does appear to have purged criticism of Rubio from his feed. Beattie deleted tweets suggesting a deep hostility toward Rubio \u2014 particularly after the then-senator voted to certify the 2020 election results and condemned the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. One deleted tweet also attacked Rubio for criticizing possible Russian actions in Ukraine.\n\nAfter being ousted from the Trump White House in 2018, Beattie launched Revolver News, a far-right media outlet that has spread conspiracies regarding the January 6 attack. The website has boosted false claims that federal agencies orchestrated aspects of the attack and that extremist groups involved were under government control.\n\nIn a tweet that was removed for violating Twitter\u2019s terms of service, on the day Roe v. Wade was overturned, Revolver News posted about shooting women who get abortions.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: It\u2019s now legal to shoot women having abortions in New York City with your Supreme Court-issued concealed handgun,\u201d read the post.\n\nBeattie\u2019s appointment fueled outrage, with Democrats calling for his removal over his history of racist and misogynistic tweets and posts that denied the Uyghur genocide in China \u2014 most of which are still on his public X account.\n\nIn response to a series of questions from CNN, Beattie responded, \u201cSecretary Rubio is 100 percent America First and it\u2019s a tremendous honor to work for him in advancing President Trump\u2019s world historical agenda.\u201d\n\nRubio has declined to comment on Beattie\u2019s past offensive statements and said that Beattie\u2019s role would focus on perceived online censorship. He has also said Beattie will not be nominated for the full-time position, which requires Senate confirmation. Acting officials can serve for 300 days.\n\nBeattie\u2019s position ranks as one of the most important at the State Department, serving as the secretary of state\u2019s top adviser on public affairs and public diplomacy. Beattie also oversees the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which implements educational, professional and cultural exchanges to advance US interests, such as foreign exchange programs and Fulbright scholarships.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio arrives before President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nBeattie\u2019s position at the State Department highlights Rubio\u2019s unique role in the administration. Once a fierce Trump critic and a hawkish internationalist, Rubio now finds himself working with people who have openly ridiculed him.\n\nIn a now-deleted tweet on January 7, 2021, Beattie invoked far-right conspiracy theories about Rubio\u2019s past, referencing \u201cWainwright Park\u201d \u2014 a curfew violation from Rubio\u2019s teenage years that was later twisted into baseless speculation that Rubio is gay \u2014 and \u201cfoam,\u201d a reference to similarly unfounded claims about Rubio attending foam parties at gay nightclubs.\n\n\u201cForget Wainwright park, forget the foam, forget the war promotion and the neocon sugar daddies, forget the low IQ, forget the 2016 primary, Rubio is TOUGH ON CHINA (and good for military industrial complex) So be a good DOG and vote for him!!!\u201d Beattie wrote.\n\nA follow-up tweet about Rubio said, \u201cWhat happens in the Cabana stays in the Cabana #Rubio.\u201d\n\nBeattie followed up his tweet with one that mocked what he perceived as Rubio\u2019s attempt to rebrand himself as a nationalist, while sarcastically saying he supported tax credits for Black Lives Matter and criticizing his hawkish rhetoric on China.\n\n\u201cIf a bunch of DC wonks try to reinvent Marco Rubio as a nationalist, but a \u2018respectable\u2019 one who promises tax credits to BLM supporters and is \u201cTOUGH ON CHINA\u201d will you be a good dog and vote for him?\u201d the tweet said.\n\n\u201cDoes Marco Rubio have a future in politics?\u201d Beattie asked in another deleted tweet.\n\nBeattie deleted three other tweets from July 23, 2020, that called efforts to rebrand Rubio a nationalist a \u201cscam,\u201d \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cfake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea behind the Hawley/Rubio scam is this. They are smart enough to know the rebranded neoconservatism of Nikki Haley and Crenshaw has no legs. Also smart enough to know free-market libertarianism has no legs,\u201d Beattie wrote.\n\nIn a deleted March 7, 2022, tweet, Beattie cast doubt that then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons during the country\u2019s civil war in a tweet attacking Rubio\u2019s warning that any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks in Ukraine would be attributable to Russia.\n\n\u201cI bet Rubio still thinks Assad gassed his own people,\u201d Beattie wrote, responding to Rubio."

            "full_content": "Illustration: David Macaulay\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIn February 2024, dairy farmers in the northwest corner of the Texas Panhandle noticed that their herds were getting sick. A cow\u2019s temperature would spike, and she would stop eating. Soon, her milk would dry up or turn thick \u2014 tests would reveal the milk had twice the normal number of white blood cells. The feverish cows would barely drink any water. As they grew dehydrated, their eyes sank into their heads. Nearly all of them had mastitis: a swollen, painful udder and teats, which made milking difficult.\n\nThe disease seemed to be spreading; veterinarians in the region heard from colleagues in Kansas and New Mexico who reported the same constellation of symptoms. On March 14, a group of them got on a conference call with animal-health specialists from around the country, trading information on what they had begun calling \u201cmystery cow disease.\u201d \u201cWe made a master list of causes and just started checking it twice,\u201d said Barb Petersen, a veterinarian who cares for 40,000 cows on several dairies near Amarillo. Was it heavy metals in the feed? That could explain why so many herds had gotten sick so quickly. But no, the feed was okay. A bacterial infection? A coronavirus? Every test they ran came back negative. Whatever this was, it wasn\u2019t something any of them had seen in cows before.\n\nIn This Issue Five Years Older, None the Wiser See All\n\nAround the same time, some of the farmworkers Petersen saw on her rounds started to fall ill. Most had conjunctivitis, or pink eye, but some developed fevers bad enough to keep them home from work. \u201cWe felt like, Gosh, we don\u2019t think this is a coincidence,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nPetersen, 41, has the calm forthrightness you might expect in someone used to working with large animals. She spends most of her days on the road, traveling from dairy to dairy. During the early part of the outbreak, she was as busy as she\u2019s ever been: fielding calls from farmers, coordinating lab tests, and tending to sick cows. She came home each day exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m taking off all my farm clothes in the garage,\u201d she said. \u201cI have animals at home, so I\u2019m making sure I\u2019m not trying to bring something home to them.\u201d\n\nA breakthrough came from Kay Russo, a veterinarian who had studied both dairy cows and poultry. Russo told Petersen that she\u2019d been monitoring an outbreak of avian influenza that had spread from Europe to South America, where it had crossed over from birds into the sea-lion population, killing more than 20,000. Had Petersen noticed any dead birds at the dairies? She had. (\u201cA shit ton of dead birds,\u201d in Russo\u2019s words.) Petersen gathered a few and sent them to a lab. The results came back positive for influenza-A subtype H5N1. Bird flu. With that diagnosis in mind, one of Russo\u2019s colleagues tried to get some bovine samples tested for H5N1, but the lab refused. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t run it,\u201d Russo said, \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t on their list.\u201d No cow had ever been infected with H5N1 before.\n\nA few days later, Petersen got a call from one of the dairies. The cats on the farm had become seriously ill after drinking milk from the sick cows: Some had gone blind and lost control of their muscles, mucus streaming from their noses and eyes. Many of them died. When Petersen mentioned the cats to Drew Magstadt, her former classmate at Iowa State\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, he remembered that neurologic disease was a well-documented symptom of influenza A in cats. He offered to test for the virus if Petersen would send samples to his lab at Iowa State. \u201cThose cats were really the key to finding this out as quickly as we did,\u201d Magstadt said.\n\nAt Magstadt\u2019s request, Petersen gathered milk from eight infected cows into plastic tubes and collected the bodies of two dead cats, wrapping them in plastic bags. She shipped it all in a cooler to Magstadt\u2019s lab, more than 600 miles away in Ames. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything leaking,\u201d she said, \u201cso everything was triple bagged. I don\u2019t want anybody at FedEx or UPS getting a surprise.\u201d The samples arrived the morning of March 21, a Thursday, and by that night they had their results: The cats were positive for influenza A, as was the milk. The next day, Magstadt determined via PCR that it was H5N1, and there was a lot of it, especially in the milk. \u201cI was very, very surprised,\u201d he said, \u201cparticularly at the amount of virus.\u201d\n\nMagstadt sent Petersen\u2019s samples across town to a lab run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which formally confirmed the presence of H5N1, and the massive apparatus of the federal government began to whir into motion. Petersen was suddenly receiving calls from multiple federal agencies. \u201cNormally, I\u2019m not going to talk to people who are in Washington, D.C., on the weekend,\u201d she said. The response to the outbreak had transformed into a political problem.\n\nOn the following Monday, March 25, the USDA announced that highly pathogenic avian influenza had been found on farms in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. The agency urged farmers to report illnesses, revealed plans for widespread testing and new biosecurity measures, and soon put restrictions on interstate transfers of dairy cows. There was hope, in those days, that the outbreak could be contained.\n\nNow, a year later, the country is, in Russo\u2019s words, \u201ca pot of swirling virus with every species thrown in the middle.\u201d Multiple strains of H5N1 are burning uncontrolled through cattle herds and poultry flocks in almost every region. Farmers have been forced to euthanize millions of chickens, turkeys, and ducks. Pet food made from infected meat has been linked to the deaths of multiple house cats, and the list of species testing positive for bird flu grows longer every day: squirrels and raccoons, dolphins and deer mice, polar bears and rats, skunks and alpacas. In November and December, at an animal sanctuary in Washington, 20 big cats died of the virus, including four cougars, four bobcats, and a tiger.\n\nMost of the 70 human cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been mild. A bad case of pink eye, maybe a fever, then a full recovery. But in January, when authorities in Louisiana announced that a man had died after being exposed to sick and dead birds in his backyard flock, it seemed to signal an ominous turn. Of the 964 human cases of H5N1 reported to the World Health Organization since 2003, nearly 50 percent were fatal.\n\nThis was, and is, a crisis that seems to demand an overwhelming response. The longer we allow the virus to run rampant through animal populations, the greater our chances of disaster. Instead, we\u2019ve had a replay of the first year of the COVID pandemic, overseen this time, until recently, by a Democratic president: Early detection gave way to months of confusion and inaction. Good guidance was circumvented or ignored. Each state had its own rules about how to handle an outbreak or whether to test for one in the first place. We are now approaching a moment when our final line of defense for both people and animals may be an effective vaccine \u2014 just as the most anti-vaccine administration in history has taken power.\n\nOnce again, we are running an experiment to see whether half-measures will be enough to defeat a virus that has proved shockingly successful at spreading around the world. For now, H5N1 remains primarily a threat to birds and cows and the people who raise them. But if that changes, one thing is undeniable: We aren\u2019t prepared.\n\nThe drumbeat of frightening news coverage of the bird-flu outbreak over the past year has seemed to carry a contradiction. Each troubling development \u2014 each new animal death, each perplexing human case, such as a child in British Columbia who developed severe disease \u2014 has been reported alongside the same refrain: The CDC says that H5N1 poses a low risk to the public. How could the virus be everywhere but still, somehow, in the CDC\u2019s estimation, not likely to cause a pandemic?\n\nH5N1 is already a panzootic. It spreads easily among birds via their digestive tracts; everywhere an infected bird poops, a new host can be born. Although highly pathogenic H5N1 has been around since at least 1996, sometime in 2020 a newer, more transmissible version emerged in Europe or Central Asia. This strain, known by the unwieldy name H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, infected species H5N1 had never touched before, causing mass die-offs of seabirds and spreading rapidly beyond the virus\u2019s original geographic range.\n\n\u201cIt became quite clear early on that this was a completely different beast and that this was going to be potentially long term and not controllable,\u201d said Martha Nelson, a computational biologist and the co-author of a recent paper about H5N1 in Nature. There were frequent crossovers into mammals but limited onward transmission until the first cows were infected \u2014 most likely when migrating birds left behind droppings on a dairy that got onto a cow\u2019s udder. After that, spread was all but inevitable: Each cow stepping into the milking parlor could deposit virus on the automatic milker for the one that followed.\n\nAs transmissible as this virus was, it still didn\u2019t have an easy way to infect humans. Smallpox, the 1918 flu virus, and SARS-CoV-2 could all bind to cells in our mouths, noses, and throats, which enabled rapid person-to-person transmission: Every breath, cough, and sneeze sent millions of virions into the air to be picked up by a neighbor. H5N1 can easily infect our eyes and the deep recesses of our lungs but, crucially, not our upper airways. Until that changes, the H5N1 pandemic will be held at bay.\n\nThe fact that the virus can infect a cow\u2019s teat but not our nasal passages is a quirk of biology. Every virion has proteins on its surface \u2014 hemagglutinin, the H in H5N1 \u2014 that it uses to gain entry to a host\u2019s cell. The hemagglutinin in H5N1 is excellent at binding to a particular cell-surface receptor that\u2019s common in the digestive tract in birds, a cow\u2019s mammary glands, and human eyes. We are lucky it\u2019s not more widely distributed in our bodies. Cats, for example, have these receptors in places we don\u2019t, which may explain why they have gotten sick from drinking raw milk from infected cows but humans haven\u2019t. (Pasteurized milk is fine.)\n\nHaving won the influenza lottery with the placement of these receptors, we now seem determined to allow the virus to accumulate enough mutations to infect our upper airways after all. The virus has already made some progress in this direction. The strain found in Nevada\u2019s dairy cows is better able to replicate in infected cells than the one that arrived from Europe. But for human-to-human transmission to take off, the hemagglutinin protein itself will have to change. First, it will have to switch its preferential binding from the kind of receptors in our eyes to their cousins in our upper airways. And then it will need to remain stable in low-pH environments; right now the protein degrades in our respiratory system because it\u2019s too acidic.\n\nTo evolve, influenza is able to use a shortcut called reassortment, the same process that created H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in the first place. Rather than changing its genome nucleotide by nucleotide, it can swap whole segments of RNA with another virus. H5N1 could, for example, exchange its hemagglutinin for a version that binds easily to receptors in our noses by swapping an RNA segment with one of the two strains of flu already circulating in humans. But by its nature \u2014 borrowing material from viruses familiar to human immune systems \u2014 reassortment creates hybrids that our bodies are at least somewhat primed to fend off. A pandemic prefers na\u00efve hosts, and reassortment robs it of that.\n\nThere is another path for mutations that is slower but could be more consequential. As the virus replicates within a host (a bird, a cow, a human), it\u2019s constantly generating new versions of itself with slight tweaks to its genome \u2014 each, in the words of the German geneticist Richard Goldschmidt, a \u201chopeful monster,\u201d an opportunistic mutant that voyages out in search of friendly tissue to infect. \u201cThe mutations are constantly occurring in cases of conjunctivitis,\u201d said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist who worked with Nelson on the paper in Nature. \u201cBut those mutants are in a desert, relatively speaking.\u201d There\u2019s no easy way for them to find new parts of the body to infect.\n\nThe virus won\u2019t replicate into a desert indefinitely. In Worobey and Nelson\u2019s paper, they write, somewhat cryptically, \u201cThe continued absence of H5N1 in U.S. swine is highly fortunate.\u201d I asked Worobey to explain what that meant. Pigs, he said, \u201chave both receptor types throughout their respiratory tract and therefore could conceivably be a much, much better place for the evolution of something that could become successful.\u201d\n\nAnother place such mutations could take hold is in humans themselves. The H5N1-friendly receptors in our lungs are normally safe from infection unless someone deeply inhales large amounts of virus. (The few severe cases of H5N1 in the past year and the multiple deaths in the first outbreak among humans, in Hong Kong in 1997, may have been the result of people doing just that.) If a hopeful monster with the right kind of hemagglutinin was able to travel up the lungs and infect the upper airways \u2014 well, that\u2019s the pandemic-ready virus we\u2019re all worried about. The mutations may make it less deadly or more; we probably won\u2019t know unless and until it happens.\n\n\u201cWith this new reality we live in where cattle are infected and therefore dairy farmworkers are constantly being exposed,\u201d Worobey said, \u201cyou have a situation with an H5 virus that is taking many more shots on goal to get into humans and get past whatever that last barrier is.\u201d At this point, the most reassuring thing you can say is that the virus has been around for 30 years and hasn\u2019t found a way to transmit effectively in humans yet. But Nelson warned against complacency: \u201cMy history of studying flu is that whenever you say influenza can\u2019t do something, it does.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, Worobey said he rejects the idea that H5N1 can be called low risk. \u201cIt seems a bit of a thumb on the scale to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the proper thing to appreciate is that we don\u2019t really know the risk.\u201d In the meantime, we\u2019ve created a giant reservoir of novel virus in our dairy cows, 9 million little Wuhan wet markets (or, if you prefer, Wuhan Institutes of Virology) spread around the country, just waiting for the right occasion to spill over into the human population.\n\nThe Way Bird Flu Works How H5N1 Gets From a Wild Bird to a Farmerworker\u2019s Eye\n\nA goose flies over a dairy and leaves behind droppings. Cows gather in a field, exposing their undersides to waste and mud. H5N1 virus from the bird droppings infect a cow\u2019s teats and udder. An infected cow steps into the milking parlor. The virus spreads from cow to cow via the milking machines. A worker rubs contaminated milk in his eye, completing the chain of infection. Illustrations by David Macaulay\n\nWhen H5N1 began spreading in American cows, experts who have studied avian influenza all their lives looked on, horrified, as the country failed to get the outbreak under control. Worobey told me he talked to a veterinarian about transmission routes; he was accustomed to learning as much as he could about the animals that serve as the flu\u2019s vectors. (Once, researching the origins of the 1918 pandemic, he investigated the Great Epizootic of 1872, which disabled millions of horses in North America; some blame the Great Boston Fire from that year on the lack of horses available to pull firefighting equipment.) \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a dairy farm,\u201d he explained to me, \u201ceveryone carries a rag in their back pocket. You have to every few minutes wipe off piss, shit, milk, who knows. Getting into the eyes that way is easy and then the receptors there are ready and waiting.\u201d\n\nThe official policy of the USDA is still elimination of H5N1, but making an environment like that biosecure is a formidable challenge: The central commodity of a dairy is teeming with virus \u2014 never mind the vulnerability of an open-sided barn or an unprotected field. In California, dairy farmers are required to report any positive tests, and infected herds are placed under quarantine for at least 60 days, at which point they have to test negative three weeks in a row. \u201cI have quarantine authority,\u201d Annette Jones, the state veterinarian, told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m actually required by law to act. I can\u2019t choose not to act.\u201d The state has also required dairies to put strict limits on visitors and to institute various measures to control the spread of the virus from farm to farm, like disinfecting vehicles, clothes, and boots.\n\nIn Texas, the origin of the outbreak, many of these precautions are voluntary. Sid Miller, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, took quick action after learning about the first cases. \u201cWe alerted everybody and quit transporting cattle out of state from that area,\u201d he told me, \u201cand we started changing some of our practices and put in better biohazard policies.\u201d But he rejected the suggestion that the state should make some measures, like wearing goggles and disinfecting the milkers, mandatory for the dairies as well: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s in their best interest. They\u2019re going to do it anyway. They don\u2019t need a rule.\u201d\n\nThe USDA has a national program for testing milk, but not every state is enrolled, and it didn\u2019t begin until ten months into the outbreak. \u201cProbably close to half of the known cases are in California,\u201d William Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not because California is bad. That\u2019s because California is looking.\u201d The result is an information ecosystem that\u2019s familiar from the COVID pandemic, with the states reprising the roles they played in 2020.\n\nThe mildness of the disease in cows skews the incentives for individual farmers to take action. Most cows recover from the illness, albeit sometimes with diminished milk production. (Many of the early deaths in California, where \u201cdown cows\u201d and stillbirths were relatively common, have been ascribed to high heat in the Central Valley just as the outbreak began.) \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a threat,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like they had a cold for a week or the flu for a week, basically. It\u2019s a devastating disease in poultry, but it\u2019s a minor setback in the dairy business.\u201d\n\nThe dairy industry, meanwhile, is broadly suspicious of government efforts to intervene. This is especially true of the CDC\u2019s attempts to test and trace infected workers. The many thousands of undocumented immigrants working on farms, Hanage said, \u201care not going to be excited when the federal government is sending someone there to collect samples.\u201d Trust in public-health officials in rural areas, already low, has eroded even more since 2020. Mark McAfee, the founder of Raw Farm outside Fresno, said the official number of infected farmworkers to date is probably an undercount: \u201cI imagine a lot of farmers just don\u2019t want to hassle with the paperwork and have the CDC go test them. It becomes a hassle factor. Most farmers don\u2019t like hassle.\u201d He pointed out that during COVID, the states doing a lot of testing and the states doing very little fared about the same. (This was basically true, at least until vaccines were widely available.)\n\nThe USDA provides emergency assistance for farmers with cows in quarantine, but some may prefer not to test in the first place. Beef and dairy exports are worth $19 billion a year, poultry exports another $5 billion. A positive test could jeopardize a farmer\u2019s ability to ship products abroad. It\u2019s notable that after a year of H5N1 spreading among cows, no beef herds have officially tested positive. But Russo told me that\u2019s not the full story. \u201cThere is testing to show that there is seroconversion in these cattle, which would suggest they are getting infected with the virus,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not been publicly released or seen the light of day. And I don\u2019t know if it will.\u201d\n\nThe USDA is asked to wear two hats, Petersen said: \u201cThey\u2019re tasked with protecting animal health, but they\u2019re also tasked with protecting the industry \u2014 and protecting the industry means defending trade.\u201d According to the USDA, those two missions are not in conflict. \u201cUSDA\u2019s priority is to protect American farmers and ranchers and their animals,\u201d a spokesperson said, \u201cwhich closely aligns with its mission to protect safe trade.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether to vaccinate cows and poultry is even more fraught. H5N1 vaccines for cows are still in development, but the push to inoculate them will probably remain weak unless herds start developing more severe symptoms. (There were early reports of \u201clong bird flu\u201d in cows but no definitive evidence that it\u2019s a widespread problem.)\n\nVaccines for poultry are already available, but trade complicates that decision as well. In 2023, France decided to start vaccinating its ducks \u2014 an effort, in part, to protect the national supply of foie gras. Within days, the U.S. banned all poultry imports from the country, and the embargo lasted for more than a year. The stated reason was to keep avian influenza out; vaccinated ducks, the reasoning went, could be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. If the U.S. began vaccinating its poultry, it could expect similar bans from other countries. Brooke Rollins, the secretary of the USDA, recently announced the department would devote $1 billion to fighting avian influenza, including up to $100 million for vaccine research, but declined to authorize the use of existing H5N1 vaccines for poultry. Until our trade agreements are renegotiated, that authorization likely won\u2019t arrive.\n\nThe poultry and dairy industries seem to be on a collision course. Once a herd recovers, it has some immunity against future infections. The same isn\u2019t true for chickens, ducks, and turkeys. The virus can kill nearly all of those infected, but it rarely has a chance to get that far. As soon as the disease is detected, farmers are usually required to destroy the entire flock \u2014 commercial operations lost more than 50 million birds last year. And with no vaccine and no acquired immunity, the next generation of hatchlings will be just as susceptible to the virus as the birds they replaced.\n\nDairies and chicken farms are often neighbors, and they can share personnel, a steady source of potential new infections. With the amount of virus circulating, even stringent biosecurity \u2014 workers in protective suits, barns sealed off, active disease surveillance \u2014 hasn\u2019t always been enough. Egg producers have been the hardest hit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do something for these poultry operations so that we can have eggs in this country, to put it bluntly,\u201d Russo said. \u201cPolitics and trade and economics have been put before the health of animals, of humans, of science. And now we\u2019ve got a real fucking mess on our hands.\u201d\n\nIf H5N1 were to adapt to transmit readily among humans, our welfare would be, ultimately, in the hands of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy is skeptical of the epidemiological tools used to control viruses: testing, distancing, masking, and, especially, vaccines. His stance on the childhood vaccination schedule and the COVID vaccines developed under Operation Warp Speed \u2014 which he called \u201cthe deadliest vaccine ever made\u201d \u2014 is well known.\n\nHe speaks less often about flu inoculations, which are administered annually to around 150 million Americans. But during a podcast in 2021, he revealed that he blamed the flu shot for the problems he\u2019s had with his voice. \u201cIn 1996, when I was 42 years old, I got this disease called spasmodic dysphonia,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a very, very strong voice prior to 1996. Unusually strong.\u201d He didn\u2019t connect his disease with the vaccine until he found his condition on a list of possible side effects. The shot, he said, was \u201cdefinitely a potential cause of what I\u2019ve got, and I haven\u2019t been able to figure out any other cause.\u201d\n\nSince Kennedy took over at HHS, the CDC has ended an ad campaign urging Americans to get the flu shot (its doomed slogan was \u201cWild to Mild\u201d) and postponed the February meeting of the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory group. At the end of February, members of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee learned that their March meeting, during which they were meant to determine the strains to be targeted by next year\u2019s flu shot, had been canceled as well.\n\n\u201cI think that the administration, and most specifically Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is not interested in external expertise,\u201d said Paul Offit, an infectious-diseases specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who has been a member of the FDA committee since 2017. \u201cThe man does not believe in the germ theory of infectious diseases.\u201d Offit laughed despondently. \u201cI dunno. I would have thought that was a minimum criteria for being the head of HHS, but what do I know?\u201d (Kennedy did not reply to requests for comment.)\n\nThe Way Bird Flu Works The Evolution of a Pandemic-Ready Virus 1. Someone inhales H5N1 deep into his lungs. At this point, the virus can\u2019t infect the upper airways. 2. The virus attaches to receptors in the lungs and begins replicating. 3. As the virus divides, it occasionally creates mutant versions of itself. Most of these go nowhere. 4. One mutant has the ability to infect cells in the upper airways. It multiplies quickly. 5. The mutated virus, now easily transmissible, is coughed out, ready to infect the next person.\n\nThe federal government has spent years preparing for an avian-influenza pandemic. Dawn O\u2019Connell, the former head of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, who left her job at the end of the Biden administration, told me that even before the virus began spreading in cows, ASPR and the CDC had been working with vaccine manufacturers to create a library of possible H5N1 vaccines that could be directed to different variants. \u201cBecause we had some of that library in place already,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to find a fairly well-matched vaccine\u201d \u2014 one targeted to the strains in circulation \u2014 \u201cthat we\u2019ve increased manufacturing for.\u201d The Biden administration also invested $766 million in the development of mRNA vaccines for pandemic flu. \u201cIf the strain changes,\u201d O\u2019Connell said, \u201cwe would want to stay ahead of what\u2019s currently circulating, and mRNA lets you do that a little easier.\u201d\n\nWhen O\u2019Connell and I spoke in early January, there were 8 million doses of the H5N1 vaccine in the federal government\u2019s stockpiles, with plans to add 2 million more by March. Several public-health experts I spoke to were frustrated that the Biden administration never released those doses to vaccinate farmworkers. Now it\u2019s unclear if the federal government will ever release them. Last summer, Kennedy said that \u201cthere is no evidence these vaccines will work, and they appear to be dangerous.\u201d\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, when Alex Azar had Kennedy\u2019s job, he said, \u201cThe secretary of HHS has a shocking amount of power by the stroke of a pen.\u201d We may be about to find out how true that statement is. Offit thinks it\u2019s likely that Kennedy will either eliminate committees like his \u2014 cutting off one path for dissent \u2014 or fill them with like-minded people. He could hold up the approval of new vaccines and refer existing ones for additional study. There may be few checks on his ability to do so. \u201cIn a normal world, you would have people at the FDA and CDC who would say, \u2018No, sorry, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019\u201d Offit said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t live in that world. We live in a world full of sycophants who are just there to rubber stamp whatever it is they\u2019re told to do.\u201d It turns out that not interfering with the vaccine-approval process is another one of those norms that, like not renaming the Gulf of Mexico, we have scant ability to enforce.\n\nWe can predict the cascade of effects if the FDA withheld approval from an H5N1 vaccine. Without an FDA license, insurance companies won\u2019t cover it. Without the market promised by insurance coverage, drug companies won\u2019t manufacture the doses. It\u2019s not a system that works without the support of the federal government.\n\nIn recent weeks, more than 5,000 employees at HHS have been laid off by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE also fired 400 employees of the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which has been running the response to the H5N1 outbreak, including 55 associated with the lab in Ames that helped diagnose the first cases of H5N1 in the Texas Panhandle. Some of these employees were rehired, and the USDA wrote in a statement that \u201cseveral job categories, including veterinarians, animal health technicians, and other emergency response personnel\u201d at APHIS \u201chave been exempted from the recent personnel actions.\u201d But the turmoil in the executive branch continues. When I first wrote to Martha Nelson, the co-author of the paper in Nature about H5N1, she said she wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with me because, as a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health, she was subject to a blanket HHS communications pause.\n\nO\u2019Connell reminded me that, at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, federal officials had planned to use the strategic national stockpile, which is maintained by ASPR, to provide N95 masks to frontline workers. But the stockpile, they discovered, was empty. \u201cThey had not purchased PPE since H1N1,\u201d she said, \u201cten years before.\u201d Whatever missteps the Biden administration made regarding bird flu before its departure, we are undoubtedly on a better logistical footing than in 2020. As of January, the government had distributed 2.3 million pieces of PPE to farmworkers across the country, and it had accumulated 68 million doses of the antiviral medication Tamiflu.\n\nIf there ends up being scarcity this time around, it will have been by choice, a decision made by a weary public and the leaders they elected. Many Americans need time to rebuild their willingness to support pandemic-mitigating measures like lockdowns and masking. Some people need time to rebuild their trust in vaccines. \u201cWe may not even be able to have a serious conversation about it for a few years,\u201d Hanage, the Harvard epidemiologist, said. \u201cBut viruses don\u2019t look at our Google calendars to decide what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nKennedy got his job in part because a significant portion of the country thought that the government overstepped its authority during COVID, and that agencies like the FDA rushed the approval of vaccines for political reasons. Now that he is in charge of the public-health infrastructure of the U.S., we may get to see what the opposite approach would look like. Rather than a vaccine mandate, there may be a trade in gray-market vaccines acquired from abroad. Mitigation measures may be actively discouraged or penalized. As before, the rich may be able to protect themselves, but the poor will not. Kennedy and his critics rarely see eye to eye, but both sides would likely agree that, under his watch, we\u2019re not going to see another Operation Warp Speed.\n\nIn February, one year after the initial outbreak, I went to visit a dairy to see how biosecurity had changed since H5N1 became a bovine disease. A second spillover from wild birds had recently hit cattle in Nevada. The general public, at least those of us prone to worrying, had begun keeping track of esoteric variant names again. This one was D1.1, a different genotype from the B3.13 variant already circulating widely. Nothing changed except the hope we\u2019d have to eliminate H5N1 from the cow population only once.\n\nI tried to find a suitable farm in California but was advised by Michael Payne, a researcher at UC Davis\u2019s School of Veterinary Medicine, that all dairies he was aware of were now closed to nonessential visitors. In Pennsylvania, I found a farm with chickens and dairy cows offering tours, but a few days before the trip I got a call. All tours had been suspended until May. A few days later, the farm euthanized 2 million hens.\n\nThere were more options in Texas. After confirming a visit with one dairy, I asked Miller, the agriculture commissioner, what I should do to ensure I wasn\u2019t helping spread the disease. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going from farm to farm,\u201d he said, \u201cdisinfect your boots and your hands. Just use cowboy logic, basically.\u201d I had neglected to get a flu shot this year, so I made an appointment at my local pharmacy. I wasn\u2019t interested in being the Petri dish for any reassortment events.\n\nThe dairy was small by Texas standards. In a paddock near the entrance, a dozen or so calves, almost seven months old according to their ear tags, crowded near the steel fence as I approached. They were heartbreakingly cute. A few chickens walked around. A trio of ducks sat by a waste-covered pool. In the distance, the dry herd (cows given a break from lactation in the final months of their pregnancies) gathered under a tree. On other farms, it was 2020, but here it was still 2019.\n\nIn the milking parlor, one of the employees, a cheerful woman who had worked there for four years, demonstrated how the machines worked. The cows were led in through one door, workers attached four teat cups, and the milk was piped to a bulk tank before the cows were ushered out a second door. The room was about as clean as a cow conveyor belt could be. I asked whether they had made any changes to the operation over the past year, and the employee said they hadn\u2019t. She told me the farm didn\u2019t get that many wild birds passing through.\n\nEarlier, a calf had licked my arms while I petted it, and I\u2019d reminded myself the virus was concentrated in the cow\u2019s mammary glands, not its mouth. Now the employee asked me if I wanted to try milking by hand. I declined, but another visitor stepped forward and followed instructions for coaxing the fluid down the udder and into the teat. A stream of milk hit the ground and splashed up into the air.\n\nAfter spending weeks talking to veterinarians and infectious-disease experts about mastitis and quarantines and depopulation orders, it was jarring, and kind of wonderful, to be on a farm where the animals seemed healthy and the farmworkers happy. I did worry about their chickens and ducks. In an email, Martha Nelson drew a distinction between small farms like this one and the ones run by large conglomerates. \u201cOn a small farm, if you had an influenza virus spillover from birds to cows, it might have caused a small outbreak and then probably died out,\u201d she wrote. Big operations were different, shipping animals, and potentially virus, all over the country.\n\nLarge farms with animals packed tightly together are excellent sites for rapid disease spread. That\u2019s the story of the country\u2019s egg producers. And one of the earliest examples of mammal-to-mammal transmission during the 2.3.4.4b outbreak in Europe occurred on a farm where nearly 52,000 minks were being raised for their fur. \u201cIntensive farming is more likely to promote viral amplification,\u201d Nelson and her co-authors wrote in Nature. This disease, like COVID before it, has a knack for exposing the flaws in our society: the brutality of factory farming, the vulnerability of undocumented workers, our mistrust of science and of one another.\n\nAfter Barb Petersen helped solve the mystery of the outbreak in the panhandle, she spoke to the Associated Press and Bovine Veterinarian about what had happened. \u201cMy goal is that, hey, folks need to understand what\u2019s happening. And the only way to do that is to tell your story,\u201d she said. When the articles appeared, several clients cut ties with her. She said some of her colleagues lost business for taking farmworkers to get tested. \u201cPeople are going through stages of grief,\u201d she told me, \u201cand some reactions that I got were anger and denial. Some of them were more severe than others.\u201d\n\nThe future of this outbreak is still unknown. Rollins, the head of the USDA, has proved that she\u2019s taking the problem seriously. And Trump recently named Gerald Parker, a veterinarian with experience bringing together public-health and agriculture interests, to run the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, a remarkably sane choice. The country\u2019s animals will likely have access to a vaccine before its people do.\n\n\u201cWhen people ask me what worries me most,\u201d said Hanage, \u201cit\u2019s very bluntly the fact that we don\u2019t talk about what we will do when we actually see something really serious.\u201d We may get lucky and H5N1 may never mutate to become pandemic-ready. But there are countless other viruses waiting to cross over, chasing us like Philip Larkin\u2019s ship of death in \u201cNext, Please\u201d: \u201ca black-sailed unfamiliar, towing at her back a huge and birdless silence.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no comfort in where we are. Our government has spent the past year allowing H5N1 to spread throughout the country and the past two months dismantling some of the best defenses we have against pathogens of all sorts. We\u2019re beleaguered and suspicious and seemingly incapable of collective action for the common good. The only thing keeping us safe, for now, is the virus itself."

They are now trying again to navigate a new, uncertain Syria since the fall of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad.\n\nMembers of the small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: the new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Syria\u2019s hostile neighbor, Israel, which has used the plight of the Druze as a pretext to intervene in the country.\n\nSyria\u2019s many religious and ethnic communities are worried over their place in the new system. The transitional government has promised to include them, but has so far kept authority in the hands of the Islamist former insurgents who toppled Assad in December -- Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. That and HTS\u2019s past affiliation with Sunni Muslim extremist al-Qaida, has minorities suspicious.\n\nThe most explosive hostilities have been with the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad\u2019s family belongs. Heavy clashes erupted this week between armed Assad loyalists and government forces, killing at least 70, in the coastal regions that are the Alawites\u2019 heartland.\n\nIn contrast, the Druze -- largely centered in southern Syria -- have kept up quiet contacts with the government. Still, tensions have broken out.\n\nLast week in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus with a large Druze population, unknown gunmen killed a member of the government\u2019s security forces, which responded with a wave of arrests in the district.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military officials weighed in by threatening to send forces to Jaramana to protect the Druze. Druze leaders quickly disavowed the offer. But soon after, someone hung an Israeli flag in Sweida, an overwhelmingly Druze region in southern Syria, prompting residents to quickly tear it down and burn it.\n\nMany fear another flare-up is only a matter of time.\n\nMultiple Druze armed militias have existed for years, originally set up to protect their communities against Islamic State group fighters and drug smugglers coming in from the eastern desert. They have been reluctant to set down their arms. Recently a new faction, the Sweida Military Council, proclaimed itself, grouping several smaller Druze militias.\n\nThe result is a cycle of mistrust, where government supporters paint Druze factions as potential separatists or tools of Israel, while government hostility only deepens Druze worries.\n\nOn the outskirts of Sweida, a commander in Liwa al-Jabal, a Druze militia, stood on a rooftop and scanned the hills with binoculars. He spoke by walkie-talkie with a militiaman with an assault rifle below. They were watching for any movement by militants or gangs.\n\n\u201cOur arms are not for expansionist purposes. They're for self-defense and protection,\u201d said the commander, who asked to be identified only by his nickname Abu Ali for security reasons. \u201cWe have no enemies except those who attack us.\u201d\n\nAbu Ali, who is a metal worker as his day job, said most Druze militiamen would merge with a new Syrian army if it\u2019s one that \u201cprotects all Syrians rather than crushes them like the previous regime.\u201d\n\nThe Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.\n\nIn Syria, the Druze take pride in their fierce independence. They were heavily involved in revolts against Ottoman and French colonial rule to establish the modern Syrian state.\n\nDuring Syria\u2019s civil war that began in 2011, the Druze were split between supporters of Assad and the opposition. The Sweida region stayed quiet for much of the war, though it erupted with anti-government protests in 2023.\n\nAssad reluctantly gave Druze a degree of autonomy, as they wanted to avoid being involved on the frontlines. The Druze were exempted from conscription into the Syrian army and instead set up local armed factions made of workers and farmers to patrol their areas.\n\nDruze say they want Syria\u2019s new authorities to include them in a political process to create a secular and democratic state.\n\n\u201cReligion is for God and the state is for all\u201d proclaimed a slogan written on the hood of a vehicle belonging to the Men of Dignity, another Druze militia patrolling the outskirts of Sweida.\n\nMany Druze quickly rejected Israel\u2019s claims to protect the minority. Hundreds took to the streets in Sweida to protest Netanyahu\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cWe are Arabs, whether he or whether the Lord that created him likes it or not. Syria is free,\u201d said Nabih al-Halabi, a 60-year-old resident of Jaramana.\n\nHe and others reject accusations that the Druze want partition from Syria.\n\nBut patience is wearing thin over what many see as arbitrary layoffs of public sector workers, shortage of economic opportunities, and the new authorities\u2019 lack of more than token inclusion of Syrians from minority communities. For the first time, a protest took place in Sweida on Thursday against Damascus' new authorities.\n\nInterim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive system, but the government is made up mostly of his confidantes. The authorities convened a national dialogue conference last week, inviting Syrians from different communities, but many criticized it as rushed and not really inclusive.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing from the state today, in our opinion, does not achieve the interests of all Syrians,\u201d said retired nurse Nasser Abou-Halam, discussing local politics with other residents in Sweida's public square where near-daily protests took place. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-color government, with leadership appointed through factions rather than through elections.\u201d\n\nAl-Sharaa \u201chas a big opportunity to be accepted just to be Syrian first and not Islamist first. Being inclusive will not hurt him,\u201d said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat currently based in Washington. \u201cOn the contrary, it will give him more power.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s new leaders have struggled to convince the United States and its allies to lift Assad-era sanctions. Without the lifting of sanctions, it will be impossible for the government to rebuild Syria\u2019s battered infrastructure or win over minority communities, analysts say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared sanctions won\u2019t be lifted and Syria won\u2019t be given the chance,\u201d said Rayyan Maarouf, who heads the activist media collective Suwayda 24. He has just returned to Sweida after fleeing to Europe over a year ago because of his activism.\n\n\u201cSyria could go back to a civil war, and it would be worse than before,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside Sweida, Abu Ali was helping train new volunteers for the militia. Still, he said he hopes to be able to lay down his weapons.\n\n\u201cThere is no difference between the son of Sweida or Jaramana and those of Homs and Lattakia,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are tired of war and bloodshed \u2026 weapons don\u2019t bring modernism.\u201d\n\n___\n\nChehayeb reported from Beirut."

While he has never run for elected office before, rumors have swirled for years about if \u2014 and when \u2014 he might foray into politics.\n\nSpeaking Monday to reporters, he added that the transition between Trudeau\u2019s premiership and his would be \u201cseamless\u201d and \u201cquick,\u201d but did not give an exact date for when he will take office.\n\nThe Liberals have been courting Carney for more than a decade, and he advised Trudeau on Canada\u2019s economic recovery from Covid-19. But the banker-turned-politician did not make his official entrance until Trudeau announced his resignation in January. All of his competitors were sitting politicians: Carney is in the unusual situation of becoming Canada\u2019s prime minister without holding a seat in parliament.\n\nBut before all that, he was born in Fort Smith, the Northwest Territories, and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. His parents were both teachers, and, true to his Canadian roots, he played ice hockey as a goalie growing up, according to his campaign website.\n\nGrowing up, Mark Carney played hockey as a goalie for Laurier Heights, according to his campaign website. Mark Carney campaign website\n\nHe then headed to the United States for a degree in economics at Harvard University, before pursuing a master\u2019s degree and doctorate in economics from Oxford University.\n\nHis career was similarly globe-trotting. He spent 13 years working for Goldman Sachs, traveling between the firm\u2019s offices in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, according to a profile from the Bank of Canada, which he joined in 2003.\n\nBy 2008, he was serving as governor of Canada\u2019s central bank, stepping into the job as the world plunged into the Great Recession. During his campaign to lead the Liberal Party, Carney pointed to this time as evidence of his experience navigating crises, saying on his website he had helped protect jobs and stabilize the Canadian economy.\n\nHe did well enough that by the time he finished his five-year term, he was scooped up by the Bank of England to be its governor \u2014 the first non-British person to hold the position. (Canada is a member of the British Commonwealth.)\n\nClimate change advocate\n\nThe following years were just as crisis-ridden, with the British public voting to depart the European Union. In speeches before the 2016 referendum, Carney had warned of the economic impact Brexit would have on the country. He left the Bank of England in 2020 after almost seven years in the job.\n\nAfter becoming the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance in 2019, he advocated for the financial sector to invest in net-zero emissions.\n\n\u201cWhen I became governor of the Bank of England, which oversees the insurance industry, I saw that the number of extreme weather events had tripled and the cost of those events had gone up five times in a quarter century,\u201d he said in an interview on the UN website. \u201cThese things really concentrated my mind on climate.\u201d\n\nMark Carney makes a \"W\" gesture to signify his win in the race to become leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party. Blair Gable/Reuters\n\nSince then, he has made clean energy, climate policies and economic prosperity for Canada some of the central facets of his campaign, stressing that being low-carbon will help Canada be more competitive.\n\nHe has proposed shifting the financial burden of the carbon tax from consumers to big corporations and has said that under his leadership, the tax Canadian consumers and small businesses pay on fuel would be replaced with incentives to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nSome experts believe Carney\u2019s background could make him uniquely suited for the job as Canada grapples with a souring relationship with the US and an escalating trade war.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very competent in economics, so with these tariffs, this economic war, a lot of people are supporting him,\u201d said Charles-Etienne Beaudy, political science professor at the University of Ottawa and author of \u201cRadio Trump: How he won the first time.\u201d\n\nSince the 25% US tariffs on Canada were announced last month, Carney has been an outspoken proponent of dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs.\n\nHe addressed the issue on Sunday in his first remarks after the vote, slamming the Trump administration\u2019s plans. Trump is \u201cattacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed and we won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIn trade as in hockey, Canada will win.\u201d"

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO -- Canada\u2019s next prime minister has helped run two Group of Seven economies in crisis before and now will try to steer Canada through a looming trade war brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, a threat of annexation and an expected federal election.\n\nFormer central banker Mark Carney will become prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday in a landside vote with 85.9% support.\n\nCarney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney is widely expected to trigger an election the coming days or weeks amid Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff threats.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\u201d\n\nCarney said Canada will keep its initial retaliatory tariffs in place until \u201cthe Americans show us respect.\u201d\n\nCarney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. He helped managed the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.\n\nThe surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving in opinion polls.\n\n\u201cThe Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. Think about it. If they succeed they would destroy our way of life,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIn America health care is big business. In Canada it is a right.\u201d\n\nCarney said America is \u201ca melting pot. Canada is mosaic,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is not Canada. And Canada will never, ever will be a part of America in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nAfter decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.\n\n\u201cThese are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\u201d\n\nTrump has postponed 25% tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico for a month, amid widespread fears of a broader trade war. But he has threatened other tariffs on steel, aluminum, dairy and other products.\n\nCarney picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.\n\nTrudeau previously offered to make him finance minister. Carney has said former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper also offered to make him finance minister.\n\nCarney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.\n\nIn 2020, he began serving as the United Nations\u2019 special envoy for climate action and finance.\n\nThe other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who received just 8% of the vote. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.\n\nEither Carney will call an election in the coming days or weeks, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\n\nTrudeau urged Liberals supporters to get involved.\n\n\u201cThis is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,\u201d Trudeau said."

            "full_content": "The Europeans got the message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican presidents since Kennedy have wanted Europe to shoulder more of the burden of its own security. But not until President Donald Trump has a U.S. leader succeeded in getting Europeans to want the same. Of course, the eruptions of a revanchist Russia have helped.\n\nThe latest example of Europe\u2019s new groove: The prime minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, announced on Friday plans for all Polish men to undergo military training. Tusk said he wants to increase the size of the army from 200,000 soldiers to half a million, and that Ukraine\u2019s army has 800,000 while Russia\u2019s has 1.3 million. It\u2019s no coincidence that the target set by Tusk would make up the difference.\n\nOne far-sighted philosopher prophesied long ago that Russia\u2019s rise would lead to Europe\u2019s revitalization. In 1886, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that Europe might only shake its feebleness, divisions, and liberal illusions in the face of a growing Russian threat:\n\nI mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening\u2014namely, to acquire one will, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-stateism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world\u2014the compulsion to great politics.\n\nThe 20th century did indeed bring great power politics to Europe, as Nietzsche foretold\u2014but not European unity against Russia. That wouldn\u2019t come until the third decade of the 21st century. Still, the Trump White House has needed to prod the Europeans to translate their moral solidarity into military action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, during a meeting in Brussels, told NATO allies that the U.S. would retrench from Europe\u2014meaning Europeans would need to step up on their continent. \u201cSafeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of NATO,\u201d Hegseth said.\n\nSubsequent White House moves reinforced the message. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vice President J.D. Vance scolded European elites for sacrificing their own people on the altar of globalism, and he questioned whether shared values still held together the transatlantic partnership. A few days later, Trump dispatched top diplomats to meet Russian envoys in Saudi Arabia\u2014and didn\u2019t invite Europeans to join. Two weeks after that, during a tense Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump made clear that he wouldn\u2019t aid Ukraine\u2019s war effort against Russia indefinitely.\n\nEuropeans, in reaction, have grown concerned that they can no longer rely on America to defend them from Russian aggression\u2014or worse, that Washington is aligning with Moscow against Europe. To meet the moment, leaders like Tusk and Friedrich Merz, Germany\u2019s chancellor-in-waiting, have promoted European self-sufficiency. \u201cMy absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\u201d Merz said last month.\n\nFrance\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron\u2014Mr. Europe himself\u2014must sense a golden opportunity to construct what he calls a \u201cPower Europe.\u201d In recent weeks, Macron has found a more receptive audience for his controversial idea to extend France\u2019s nuclear umbrella across the continent. Tusk has said Poland\u2019s government is \u201ccarefully examining\u201d France\u2019s offer\u2014and might itself develop nuclear weapons one day. Merz said Sunday that he\u2019s open to France and Britain \u201csharing\u201d their nuclear weapons with Germany.\n\nThe Europeans would be wise to fold up America\u2019s nuclear umbrella and open one of their own\u2014and America would be wise to let them. U.S. nuclear deterrence has always been questionable in Eastern Europe, where America lacks vital interests. In such a situation, America\u2019s clients can become over-confident, while its adversaries may doubt that Washington would fight for faraway vassals.\n\nHegseth had proposed in Brussels that Europe take the lead only in conventional security while Washington continues providing nuclear deterrence. But if the Europeans believe that Washington has become \u201clargely indifferent to the fate of Europe,\u201d as Merz recently claimed, why would they count on America to risk nuclear war to defend Warsaw and Vilnius? The truth is, they no longer do.\n\nOddly, many American commentators who have mocked Europe\u2019s weakness are now dismissing its plans for rearmament as moronic and the leaders who promote those plans as warmongers. Some of these commentators are plainly motivated by anti-European sentiments, plus a smattering of braggadocio about American power.\n\nBen Shapiro, a pro-Israel podcaster, is one of many conservative voices calling on Europe to pay more for defense, or as he put it, to \u201cpony up, show us the money.\u201d Shapiro is also one of many conservatives who have evinced personal disdain for Europe, as he did in a tirade a few years ago on his show. On the same day, Shapiro left no doubt about the kind of notions that fed his antipathy, promoting David Harsanyi\u2019s book Eurotrash: Why America Must Reject the Failed Ideas of a Dying Continent.\n\nAmerica-First patriots have taken a different view of the old continent, seeing it as the ancestral homeland of most U.S. citizens and the wellspring of America\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nFollowing the Cold War, Pat Buchanan, a cofounder of The American Conservative, was fiercely critical of America\u2019s deepening entanglement in Eastern Europe, predicting that it would provoke a backlash from Russia. He also lambasted the EU as a \u201csocialist superstate\u201d and spoke of Europe\u2019s civilizational decline. Yet Buchanan always harbored deep affection for Europe, and he drew harsh criticism for his view that America was founded on European stock and might not survive the influx of African, Asian, and Hispanic immigrants.\n\nBuchanan would agree, I think, that the best reason to support Europeans\u2019 rearmament is not that they have been insolent freeloaders, but that it would be good for both Europe and America.\n\nIn truth, American militarism has lately endangered Europe, not protected it, often over the objections of European capitals. Belligerent U.S. policies made a Russian invasion of Ukraine more likely. U.S. wars in the Middle East sparked migration crises that have destabilized European politics. And U.S. support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has inflamed the hatred that many of Europe\u2019s newcomers feel for the West. American retrenchment and European rearmament would be a boon to Europe\u2019s security.\n\nA military restructuring may also bring about a spiritual revival among Europeans, arousing the warrior ethos that historically they have been known for. Safeguarding one\u2019s own existence tends to focus the mind, dispelling universalist illusions and sharpening distinctions between friend and foe, brother and stranger. For Europeans, whose national identities are being deconstructed to make way for multiculturalism, such a change in consciousness can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nEuropean self-sufficiency would also be good for the United States, as Buchanan argued in books like A Republic, Not an Empire. Our efforts to serve as the world\u2019s policeman have drained U.S. resources and enmeshed us in foreign conflicts that do not implicate the interests of Americans. In the dawning era of multipolarity, America should prioritize the homeland; Europe should become a strong pillar in the NATO alliance; and the collective West needs to chart a new course\u2014even as it continues marching toward a common destiny.\n\nTo that end, the Trump administration should modulate its criticisms of Europe, highlighting the mutual benefits of European independence and the common interests of Western nations. J.D. Vance struck the right note in Munich: \u201cWe ought to ask whether we\u2019re holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard,\u201d Vance insisted. \u201cAnd I say \u2018ourselves,\u2019 because I fundamentally believe we are on the same team.\u201d\n\nIf Trump can pass the ball to Europe without breaking up the team, he could go down not only as a successful America-First president\u2014but as a transformative figure in the history of Western civilization."

It's hard not to see it as an attempt to inject politics into scientific research, forcing us to align with ideological priorities rather than urgent public health needs,\" said one researcher who received the survey.\n\nResearchers who received the survey also told ABC News that they were concerned their answers would be used to jeopardize ongoing research or could be used to justify further cuts, especially to research conducted abroad.\n\n\"I worry about how these responses might be used to justify funding cuts, especially for critical public health initiatives,\" one researcher said.\n\nEarlier this week, a similar survey was sent to foreign aid programs supported by the United States Agency for International Development, according to reporting by The New York Times.\n\nThe survey comes amid federal firings, budget cuts and grant cuts to federally funded research, though some of those actions have been blocked in court.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered in the nation's capital on March 7 for the Stand Up for Science rally, and there are similar rallies planned in more than 30 other cities.\n\nIn 2023, the federal government funded roughly $60 billion in scientific research, according to the Association of American Universities. Prior government-funded research has led to technologies such as MRIs and GPS."
