            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDozens of people have been reported killed after US President Donald Trump ordered \u201cdecisive\u201d military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen, opening a new salvo against the Iran-backed group that has targeted shipping lanes in the Red Sea.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the US would deploy \u201coverwhelming lethal force\u201d against the Houthis \u201cuntil we have achieved our objective,\u201d signaling the start of a major operation that could last weeks and prompting the Houthis to warn of escalation.\n\nThe US strikes killed at least 53 people and wounded almost 100 others in Yemen, including women and children, the Houthi-run health ministry said according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe strikes killed \u201cmultiple\u201d Houthi leaders, according to US national security adviser Michael Waltz. They were an \u201coverwhelming response,\u201d Waltz told ABC News, adding that they were also aimed at \u201cholding Iran responsible\u201d for supporting the Houthis.\n\nOn Sunday, the Houthis claimed to have launched 18 missiles and drones at the American aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman in the northern Red Sea in response to \u201cAmerican aggression.\n\n\u201cIf they continue their aggression, we will continue the escalation,\u201d the group\u2019s leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said.\n\nAccording to two US officials, there were no injuries or damage on the Truman, and it is not clear from initial assessment whether the carrier had to intercept any launches.\n\nThe Houthis, based in Yemen, started launching drone and missile strikes on vessels in the Red Sea in late 2023 in what they say is revenge for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The sustained strikes significantly impacted global trade.\n\nThe Houthis stopped their attacks when a Gaza ceasefire was declared in January, but have since threatened to resume them due to Israeli aid blockages to Gaza.\n\nIn his post, Trump accused the group of waging \u201can unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.\u201d\n\nHe said US personnel were carrying out aerial attacks on Houthi bases, leaders and missile defenses \u201cto protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nFurther actions after Saturday will depend on battle damage assessments from this series of strikes, a US defense official told CNN. But there is expected to be more action against the Houthis over the next several weeks.\n\nTrump also delivered a warning for Iran, the Houthis\u2019 main backer, saying it must \u201cimmediately\u201d end support for the group. He warned that if Iran threatened the American people or their president, \u201cAmerica will hold you fully accountable and, we won\u2019t be nice about it!\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi hit back in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe United States Government has no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEnd support for Israeli genocide and terrorism. Stop killing of Yemeni people.\u201d\n\nThere were fatalities in Yemen\u2019s capital Sanaa, according to the health ministry, as well as the northern province of Saada.\n\nPeople gather at the site of a house hit by a strike in Saada, Yemen, March 16, on Sunday. Naif Rahma/Reuters\n\nIn Saada, strikes targeted a power station in the city of Dahyan, causing a power outage in the city and its suburbs, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.\n\nStrikes also targeted Houthi military sites in Yemen\u2019s southwestern city of Taiz, Reuters reported, citing two witnesses.\n\nThe Houthis\u2019 political bureau condemned the US strikes as a \u201cwar crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation,\u201d it said in a statement seen by Reuters.\n\nTrump approved the Houthi strike plan \u2014 which he requested be drawn up several weeks ago \u2014 late last week, and the final order was given on Saturday to begin what officials describe as a sustained attack on the group\u2019s positions in Yemen.\n\nA larger campaign of strikes took time to organize and plan because the US had to collect the intelligence necessary for more sweeping attacks against the Houthis. A senior military official recently told CNN the intel collection required for broader strikes had been completed.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the strikes with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, stressing that Houthi attacks \u201cwill not be tolerated,\u201d according to a readout from the State Department. Last summer, Russia was prepared to deliver weapons to the Houthis but pulled back following pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement that Lavrov \u201cemphasized the need for an immediate cessation of the use of force\u201d in Yemen in the phone call.\n\nThe US has been working to degrade Houthi capabilities for months as the entity worked to disrupt international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways, calling the attacks a response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza against Hamas. The group has targeted more than 100 ships and vessels, including with drones, missiles and small ships.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump pictured as military strikes are launched against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday. White House/Reuters\n\nThe Biden administration sought to respond by carrying out targeted strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen, including attacking underground weapons storage facilities in October and November, but the actions did not prevent further attacks.\n\n\u201cThis is not a one off. This is the beginning of an ongoing series of events that will last days if not weeks,\u201d a source familiar with the strategy told CNN. \u201cThere is not and will not be an invasion or troops on ground. But there will be a series of ongoing strategic targeted attacks.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Trump signed an order designating the Houthis a \u201cforeign terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nTrump, in his message, said the Biden administration\u2019s approach to the Houthis was \u201cpathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON\u2019T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!\u201d he said.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alayna Treene, Oren Liebermann , Sophie Tanno, Maria Kostenko and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemocrats have long found the flip phone Chuck Schumer still insists on using as an endearing quirk that illustrates how committed he is to his way of talking to all sorts of allies, all the time.\n\nAfter how he handled the spending fight, many inside and outside the Capitol are starting to see that phone as a metaphor for a leader who\u2019s out of date and refusing to change as politics changes radically around him.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that members of the caucus expressed frustration that he wasn\u2019t as inclusive as he could have been on decision making or strategy, but the stakes of this particular vote were huge,\u201d said one Senate Democrat, who like others, is still wary of going public with attacks on the leader.\n\nBut CNN\u2019s conversations with three-dozen Democratic senators, members of the House, top aides and other prominent leaders detail a cratering of support, with many starting to feel that he can\u2019t be the party\u2019s future and shouldn\u2019t be their present.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t lose it between now and then, he won\u2019t be leader in two years,\u201d said another Democratic senator, who added, looking ahead to the next expected Congressional showdown, \u201che can\u2019t be trusted alone to negotiate the debt limit.\u201d\n\nIn a video he blasted out to his supporters Friday night, longtime Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 an independent who caucuses with the Democrats \u2014 called the situation \u201can absolute failure of Democratic leadership.\u201d In a video he blasted out to his own supporters, freshman California Sen. Adam Schiff called it \u201ca bad day for our country \u2013 and for the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchumer tried to be too smart,\u201d said another Democratic senator, \u201cbut he ended up looking indecisive.\u201d\n\nSchumer and the nine Democrats who voted with him on Friday say they were making the responsible decision between two horrible choices. Option one: advance a bill full of major cuts and leeway for Trump\u2019s administration to reallocate billions of funds for their own purposes. Option two: enable a shutdown which could have stretched on indefinitely while Trump officials flexed executive authority over spending in ways they would find even more devastating, not to mention leaving tens of thousands of federal workers without pay and millions more without services.\n\nBut critics from across traditional Democratic divides of ideology, geography and age see a pile of excuses and false choices. They say Schumer flubbed weeks of strategy, essentially negotiating with himself for less to make the final bill worse than they could have gotten it to be with better pushback. They say he mismanaged dynamics internally with colleagues and publicly so that he ended up delivering a fresh round of dejection to a party already slumping on the ropes.\n\nAny Democrat paying attention knew this week of negotiations was going to be terrible for them. But, many say, it was Schumer\u2019s leadership that left them looking and feeling even worse\u2014and with much less leverage for future fight, now that Senate Republicans saw how easy it was to write what Trump wants into the bills, make no effort to reach out to Democrats, and watch them be the ones to attack each other.\n\n\u201cRepublicans saw Democrats were weak, and thought, \u2018We\u2019re going to call your bluff\u2019\u2014and they were right,\u201d said a top aide to one Senate Democrat. \u201cThis was always going to be no-win. But it didn\u2019t have to be this much of an \u2018L\u2019.\u201d\n\nLosing some faith in the Senate, much more outside the Senate\n\nAs Trump got exactly the bill he wanted while losing only two Republican votes combined between the House and Senate, Schumer has lost faith among several of his Democratic senators for being able to manage the fights ahead. He left several of his own senators distrusting others in their own caucus. Several Democratic governors, who have privately been knocking Schumer as inept for weeks, finished Friday feeling more validated than they ever wanted to be.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) (L) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) walk together as they leave a press conference introducing the Stop The Steal Act at the U.S. Capitol on February 04, 2025 in Washington, DC. The legislation, according to the Democratic leadership, is designed to combat Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) by preventing unlawful access to the Treasury Department's payment systems. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was not just frustrated by what played out, but annoyed that Schumer\u2014who otherwise calls multiple times a day to check in on everything from strategy to tweets\u2014barely talked to him about any of this over the last few weeks, according to several House Democratic sources. Always deliberate with his words, the only answer the fellow New Yorker would give on Friday when asked by CNN if he thought a change in Senate leadership was needed was, \u201cnext question.\u201d\n\nOutside the Capitol, many Democratic assessments of Schumer are much harsher.\n\n\u201cDemocrats need a leader who is up to the moment both in terms of willingness to fight and ability to communicate about that willingness to fight. I don\u2019t think at this point Senator Schumer has had either,\u201d said Amanda Litman, the co-founder of the group Run for Something, which helps younger and newer Democratic candidates put together campaigns on the local level.\n\nA leader of a major Democratic-aligned organization, for now reluctant to exacerbate the party fractures by speaking publicly, said Schumer has now made himself irrelevant.\n\n\u201cThe biggest impact of this last week is that from now on, the broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, from the center to the left, will be looking to the House for leadership,\u201d that person told CNN on Friday afternoon.\n\nSchumer believes he\u2019s the one really grappling with the reality of Trump\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to the press as they stand next to a Tesla vehicle on the South Portico of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSchumer sees what he did, by contrast, as truly grappling with how different Trump is as a president now, versus when they had their showdown fights in his first term. Then, Schumer said repeatedly in conversations, Trump wasn\u2019t looking for pretexts to fire federal government workers. Then, Schumer also said, Republican leaders in Congress were trying to avoid a shutdown, while now he saw them as egging one on in a way that he feared meant they wouldn\u2019t have allowed government to re-open anytime soon.\n\n\u201cOnce you shut down the government, it is totally up to DOGE and Trump and Musk how long we\u2019re in shutdown,\u201d Schumer said in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN on Friday evening. \u201cWe could have been in shutdown for months, and why did Musk and Trump want to shut down? Because they wanted this power to achieve their goal of dramatically shrinking, destroying, hurting innocent people in the government.\u201d\n\nSo Schumer\u2019s thinking going into the week, several people familiar with it told CNN, was trying to avoid letting House Speaker Mike Johnson use him as a foil\u2014being clearer with his position, the Senate leader thought, would make it easier to line up House Republican votes. He also felt he was giving Jeffries the maximum amount of space to unite against the bill. And he figured this Republican leadership wouldn\u2019t make any real concessions on the bill no matter what he did.\n\nFor three days in a row leading up to the vote, Schumer held long lunch meetings for the Senate Democrats to air their grievances and opinions about what to do. To many of the senators stewing and steaming through them, this felt like not having a strategy\u2014to the point that one senator, according to a colleague, spoke up to say that even former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, despite being constantly mutinied against by his own Republican colleagues, managed to get a meeting with then-President Joe Biden during their 2023 debt limit fight.\n\nSchumer has told allies he saw these lunches as his strategy, trying to let colleagues coalesce around which of the bad options they felt was worse by arguing with each other, but without his twisting arms either way. He didn\u2019t want a shutdown. He felt like Democrats would lose the political fight over one. But he says he wanted his colleagues to get there themselves.\n\nHe also called multiple senators into his office to tell them they had to convince particular colleagues to vote yes, and urged several leaders of Democratic-leaning organizations to tamp down their rhetoric pushing for a shutdown.\n\nAnd when Schumer announced his own yes vote, it was not just within a day of floating an alternative strategy\u2014he even surprised one of his closest allies, according to multiple senators: Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and far from a standard resistance figure. She ended up voting no.\n\nHouse Democrats were bewildered themselves by the suggestion that Schumer was doing them any favors. Several joined the nearly unanimous Democratic vote against the Republican budget bill not because they wanted a shutdown, but because they thought they were giving the Senate more leverage. Others were convinced that they needed to be part of a unified Democratic effort.\n\nSeveral close to Jeffries himself, meanwhile, scoff at Schumer\u2019s suggesting that House Democrats didn\u2019t think Johnson would pass the bill, arguing the senator doesn\u2019t get how much obedience to Trump has come to define Republicans in Congress. They think Schumer never understood Jeffries\u2019s strategy was to push for the fight since he was convinced Democrats could win, and worried about the policy and political consequences of putting a rubber stamp on the Republican bill.\n\nAt a panel of union leaders at their retreat, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro asked them to call Schumer to remind him that they supported a \u201cNo\u201d vote. Several did. Schumer told those he spoke with he still felt confident he was right.\n\nLater in that same strategy session, another House Democrat vented more broadly: \u201cWhat\u2019s Chuck Schumer thinking?\u201d\n\nAnother voice shouted back from the crowd, \u201cOf himself!\u201d\n\nMany members started to clap and cheer, according to two people in the room.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is broken,\u201d one House Democratic member told CNN. \u201cThe anger is so strong right now that the future is hard to imagine.\u201d\n\nDemocrats struggle to see Schumer as majority leader ever again\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, speaks during a news conference following the weekly Senate Democrat policy luncheon at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. The House is scheduled to vote on a six-month spending bill that would make sure the whole government doesn't shut down, interrupting the fast start of President Donald Trump's second watch.

Kirsten Gillibrand, who in 2017 stood out for voting against every one of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, by Thursday\u2019s lunch of Senate Democrats was speaking so loudly in favor of voting Yes to advance the government funding bill that reporters outside could her through the walls.\n\nGillibrand is the chair of the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm for the 2026 elections. After voting yes, despite a detailed justification she argued in a press release from her office on Friday, several of her colleagues and Democratic operatives told CNN they did not see how she could credibly appeal to donors and voters who wanted more of a fight.\n\n\u201cWe are confident we will have the resources we need to win,\u201d an aide to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told CNN. \u201cWhen given an explanation, donors are receptive and understand the negative consequences of a shutdown.\u201d\n\nOthers sympathetic to Schumer and Gillibrand argued to CNN that it\u2019s hard to believe the intricacies of a procedural vote in March 2025 will really shape the 2026 midterms, especially because by the fall Democrats are expecting Republicans to push through a bill to enact much of Trump\u2019s agenda that includes sweeping tax cuts and deep spending reductions on programs like Medicare without requiring a single Democratic vote, which they think will unify both Democratic officials and their supporters.\n\nBut with Senate Democrats acknowledging they probably don\u2019t have enough opportunities in races to get to the majority even in their best case scenario for 2026, they are hoping to get there by 2028. By then, Schumer would be 77, in Washington for as long as Joe Biden had been when he was elected president, and have weathered years of compromises with Trump. He\u2019d also have had to run for a sixth term that would keep him in office until his mid-80s.\n\nChatter about who will be the next Senate leader was whipping around Washington long before this week\u2014though the focus of much speculation, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, ultimately joined Schumer in voting \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAnd while multiple senators declined CNN\u2019s interview requests because, they said, they wanted to be able to tell Schumer they weren\u2019t involved in questioning his future, some of the No votes stood by him publicly.\n\n\u201cSchumer is a senator as well, and every one of us has to make these tough decisions,\u201d New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n said on Friday. When asked if he questioned the New Yorker\u2019s leadership, he said, \u201cI support Chuck Schumer.\u201d\n\nRepublicans \u201cown the pain that will result from this Continuing Resolution, and they will own the disastrous effects of cutting Medicaid and Social Security\u2014which they call a Ponzi scheme. We need to be ready for the fight ahead and redouble our efforts, and be unified,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, also a No vote.\n\nAsked if he had any concerns about Schumer\u2019s leadership going forward, Blumenthal answered without giving a yes or no, but insisted that was only because his only focus was Friday\u2019s vote.\n\nOr there was Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper\u2019s response when asked on Friday afternoon if he had a message to those Democrats outside the Senate so outraged that they\u2019re calling on Schumer to resign: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have a message\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Sarah Ferris and Manu Raju contributed to this report."

Never elected to any office before, Carney was sworn in on Friday to become Canada\u2019s 24th prime minister.\n\nHe is expected to call an election this week in a bid to keep the Liberals in power, and for him, to win a seat in the House of Commons.\n\nCount on the official opposition Conservatives, in a dead heat with the Liberals at 37% according to a recent Leger poll, to portray Carney as someone \"not connected to the common man\" and who has spent a fair amount of time outside Canada, Laura Kurkimaki told Fox News Digital. Kurkimaki served as deputy national campaign manager for the Conservative Party during the last federal election in 2021.\n\n\"Over the last five years, while Canadians have been lining up at foodbanks and experiencing a significant cost-of-living increase, he has not been in Canada,\" Kurkimaki said.\n\nSeen by detractors as out of touch, Carney, during a recent leadership debate, did not provide an answer when the moderator asked the candidates whether they knew the average cost of a week\u2019s worth of groceries.\n\nIn an appearance on \"The Rest is Politics\" podcast last month featuring Alastair Campbell, former British prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s press secretary, and past Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Scaramucci, Carney said that his \"weakness is people will charge me as being elitist or globalist.\"\n\nMARK CARNEY WINS LIBERAL PARTY NOMINATION TO REPLACE TRUDEAU AS CANADA'S NEXT PM\n\n\"Well, that happens to be exactly what we need,\" he said, adding that he\u2019s also \"a pragmatist\" and \"a leader in crisis.\"\n\nWhen Scaramucci asked Carney how he would respond to attacks that he is \"out of touch with the mainstream, common citizen in Canada,\" the new prime minister said that most of his life in Canada \"has been in service of Canadians.\"\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre also targeted Carney, who played hockey at Harvard and Oxford, after he was photographed playing goalie reportedly wearing high-end sneakers.\n\n\"Trying to be a normal guy playing hockey in $2000 shoes,\" Poilievre posted on X.\n\nKurkimaki said the upcoming federal election campaign with Carney at the Liberal helm could be a replay of the one in 2011 when another \"out-of-touch\" Liberal leader \u2013 historian Michael Ignatieff, who came from the world of academia \u2013 lost his House seat, and his party recorded its worst-ever result in a general election that the Conservatives won.\n\nCanada\u2019s new prime minister earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics at Harvard University and went on to receive master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in economics at the University of Oxford.\n\nWHO IS PIERRE POILIEVRE? CANADA'S CONSERVATIVE LEADER SEEKING TO BECOME NEXT PRIME MINISTER AFTER TRUDEAU EXIT\n\nCarney, who lived in the tony Ottawa neighborhood of Rockcliffe Park before becoming prime minister, also holds British and Irish citizenship. Earlier this month, he said that he had begun the process of renouncing both.\n\nAlong the way, the man whose looks were once compared to those of actor George Clooney made a fortune at England\u2019s central bank alone. Carney earned $1.3 million, including pay, allowances and housing costs \u2013 the highest for the head of any federal reserve at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, his current net worth might not be revealed any time soon. Before becoming prime minister, Carney divested his assets, \"other than his personal real estate, into a blind trust,\" a member of his team told CBC News. Under Canadian law, public-office holders need to divest their assets, such as stock options, either by selling them or having a trustee manage or sell them without, in this case, consulting Carney.\n\nCarney's spokesperson did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment."

            "full_content": "Tesla is now facing intense competition from other Chinese EV makers, including BYD.\n\nYet even there, a Chinese official also warned about the impact of Musk\u2019s high-profile politicking.\n\n\u201cAs a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: Treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,\u201d the secretary of China\u2019s Passenger Car Association, said in a briefing Monday, Bloomberg reported. \u201cBut if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the unavoidable risk that\u2019s come after he got his personal glory,\u201d the secretary, Cui Dongshu, said Monday, referring to Musk.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reported Tesla was planning to sell a Model Y costing at least 20% less to produce to defend its China share.\n\nAnd in the U.S., Tesla\u2019s January sales were down about 11%, according to data from the S&P Global analytics group \u2014 an outlier at a time when EV sales for all other brands are trending higher in America.\n\nThough he has long worn multiple proverbial hats, Musk\u2019s role in the White House as nominal head of the Department of Government Efficiency may be his most consequential. And having influence with the Trump administration could be critical to Tesla\u2019s fortunes. This week, Trump promised he would purchase a Tesla in a showy presentation on the White House lawn, seemingly further cementing the Trump-Musk alliance.\n\nOn X \u2014 the social media platform he owns \u2014 Musk\u2019s frenetic posting is increasingly focused on politics and America\u2019s culture wars, with an occasional nod to SpaceX launches.\n\nHis apparently undiminished role in the Trump administration \u2014 he was seen leaving the White House last weekend alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2014 has sparked boycotts in Europe, as well as protests and even acts of vandalism against auto owners in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhen people\u2019s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent to Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,\u201d Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d on Monday.\n\nIn a note to clients this week downgrading its estimate of deliveries, analysts with JPMorgan said the damage to Tesla\u2019s brand has been serious.\n\n\u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTesla itself is warning about the fallout from retaliatory measures taken by countries targeted by Trump\u2019s tariffs, saying in a letter to the U.S. trade representative this week that the company may be \u201cexposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.\u201d\n\nAlready, the Canadian province of British Columbia has announced it was ending subsidies for Tesla\u2019s products.\n\nFor all the oxygen Musk has taken up with his political activities, concerns about Tesla products themselves are equally keeping investors and analysts up at night.\n\nMusk has \u201cneglect[ed] the rest of Tesla\u2019s automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving \u2014 automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles,\u201d Fred Lambert, who covers the company for the Electrek electric vehicle blog, wrote in a recent post.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk decided to kill Tesla\u2019s cheaper, $25,000 model while going all-in on the Cybertruck, whose sales have yet to take off, Lambert said.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s core business remains selling cars and batteries,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there\u2019s no clear path to improvement.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, many analysts continue to take a much longer view of Tesla\u2019s outlook. In his most recent note to clients about the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most closely watched observers of Tesla, summarized the long-term outlook that he says continues to justify the company\u2019s eye-watering valuation.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive \u2018pure play\u2019 to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\u201d he wrote in a note March 2.\n\nWhile that was before the most recent sell-off intensified, Jonas said he was already discounting market gyrations.\n\n\u201cWhile the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,\u201d he wrote."

Widespread layoffs are in the works, with plans to cut nearly 20% of all IRS employees by May 15.\n\nThe barnstorming, which has played out at multiple agencies, has thrown the IRS into turmoil at the height of tax season. While the business of processing returns and issuing refunds has been ongoing, sources say these DOGE actions could undermine the long-term operations of the IRS, which handles nearly all accounts receivable for the federal government.\n\nFormer Internal Revenue Service workers leave their office after being laid off in downtown Denver, Colorado, on Thursday, February 20. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post/Getty Images\n\nIn interviews with CNN, multiple current and former IRS officials, who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous, described an atmosphere of intimidation, especially of career staffers.\n\n\u201cThey just randomly drop by people\u2019s offices, demanding access to systems; they\u2019re bullying us and there\u2019s no discipline in what they are doing, which really worries me,\u201d said one IRS employee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clusterf***, and I can\u2019t believe no one is stepping in to do anything,\u201d said another top staffer who worked at the IRS.\n\n\u201cWe are paralyzed,\u201d said a third IRS source.\n\nAnother current IRS employee, who works outside Washington and is a local union leader, said it\u2019s now routine to see people crying in the office and managers going around apologizing for firings they had no decision in.\n\n\u201cMorale is suffering,\u201d the person said.\n\nNina Olson, who served from 2001 to 2019 as the independent National Taxpayer Advocate within the IRS, said the cuts were \u201cbasically gutting the agency\u201d by hollowing out the ranks, putting the IRS\u2019 future at risk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of new blood getting fired, that\u2019s supposed to be the future of the workforce,\u201d Olson said, referring to the agency\u2019s newly hired probationary employees. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got the most skilled people, at the height of their institutional knowledge, leaving through retirement.\u201d\n\nOlson, who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Taxpayer Rights, criticized this \u201cshotgun approach\u201d to staff reductions and predicated, \u201cnone of this bodes well for the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nIn response to CNN\u2019s reporting, the White House press secretary said in a statement, \u201cThis story is based on anonymous sources and the fraudsters always scream the loudest. The vast majority of Americans support President Trump rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll released last week found that 62% of Americans are worried that Trump\u2019s cuts to the federal government will go too far and lead to important programs being shut down. Only 37% said they\u2019re more worried that the cuts won\u2019t go far enough to eliminate fraud and waste.\n\nRemaking the IRS\n\nSince Trump\u2019s return, there have been a number of leadership changes at the IRS.\n\nThe Biden-appointed IRS commissioner, Danny Werfel, resigned on Inauguration Day. The acting commissioner who succeeded him retired four weeks later. The current leader, Melanie Krause has only been at the IRS for three-and-a-half years.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee to be the next full-time commissioner, former GOP congressman Billy Long, hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet.\n\nTrump announced Long\u2019s appointment in December. In a Truth Social post, Trump didn\u2019t say anything about the fact that Werfel\u2019s statutory five-year term \u2013 which is intended to give IRS commissioners some independence from the president \u2013 wasn\u2019t set to expire until 2027.\n\nDuring the transition, Werfel reached out multiple times to incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, seeking guidance on whether to resign or stay at the helm until Long was confirmed, to maintain stability amid tax season, according to a source familiar with the matter. Bessent never responded, the source said, and Werfel stepped down on January 20.\n\nIn this May 2024 photo, Biden-era Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Danny Werfel testifies before the House Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/File\n\nAlong with reducing headcount, sources say that it appears that DOGE\u2019s priority at the IRS has been around accessing its vast data systems.\n\nIn recent weeks, DOGE staffers have gained access to the IRS\u2019 human resource system that houses personal information of all the agency\u2019s employees, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile the courts weigh whether to allow DOGE to have full access to IRS data systems, the effort to remake the tax collection agency is well underway.\n\nIt began in mid-February when senior IRS staff were told DOGE would be visiting their offices. They were given just a 15-minute heads up that Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old software engineer, was on his way.\n\nWithin minutes of arriving, Kliger demanded access to the IRS\u2019s \u201ctax administration systems,\u201d according to an IRS employee familiar with the situation.\n\nIn a Bloomberg op-ed published Friday, Werfel, the former IRS commissioner, said DOGE should not have access to the sensitive data. He said it was akin the CEO of a bank walking into a branch and demanding access to all of the customers\u2019 safe-deposit boxes.\n\nOnly a select group of IRS employees have access to the systems that house taxpayers\u2019 sensitive financial data. Career employees informed Kliger that he could not access the agency\u2019s IT system without undergoing extensive background checks to ensure he would not pose an insider threat.\n\nTwo weeks later, Kliger was joined at IRS by Sam Corcos, a 36-year-old startup entrepreneur, who co-founded a company that helps people customize their diet to boost their metabolism.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taxpayer advocate on DOGE access to IRS data 05:00 - Source: CNN Taxpayer advocate on DOGE access to IRS data 05:00\n\nAs soon as Corcos got there, one IRS employee told CNN, he pushed to a halt nearly all the agency\u2019s congressionally funded programs and initiatives it was planning for fiscal year and calendar year 2025. The employee told CNN Corcos was making the demand without \u201cfully understanding how the agency works within the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come in and say we\u2019re going to delete that initiative\u2013 \u2018delete\u2019 is one of their favorite terms,\u201d said the IRS employee. \u201cSo, we are scrambling to figure out \u2018Does Sam have that authority? Does Gavin have that authority? Did Treasury give them that authority?\u2019\u201d\n\nCorcos also pushed for a fast-tracked background check which would have required federal employees to work on the weekend so he could quickly gain access to the IRS IT system.\n\nBy the following Monday, the agency\u2019s top HR officer was placed on administrative leave and told she was dismissed for being insubordinate after Kliger\u2019s demand for an expedited background check for his DOGE partner had not been fulfilled over the weekend, sources said.\n\nUsing tax data to find immigrants\n\nLike all of DOGE\u2019s actions, the moves at IRS are part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader efforts to purportedly root out fraud and abuse. But two IRS employees who spoke to CNN said that some of the actions taken by DOGE inside IRS appear to be aimed at finding ways to use the agency\u2019s protected data to find undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security circulated a draft memo to IRS that represented a sweeping request for information about suspected undocumented immigrants, including the home addresses of several hundred thousand individuals who paid federal taxes based on their individual taxpayer identification numbers, according to a source with direct knowledge of the document.\n\nThe memo also proposed IRS detail a dedicated group of several dozen senior IRS auditors to launch investigations into companies suspected of hiring undocumented immigrants.\n\nPrivacy experts say that would be a violation of the strict disclosure laws that the IRS operates under that prohibits the release of tax information by an IRS employee.\n\nTwo immigrant-rights groups in Chicago sued the Treasury Department and IRS earlier this month and asked a judge to block the agency from sharing taxpayers\u2019 identifying information with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement or DHS, as Trump pushes for more deportations.\n\nThe groups claimed federal law \u201cforbids\u201d IRS from giving this data to immigration authorities, because ICE and DHS aren\u2019t listed as exceptions to the confidentiality rules in the tax code.\n\nIf that does happen, lawyers for the groups wrote in filings that it would subject their members \u201cto harm in the form of the arrest, detention, or other deprivations of liberty associated with the Trump Administration\u2019s stated intention to engage in mass actions against immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe case is still pending in DC federal court, and the judge hasn\u2019t issued any rulings yet.\n\nCarts containing documents sit organized at the IRS Processing Facility on September 6, 2024 in Austin, Texas.

            "full_content": "Mahmoud Khalil. Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP Photo\n\nWhen ICE agents detained Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student and pro-Palestine activist, on March 8, Democratic leaders could not seem to agree on whether to stand up for him. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasted the arrest and threat of deportation of a green-card holder for no crime other than exercising his free-speech rights as \u201ctyrannical.\u201d The X account for the Senate Judiciary Democrats posted, \u201cFree Mahmoud Khalil.\u201d But other Democrats, from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo, stressed their opposition to Khalil\u2019s political views before grudgingly conceding that people should not be spirited away to a Louisiana detention center for those views.\n\nIn some ways, Khalil\u2019s case bears many of the hallmarks of a liberal cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Here we have a sympathetic protagonist whose edges are softened by his status as a father-to-be, pitted against despicable villains in Marco Rubio and Donald Trump. A federal judge has halted Khalil\u2019s deportation for now, and protests have erupted across the country as legal analysts and even Ann Coulter have voiced their dismay at what by all appearances is a full-scale trampling of the First Amendment. Yet because the issue involves Israel, which in the past year and a half has divided the liberal-left like no other issue, the support for Khalil is less than ironclad. Unfortunately, there is no pro-Palestine activist who could help the party avoid conservative pundit Jonah Goldberg\u2019s verdict that it has \u201ca gift for picking problematic martyrs,\u201d because the Democratic Party tends to treat everyone who stands up for Palestine like a problem.\n\nAnd that is the real crisis that Khalil embodies for Democrats. His cause is clearly just, but he is a member of one of the most marginalized and pilloried communities on earth \u2014 which is likely why the Trump administration feels comfortable targeting him. As a result, the party is buckling in the most prominent test yet of its commitment to opposing encroaching fascism.\n\nFor their part, conservatives from X to Capitol Hill have presented a unified front, smearing the 30-year-old Syrian national as a threat to national security and in some cases claiming he was a different Mahmoud Khalil who allegedly chanted, \u201cExplode the heads of Zionists!\u201d at a protest in Quebec. Trump has called Khalil\u2019s arrest \u201cthe first of many to come,\u201d and his plan to weaponize state resources against people who support Palestine is already entering its next phase. Department of Homeland Security agents were seen scouring two more Columbia dorms with search warrants on Thursday night. The Atlantic reported on Friday that Rubio has singled out a second unnamed green-card holder for deportation, hours before DHS announced that it had arrested a second former student who had participated in the Columbia protests, Leqaa Kordia, and that a third, Ranjani Srinivasan, had left the country voluntarily\n\nDemocrats including Schumer have seemed eager to go along with Trump\u2019s demagogic characterization of Khalil and his fellow activists \u2014 with the minority leader asserting, \u201cI abhor many of the opinions and policies that Mahmoud Khalil holds and supports\u201d \u2014 but it remains unclear if the supposedly abhorrent views he is accused of expressing are actually his. Social-media users have alleged that pamphlets from the Hamas Media Office were distributed at a protest at Barnard College earlier this month, but offered no proof that Khalil distributed them. Others have pointed to an Instagram post from Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a campus group that Khalil has protested with, calling for \u201cthe total eradication of Western Civilization.\u201d But Drop Site News reported that Khalil has nothing to do with CUAD\u2019s Instagram decisions. So far, anyway, it appears Khalil\u2019s principal views \u2014 that Palestinians should be free, that Columbia should divest from Israel \u2014 are within the mainstream.\n\nKhalil had open misgivings about protesting at Columbia because he feared the exact consequences he is now facing \u2014 \u201cthat I will be arrested and ultimately deported\u201d \u2014 so his primary role was as an intermediary between student protesters and the administration. This put him on the school\u2019s radar and, owing in part to the activity of extremist pro-Israel groups like Canary Mission and Betar US that dox pro-Palestine activists, eventually on Trump\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s an easier target than a lot of other students,\u201d said the Verge\u2019s Gaby Del Valle on Vox\u2019s Today, Explained podcast. This may account for the speed with which both Columbia and key Democrats have yielded to Trump\u2019s bellicosity. It\u2019s no coincidence that Khalil was arrested the day after the Trump administration canceled $400 million in federal funding to Columbia over its alleged failure to police antisemitism.\n\nHowever, the Democrats\u2019 alignment with the president on this issue is less about Trump than it is about them. John Fetterman, the Senate\u2019s most ostentatious Israel supporter, was in a meeting with pro-Israel activist Ross Glick while Khalil was participating in the Barnard protest. According to The Forward, Fetterman promised Glick, who has provided lists of campus protesters to federal immigration authorities in the past, that he would \u201cescalate\u201d pressure on the administration to deport pro-Palestine activists who were not citizens. Both parties are in lockstep providing material support and political justification for whatever Israel chooses to do to its Palestinian subjects, including a military assault on Gaza that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women, children, or the elderly.\n\nEven if Democrats were not proactive collaborators in Trump\u2019s assault on the First Amendment, their own past actions would be apt precursors: In 2023, 20 of them voted to censure Palestinian American congresswoman Rashida Tlaib for daring to criticize Israel\u2019s mass slaughter of Palestinian civilians, the most severe punishment for a member of Congress short of expulsion.\n\nThus, instead of riding the groundswell of outrage over Khalil\u2019s persecution and siding with him unequivocally, Democrats are drawing more attention to their own complicity and to their own conditional support for democratic institutions. Not only are they ceding critical ground to Trump\u2019s authoritarian takeover in the process, they are reminding people that the reason Khalil is in this situation to begin with, Israel\u2019s oppression of Palestine, is one they support and have shown no interest in wavering on. Even if they were not immobilized by their current lack of institutional power, entrusting them with Khalil\u2019s political defense would be a dicey proposition. Why trust a party whose moral convictions are as weak as their opposition to Trump has been?"

            "full_content": "Craig Peterson\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nUsing the R-word is vulgar, hateful and immature behavior. It must stop.\n\nIt would have been about 57 years ago. I was a first grader at Madison Elementary School in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. My mom would drop me off in the summer at Lindsay Park, just off Congress Avenue to play in the wading pool. There was an older boy in the pool, probably in eighth grade, who had Down syndrome. There was also a group of older boys on bikes hanging around the fence surrounding the pool.\n\nAt some point the kids on bikes began jeering at the boy with Down syndrome, laughing and yelling \"retard\" over and over. The boy in the pool laughed, too, as the group continued chanting the slur.\n\nWhat happened at Wauwatosa wading pool haunts me to this day\n\nI don't know when, but he eventually got out of the pool and joined the older kids who were now off their bikes.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThen there was a lot of commotion. It seemed like everyone jumped out of the pool at the same time and swarmed the group as the boys kept cheering as they lead the boy with Down syndrome into the bathroom.\n\nEveryone followed, like a mob caught up in the moment. It seemed like something exciting was going to happen. Then a couple of the kids grabbed the boy and forced his head into one of those big, stinky, county park toilets while another boy flushed the toilet, giving the young man a \"swirly.\"\n\nWhen he was lifted out of the toilet bowl with his wet head and water running down his cheeks, he laughed. Because the whole group was laughing. Yup, everyone.\n\nThat day and those images have haunted me for the last 57 years.\n\nI'm the proud father of a talented son with Down syndrome\n\nToday, I am the proud father of a very talented son with Down syndrome. I thought as a culture we had banished the R-word and begun welcoming everyone with special needs and disabilities into our lives with open arms and minds. Then came Elon Musk and the followers of Donald Trump.\n\nThey think it\u2019s cool and anti-woke to throw around the R-word to virtue signal their unwillingness to follow the norms of a polite and empathetic society.\n\nTheir actions are already picking up steam as more and more folks and conservative media types are using the R-word. Just because they heard Musk use it, they think it\u2019s OK and must be cool to not be \u201cpolitically correct.\"\n\nI'm afraid these celebrities, insensitive fools and keyboard rage posters are going to bring us back to a time when playground bullies felt empowered to use the R-word and act like young mobsters, giving swirlies and hinder-binders to the kids with disabilities. And the herd mentality will take over as other kids join in to become accessories to the cruelty.\n\nAll while everyone laughs.\n\nThat's not who we are, and we need to stop it right now. The R-word is never acceptable. Period.\n\nCraig Peterson is the CEO of Wisconsin's oldest independent public relations firm, Zigman Joseph & Associates in Milwaukee.

            "full_content": "Photo: Oliver Contreras/The New York Times/Redux\n\nThe path to women\u2019s liberation has always been blocked by other women. Before Amy Coney Barrett rose to the Supreme Court or Marjorie Dannenfelser began her war on legal abortion, there was Phyllis Schlafly, that self-styled paragon of wifely submission, and Anita Bryant, the unrepentant homophobe. In Right-Wing Women, the late feminist writer Andrea Dworkin skewered them and the culture of male violence they served. Now that Schlafly\u2019s heirs are in power, we owe Dworkin reevaluation, or so the argument goes. \u201cFew writers are pilloried so confidently by people who do not really know what they said; few writers provide, as a consequence, so many disorienting surprises,\u201d the writer Moira Donegan argues in a new foreword to the reissued book.\n\nDworkin published Right-Wing Women in 1983 as second-wave feminism faded and the Reagan revolution got underway. There was something unfashionable about her, even then. Her scalding analysis of woman-hatred ran counter to the Moral Majority\u2019s tender visions of the traditional white family, anchored by a mother in the home. Feminists, too, regarded her with suspicion if not hostility, and for good reason. In the porn wars years earlier, Dworkin sided with the censorious Christian right over many of her feminist peers, a decision that would undermine her work for the rest of her life. By the time she died in 2005, most people knew Dworkin the caricature, not Dworkin the writer.\n\nLike the rest of her work, Right-Wing Women is a hammer blow. \u201cFrom father\u2019s house to husband\u2019s house to a grave that still might not be her own, a woman acquiesces to male authority in order to gain some protection from male violence,\u201d she asserted, and who can fault her? The right-wing woman is ascendant, and with her rides the incel, the woman batterer, and the rapist. Andrew Tate\u2019s former attorney, Paul Ingrassia, now works for Donald Trump, an accused rapist, and so does Pete Hegseth, who has been accused of sexual assault and abuse himself. Hegseth hired Sean Parnell, whose ex-wife once testified that he choked her and abused their children. Dana White, the chief executive of the UFC and a prominent Trump ally, allegedly hit his wife and embraced Tate and his brother Tristan at a recent event. Texas lawyer Jonathan Mitchell represents men who are outraged over their partners\u2019 abortions, and some women have accused his clients of domestic abuse.\n\nWomen are in danger, and they know it. The right-wing woman knows it too and, Dworkin wrote, strikes a bargain to save herself. \u201cThe political Right in the United States today makes certain metaphysical and material promises to women that both exploit and quiet some of women\u2019s deepest fears,\u201d she argued. \u201cThese fears originate in the perception that male violence against women is uncontrollable and unpredictable.\u201d Today\u2019s tradwives agree to bear children, stay at home, and obey their husbands because the alternative is too frightful for them to contemplate, because the right wing tells them that it is their nature and because it\u2019s what they want to do. They believe abortion, contraception, and queerness prevent them from finding true satisfaction as women, so each must be destroyed. If they\u2019re bored enough, or zealous enough, they can follow Schlafly and Bryant and sell their choices to the masses. There\u2019s always TikTok.\n\nIn videos and on podcasts, right-wing women say they need men more than they need feminism. Of course, the opposite is true. We need feminism, but there are many feminisms, and they aren\u2019t all fit for purpose \u2014 any reevaluation of Dworkin must reckon with the full scope of her work. Though her defenders will sometimes admit some flaws in her thinking, they say her critics have judged her too harshly. She did not write that all heterosexual intercourse is rape, as is commonly reported, and whatever her flaws, her feminism had teeth. The rise of Trump, and later the Me Too movement, helped revitalize interest in Dworkin, whose excoriations of male brutality no longer seemed so outlandish. After all, what had sex positivity accomplished for women? \u201cIn her singular scorched-earth theory of representation, pornography was fascist propaganda, a weapon as crucial to the ever-escalating war on women as Goebbels\u2019 caricatures were to Hitler\u2019s rise,\u201d Johanna Fateman wrote in the introduction to Last Days at Hot Slit, a 2019 collection of Dworkin\u2019s work. In 2021, the academic Claire Potter wrote that Me Too had \u201copened the door to a long-overdue recognition of Dworkin\u2019s contributions to how we understand the politics of sex and gender,\u201d adding, \u201cI have always believed that part of the hostility that Dworkin aroused had something to do with a clarity of mind that terrified people who shy away from difficult and dangerous thoughts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an attractive logic. Twenty years after Dworkin\u2019s death, feminists have few friends and little institutional power. They certainly cannot look to the Democratic Party for aid, as members dither over rhetoric and strategy. A handful of Democratic women wore pink to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address because it is \u201cthe color of women\u2019s power, of persistence and of resistance,\u201d Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez told the New York Times. The pink-clad electeds held up signs as Trump rambled; it was Representative Al Green, not in pink, who interrupted the speech. (Some Democrats joined Republicans to censure him later.) Other Democrats try to appease the right by sacrificing trans girls and women on the altar of political expediency. With fascists on one side and quislings on the other, a militant response is overdue. Enter Dworkin, whose relentless anger and imaginative prescriptions can seem like the antidote not only to the right wing but to mainstream feminism itself, which told women that liberation ran through the Capitol and the courtroom and the corner office. Dworkin did not seek parity with men, but rather a new world altogether.\n\nThe pursuit of power for its own sake leaves most women behind, and the politics of compromise brings even the girlboss to her downfall. Right-Wing Women reappears in a moment of pitched anti-feminist backlash, as corporate America abandons all pretense of equal treatment and abusers of women fill the government. Women marched, rallied, and told their stories, but no hashtag is a match for misogyny. \u201cNo matter how often these stories are told, with whatever clarity or elegance, bitterness or sorrow, they might as well have been whispered in the wind or written in sand; they disappear, as if they are nothing,\u201d Dworkin wrote. Male outrage drowned out female pain. As she put it, \u201cThe tellers and stories are ignored or ridiculed; threatened back into silence or destroyed, and the experience of female suffering is buried in cultural invisibility and contempt.\u201d\n\nLately, pundits and policy wonks speak of men \u2014 their loneliness, their resentment, their decline \u2014 often presented as problems for women to solve. One popular theory says American men are moving to the right because they have been abandoned by liberals and alienated by feminism. The solution, of course, is for women to marry them anyway. Men need marriage and children to be happy, which is to say they need women; the worthiness of a man matters less to a pro-natalist than his fertility. Even a woman who seeks heterosexual marriage must know her place or be condemned. On the latest season of Love Is Blind, a contestant left her fianc\u00e9 at the altar because he attends an anti-gay megachurch, and the right wing erupted. \u201cThis man dodged a bullet,\u201d posted Isabella Maria DeLuca, a January 6 rioter. \u201cLiberal women are INSUFFERABLE & MISERABLE,\u201d posted Morgonn McMichael, who works for Charlie Kirk\u2019s Turning Point USA.\n\nMarriage is no sure refuge from male violence, and it can often become a trap, as Dworkin knew well. She endured molestation as a child and sexual violation during her incarceration as a war resister, only to marry a man who beat her savagely, once in front of her apathetic parents. In Right-Wing Women, she wrote almost sympathetically of Bryant, who was married to a controlling Evangelical husband. \u201cBryant, like all the rest of us, is trying to be a \u2018good\u2019 woman,\u201d she argued. Yet Bryant was responsible for her own choices and by all accounts died a bigot. There is no easy way to separate the right-wing woman\u2019s convictions from her victimhood, though we often try to do it anyway. In the silence of Usha Vance, some look for evidence of dissent, as if a woman of her obvious intelligence could not possibly agree with her husband\u2019s retrograde politics. Vance, like Bryant, is oppressed and oppressor at once.\n\nPortions of Right-Wing Women remind us that the Trump era has old roots. The Guardian reported earlier this month that an upcoming pro-natalist conference will feature eugenicists and purveyors of race science who believe women must have babies, but in the right way and with the right men. The argument is familiar, and so is the racism behind it. Dworkin recalled her encounters with a delegation of anti\u2013Equal Rights Amendment women from Mississippi. The Ku Klux Klan said it controlled the delegation, she wrote, and a man who accompanied them said he held a powerful role in the white-supremacist group. \u201cHe said that his wife had wanted him to be there to protect women\u2019s right to procreate and to have a family,\u201d she added.\n\nDworkin concluded later in Right-Wing Women that an extermination or \u201cgynocide\u201d may be on the way, though it was not inevitable. A rigorous thinker, she diagrammed a system of crimes against women to help her readers break free of the same. Her writing was one more act of optimism, shaped by her deep conviction not only in the necessity of liberation but in its possibility. In the years since her death, some feminists have identified a prophetic quality to her thinking, although that, too, risks caricature. A prophet is a divine vessel, and Dworkin was not that.\n\nOne of the principle functions of the right-wing woman is to police female sexuality and reproduction, and Dworkin\u2019s logic ultimately pushed her into a similar role. In Right-Wing Women, Dworkin attacked sex work, pornography, and reproductive technology with the same ferocity she applied to Schlafly\u2019s ilk. \u201cMotherhood is becoming a new branch of female prostitution with the help of scientists who want access to the womb for experimentation and power,\u201d she wrote, but the truth is somewhat more complex. For conservatives who defend technologies like IVF, science is another way to bind women to motherhood, but it can also detach reproduction from compulsory heterosexuality, and it offers women a way to bear children on their own terms, which is why it has always been in danger from some factions of the right wing. Dworkin admitted the irony, but as with her fight against pornography, she stood firmly on reactionary ground.\n\nIf there is a gynocide to come, as she feared, it would be carried out by the same forces who want to ban IVF, pornography, and sex work. The writer Sophie Lewis has called Dworkin\u2019s thinking an \u201cenemy feminism,\u201d an obstacle to the very liberation she sought. \u201cDid Dworkin herself not see the contradiction between her unjust arrest and subsequent rape at the hands of the state, and her apparent faith that this same coercive apparatus could be wrangled into the service of women?\u201d wrote the philosopher Amia Srinivasan in 2022. \u201cEven if we grant, with Dworkin and other radical feminists, that sex work cannot be understood outside the frame of gendered hierarchy, what does it mean to ignore sex workers\u2019 near-universal insistence that the criminalisation of their trade makes their lives less liveable?\u201d That\u2019s not an abstract question. The answer has life-or-death consequences.\n\nWith the right wing in power, the pursuit of liberation only becomes more urgent. \u201cWill it take a hundred fists, a thousand fists, a million fists, pushed through that circle of crime to destroy it, or are right-wing women essentially right that it is indestructible?\u201d Dworkin asked. \u201cThe freedom of women from sex oppression either matters or it does not; it is essential or it is not.\u201d We must agree that it is essential. In doing so, we must also understand why liberal \u201cwar on women\u201d rhetoric has failed. Misogyny is one reason, but misogyny serves a purpose, and today\u2019s anti-feminist moment was orchestrated by political forces that rely on our collective submission. The right wing tells all of us to bargain against our own liberation. They tell men that women\u2019s advancement deprived them of economic and emotional security, and they tell women that safety depends on the prosperity of men. All they can offer is hierarchy. Without meaningful political alternatives to that argument, misogyny will become more attractive, and the ranks of the right-wing woman will grow. Dworkin knew that women need a revolution, a feminism of fists. If it\u2019s going to succeed, it will have to be more transformative than even she imagined."

It is home to three main ethnic groups: Bosniak Muslims, Catholic Croats, and Orthodox Serbs.\n\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia and the war that followed left the country in ruins, with thousands of victims and deep ethnic and religious divisions.\n\nThe war, which began in 1992, ended with the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which divided the country into two federal entities: the Republic of Srpska, primarily inhabited by Orthodox Serbs, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, shared by Bosniak Muslims and Catholic Croats.\n\nThe Dayton Peace Agreement, however, failed to provide a long-term solution for Bosnia. As Tam\u00e1s Orb\u00e1n of the European Conservative aptly points out, \u201cBosnia and Herzegovina is not a country; it\u2019s a ceasefire between three nations pretending to be one, and it may soon come to an end.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ago, a court found Republic of Srpska President Milorad Dodik guilty of defying the authority of Bosnia\u2019s UN High Representative, Christian Schmidt. He was sentenced to one year in prison and barred from holding public office for six years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling has plunged the country into a constitutional and political crisis unlike any seen since the end of the war.\n\nJovan Tripkovic, a contributor to The American Conservative, sat down with President Dodik to discuss the ruling, the Biden administration\u2019s involvement in the judicial process against him, and his hopes of working with President Donald Trump to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe past few weeks have been incredibly turbulent for you. For our readers who don\u2019t closely follow developments in the Balkans, could you briefly summarize what has happened to you during this time?\n\nThis crisis has been building up for years, beginning with President Biden and his officials, including Ambassador Michael J. Murphy, who have acted like colonial rulers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their actions have undermined the country\u2019s constitution and the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was instrumental in establishing lasting peace in Bosnia.\n\nAt the end of the war, the Dayton Peace Agreement established the Office of the High Representative (OHR) for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The High Representative is appointed by the Peace Implementation Council\u2014PIC, an international body charged with implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement. The PIC comprises 55 countries and agencies.\n\nThe Biden administration installed Christian Schmidt through an ad hoc group that lacks any official international jurisdiction over Bosnia or the Dayton Peace Agreement. Russia and China opposed the appointment of Christian Schmidt, so he was appointed by the PIC Steering Board in 2021, but not confirmed by the UN Security Council due to Russian and Chinese opposition.\n\nFor this reason, we consider Christian Schmidt an illegitimate holder of the Office of the High Representative.\n\nUpon his arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt began unilaterally imposing decisions and altering the country\u2019s laws. The Muslim side welcomed these actions, believing they would pave the way for a unitary Bosnia, ultimately undermining the existence of the Orthodox Christian entity, the Republic of Srpska.\n\nAs the president of the Republic of Srpska, I refused to comply with Schmidt\u2019s unconstitutional and colonial imposition of changes to existing laws. That is my so-called \"original sin.\" I firmly believe that no foreigner should have the authority to unilaterally impose and alter a country\u2019s law at their discretion.\n\nThat is why I was found guilty of defying the authority of Bosnia\u2019s UN High Representative, Christian Schmidt. A few weeks ago, I was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office for six years.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the court\u2019s decision?\n\nThe court that sentenced me was biased, predominantly composed of Bosnian Muslims, as was the prosecutor\u2019s office that formally initiated the case against me. This verdict is politically motivated, aimed at removing me from political and public life.\n\nThe deep state attempted a similar tactic against President Trump in an effort to prevent his re-election. Fortunately, they did not succeed.\n\nConsidering everything you\u2019ve just told me, I have to ask\u2014do you believe Bosnia and Herzegovina is a failed state?\n\nSince the Dayton Peace Agreement ended the civil war in Bosnia in 1995, Democratic administrations have consistently worked to undermine it. Over the past 30 years, the Bosnian project has proven to be largely unsuccessful, as the country remains deeply divided along ethnic lines. The people of Bosnia\u2014Bosniak Muslims, Catholic Croats, and Orthodox Serbs\u2014do not wish to live in the same country.\n\nThese factors render Bosnia a non-functional nation-state and are the primary reason so many people are leaving for other countries. Bosnia is unable to meet the basic needs of its citizens, including fostering economic growth. This is why I believe Bosnia is a failed state in the heart of Europe.\n\nThe only thing that has not failed in Bosnia is international interventionism, driven by President Biden\u2019s administration and supported by other neoconservative officials in Washington, D.C., who continue to hold the country together.\n\nDuring her first presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton claimed she had come under sniper fire during a trip to Bosnia as first lady. However, she visited the country in March 1996, after the war had ended. This incident offers a revealing glimpse into how the Democratic Party\u2019s elites perceive Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSince 1992, the United States has invested over $2 billion in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Where has all that money gone?\n\nUntil recently, we knew very little about these funds. The new administration revealed that over the past four years, Bosnia received $402 million through USAID programs. However, Bosnia\u2019s financial regulatory agencies have confirmed receiving only $150 million during the same period. The fate of the remaining $250 million remains unclear.\n\nI am asking: Where did a quarter of a billion dollars go? What was it spent on? Why were American taxpayers required to fund Bosnia\u2019s nation-building process, including sponsoring the Office of the High Representative of the United Nations?\n\nI agree with officials from President Trump\u2019s administration who have stated that USAID operates as a criminal organization. While there is no doubt that some of the funds have supported beneficial projects for our communities, the majority of USAID grant money has been used to finance the nation-building process and other corrupt activities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on former U.S. federal prosecutor Martin De Luca\u2019s visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the initiation of an investigation into USAID misappropriations in the country?\n\nIt\u2019s very encouraging. I believe that any further investigation into USAID\u2019s activities and finances related to Bosnia will uncover deep-rooted corruption. I am also aware that a USAID official owned two consulting firms registered at the same address in Washington, D.C., even using the same telephone number.\n\nThrough these entities, he managed USAID grants for Bosnia, particularly in the judicial sector, where he worked to install liberal judges aligned with President Biden\u2019s agenda. I know for a fact that he awarded one of his firms a USAID grant of $11 million to oversee Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s judicial branch.\n\nI am willing to collaborate with President Trump\u2019s administration and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency in any future investigation into USAID corruption and misappropriation in Bosnia.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, it appears that Democratic administrations\u2014from President Clinton to President Biden\u2014have actively worked to shape the Bosnian nation, often at the expense of Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs. Is there any truth to this claim?\n\nAbsolutely. I\u2019ve been in politics for over 30 years and have witnessed this process many times. It is clear that Bosnia has a Christian majority. However, Democratic administrations\u2014including Clinton, Obama, and most recently Biden\u2014have consistently worked to place both Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs under the political and legal authority of a Muslim minority.\n\nThis is a deeply emotional issue for us. During and after the war, 150,000 Orthodox Serbs were forced to flee their homes, leaving their property behind after Muslims took control of Sarajevo. More than two decades later, President Biden\u2019s administration pressured Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs to accept Sarajevo as the nation\u2019s capital. As part of this effort, they centralized the entire judicial branch\u2014aligned with their agenda\u2014in Sarajevo.\n\nI am not the only person to face legal prosecution for opposing the nation-building process in Bosnia. Dragan \u010covi\u0107, the representative of Catholic Croats in Bosnia, was also sentenced due to his political activities. Although he was later exonerated, he still had to spend time in jail. This tactic is used to intimidate and discourage those who resist the nation-building agenda, effectively preventing representatives of Croats and Serbs from voicing their concerns about the assimilation of their people into the Muslim majority.\n\nYou\u2019ve shared a lot about the involvement of President Biden\u2019s administration in Bosnia. Could you also say a few words about the role of Biden\u2019s ambassador, Michael J. Murphy, in the judicial process against you?\n\nAmbassador Murphy orchestrated the judicial process against me, directing the illegitimate High Representative, Christian Schmidt, on how to handle my case. Years ago, Murphy served as an assistant to Richard Holbrooke, the key diplomat in the Clinton administration who brokered the 1995 peace agreement in Bosnia. Strongly influenced by Holbrooke\u2019s views on Bosnia, Ambassador Murphy has returned to complete the unfinished business of his former boss.\n\nAs soon as he arrived in Bosnia, Ambassador Murphy began acting against the country\u2019s constitution and the Dayton Peace Agreement. Bosnia\u2019s constitution, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, states that any powers not explicitly designated as federal jurisdiction are reserved for the entities. However, Ambassador Murphy sought to change that.\n\nDuring his tenure as ambassador in Bosnia, he behaved like a colonial ruler, effectively capturing the state by weakening its political institutions and manipulating decision-making to benefit the Biden administration and the Muslim majority. Ambassador Murphy justified his actions by leveraging his close relationship with Secretary Blinken as a shield.\n\nHe is the mastermind behind the judicial witch hunt against me, hoping that the people of the Republic of Srpska would support the court\u2019s ruling. However, Murphy overplayed his hand. According to the latest polls, an overwhelming majority of voters believe the verdict is politically motivated and illegitimate.\n\nFrom what I\u2019m hearing, it seems that President Biden\u2019s administration has deliberately fostered instability in Bosnia. Guided by identity politics favoring the Muslim side, Ambassador Michael J. Murphy has actively opposed a strategic agreement that would have increased U.S. gas imports. Max Primorac, a Senior Research Fellow at the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation and one of the authors of Project 2025, has publicly criticized Ambassador Murphy in a piece for the National Interest. Could you share with our readers what that was all about?\n\nAs an ambassador, Murphy acted like a colonial governor. When meeting with Croat representatives in Bosnia, he insisted that a gas terminal be built on their territory. However, he also told them\u2014and even threatened them\u2014that control and jurisdiction over the terminal must be handed over to Bosnian Muslims. This was an unjust and unfair approach toward Croatia and its people.\n\nWhy do you believe Ambassador Murphy favored the Muslim side in this energy agreement?\n\nI don\u2019t have concrete evidence of this, but there are many rumors about Ambassador Murphy\u2019s financial dealings with Bosnian Muslims. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they turned out to be true.\n\nWhat is the path forward to resolve the political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina? What would be the ideal solution for the Republic of Srpska?\n\nThere are no ideal solutions left. We can\u2019t accept an unconstitutional judicial system designed to prosecute anyone who disagrees with the Muslim side and their vision for the country. We do not seek war or any form of conflict\u2014we stand for peace.\n\nThe leadership of the Republic of Srpska seeks to restore the original interpretation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s constitution. Any issue not explicitly addressed in the constitution should be discussed and resolved through dialogue among representatives of Bosnian Muslims, Catholic Croats, and Orthodox Serbs.\n\nAll three nations must engage in dialogue and work toward a compromise on the pressing issues facing the country. Every group deserves to have its voice heard. However, Bosnia\u2019s diplomatic corps is overwhelmingly dominated by Muslim staffers.\n\nThe voices of Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs are virtually absent in Bosnian embassies abroad, including the one in Washington, D.C. and the Bosnian mission to the United Nations. This is not a sustainable way to govern the country. All sides must come together, engage in dialogue, and work toward an agreement on the country\u2019s future.\n\nPresident Trump is a busy man, dealing with the war in Ukraine, the immigration crisis, and a trade war with China, among other pressing issues. Given this, the crisis in Bosnia is unlikely to be a top priority for him. What interest would the United States have in actively participating in resolving the crisis in Bosnia? And would you be open to cooperating with President Trump\u2019s administration to find a solution?\n\nThe United States has wasted billions of dollars on the nation-building process in Bosnia and has received nothing in return\u2014absolutely nothing.\n\nIn the eastern region of the Republic of Srpska, near the Serbian border, there are substantial deposits of lithium, magnesium, and other rare earth minerals. Some estimates place their commercial value at over $100 billion.\n\nWe are open to discussions on a rare earth mineral deal with President Trump. We are willing to grant access to these mineral deposits to companies selected by his administration. Additionally, there is potential for collaboration with Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, whose government is involved in this investment.\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Srpska, in cooperation with President Trump, is prepared to fast-track the issuance of all necessary mining permits for American companies selected to participate in this rare earth minerals agreement.\n\nSo far, we have not granted mining rights to any country or foreign company. I am willing to discuss this matter exclusively with President Trump, and I believe we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nI assume you listened closely to Vice President Vance\u2019s speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he addressed the suppression of free speech, elections, and the democratic process. Given recent events in Bosnia, his words almost seem as if they were directed specifically at you. How do you interpret his message in the context of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nVice President Vance\u2019s speech at the Munich Security Conference has been an inspiring catalyst for change across Europe. It served as a sharp analytical wake-up call, signaling the need for a new approach. If properly understood, it represents the best offer from the U.S. to European leaders\u2014a call for a stronger, more independent Europe.\n\nWhile I was encouraged by Vice President Vance\u2019s address, I was somewhat surprised by Secretary Rubio\u2019s recent post on X, in which he accused me of undermining Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s institutions and threatening its security and stability.\n\nI want to make it clear that I am not undermining Bosnia\u2019s sovereignty, security, or stability. I support a peaceful and constitutional resolution to the current political crisis in Bosnia.\n\nAs the president of the Republic of Srpska, I strongly align with Vice President Vance\u2019s remarks in Munich and intend to act accordingly. His speech delivered a fresh and important message from Washington\u2014one that should not be diluted by conflicting statements from other U.S. officials, even if they come from Secretary Rubio.\n\nJust a few hours ago, Calin Georgescu was barred from the Romanian presidential election re-run. Do you see any parallels between the situations in Bosnia and Romania?\n\nI see clear parallels and still can\u2019t believe something like this has happened. Georgescu won the first round of the presidential election, only for it to be canceled after his victory. Now, he has been banned once again from participating in the new election out of fear that he might win. It\u2019s surreal. I am certain that the United States and its leadership do not support a world where such things are possible.\n\nI firmly believe we are witnessing the emergence of an anti-Trump bloc among European leaders. There are striking similarities between what is happening to Calin Georgescu and my own situation. Both cases appear to be orchestrated by German political and intelligence structures seeking to establish Germany as the dominant force in Europe.\n\nPresident Trump is not a strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and has also been critical of the European Union. Recently, the official X profile of the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina posted a statement criticizing your recent actions while expressing support for Bosnia\u2019s integration into the EU and NATO.\n\nAs someone who closely follows American politics, I can confidently say that President Trump is unlikely to prioritize Bosnia\u2019s membership in either organization. How do you interpret the apparent differences between President Trump\u2019s stance and the messaging from the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nThat is surprising to me. I believe these mixed messages, which contradict President Trump\u2019s America First agenda, originate from deep state bureaucrats and officials. The Biden administration has hired numerous Muslim staffers to work at the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo. In fact, over 90 percent of the embassy's staff, including its director of communications, are local Muslims.\n\nThe statements made by the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo and Secretary Rubio were unfair to Orthodox Serbs. Moreover, both were inconsistent with President Trump\u2019s America First policy.\n\nSecretary Rubio\u2019s post on X was one-sided, showing support exclusively for the Muslim side. I am not criticizing him; rather, I am inviting him to engage in dialogue. I want him to hear all three perspectives, not just that of the Bosnian Muslims, who seek to impose their rule on the country\u2019s Christian majority.\n\nWe have never advocated for war, nor have we taken any actions to provoke conflict. We stand for peace. Unfortunately, we continuously hear warmongering rhetoric from Muslim representatives. Some Bosnian Muslims have even called for NATO intervention against us.\n\nWhat message would you like to convey to President Trump and Vice President Vance?\n\nI am calling on them to help us and to prevent any form of NATO intervention in Bosnia. We do not want war\u2014we want peace. We seek to fight for our human rights through democratic means. Our goal is to restore the original interpretation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Help us overturn all illegitimate and undemocratic decisions imposed on us by President Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President Vance can play a pivotal role in ensuring the Dayton Peace Agreement is honored. If an agreement with Bosnian Muslims cannot be reached, there is no reason why all three nations\u2014Croats, Muslims, and Serbs\u2014cannot begin a dialogue about a peaceful, non-violent dissolution of Bosnia. I am ready and eager to engage with the new administration in discussions on all the challenges facing Bosnia and its future."

US District Judge Adam Abelson\u2019s February ruling said that the government could not freeze or cancel \u201cequity-related\u201d contracts, nor could it require recipients of grants to certify that their programs do not promote DEI. He also barred the administration from bringing False Claims Act enforcement action related to the anti-DEI certification requirement.\n\nThe 4th Circuit said it would be considering the merits of Abelson\u2019s ruling on an expedited timeline.\n\nChief Judge Albert Diaz, an Obama appointee, wrote a concurring opinion praising efforts to promote diversity, and he said \u201cthere should be room for open discussion and principled debate about DEI programs.\u201d However, he echoed a concurrence by a fellow member of the appellate panel, Judge Pamela Harris, by raising the possibility of constitutional violations depending on how agencies carry out Trump\u2019s orders. The concurring opinion from Harris, an Obama appointee as well, pointed out that some of Trump\u2019s directives appeared to be limited in scope as their language took aim specifically at \u201cconduct that violates existing federal anti-discrimination law.\u201d\n\nThe third member of the panel, Trump-appointed Judge Allison Rushing, stressed the panel\u2019s conclusions that the president\u2019s orders likely did not violate the Constitution, and she took a swipe at Diaz for praising diversity programs.\n\nThe case was brought by the city of Baltimore, two education associations and a restaurant association, who alleged various constitutional violations with the orders.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

Trump, instead, embraced the notion of the agency as his own personal tool of vengeance.\n\n\u201cAs the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,\u201d Trump told the audience, with Attorney General Pam Bondi (who is technically the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer) and FBI Director Kash Patel in the audience.\n\nOne of Trump's favorite campaign songs, \u201cYMCA,\u201d played after he wrapped up his nearly hourlong address inside the department's ceremonial Great Hall.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what Trump said, what the reality is and the significance of his words.\n\n\u201cThe same scum you have been dealing with for years. Guys like Andrew Weissman, deranged Jack Smith. There\u2019s a guy named Norm Eisen, I don\u2019t even know what he looks like. His name is Norm Eisen of CREW; he\u2019s been after me for nine years.\u201d\n\nTrump named lawyers and a legal nonprofit that he has tangled with over the years, which could serve as a roadmap for people he would like prosecuted by the officials in the room with him.\n\nTrump named lawyer Eisen, but misidentified him as running the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued to block Trump from running for reelection due to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Eisen was with the organization during part of Trump\u2019s first term but has since left.\n\nTrump rained vitriol on CREW as well as Eisen, who remains staunchly opposed to Trump and co-founded an online publication, The Contrarian, to take on the new administration. Still, Trump claimed Eisen has been \u201cviolent,\u201d which is laughable. He\u2019s a lawyer who\u2019s never used physical force toward Trump.\n\nWeissman was lead prosecutor for the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia during Trump\u2019s first term. One of the people Weissman convicted in that probe, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, watched the speech and was warmly introduced by Trump himself.\n\nTrump also name-checked Smith, who was the special prosecutor who filed charges against Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and for hoarding classified documents at his Florida resort.\n\nNotably, the president didn\u2019t name a single possible crime these lawyers or CREW committed other than opposing him.\n\n\u201cI believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they are really corrupt and they are illegal. What they do is illegal.\u201d\n\nThis was a remarkable moment \u2014 the president of the United States telling his Department of Justice that he believes the media are illegal because they write bad things about him.\n\nNeedless to say, CNN and MSNBC (which Trump tweaked by changing its initials) are not actually part of the Democratic Party. No matter if you think their coverage leans in that direction, there\u2019s no actual, legal connection.\n\nEven if there was, the First Amendment allows political groups to criticize a rival politician. It certainly allows the media to do so, regardless of any perceived ideological bias.\n\n\"What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.\u201d\n\nThis is one of Trump's favorite subjects \u2014 how he didn't really lose the 2020 election. He did, though.\n\nTrump has claimed falsely that widespread fraud cost him the 2020 election, but the evidence says otherwise. Trump lost dozens of court challenges, including some before judges he appointed, his own attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have tipped the election, and reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump contested his loss all affirmed Biden\u2019s win.\n\nIt's unclear who \u201cthe people who did this\u201d are in Trump's threat, but when a president says someone should go to jail while addressing the Department of Justice \u2014 especially about something that never happened \u2014 that's significant.\n\n\u201cI pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been grossly mistreated. We removed the senior FBI officials who misdirected resources to send SWAT teams after grandmothers and J6 hostages. And it was a great honor for me, a great honor to fire James Comey.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed he'd end what he called \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Department of Justice, but then quickly boasted of pardoning those who attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election loss on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump also boasted of firing Comey, who was the FBI director in his first term. It was one of Trump's most controversial acts then, but seems almost quaint now. The man whom Trump nominated to replace Comey, Christopher Wray, stepped aside in December after years of being targeted by Trump, who has now replaced him with Patel, a loyalist who never worked in the bureau.\n\nThe president boasting of firing top FBI officials is a clear signal to those inside the Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to scare the hell out of the judges. And they do it. How do you stop it? ... What do you do to get rid of it? You convict Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump has personally singled out judges who ruled against him for attack since he first ran for president in 2016. But, remarkably, Trump implied that the adverse legal decisions against him have been because his opponents are threatening judges.\n\nIn reality, the judge who presided over Trump\u2019s criminal in New York, Juan Merchan, received threats after Trump repeatedly attacked him and his family. Judicial organizations have reported a sharp rise in threats as Trump increasingly complained the legal system was \u201crigged\u201d against him as he fought four separate prosecutions during his campaign.\n\nTrump did accurately note negative coverage that conservative justices on the nation\u2019s highest court have received over some of their rulings and conduct. He has reason to want those justices to be sympathetic to him because several of his administration\u2019s initiatives are tangled up in litigation headed straight to the Supreme Court."
