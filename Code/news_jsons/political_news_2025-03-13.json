Plus, we have a new excerpt from Jonathan Allen\u2019s forthcoming book on the 2024 campaign.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\n\ud83d\udea8Breaking news: Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer relented and said he wouldn\u2019t block a Republican stopgap funding bill, arguing a government shutdown would give \u201cmore power\u201d to Trump. Read more \u2192\n\nTrump's economic troubles put Republicans on defense\n\nBy Jonathan Allen, Carol E. Lee and Sahil Kapur\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s full-speed-ahead approach to making radical change has forced his allies to fight from a defensive posture \u2014 explaining his plans after they have been executed \u2014 and has raised alarms in his Republican Party that it could all end in a wreck.\n\nThe concerns are particularly acute when it comes to the economy, with the stock market slumping and many economists projecting either slower growth or a coming recession. Those fears haven\u2019t deterred Trump from continuing to impose tariffs on foes and friends \u2014 which figure to raise prices on U.S. consumers \u2014 and slash federal government jobs, grants and contracts.\n\n\u201cThere are worries,\u201d said a person who has been involved in discussions about the economy with White House officials. Those effects on the markets and the economy are felt immediately, while policies aimed at spurring growth \u2014 including cutting taxes and regulations \u2014 will take much longer to implement, this person said.\n\nThe dark economic clouds are forcing Trump administration officials to explain why the president\u2019s lofty economic promises on the campaign trail to \u201cend inflation\u201d and \u201cMake America Affordable Again\u201d on Day 1 haven\u2019t come to fruition.\n\n\u201cThis was always part of the plan,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said recently on Fox News. \u201cThe president is so focused on \u2014 not the short term. ... He truly wants to fix America.\u201d\n\nWhat Hill Republicans are saying: Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he thinks Trump has some latitude to pursue trade wars but not at a long-term cost.\n\n\u201cLook, this isn\u2019t the way I would do it,\u201d Rounds said of the White House\u2019s tack. \u201cI think they want to try something different than from the previous administration. But they\u2019ve got to show some success fairly quickly.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Trump\u2019s \u201cdramatic tariffs\u201d on Canada and Mexico \u201ccould be devastating to the economy,\u201d including in his home state.\n\n\u201cThere are stories coming out talking about cars costing $10,000 more. And, of course, we\u2019re worried about bourbon. We want to sell our bourbon. The Canadians are going to block our bourbon,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNow that you add lumber costs to that and steel with tariffs, nobody at home is coming up to me and saying please put tariffs on.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nStock market latest: The S&P 500 fell 1.4% Thursday, making its decline since its February all-time high greater than 10%. It has now fully erased all its post-November election gains and is back to levels last seen in September.\n\nTrade war latest: After the European Union imposed a 50% tariff on American whiskey, Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on alcohol from the E.U.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\n'No daylight, kid': How Joe Biden handcuffed Kamala Harris\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nThe following is adapted from the forthcoming book \u201cFIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House\u201d by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, to be published April 1 by William Morrow. Copyright \u00a9 2025 by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. Reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins Publishers. It is available for pre-order here.\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris both understood the importance of being seen as the bigger change agent.\n\nFor Trump, that meant continuing to promise an antidote to the Joe Biden-Harris years. For Harris, there was more flexibility to define her brand of change. She could risk looking hypocritical by making clean breaks with Biden on policies she had supported as vice president, rejecting parts of their record to forge her own agenda. She could identify new issues to run on that avoided the pitfalls of turning her back on the Biden era. Or she could rely on voters to see her gender, her genes, and her \u201clived experience\u201d \u2014 a middle-class upbringing, schools outside the Ivy League, and a career as a prosecutor \u2014 as symbols of change.\n\nBiden and his loyalists took the first option off the table. He would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win. But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: let there be no daylight between us. \u201cNo daylight\u201d was the phrase he had used as a vice presidential candidate in 2008 to bind Republican nominee John McCain to an unpopular president, George W. Bush.\n\nAlmost everywhere she went, Harris walked among former Biden aides who sought to defend his presidency. Her campaign was run by a former White House deputy chief of staff \u2014 whom she had just empowered to box out her own confidants \u2014 and a phalanx of department heads who had served Biden until the previous month.\n\nThe day before Harris\u2019 first interview, a joint appearance with Tim Walz, she dived into the recurring question of whether and when she would let daylight shine between herself and Biden. Veteran Democratic communications strategist Stephanie Cutter launched into a proposed preamble \u2014 a list of all the items that made Harris proud of her work with Biden.\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d said Sean Clegg, a longtime Harris adviser who was regarded with suspicion by the Biden holdovers running the campaign. \u201cLet\u2019s not do this. Let\u2019s not go down memory lane.\u201d That was the last time he was invited to media prep. Cutter, another Harris confidant later joked, cut him out.\n\nCutter did not have the authority to make out the lineup card for media prep sessions, two senior campaign officials told NBC News on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhen Harris sat down with Walz and CNN\u2019s Dana Bash the last week of August, the segment produced a little bit of news: Harris said she would name a Republican to serve in her Cabinet. She also said that she no longer supported a ban on fracking.\n\nHer 2019 call to end the practice threatened to hurt her in Pennsylvania, even though she had adopted Biden\u2019s no-ban policy as his vice presidential candidate in 2020. But the first portion of the one-on-two interview \u2014 the part more viewers were likely to watch \u2014 featured Harris reciting a laundry list of Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nSitting next to Walz in a chair that seemed to place her below him and heaping praise on Biden\u2019s record, Harris did not look like a candidate seeking the highest office in the land. The whole scene reinforced the criticism that the vice president was either incapable, or afraid, of answering tough questions on her own.\n\nFor the rest of the campaign, her team required that she be provided a chair that met certain specifications: \u201cLeg height no less than 15 inches; floor to top of seat height no less than 18.9 inches; arms on chairs may not be very high, arms must fall at a natural height; chairs must be firm.\u201d\n\nNo matter how firm her chair, the question facing Harris was whether she could build a sturdy platform.\n\nHer rallies and convention speech had not answered the question of why she was running for president \u2014 or how her vision for the country would deliver for voters \u2014 other than having been next in line. She was running out of major moments to explain a vision to a broad audience. Her Sept. 10 debate with Trump would offer another opportunity \u2014 perhaps a last chance before voters cast early ballots \u2014 to establish that key part of her narrative.\n\nBut the day of the debate Biden called to give Harris an unusual kind of pep talk \u2014 and another reminder about the loyalty he demanded. No longer able to defend his own record, he expected Harris to protect his legacy. Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him \u2014 especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans. To the extent that she wanted to forge her own path, Biden had no interest in giving her room to do so. He needed just three words to convey how much all of that mattered to him.\n\n\u201cNo daylight, kid,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83c\udfc3 High, high hopes for higher office?

Former President Joe Biden also used the term \"oligarchy\" in his farewell address to the nation.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden told Americans on Jan. 13.\n\nTwo weeks after Tillis' office received the letter, Indivisible Guilford County, a local arm of a progressive political action group, organized a protest at Tillis\u2019 Greensboro office. While the protest's press release encouraged peaceful signs and \"solidarity,\" Keylin said the protesters attempted to break into Tillis' office.\n\n\"They angrily yanked and attempted to open the office\u2019s locked door, yelling at Tillis\u2019 staff to open it: \u2018Come back, we see you! Open the door!\u2019 and reminding the staff they had no way to exit their office,\" Keylin said in the memo.\n\nKeylin said Tillis' office received several media inquiries questioning if Tillis would attend the protests or town halls planned in Republican-held districts. Outlining years of targeted threats that have only escalated since Trump returned to office, Keylin said, \"I imagine anyone with a modicum of sanity would understand what a silly question that is.\"\n\nThe memo says that \"out of an abundance of caution,\" law enforcement has directed the senator's office to work from home on the days protests are planned.\n\n\"We will not make any apologies for prioritizing the safety and security of our staff,\" Keylin said.\n\nThe memo outlines two more instances in which the North Carolina senator was subject to death threats.\n\n\"Senator Tillis, his staff, and even his family have long been subject to threats, harassment, attempted intimidation, and verbal abuse from unstable individuals who don\u2019t agree with his political view,\" Keylin said.\n\nA U.S. citizen living abroad was arrested for threatening to kill Tillis and cut off the hands of his staffers in 2023, and a Minnesota man was indicted in 2022 for threatening to kill Tillis, the memo confirmed.\n\nProtests have shut down town halls and disrupted local legislative offices in the past two months, and Republicans have opted for tele-town halls instead of in-person town halls as a result. Democrats have accused Republicans of ignoring their constituents' concerns by avoiding in-person town halls.\n\nGov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., will host town halls on Friday in Republican-held congressional districts in Iowa and Nebraska \"to lend a megaphone to the people.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has reportedly started planning her own rallies in Republican-held congressional districts as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMoveOn.org, which has accepted millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Policy Center, announced in a press release last month that it was mobilizing resources as part of a \"Congress Works for Us, Not Musk\" initiative \"aimed at pressuring lawmakers to fight back against the Trump-Musk agenda.\" The group planned protests at congressional-led town halls and congressional offices.\n\nFox News Digital's Julia Johnson and Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Hong Kong/Taipei CNN \u2014\n\nIt was a surprise ceremony at the White House presided over by President Donald Trump to unveil a $100 billion investment from what he called the world\u2019s most powerful company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\n\nBut nearly 8,000 miles away, the mood was far from celebratory. Instead, the shock announcement last week has reignited fears in Taiwan about losing its crown jewel, its world-beating semiconductor industry, to the US due to political pressure.\n\nThe island democracy\u2019s former President Ma Ying-jeou wasted no time in accusing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of \u201cselling TSMC\u201d to Trump as a \u201cprotection fee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a major national security crisis,\u201d Ma, a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), wrote on his Facebook page on March 4, shortly after the White House signing ceremony. It will \u201c\u2019have a significant negative impact on people\u2019s confidence, cross-strait relations and Taiwan\u2019s future geopolitical position.\u201d\n\nTo reassure the public, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te appeared alongside TSMC CEO CC Wei last week at Taipei\u2019s presidential office, saying the company\u2019s US investment would not undermine its commitment to and planned expansion in its home base.\n\nTSMC produces more than 90% of the world\u2019s advanced microchips, which power everything from smartphones and artificial intelligence to weapons. That\u2019s why many in Taiwan believe that global dependence on its semiconductors serves as a \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a deterrent against a potential Chinese invasion.\n\nChina\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory despite having never controlled it and has vowed to take control of the self-governing island, by force if necessary. Beijing has in recent years escalated its military activities around Taiwan, regularly flying fighter jets and conducting exercises in waters near the island.\n\nA screen in Beijing shows news footage of military drills conducted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army around Taiwan on October 14, 2024. Tingshu Wang/Reuters\n\n\u2018Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow\u2019\n\nTaiwan relies on US military and political support. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the US is legally obligated to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against a possible attack by China.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric has cast uncertainty over the future of US-Taiwan relations. He has repeatedly accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the US semiconductor industry, a claim that is widely disputed, while saying outright that Taiwan should pay the US for \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nFor many on the self-governing island, the phrase \u201cUkraine today, Taiwan tomorrow\u201d has increasingly resonated in recent weeks as they watch Trump upend longstanding US policy by playing up Kremlin rhetoric and warming to Moscow, while alienating traditional European allies and Kyiv. Taiwanese see parallels between their democracy and Ukraine, with both facing existential threats from aggressive, expansionist neighbors.\n\nWashington earlier this month abruptly suspended military aid to Ukraine following a heated exchange between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, just hours after the cheerful TSMC ceremony. It reinstated aid this week after Ukraine accepted a 30-day US-proposed ceasefire. The White House has also pressed Zelensky to sign a deal giving the US access to Kyiv\u2019s untapped mineral riches.\n\nTammy Chao, a retiree, expressed deep concern to CNN about Taiwan\u2019s security after TSMC\u2019s announcement, likening Trump\u2019s approach to his handling of Ukraine. She described him as a \u201cdealer\u201d who might eventually treat Taiwan as a bargaining chip.\n\n\u201cTaiwan, pretty soon just like [what] he said to Zelensky, \u2018you have no cards to play,\u2019 and Taiwan is not gonna have cards to play,\u201d she said. \u201cTSMC was the best card.\u201d\n\nBut others appear less concerned. Fred Lin, a finance industry professional, said he believed TSMC came to this decision prudently.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t pay protection fees to the US? No doubt It is a form of protection fee, that we can understand, but that\u2019s the reality of international politics,\u201d he said.\n\nTSMC headquarters in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2024 I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump administration officials, however, have also said they need to dial down involvement in European security to focus on Asia \u2013 and the threat from China. Prior to his election, Vance was explicit in his concerns that US support for Ukraine could hinder its ability to aid Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nResearchers say there are limits to comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan\u2019s security circumstances and believe the island\u2019s security is influenced by multiple factors beyond its semiconductor industry, including China\u2019s broader geopolitical ambition and Taiwan\u2019s strategic location.\n\nWhether China takes military action against Taiwan is ultimately driven by its core interests, which are not solely dependent on the island\u2019s role in global chip production, said Min-yen Chiang, a nonresident fellow at the Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology, a government-funded think tank in Taipei.\n\nHe referenced the time in 1950 when the US sent its Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait early on during the Korean War to deter China from invading Taiwan. The strategic move by then-President Harry Truman neutralized the Taiwan Strait and ensured the Korean War did not trigger a wider conflict, maintaining stability in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\u201cTaiwan then had no semiconductor industry at all,\u201d he said.\n\nStill committed\n\nLast week, President Lai said Taipei did not \u201cface any pressure from Washington\u201d in doing the TSMC deal, which the company said was the biggest such investment in the US ever made by a non-American firm.\n\nStanding next to him, Wei attributed the increased investment to \u201cstrong demand\u201d from American customers such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and Broadcom that wanted to reduce potential supply chain risks by having chips made locally.\n\nHe also added that TSMC was \u201cnot afraid\u201d of Trump potentially scrapping the subsidies from the Chips Act, stressing that the company\u2019s decision to invest in the US was driven by customer needs.\n\nTSMC was awarded $6.5 billion in grants for its first three plants in Arizona under the bipartisan Chips Act, spearheaded by the Biden administration, which allocated $39 billion in federal funding to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe are the best wherever we build our fabs,\u201d Wei added, referring to semiconductor fabrication plants.\n\nAlong with the additional three manufacturing facilities, the new investment also promised two chip packaging plants and a research and development center to improve the production process technology.\n\nWei clarified that the development of the cutting-edge next generation chipmaking technology would remain in Taiwan and would still be 10 times bigger than the US facilities.\n\nSemiconductor analysts applauded the company for making an \u201cagile\u201d decision.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo praised TSMC in an online analysis, calling it the \u201cmost successful non-US company in negotiations with the Trump administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the $100 billion investment seems massive, the lack of details provides the flexibility for spending based on future conditions, softening the impact on profitability,\u201d Kuo wrote.\n\nTSMC\u2019s investment has mostly alleviated Trump\u2019s concerns, according to Eric Chen, an analyst at Digitimes Research, a market research firm. \u201cBut of course, we have no way of knowing when Trump might change his stance \u2014 he\u2019s notorious for making sudden U-turns,\u201d he said.\n\nAn electronic wafer is displayed at the TSMC Museum of Innovation in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2024. I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWeaponizing tariffs\n\nTSMC\u2019s $100 billion investment marks the latest in a wave of businesses committing massive sums to the US. But it stands out as one of the first major foreign firms to do so, and Trump claims more such investments are on the way.\n\nIn contrast to his predecessor Biden\u2019s approach of incentivizing domestic investment through subsidies, Trump prefers to weaponize tariffs. So far, it has proven effective.\n\nTrump has previously threatened to impose 25% tariffs on semiconductors, along with automobiles and pharmaceuticals as early as next month. At the announcement of TSMC\u2019s investment, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the company chose to expand in the US due to the threat of tariffs, and were not given additional grants.\n\nIn late February, Apple pledged $500 billion to expand facilities, manufacturing and projects across the US over the next four years. Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank announced in January that they would invest $500 billion to create a new company that would build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.\n\nWith TSMC\u2019s new investment in the US, Trump is expected to turn up the heat on other major companies, said Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business.\n\nHe said it puts added pressure on Samsung and Intel, the two other major producers of computing and AI chips in the world.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s SK Hynix, another key player in memory chips along with Samsung, are also expected to feel the squeeze. Samsung has previously pledged to invest $37 billion in Texas, while SK Hynix announced plans to build a $3.87 billion chip packaging plant in Indiana last year. Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment.\n\nHsieh said it is obvious that companies like TSMC and others will have to \u201cdo whatever they can to make Trump happy.\u201d But he also warned of the risks associated with such concessions.\n\n\u201cOnce you agree to blackmail, then there\u2019s no end of it,\u201d he said."

            "full_content": "OMB\u2019s Russell Vought is firing federal employees with one hand and impounding the funds to pay them with another. Photo: Tom Brenner/The New York Times/Redux\n\nWith a government shutdown set to begin at midnight on Friday, all eyes are on the U.S. Senate right now. But it\u2019s important to understand that the federal government is being progressively shut down by the Trump administration through means other than denying appropriations. Thursday is a big deadline for federal agencies, which will determine how bad the next wave of cuts will bite, as USA Today reports:\n\nThursday is the deadline for federal agencies and departments to give the Trump administration their plans for large-scale layoffs, and the details about how many people will be fired are expected to come out throughout and coming weeks \u2026\n\nIt remains unclear how many of the roughly 2 million federal employees spread across the country could lose their jobs under the new layoff plans, called a \u201creduction in force\u201d or RIF. The memo ordering agencies to produce the reduction in force plans called for \u201ca significant reduction.\u201d Agencies can whittle personnel through layoffs, attrition, removal of underperforming employees, or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements.\n\nAn early estimate when Trump initiated the RIF process last month was that up to 700,000 federal employees could lose their jobs. It\u2019s no accident that this is the number of employees that would likely be furloughed if there was a government shutdown; determining who is not an \u201cessential employee\u201d (a very technical term that has nothing to do with the quality of work someone does) is one of the key criteria agencies are being told to use in identifying RIF victims. So in a way, the RIF is operates like a government shutdown in terms of the services lost, though worse in one way: In the past, furloughed employees received back pay once a shutdown ended.\n\nOne significant aspect of the RIF process is that it\u2019s a joint project of Russell Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (which earlier sought to impose a funding freeze on much of the federal government) and the Office of Personal Management. OPM has served as Elon Musk\u2019s beachhead in the federal government and has been the staging area for most DOGE cuts. While DOGE\u2019s formal involvement in the RIF process is unclear, some of the deep cuts it has already imposed on agencies appear to be a sort of doubling down on RIF. As Politico explains, the RIFs will roll out in two stages:\n\nThe strategies due Thursday will identify agency offices that provide \u201cdirect service to citizens,\u201d explain which parts of agencies are required by law and explain whether \u201cthe agency or any of its subcomponents should be eliminated or consolidated,\u201d according to guidance provided to agency bosses.\n\nAgency leaders were also directed to describe the tools they intend to use to \u201cachieve efficiencies,\u201d including through expected staff reductions in coming years.\n\nIn the \u201cPhase 2\u201d plans due by April 14, agency bosses were directed to expand on their plans for overhauling their operations. That plan is set to include any proposals to relocate agency offices from Washington to other parts of the country, targets for \u201csubsequent large-scale RIFs,\u201d and agencies\u2019 plans to renegotiate provisions of collective bargaining agreements deemed to \u201cinhibit government efficiency and cost-savings.\u201d\n\nIs this legal? That\u2019s debatable. In the past, much smaller RIFs have occasionally been deployed to bring agency staffing into line with congressionally determined policy changes or specific efficiency measures. In the most famous recent RIF, during the Clinton administration, the process was approved by Congress and coordinated with public employee unions; it was rolled out over years, not weeks, and only after a sustained analysis flowing from a National Performance Review. Its size and speed was nothing like what Team Trump is undertaking. There will be litigation, for sure, when the RIF really get rolling and people lose jobs. But it\u2019s part of what now looks to be a multipronged effort to hammer the federal government: If one avenue is blocked, another is opened.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, on the same day as the RIF deadline, Fox News reported that Vought\u2019s long-cherished dream of simply impounding (i.e., refusing to spend) congressional appropriated spending is close to being realized:\n\nThe White House has already started mapping out how to make good on its promise to slash federal spending in preparation for a six-month government funding bill to pass through Congress.\n\nTwo people familiar with the conversations told Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought are working on a strategy for impounding federal funds that Congress is expected to allocate this week, before the partial government shutdown deadline on March 14.\n\nTrump and his allies have made no secret of their belief that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is unconstitutionally constraining the powers of the president. But the new development is a significant step toward a likely legal showdown as Democrats warn they will respond if Trump tries to bypass Congress on federal spending.\n\nThis power grab will definitely be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has upheld congressional limits on impoundment in the past.\n\nBut in any event, think about this: Team Trump isn\u2019t even waiting for the funds to be appropriated by Congress before plotting to cancel them. It certainly makes congressional Republicans look like disingenuous stooges in voting for a spending bill written in disappearing ink, and it reinforces the impression that no matter what Congress does or doesn\u2019t do, the government is in a state of perpetual shutdown."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nOne of the trends that Donald Trump and his supporters wanted to reverse with his big speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 was a steady erosion of his job-approval ratings in the polls from the mildly positive \u201choneymoon\u201d levels he registered just after returning to the White House.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. And there\u2019s increasing evidence concerns about the economy and reaction to Elon Musk\u2019s assault on federal services and employees are beginning to take a toll on the new administration\u2019s base of support. On Thursday, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, having lost more than 10 percent of its value in three weeks.\n\nSilver Bulletin\u2019s comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of the polls show Trump\u2019s approval-rating averages now clearly underwater at 47.3 percent positive and 49.0 percent negative. RealClearPolitics, which produces simple arithmetical averages from a database that includes several dubious pro-Trump pollsters, shows his net job-approval averages dropping from 1.2 percent on March 4 to minus-0.7 percent on March 13.\n\nBeyond the overall numbers, the most recent polls show that worries about the economy continue to hound the 47th president. Here\u2019s how Emerson College explained the trends:\n\nAs President Trump reaches his first 50 days in office, his approval rating has declined from 49%-41% to 47%-45%, reflecting a nation deeply divided \u2026 Voters are most supportive of Trump\u2019s immigration policy, but they disapprove of his handling of the economy, believe tariffs will hurt economic growth, and are skeptical of his cryptocurrency policy.\n\nA number of polls before the speech suggested that even Trump supporters thought he was inadequately focused on inflation and prices, which could mean deeper trouble for him if his current wave of tariffs and trade-war threats produce higher retail prices, as most economists expect. The most recent plunge in stock prices may produce additional jitters as predictions of a possible recession return to news reports.\n\nA March 13 Quinnipiac survey shows that concerns over the economy are actually more intense than they were at the end of the Biden administration. The percentage of voters describing the economy as either \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d has increased from 64 percent in December to 76 percent now.\n\nWhere is Trump losing ground among the electorate? Polls differ, but the latest, the above-mentioned Emerson poll, showed Latinos disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance by a 51.6 to 35.2 percent margin. Another post-speech poll from TIPP Insights shows self-identified moderates disapproving of the job Trump\u2019s doing by a 54 to 33 percent margin. It appears that the less MAGA-oriented elements of the electorate where Trump made important gains last November may be proving soft spots in his coalition, which isn\u2019t surprising since he\u2019s now responsible for a status quo with which a lot of Americans are chronically unhappy. The chaos in his administration probably isn\u2019t helping. As Axios reports, the occasional pollsters who ask about Elon Musk and DOGE are sensing some negative vibes:\n\nIn a Feb. 13-18 Washington Post-Ipsos poll, a net 34% of respondents said they approved of how Musk was handling his job, compared to 49% disapproving and 14% not sure.\n\nThe poll displayed a stark divide based on party ID, with just 6% of Democrats approving of how Musk has handled his job compared to 70% of Republicans. But when asked if they approved of Musk shutting down federal government programs he deemed unnecessary, a smaller slice of Republicans (56%) gave their blessing, while 25% said they weren\u2019t sure and 18% disapproved \u2026\n\nOver half of respondents (55%) in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted Feb. 13 to 17 said Musk has too much power in making decisions affecting the U.S., while 36% think he has about the right amount of power.\n\nA Pew survey of U.S. adults taken Jan. 27 to Feb. 2 showed that Americans had more negative (54%) than positive (42%) views of Musk (DOGE\u2019s dissection of the federal government has dramatically escalated since the poll was conducted).\n\nThe more recent Quinnipiac poll shows self-identified independents disapproving of Musk and DOGE by a 68 to 28 percent margin.\n\nIf alarm over arbitrary federal budget cuts and employee layoffs coincides with troublesome economic news, Trump may soon find himself back in the more decisively negative public-opinion territory he has inhabited for much of his political career."

            "full_content": "When Republicans are looking for a political bogeyman, they point to liberal megadonor George Soros\n\nTwo billionaires that are villains of the left and right take the spotlight in a key Wisconsin race\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- When Republicans are looking for a political bogeyman, they point to liberal megadonor George Soros. Democrats recently have been answering with a villain of their own: the world's wealthiest man and close adviser to President Donald Trump, Elon Musk.\n\nNow, the billionaires' influence on politics is colliding in a spring election that will decide whether conservatives or liberals control the supreme court in an important presidential battleground state. Both Musk and Soros have spent large sums on the race for an open seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, making them easy targets in a debate between the two candidates Wednesday.\n\nWhile the race is officially nonpartisan, Democrats and Republicans have lined up behind each candidate. Former state Attorney General Brad Schimel, who is backed by Republicans, called Soros a \u201cdangerous person to have an endorsement from.\u201d The philanthropist has spent $1 million to benefit his opponent, Democratic-supported Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford.\n\nShe fired back by saying Musk \u201chas basically taken over Brad Schimel\u2019s campaign.\u201d The Tesla and SpaceX CEO who is running Trump's massive federal cost-cutting initiative has funded two groups that have together spent more than $10 million to promote Schimel.\n\nThe exchange highlighted how the April 1 election, which will affect looming cases on abortion, voting rules, congressional district boundaries and more, has drawn national scrutiny in a year when there are just a handful of consequential elections. It also showed how the two polarizing billionaires are playing an outsized role in the race, as each side seeks to weigh down the other with political baggage.\n\nThose tactics make sense in an off-year, spring election when voters may not know the candidates or be paying much attention, said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to tie it to national themes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall strategy is, how can you scare your base into making sure they show up at the polls?\u201d\n\nSoros has been reviled by conservatives for years for his donations to liberal prosecutors and other left-wing and anti-authoritarian causes. Musk, a newer power player in political giving, has angered liberals because of his role in Trump\u2019s campaign last year \u2014 his super PAC spent about $200 million to help get Trump elected \u2014 and his efforts to slash federal government services and staff through the new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe 94-year-old Hungarian American and Jewish billionaire has been a conservative target for decades.\n\nCore to their ire is the spending he and affiliated groups have done to elect liberal prosecutors \u2014 officials that Republicans argue are too soft on crime. GOP lawmakers have called attention to Soros\u2019 donations in efforts to recall those prosecutors, saying the people he supports have put communities at risk.\n\nTrump also has used Soros to tarnish the credibility of people and groups he doesn\u2019t like. In a recent executive order aiming to punish the law firm Perkins Coie, he said the firm \u201chas worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws.\u201d\n\nAttacks on Soros often veer into antisemitic and conspiratorial territory, with some falsely casting him as backing violent protesters or having secretive family ties.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2014 an ally of Trump \u2014 has boosted that trope by promoting the belief that Soros is engaged in covert plots to destabilize Hungary. Pressure from the autocratic leader prompted a university Soros founded to move its programs from Budapest to Vienna in 2018.\n\nAhead of the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Soros gave $1 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party. He made a donation in the same amount ahead of this year\u2019s race, prompting Schimel and his supporters to invoke Soros in campaign messaging and ads.\n\n\u201cSusan Crawford takes her marching orders from George Soros, (Illinois Gov.) JB Pritzker, anti-ICE sheriffs, and Defund the Police radicals,\u201d Schimel's campaign wrote on X earlier this month. \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d\n\nMusk hurtled onto the political scene in the last couple of years, spending big money to secure Republican control of the federal government and in states where he has businesses.\n\nLast year, he spent nearly $300 million on Republican campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The bulk of that was to boost Trump, but a super PAC he founded also spent millions on U.S. House races.\n\nMusk also has dabbled in state politics in Texas, where he has moved several of his businesses. He became involved in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race shortly after Tesla sued the state in a dispute over a law barring automakers from operating or controlling vehicle dealerships. The case ultimately could end up before the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe curious timing, his unabashed support for Trump and his chaotic moves in the federal government, make Musk a dream target for the left, said Wisconsin Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki, who is not involved in the race.\n\n\u201cHaving a villain makes everything easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cue to the partisans \u2013 it\u2019s a clarion call. Crawford is with us, and Schimel is in the pocket of Elon Musk, the most unpopular person in America right now who can\u2019t get off the front page.\u201d\n\nCrawford has leaned into the attacks, referring to Musk as \u201cElon Schimel\u201d in the debate. She also reminded voters of Musk\u2019s actions at DOGE, such as recommending the firing of government workers helping to fight the avian flu outbreak.\n\nThe race, which is seen as a litmus test of how a battleground state\u2019s voters are responding to the first months of the Trump presidency, also might offer clues into how they view Musk\u2019s role in the administration.\n\nA challenge both candidates face is that as they attack each other for being supported by notorious high-dollar donors, they must rationalize having their own wealthy benefactors.\n\nCrawford needs to associate Schimel with Trump as much as possible to win, said Brandon Scholz, a former Republican strategist in Wisconsin who now identifies as an independent. The Musk donations help with that \u2013 as do flyers distributed to voters by Musk\u2019s America PAC that say Schimel will \u201c support President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nThere could soon be more opportunities to show those ties: A Monday town hall billed as a get-out-the-vote effort for Schimel will be co-hosted by one of Trump\u2019s sons, Donald Trump Jr., and political activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nSchimel, meanwhile, needs diehard Trump voters to come out to the polls, said Scholz. It's a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\" he said, because it means the candidate will have to gamble with turning off some voters.\n\nSoros also has less name recognition than Musk right now, Scholz said. That could be one reason why Schimel has relied more in recent weeks on traditional conservative messaging, such as accusing his opponent of letting criminals off with lenient sentences.\n\nDuring the debate, he said he has no control over outside donations or the messages they spread. He also said he wouldn\u2019t give Trump or Musk special treatment if he\u2019s elected to the court. Instead, Schimel said, he treats the courtroom like a baseball umpire would \u2014 \u201cnot rooting for any team.\u201d\n\nCrawford also distanced herself from Soros\u2019 donation by noting it was made to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, which has endorsed her.

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 School was out on Thursday, so D.C. parents decided it was time for a field trip to Capitol Hill.\n\nThere, they lobbied against Congress' temporary government funding bill that could slash the city's budget by more than $1 billion and leave public schools vulnerable to cuts.\n\nParents mobilized one another to call members of Congress, show up at senators' offices and lobby Senate staffers who have children in D.C. public schools. They coordinated their actions through PTAs, group chats and email listservs, while also urging family members outside of the district to contact their members of Congress.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nOne text in a group chat of D.C. parents noted that a Senate Republican staffer had children at their school, adding that there was a movement to corner her. Another parent told NBC News that parents have been working to figure out which Capitol Hill staffers with children in public schools could be reached.\n\nSome parents have been leveraging relationships with people who may hold sway on the Hill.\n\n\"Parents have described staffers who they are either personal friends with or former colleagues that they have reached out to personally,\" Emma Kelly, a D.C. public schools parent, said.\n\nThe city\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget was approved last year, increasing the budget by more than $1 billion. But the funding bill being considered by Congress would force the city to revert back to fiscal 2024 budget levels, reducing the city\u2019s spending by $1.1 billion in six months, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said this week.\n\nPrevious temporary government funding bills, known as continuing resolutions, have had provisions allowing D.C. to continue spending funds in line with the city\u2019s current fiscal year budget, rather than the previous one. Such a provision was excluded from this week\u2019s bill.\n\nAs parents protested at her colleagues' offices, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters that she would speak with Bowser on Thursday.\n\n\"I do not support this restriction on the District of Columbia's ability to use its own funding,\" said Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. She added, however, that she still plans to vote for the bill.\n\nParents have been focusing on outreach to Republicans and moderate Democrats, emphasizing to members of Congress that their staffers are often D.C. residents whose kids may attend the city's public schools.\n\nMultiple parents told NBC News that their lobbying of other parents took place privately through text messages and interactions in schools and neighborhoods, nervous that their employers would look negatively on activism during a new presidential administration.\n\nOne woman who has a child in D.C. public schools told NBC News that she had spoken with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Wednesday about the bill's impact on D.C.'s budget. Murkowski seemed receptive and said that her staffers remind her frequently that they are all D.C. residents, the woman said.\n\nD.C. does not have voting members of Congress, so parents and children roamed the floors of the Hart Senate office building on Thursday, urging Senate staffers to protect the city's funding.\n\n\u201cIt was important for me to go to Senate Hart, largely because I\u2019ve been watching the educators around me continue to give their all to raising future generations,\" said 16-year-old Erica Floyd, who attends a D.C. public high school and visited a Senate office building to try to talk to senators. \"Their perseverance, dedication and support for students and their education inspired me to do my part and advocate for my peers\u2019 education and my own.\"\n\nSixth graders Leo Benevelli, Jake Kaplan and Jake Zelin visited Sen. Jon Ossoff's office with their moms after he said he was assessing the bill. Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is up for re-election in 2026.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think this is what the Founding Fathers of our country would have wanted, and our country is built by teachers and schools,\u201d Benevelli said.\n\nSeveral of the advocates who visited Capitol Hill on Thursday invoked their upbringing as they brought their cases to Senate staffers.\n\nDouglas McRae was born and raised in Mississippi and now lives in D.C. with his 4-year-old son, Luca, who is in the city's pre-K program. The two visited Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith's office on Thursday with other advocates, urging the staff for the Mississippi Republican to ensure that the city's budget remained in tact.\n\nMcRae has asked his parents and Luca's aunt and uncles in Mississippi to contact their members of Congress.\n\n\"I've told them to reach out and call as well to make sure that people in Mississippi are not OK with this,\" he said.\n\nIt's a tactic used by other D.C. families, too, who worry that their voices won't be heard without a voting member of Congress. The city has a delegate and two shadow senators, but they cannot vote on legislation.\n\n\"I've asked my family and my friends who live in states with voting senators to please advocate on our behalf,\" said Caitlin Rogger, whose 8- and 10-year-old children are in D.C. elementary schools. \"The Senate can turn this around, but D.C. doesn't have a senator who can vote, so there's no one beholden to my neighbors and me for this decision.\"\n\nMarina Zhavoronkova and her 4-year-old son participated in protests Thursday in Washington. Megan Lebowitz / NBC News\n\nAshley Smith Thomson visited senators\u2019 offices Thursday, one day after her latest chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. She is on medical leave, which is putting a strain on her finances and has her worried about what potential spending cuts could mean for child care in D.C.\n\n\"If it goes away, I don't know what I'm going to do with my daughter while I'm recovering from a double mastectomy,\" said Smith Thomson, whose child is in first grade.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what programs would face funding cuts if the bill goes through, but the mayor has laid out that some of the top areas that the city spends money on are public education, public safety and Health and Human Services.\n\nSteph Tatham with her daughters, who are in second grade and kindergarten, attended the Recess at the Capitol protests. Megan Lebowitz / NBC News\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to cut that kind of money in the time that we would have in this fiscal year not to affect police or not to affect teachers and not to affect some of the basic government services that allow us to keep our city clean, safe and beautiful,\u201d Bowser told reporters Monday.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for the mayor said that her office is \"hopeful that our partners in Congress will get it fixed this week.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who chairs the Appropriations Committee and introduced the bill this month, did not respond to a request for comment about the bill's impact on D.C.'s funding.\n\nThe House voted on Tuesday to pass a six-month funding bill that mostly maintains similar funding levels from 2024. The Senate has not yet voted on the bill, but Democrats have said they will reject it. The government faces a Friday night deadline to avoid a shutdown."

            "full_content": "Former first lady Michelle Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson, speak at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago on October 29, 2019. Photo: Terrence Antonio James/TNS/Getty Images\n\nDivorce is the one thing people really want to hear Michelle Obama talk about right now. And on her new podcast, IMO (short for \u201cin my opinion\u201d), the former First Lady obliges, repeatedly discussing the topic. The bad news for gossip hounds is that Mobama opines only on her brother and co-host Craig Robinson\u2019s divorce from his first wife. In fact, IMO\u2019s first two episodes are almost totally devoid of any juicy content \u2014 let alone juicy content about the state of Michelle and Barack Obama\u2019s marriage.\n\nGranted, there probably isn\u2019t much to say about the Obamas\u2019 marriage, as they are not separating. The rumor that they might be took off in August when In Touch published a cover story suggesting that Michelle Obama had been \u201cbetrayed,\u201d and that Barack Obama and Jennifer Aniston were \u201cobsessed with each other.\u201d Aniston joked about the idea that she\u2019s having an affair with the former president months later on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, calling it \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201d And the Obamas have tacitly signaled that their marriage is fine via affectionate social media posts.\n\nIMO, which is produced by the Obamas\u2019 media company Higher Ground, never promised inside information on the former First Couple\u2019s marriage, though listeners may have assumed they\u2019d get some interesting tidbits. According to the show description, a \u201crelaxed and honest\u201d Mobama will be delving into topics like \u201cdating and relationships\u201d:\n\nMichelle Obama and her big brother Craig Robinson bring their unique experiences and candid perspectives to a range of listeners\u2019 personal dilemmas, from the everyday to the existential. Each week, they\u2019re joined by special guests to tackle audience questions with practical advice, relatable anecdotes, and plenty of laughs. From dating and relationships to parenting and financial planning, IMO sees the iconic First Lady at her most relaxed and honest. This podcast will leave you laughing, reflecting, and feeling more prepared to tackle life\u2019s challenges.\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? In episode one, Obama and Robinson talk about their close bond as siblings. In episode two they have a meandering conversation about friendship with Issa Rae. In both episodes they discuss Robinson\u2019s divorce, which is old news (he divorced his first wife in 2000 and married his current wife in 2006, and he has discussed the split elsewhere). Each time, all they reveal is that Obama was upset her brother didn\u2019t initially confide in her about his marital troubles.\n\nBarack Obama is mentioned several times in passing, and his cameos, if anything, provide more evidence that the Obamas\u2019 marriage is fine. Michelle says she was initially annoyed by Barack\u2019s failure to get ready on time. Robinson tells a familiar anecdote about persuading his sister to support Barack\u2019s first presidential run. Michelle alludes to Barack being in the house when her friends come to visit \u2014 contradicting claims that they\u2019re living separate lives \u2014 and teasingly notes that he never comes home with good gossip after hanging out with his buddies.\n\nThe same can be said of IMO. These are the most interesting revelations from the first two episodes:\n\nTeenage Sasha and Malia didn\u2019t like doing the turkey pardon with their dad. \u201cIt was cute when they were little, but as they got older, you could see on their faces in the shots them thinking, \u2018Just poke my eyes out. Just right now. Just get me out of here. I\u2019m standing with my father telling these stupid jokes next to a turkey,\u2019\u201d Michelle says.\n\nMichelle Obama really likes the smell of Pine-Sol. It reminds her of her freshly mopped childhood apartment \u2014 or at least, that\u2019s what she claims during an ad read for the cleaning product.\n\nMichelle Obama is into astrology. In episode one she makes a fleeting reference to being a Capricorn. In episode two, she suggests she knows herself better than most because of where her birthday falls on the zodiac. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to set boundaries, but I think it starts with knowing, well, who do I want to be?\u201d she says. \u201cThe honesty first has to be within yourself. I think both of us probably as Capricorns, we\u2019re probably a little more honest about who we are, what we want.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the IMO podcast feels like it\u2019s coming to us from another time, or an alternate, less-grim reality (and that may literally be the case; presumably it was planned out well before Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration). Marital gossip aside, what people probably need from Michelle Obama at the moment is an anti-Trump pep talk, like the spectacular speech she delivered at the last Democratic National Convention. But despite her natural talent and huge popularity, Obama has repeatedly made it clear that she does not want a career in politics. And it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like \u201chope is making a comeback\u201d right now. So instead, all we\u2019re getting from Michelle Obama is bland chatter with her brother and and Pine-Sol ad copy."

The group was recently designated a foreign terrorist organization by the Department of State.\n\nThrough these networks, Goudreau said, Maduro can \"flood the United States with fentanyl.\"\n\nTRUMP ADMIN PROMISES TO BE \u2018RUTHLESSLY AGGRESSIVE\u2019 IN RESPONSE TO SUSPECTED CARTEL KILLING OF US CITIZEN\n\n\"Because he has individuals who have access and placement [in the United States], whether it's Tren de Aragua or whoever, he obviously has agents in the United States who are moving product, moving fentanyl and things of that nature, killing Americans. So, this is the obvious threat we\u2019ve seen this over the last four years,\" Goudreau explained.\n\nHe acknowledged recent efforts to shut the border and crack down on illegal immigration have helped, but he said the threat still exists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite this, Goudreau cautioned against any sudden moves by the Trump administration to help the Venezuelan resistance movement against Maduro.\n\n\"Everybody wants to create a kind of clarity, but this is an incredibly complex situation. It's not going to get fixed overnight,\" he said."

He said during the committee markup that Musk and the White House are perpetuating a \"big lie\" that there is a Democratic plan \"to bring illegal immigrants into the country by offering to pay them Social Security.\" Larson claimed, \"There's not a thread of truth to any of that.\"\n\n\"And, yet, this unaccountable person \u2014 not a federal employee, not a volunteer \u2014 but a special person who's not had to go through Senate approval and who this committee is now saying, \u2018Yes, we agree with the president. He should not be accountable. He should be able to have free rein and do whatever he wants. We will willingly follow him and do whatever he says because he's the wealthiest man in the world, and, surely, he must know how to save us from ourselves,'\" Larson said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLarson said Social Security \"just happens to be the No. 1 anti-poverty program for the elderly and for the children of this country,\" adding that Musk and Trump \"aren't going to lose a moment's sleep thinking about the privatization.\"\n\nThe congressman and all committee Democrats introduced a resolution to compel the Trump administration to provide answers on DOGE's intentions with Social Security, but Larson claimed Republicans are trying to stop it from coming to a vote."

            "full_content": "Congress, and particularly John Thune\u2019s Senate, is moving as slowly as molasses on Trump\u2019s big budget bill. Photo: Andrew Cabellero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cMove fast and break things\u201d is the unofficial slogan of Silicon Valley, and certainly the world\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful tech bro, Elon Musk, has taken it to heart in attacking and destabilizing the federal government. Even his own operatives at DOGE can\u2019t really keep up with the damage they are joyfully inflicting on the public sector, or what it might look like when they\u2019re done.\n\nBut in the meantime, the government entity that really does have the lawful authority to do the things that DOGE has arrogated to itself as a reflection of Donald Trump\u2019s imperial ideas of executive power, the U.S. Congress, is moving like molasses on the president\u2019s legislative agenda. It\u2019s not because Democrats are getting in the way: The minority party has been completely shut out of the decision-making process in Congress, and it may be giving up its last bit of leverage by accepting (not voting for, but also not filibustering) a Republican appropriations measure for the rest of this fiscal year as a lesser evil than a government shutdown.\n\nThe slo-mo pace in Congress is the product of three factors. First, Republicans decided ages ago that they would cram every bit of eligible legislation into a budget reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered and that would pass both Houses on a party-line vote. That\u2019s not surprising; Republicans did the same thing last time they had a \u201ctrifecta\u201d in 2017, and so did Democrats when they had one in 2021. But the reconciliation process has its own set of arcane rules that make quick action very difficult.\n\nSecond, after weeks and weeks of vacillation, Trump told congressional Republicans he preferred a \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d strategy for reconciliation. This means that everything he wants, from increased spending on defense and border security, to an array of tax cuts, to offsetting domestic-spending reductions, will have to be loaded into one piece of legislation that somehow hangs together and complies with all the budget rules. Working that out between House and Senate Republicans, and ensuring the final product is something nearly all of them can support, is incredibly complicated and takes a lot of time.\n\nThird, House and Senate Republicans are not working together well at all. After Trump endorsed the House budget resolution setting out a blueprint for a single reconciliation bill, the Senate became obligated to go along. But weeks after the House acted, the Senate hasn\u2019t followed suit, apparently because it wants some changes that then the House will have to accept or reject. The whole process is becoming more complex and fraught with pitfalls precisely at the time when Republicans should be acting smoothly as a team. And as Politico reports, the deadlines for action keep getting pushed back:\n\nBut behind the scenes, House GOP leaders are stewing over what they see as the Senate\u2019s failure to act expeditiously, despite House Republicans approving their budget plan two weeks ago.\n\nIn an effort to spur them along, Majority Leader Steve Scalise this week quietly encouraged GOP committee chairs to increase their public criticism of what he described as the Senate\u2019s unacceptable timeline. Those House GOP leaders were also deeply alarmed when Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Finance Committee member, emerged from a meeting of panel Republicans Monday night and said the reconciliation bill might not be completed until August.\n\nThere are some rather big problems with letting Trump\u2019s entire legislative agenda slide until later in the year. For one thing, it\u2019s entirely likely Trump\u2019s popularity will fade as the inevitable backlash to what the executive branch is doing to federal agencies and programs builds. For another, one of Trump\u2019s more popular ideas \u2014 one that\u2019s absolutely Job One to major elements of his MAGA base \u2014 is the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. But that really can\u2019t happen on the level he\u2019s promised without a significant shift of resources. That\u2019s one major reason Republican senators wanted to do two reconciliation bills with the first devoted to beefing up the defense and border-security programs needed to get the deportation locomotive moving. But Trump said no to that, so now the deportation drive has stalled.\n\nPerhaps the most alarming byproduct of endless delays in enacting a reconciliation bill is the possibility that it won\u2019t happen in time to deal with a debt-default crisis, which is expected to arrive as early as June, when the Treasury runs out of ways to pay for U.S. obligations. Trump has demanded a $4 trillion debt-limit increase, and the idea was to include that in reconciliation so as to (a) deny Democrats leverage over it and (b) sugar-coat the measure for fiscal hawks who hate debt-limit increases. If the debt-limit measure slips out of reconciliation because that \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d is stuck at some point in the legislative process when the bills come due, Republicans will have a real disaster on their hands.\n\nSo perhaps congressional Republicans can continue to vicariously enjoy the reckless pace at which Trump and Musk are moving to disrupt the \u201cdeep state,\u201d even if that means abdicating centuries-long legislative-branch prerogatives over spending and federal-program authorizations. But Team Trump will need Congress to act decisively on the budget at some point down the road, and the institution is not off to a great start."

            "full_content": "San Francisco CNN \u2014\n\nA federal judge has ordered half a dozen federal agencies to \u201cimmediately\u201d reinstate probationary employees fired last month as part of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rapidly shrink the federal workforce, calling the effort a \u201csham.\u201d\n\nThe preliminary injunction issued from the bench Thursday by US District Judge William Alsup requires the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury to rehire the employees. The judge said that he might extend the order to cover other federal agencies at a later time.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said he was making the ruling because he believes the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.\n\n\u201cThe court finds that Office of Personnel Management did direct all agencies to terminate probationary employees with the exception of mission critical employees,\u201d he said, rejecting arguments from the Justice Department that OPM merely issued \u201cguidance\u201d to the agencies that then led to the firings.\n\nThe judge said the order is effective immediately: \u201cThis is the order and it counts.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department indicated Thursday that it will appeal the ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by labor unions and others challenging OPM\u2019s role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.\n\nAlsup was highly critical of the administration\u2019s justification for firing the employees. OPM had provided agencies with a template termination letter that cited the employee\u2019s \u201cperformance\u201d as the reason they were being let go. But the judge said that rationale was the government\u2019s attempt to end-run federal law setting up specific rules for reducing the federal workforce.\n\n\u201cThe reason that OPM wanted to put this based on performance was at least in part in my judgment a gimmick to avoid the Reductions in Force Act,\u201d the judge said. \u201cBecause the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that\u2019s a lie,\u201d he added. \u201cThat should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\u201d\n\nFederal probationary employees have typically been in their positions for one year, but some jobs have two-year probationary periods. The employees may be new to the federal workforce, but they also could have been recently promoted or shifted to a different agency.\n\nAlsup\u2019s ruling is one of the most significant yet in cases testing the administration\u2019s authority to quickly reduce the number of federal employees \u2013 a key priority that has been central to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe White House called the ruling \u201cabsurd and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cA single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch. The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2013 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President\u2019s agenda,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement posted on X by another White House aide.\n\n\u201cIf a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nA second federal judge ruled later Thursday, in a similar case brought in Maryland by Democratic state attorneys general, that probationary employees laid off en masse by the Trump administration must be temporarily reinstated. That judge\u2019s temporary restraining order, which will last two weeks, applies to 18 agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Agency for International Development.\n\n\u2018I tend to doubt that you\u2019re telling me the truth\u2019\n\nThe preliminary injunction came after Alsup unloaded on the Justice Department for not making the acting head of the Office of Personnel Management available to testify about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to fire scores of probationary employees.\n\nHe had ordered acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to testify during Thursday\u2019s hearing, where he would likely face tough questions from attorneys representing the labor unions that are challenging his agency\u2019s role in the firings.\n\nBut the Justice Department refused to make him available and instead withdrew a declaration Ezell submitted last month that had served as the government\u2019s only evidence in the case.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to do so because you know cross-examination will reveal the truth,\u201d Alsup told DOJ attorney Kelsey Helland. \u201cI tend to doubt that you\u2019re telling me the truth.\u201d\n\nAlsup told the DOJ attorney Thursday: \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018here\u2019s a declaration, you have to accept it without question\u2019 when there is a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not helping me get at the truth. You\u2019re giving me press releases \u2013 sham documents,\u201d the judge said, referring to documents submitted by the DOJ to the court that they say shows how the agencies were making the termination decisions themselves.\n\nThe declaration from Ezell said that OPM did not \u201cdirect\u201d other agencies to terminate probationary employees \u2014 the central issue in the case brought by labor unions and others.\n\nHelland pushed back strongly on the judge\u2019s assertion, and argued during the hearing that the agency heads had sought to cull their workforce on their own, not at the direction of OPM.\n\n\u201cI respectfully disagree that we have submitted false evidence,\u201d he said at one point, adding later: \u201cDecisions on these employment actions were made by these agencies and were fully endorsed by their political leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has been targeting probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While they generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can if the action stemmed from \u201cpartisan political reasons\u201d or \u201cmarriage status.\u201d Also, they are protected from prohibited personnel practices.\n\nPart of Thursday\u2019s hearing concerned whether the employees at issue in the case have the option of appealing their firing to the MSPB, something Alsup had initially understood was possible. But the judge said he wanted the parties to submit more written legal arguments on the issue before he decides how to factor it into his ruling.\n\nOne former probationary employee who was fired last month from the IRS, an agency within the Treasury Department, told CNN that he and his colleagues were thrilled with the ruling.\n\n\u201cEveryone on the group chat is celebrating,\u201d the former IRS employee said, referring to a text chat where his former colleagues have been consoling each other in recent weeks.\n\nCNN\u2019s Tami Luhby, Tierney Sneed, Samantha Waldenberg and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the title of acting OPM Director Charles Ezell.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "Rapper Lil Yachty told cooking show host and influencer Quenlin Blackwell that Black Lives Matter (BLM) \"was literally a scam\" on an episode of her popular YouTube show.\n\nBlackwell, who hosts \"Feeding Starving Celebrities\" on the video-sharing platform and talks to various famous guests, asked Yachty how much he's spent on charitable contributions so far this year. When the rapper mentioned that the year had just started, the host asked what contributions he'd made over the previous two years, also asking if BLM was one of the causes he's donated to.\n\n\"What about the year before last year?\" asked Blackwell.\n\nYachty responded, saying, \"Well, that year, yeah, that's a good year. It's just blurry because I be doing so much.\"\n\nBLACK LIVES MATTER GLOBAL CIRCLING THE DRAIN AS IT RUNS OUT OF CASH: REPORT\n\nThe host immediately followed up his response, asking, \"BLM? Since you want to be so Black power?\"\n\n\"BLM is a scam,\" Yachty responded, to the shock of the host.\n\n\"Clip that! Send it to the f------ news!\" Blackwell responded.\n\nYachty, who has 5.3 million followers on social media platform X, expanded on his statement, explaining to the host why he believes the social justice group is a \"scam.\"\n\n\"BLM was literally a scam. They had bought mansions, and you probably wouldn't know anything about it because you don't care about Black people, and don't follow Black news,\" Yachty jokingly asserted.\n\nBlackwell, who is African-American herself, told the rapper that she does \"care about Black people,\" and that she's \"literally the most pro-Black person in this room.\"\n\n'LOVE IS BLIND' STAR SARA CARTON REJECTS BEN MEZZENGA AT THE ALTAR OVER VIEWS ON RELIGION, BLACK LIVES MATTER\n\nBLM came under fire in 2022 after their lavish home purchase was exposed by New York Magazine. According to the report, \"The California property was purchased for nearly $6 million in cash in October 2020 with money that had been donated to BLMGNF (Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation).\"\n\nThe report caused the activist organization to respond on Twitter.\n\n\"There have been a lot of questions surrounding recent reports about the purchase of Creator\u2019s House in California,\" the Black Lives Matter official Twitter account posted.\n\n\"Despite past efforts, BLMGNF recognizes that there is more work to do to increase transparency and ensure transitions in leadership are clear,\" it added.\n\nIn subsequent tweets, BLM called a flurry of reports looking into the group's finances \"inflammatory and speculative\" and blamed them for \"causing harm.\" The reports \"do not reflect the totality of the movement,\" the organization claimed.\n\nAt the time, BLMGNF board member Shalomyah Bowers emailed a statement to the New York Magazine reporter claiming that the organization purchased the property \"with the intention for it to serve as housing and studio space for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship,\" a program that was reportedly announced the next day as providing \"recording resources and dedicated space for Black creatives to launch content online and in real life focused on abolition, healing justice, urban agriculture and food justice, pop culture, activism, and politics.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nBlack Lives Matter Global Network Foundation responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Yachty's claims with strong words for the rapper: \"It\u2019s clear Lil Yachty has been drinking the white supremacist ideology Kool-Aid. His comments are wrong. They are misinformed, unoriginal, and crafted to please the same people who profit from Black suffering.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"The real scam isn\u2019t Black Lives Matter. It is watching Black artists with massive platforms recycle the same tired attacks on Black movements while ignoring the actual systems killing us. Black Lives Matter has supported Black families who have lost loved ones to police violence. We have built programs, funded mutual aid, and fought in courtrooms and on the streets to protect our people.\"\n\n\"BLM was never a scam, selling out your people for clout is,\" Black Lives Matter said.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital's Kristine Parks and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda has once again called on the U.S. to place nuclear weapons within its borders in a show of deterrence to Russia\u2019s continued aggression just over the border in Ukraine.\n\nA similar request was apparently made to the Biden administration in 2022, which was never agreed to, but Duda has not given up on the idea. This time he addressed his appeal to the Trump administration during an interview with the Financial Times that was published Thursday.\n\n\"Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,\" Duda told the Financial Times in reference to actions Russia took beginning in 2023, a year after it invaded Ukraine. \"They didn't ask anyone's permission.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about where President Donald Trump stands when it comes to this form of deterrence.\n\nPOLISH GOVERNMENT PLANS MANDATORY MILITARY TRAINING FOR ADULT MEN\n\nThe Trump administration this week took steps to try and bring about an end to the war in Ukraine, which has been raging for more than three years following Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion.\n\nWhile Ukraine has agreed to the U.S.\u2019s initial 30-day ceasefire contingent on Russia\u2019s acceptance of the terms, Moscow has not, and it is unlikely that the Trump administration would take steps to jeopardize those negotiations by agreeing to put U.S. nukes in Poland \u2013 which shares a border with Russia and could be viewed as a threat by the Kremlin.\n\nBut Duda\u2019s advisor on international affairs, Wojciech Kolarski, echoed the Polish president\u2019s plea and, in a Thursday interview with Poland\u2019s RMF FM radio, argued that as a NATO member who shares a border with Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region, as well as Ukraine and Belarus, the steps were important for Warsaw\u2019s security.\n\nNATO NATION POLAND SCRAMBLES AIR DEFENSES AS RUSSIA STRIKES WESTERN UKRAINE\n\nBut should the U.S. again refuse Poland\u2019s request, there is another nuclear-armed nation in the NATO alliance that may be willing to assist in \"nuclear sharing.\"\n\nAmid mounting concern in the European Union that the U.S. could withdraw forces from the bloc or become an unreliable defense partner in countering Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron opened discussions on a strategy that could help extend its nuclear deterrence to other EU nations.\n\nWhile the specifics of that strategy remain unclear, including whether France has proposed actually dispersing nuclear arms to other nations, Poland has reportedly been in talks with France about the issue.\n\nRussia has already called France\u2019s strategy to re-evaluate its extension of nuclear deterrence \"extremely confrontational.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite Moscow's objections, France\u2019s defense concept is far from new as the U.S. deterrence umbrella during the Cold War was intended to ensure NATO allies would be protected under America's nuclear power in case of a direct threat by another nuclear-armed nation, like Russia, China or North Korea.\n\nWhile France is the EU\u2019s only nuclear power, it has the third-largest nuclear stockpile when it comes to nuclear-armed nations in NATO, which also includes the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPete Buttigieg announced Thursday he will not run for Michigan\u2019s governorship or the state\u2019s open US Senate seat in 2026, setting up a potential presidential bid in 2028.\n\n\u201cI care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race. I remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values - and who understand that in this moment, leadership means not only opposing today\u2019s cruel chaos, but also presenting a vision of a better alternative,\u201d Buttigieg said in an X post.\n\nButtigieg called fellow Michigan Democrats on Thursday morning to tell them of his decision, which was first reported by Politico.\n\nA source familiar with Buttigieg\u2019s thinking said his decision sets him up in the strongest possible position to run for president in 2028. The source said running for governor or Senate in 2026 would have taken that option off the table.\n\nFollowing the retirement announcement by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters in late January, an adviser to Buttigieg told CNN he was taking a \u201cserious look\u201d at a Senate campaign.\n\nButtigieg said he \u201cthought seriously\u201d about running for the governorship \u2013 Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is also seen as a potential 2028 contender, is term-limited \u2013 as well as the Senate seat after being encouraged by leaders in Michigan and having conversations with family, friends and officials.\n\n\u201cI considered what I could bring to the race compared to other likely candidates, and what running and serving would mean compared to other ways I could make a difference in the years ahead,\u201d he wrote in a Substack post on his decision.\n\nThe former Biden transportation secretary described America as \u201cless free, less secure, less democratic \u2013 and less prosperous\u201d under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and that he will spend time in the coming months \u201cengaging both legacy and digital media in the service of a politics of everyday life, rooted in the values of freedom, security, and democracy. \u201c\n\n\u201cI will be engaging partners, allies, friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of American prosperity than either side has so far offered,\u201d Buttigieg wrote.\n\nThe decision has rattled some Michigan Democrats, who are increasingly anxious about holding onto a Senate seat in a state President Donald Trump won last November.\n\nSenate Democratic leaders and officials involved with their campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have been privately lobbying Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to run for the seat, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversations.\n\nIf Whitmer runs, top Democrats believe, she would be their strongest contender to hold the seat for the party. But Whitmer \u2014 who is considering a 2028 run for president \u2014 is uninterested, according to one of those people.\n\nOther Michigan Democrats, including former Sen. Debbie Stabenow, are now encouraging freshman Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet to run behind the scenes, according to two people familiar with those discussions. McDonald Rivet is \u201cactively considering\u201d a run, according to a person familiar with her thinking.\n\nThe first-term Democrat won a tough battleground seat Trump also carried. And they believe her mid-Michigan district, which is home to the birthplace of General Motors, represents the kinds of working-class voters that their Senate candidate would need to win in 2026.\n\nShe would not be the only House Democrat to consider a run. Behind the scenes, Rep. Haley Stevens is also preparing a possible bid if the party doesn\u2019t rally behind another candidate, according to the two people familiar.\n\nButtigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, mounted a presidential campaign in 2019 positioning himself as a moderate. He entered race as a relative unknown among nearly two-dozen Democrats running for the chance to take on Trump at the time.\n\nButtigieg broke barriers as the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president and raised more than $80 million during his 2020 run.\n\nWhile he had initial success in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign struggled to win over voters of color, a key base of the Democratic Party, which hurt his performance in Nevada and South Carolina, leading him to end his campaign shortly before Super Tuesday.\n\nFollowing his failed bid, Buttigieg vaulted into Cabinet work as transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden in a move that many Democrats saw as needed experience for another presidential run.\n\nDuring his tenure as mayor, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 as an intelligence officer.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report."

And people raising backyard chickens suddenly find their eggs in high demand.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know today.\n\nTrump\u2019s economic troubles put Republicans in a tough spot\n\nPresident Donald Trump's full-speed-ahead approach has led to tariffs on U.S. friends and foes alike, as well as deep cuts to federal government jobs, grants and contracts. As concerns about the economy become more acute, Republicans have been thrust into the awkward position of explaining why a president who promised to boost the economy simply by winning the election is now injecting the economic uncertainty himself.\n\n\"This was always part of the plan,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said this week on Fox News. Newly elected Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana also expressed his support of economic moves and predicted \"one of the strongest economies in a generation,\" albeit with some \"temporary disruptions.\"\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day.

Mike Rounds of South Dakota said he thinks Trump has some latitude to pursue trade wars, though he conceded, \u201cthey\u2019ve got to show some success fairly quickly.\u201d\n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who faces reelection next year, said that Trump not ruling out an impending recession is \u201cnot what you want to hear.\u201d He continued: \u201cOn the one hand, he is being honest, but on the other hand, we have to do everything we can to avoid it for a variety of reasons.\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he\u2019s worried about the effect of tariffs on his home state, saying \u201cNobody at home is coming up to me and saying please put tariffs on.\u201d\n\nAt some point, a Republican strategist warned, some lawmakers will \u201cstart going into full freakout mode.\u201d\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reject a government funding bill that the Republican-led House passed this week, leaving it uncertain whether Congress can avert a shutdown before tomorrow night\u2019s deadline.\n\nthat the Republican-led House passed this week, leaving it uncertain whether Congress can avert a shutdown before tomorrow night\u2019s deadline.

In House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s Louisiana district, many residents who rely on Medicaid and food stamps to make ends meet fear potential cuts to the programs.\n\nEPA rollback threatens core environmental policies\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has promised to \u201cdrive a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion\u201d through an aggressive rollback of regulations. Zeldin announced the change yesterday in both a Wall Street Journal opinion piece and an EPA news release.\n\nThe rollback would apply to rules and regulations on emission standards for vehicles and pollution from power plants. The agency will also revisit rules such as water pollution limits for coal plants, air quality standards for small particles and the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by large emitters like oil and gas companies.\n\nZeldin also signaled the EPA would consider upending its own endangerment finding, which says greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the Earth and that presents a threat to public health and welfare. The 2009 legal decision is a lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.\n\nEnvironmental advocates were quick to blast the announcement, which will likely spark legal battles with groups that have vowed to fight back.\n\nTrump administration seeks to deport pro-Palestinian activist\n\nThe Trump administration filed a document seeking to deport pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to documents obtained yesterday by NBC News, hours after a federal judge in New York heard arguments in Khalil\u2019s arrest and detention. In the document, the Department of Homeland Security cited a provision in immigration law that allows for deportation if it is determined that the person \u201cwould have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d Khalil has been ordered to appear at a March 27 hearing.\n\nKhalil, a green card holder who is married to a U.S. citizen, was arrested last weekend and is being held for now at a detention center in Louisiana while a federal judge weighs whether to return the case to New York, as Khalil\u2019s lawyers have requested, or move the case to New Jersey or Louisiana, which the Trump administration wants.\n\nThe Trump administration claims Khalil organized protests at Columbia University that disrupted classes and that he \u201charassed Jewish American students\u201d and distributed fliers featuring pro-Hamas propaganda. Khalil\u2019s legal team said his arrest was a violation of his free speech rights and that he was targeted because of his viewpoints.

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPolls often present a false choice: you either believe in God, or you don\u2019t. But belief is more complex.\n\nThe Jewish holiday of Purim, celebrated March 13-14, embodies this tension. It is considered holier than Yom Kippur, yet it\u2019s a story of survival where God is never mentioned, and no overt miracles occur.\n\nIt is based on the Book of Esther, found in the Jewish and Christian Bibles. Scholars say that Jesus celebrated it in the unnamed feast in John 5:1.\n\nAs a kid I didn\u2019t celebrate Halloween so Purim was the replacement. It\u2019s a holiday of reckless joy. You dress up, drink and party. It was a religious excuse for a Jewish version of Mardi Gras.\n\nJEWISH HOLIDAY OF PURIM MAY HAVE ECHOES IN AMERICAN HISTORY, SAYS NEW YORK RABBI\n\nBut beneath the revelry are layers of meaning. We read the Esther scroll, exchange food baskets and give charity. Many consider it holier than the fasting and prayer of Yom Kippur because it elevates the mundane \u2013 transforming eating and drinking into spiritual purpose. It also takes more effort to find meaning in the chaos of life than in the structure of ritual.\n\nBut if it\u2019s so holy, why is it based on a book in the Bible where God and the supernatural are left out? Imagine Easter without Jesus' resurrection, Passover without sea splitting, or erasing the miracle of Hanukkah\u2019s one day of oil lasting eight. What would be left? Isn\u2019t divine intervention \u2013 and God \u2013 the whole point of a religious holiday?\n\nSome suggest God\u2019s absence was to avoid Persian censorship of the book. Others see it as a deliberate shift from open divine intervention to showing how God\u2019s hidden presence shapes history. Or perhaps it\u2019s testing faith in uncertainty.\n\nThe Talmud teaches that the Torah\u2019s acceptance at Sinai was influenced by divine coercion. But on Purim, the Israelites reaffirmed their acceptance of the Torah willingly, without miracles or external pressure \u2013 choosing faith in the face of uncertainty. Purim shows a path where omitting an explicit God reference creates space for both believers and skeptics to find their own meaning.\n\nEsther, a Jewish orphan, conceals her identity and becomes queen (Esther 2:10, 2:17). Haman, the king\u2019s advisor, plots to annihilate the Jewish people (Esther 3:5-6). Mordecai, Esther\u2019s cousin, urges her to reveal her heritage (Esther 7:3-6). A single night of the king\u2019s insomnia sets off a chain reaction that flips the script (Esther 6:1). The king issues a new decree allowing the Jews to defend themselves, thereby thwarting Haman\u2019s plan (Esther 8:5-11).\n\nJEWISH PRO-ISRAEL ACTIVIST SAYS WARNINGS IN LEVITICUS A REMINDER THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL\n\nThe story unfolds like an improbable political thriller. Esther is in the right place at the right time. A forgotten orphan rises to power. What are the odds that one accident after another leads to a nation\u2019s survival?\n\nIf I believe in chance, it is a masterclass in luck, timing and human action. If I believe in God, it is proof that miracles don\u2019t need to break the laws of nature. They happen through people, politics, and the randomness of life that, in hindsight, is destiny.\n\nThere is a tradition of drinking to the point of not knowing the difference between \"cursed is Haman\" and \"blessed is Mordecai.\" This intoxication is to break down our perception of good and evil. The same people who play villains in one moment are instruments of salvation in another. The belief is that we are all just playing roles in a cosmic plan.\n\nYet, life often seems to defy a benevolent plan. As a child, I experienced the profound tragedy of my father\u2019s death. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades terror group murdered my Israeli cousin, Meir Tamari. Recently, my sister-in-law and niece died in a devastating water accident. A few months ago my dear friend from college took his life. These losses challenge the belief in a guided destiny and seem to highlight the randomness of suffering.\n\nMany scholars, of course, say the Purim story is folklore evolved from a Persian festival or an ancient Jewish tradition of reenacting survival stories. Its literary style feels too perfect, almost theatrical.\n\nTEN COMMANDMENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN FROM, NOT JUST SEE\n\nYet, whether it\u2019s history, allegory, or both, its message of seeking meaning in apparent randomness remains unchanged.\n\nAnd whether or not Purim \"happened,\" the story of Jewish survival in the face of relentless persecution itself seems miraculous. Mark Twain famously pondered the mystery of how empires have risen and fallen while the Jews have endured. When the 18th-century monarch, King Frederick the Great of Prussia, asked for proof of God, his doctor pointed to the continued existence of the Jews.\n\nI\u2019ve spent my life caught between two worlds: one of faith, where God controls history, and the world of reason, where things just happen and we make sense of them later. Most of the time, I feel like I have to choose. Purim won\u2019t let me.\n\nUltimately, faith and doubt aren\u2019t enemies. They are the same search for meaning. As Rabbi Jonathan Sachs said, faith is \"the courage to live with uncertainty.\"\n\nAnd Purim meets me exactly where I am \u2013 caught between belief and questioning, certainty and wonder.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe world today feels like Purim. I wonder if history is just chaos, if the bad guys win and the rest of us are just trying to survive. But then I think about Mordecai, who refused to bow when everyone else did. I think about Esther, who spoke up when she had every reason to stay silent.\n\nThey didn\u2019t know if God was with them. They acted anyway. That\u2019s what Purim teaches me.\n\nYou don\u2019t wait for miracles. You don\u2019t wait for certainty. You act.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPurim reminds you that you don\u2019t have to have all the answers. It\u2019s enough to just ask questions. Because whether or not we believe in miracles, we still have to decide how we\u2019re going to act.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s the only miracle we ever really need. And maybe that\u2019s also why Purim is holier than Yom Kippur."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn late January, Erik Prince, a long-time ally of President Donald Trump and a notorious private security contractor, gathered a meeting of executives in Washington, DC, to discuss ways their own private security firms might help the new administration deport millions of undocumented migrants.\n\nOne proposal in particular caught Prince\u2019s attention: the idea of sending migrants with criminal records for detention in another country as they awaited transit to their countries of origin.\n\nIn the months leading up to Trump\u2019s victory in November, Prince had struck up a working relationship with El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, which not everyone at the meeting knew. Trump officials had also been having separate conversations with Bukele about accepting undocumented migrants from the US.\n\nPrince eventually excused himself from the group, telling those gathered that he planned to pitch the detention idea directly to Bukele.\n\nThe next week, Bukele stood beside Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the presidential residence in San Salvador for a major announcement:\n\nNot only would El Salvador accept and jail potentially hundreds of thousands of violent undocumented immigrants currently in the US, it would also take in \u201cdangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those of US citizenship and legal residents.\u201d\n\nThe offer was as remarkable as it was legally tenuous \u2013 with a world leader publicly discussing detaining US citizens on foreign soil.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, right, meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele at his residence at Lake Coatepeque in El Congo municipality, El Salvador, on February 3. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe State Department has said little since about what elements of the deal \u2013 if any \u2013 might be utilized. But the episode, including Prince\u2019s direct line to Bukele, reported here for the first time, demonstrates how a former pariah of Washington has newly established himself back inside Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen current and former administration officials and people close to Prince suggest that he has gained traction within the second Trump administration and is moving quickly to leverage his influence in pursuit of long-held policy beliefs, some of which could turn into big business for him.\n\nPrince was effectively expelled at the end of the first Trump administration, banned from inside the Pentagon and CIA by officials who felt his ideas for using mercenary forces around the world brought unwanted scrutiny and pushed the boundaries of legality in his bid to win government contracts, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe United Nations went on to investigate Prince over his foreign dealings, including alleged arms trafficking violations as part of a failed mercenary operation in Libya. (Prince has denied he\u2019s ever been involved in operations in Libya at any time.)\n\nBut with Trump back in office that scrutiny appears to have abated as Prince has maneuvered his way back to a position of influence.\n\nPrince has been seen repeatedly at the Pentagon for the first time since his unofficial excommunication from the building in 2020, and is angling to join two key Defense advisory boards , according to two sources familiar with the matter. That could potentially put him in regular contact with senior Pentagon officials.\n\nPrince also participates in group text chats that include senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security, State Department and the White House National Security Council, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe State Department did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nMilitary contractors as a catch-all solution\n\nPrince first gained notoriety during the Iraq War when his private contracting firm Blackwater provoked international outrage after a deadly 2007 shooting that killed Iraqi civilians.\n\nIn this October 2007 photo, Erik Prince holds up a picture showing the affect of a car bomb while testifying during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nBlackwater lost a $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company\u2019s operating license.\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s 2024 election win, Prince was quietly pitching controversial, yet familiar, ideas for executing what are now some of Trump\u2019s most challenging foreign policy directives, according to two people familiar with his thinking.\n\nPrince\u2019s latest proposals center around using his network of private contractors, including former US special forces operators, as a catch-all solution for a variety of potential Trump initiatives \u2013 from deportations to conducting operations against designated terror groups abroad, to helping secure valuable mineral deposits buried beneath foreign soil.\n\nOne 26-page proposal reviewed by CNN calls for deputizing private security contractors to swiftly deport undocumented immigrants. The proposal suggests hiring retired ICE and CBP officers, as well as retired state and local law enforcement and properly trained veterans to arrest people.\n\n\u201cEvery crisis, he finds a way to poke his nose in,\u201d said one person familiar with Prince\u2019s recent lobbying.\n\n\u201cHe is constantly presenting plans to fix national security issues with his company,\u201d another source familiar with Prince\u2019s efforts told CNN.\n\nDeported migrants queue to receive an essential items bag during the arrival of a group of deported Salvadorans at Gerencia de Atenci\u00f3n al Migrante (GAMI) on February 12, in San Salvador, El Salvador. Alex Pe\u00f1a/Getty Images\n\nPrince has recently floated a proposal to senior Trump officials to use private military contractors to help carry out operations against Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to three sources familiar with the matter. While the details of the Yemen proposal remain unclear, sources described it as an adaptation of his previous plans for using private contractors in hotspots like Afghanistan and Somalia.\n\n\u201cHe has presented the plan numerous times but it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere,\u201d one of the sources said, adding that Prince has repeatedly pitched the plan to several senior officials at the National Security Council and others in Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nAsked by CNN if he wanted to discuss his recent proposals, Prince responded: \u201cNo thank you.\u201d\n\nPrince also appears to be getting involved in Ecuador\u2019s security crackdown. President Daniel Noboa revealed in a March 11 post on Instagram that he met with the Blackwater founder to form a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d against narcoterrorism and illegal fishing. A day earlier, Noboa had announced the imminent arrival of \u201cspecial forces from abroad\u201d to tackle crime in Ecuador\u2019s most violent areas, though he did not specify their origins.\n\nThe move signals a growing role for Prince\u2019s private security firm in the country\u2019s fight against organized crime. CNN has reached out to Noboa\u2019s office for more details.\n\nBack in the US, some former officials wince at the potential of Prince being newly empowered and pitching private security contractors as a way to achieve Trump\u2019s goal of mass deportations.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just bad policy \u2013 it\u2019s a dangerous, un-American escalation,\u201d said Jason P. Houser, former ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. \u201cMass deportation plans handed to for-profit mercenaries with a record of failure and abuse abroad will devastate our communities.\u201d\n\nBackchannels to allies\n\nPrince\u2019s contact with top US officials remains largely limited to private channels and he has not yet secured a formal meeting at the White House to discuss his immigration and Yemen plans, the source added.\n\nThe Trump White House appears to be keeping Prince at arms-length, at least for now. But his activity has started to bubble into view. After Politico in February reported on Prince\u2019s proposal to use private security contractors to arrest undocumented immigrants, Trump was asked specifically about it. While he told reporters he hadn\u2019t seen the proposal, he said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be opposed.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with NewsNation last month, Prince rejected that the proposal was for a \u201cprivate army,\u201d saying: \u201cIt was a memo generated to describe how to achieve the logistics necessary to move the millions of people that they intend to deport.\u201d\n\nPrince\u2019s efforts have been encouraged by a network of close Trump allies who were, in many cases, pushed to the periphery by more establishment Republican figures in the first term \u2013 but have become critical insiders in the opening weeks of the second.\n\nSome current and former officials have quietly provided Prince their input on some of his recent proposals before he formally presents it to the White House, according to two sources briefed on the matter.\n\nAmong Prince\u2019s closest allies, sources said, are Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Prince served as a character witness for Gabbard, who spent weeks as one of the administration\u2019s more controversial cabinet nominees based on concerns from some Republican senators about her qualifications.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House on February 26, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nGabbard was confirmed last month \u2013 and is now running the same intelligence agencies that tend to consider Prince to be \u201cradioactive,\u201d in the words of one senior official, who pointed to \u201cbaggage from his time running Blackwater and conflicts of interest later.\u201d\n\n\u2018The surfing is fantastic\u2019\n\nPrince\u2019s lobbying effort intensified after Trump\u2019s win in November. In the lead-up to the January 20 inauguration, Prince sought to reestablish himself in the president\u2019s orbit, reaching out to allies helping with the transition process to float various plans for using private contractors, sources said.\n\nPrince also made multiple trips to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort during this period \u2013 joining the MAGA faithful and others seeking influence in the new administration as they paid homage to the incoming president.\n\nSources say that Prince has set his sights on becoming a sort of shadow adviser for the new administration, particularly when it comes to overhauling the US immigration system.\n\nPrince has told associates that his interest in Bukele was first sparked almost exactly one year ago at the conservative CPAC annual conference held just outside of Washington, DC, two of those associates told CNN.\n\nPrince, a member of CPAC\u2019s board, was backstage when Bukele\u2019s motorcade arrived for his scheduled speaking slot. Prince recounted how he was struck by the response of the kitchen workers and convention staff who greeted Bukele\u2019s arrival with cheers and homemade signs.\n\nThe 23-minute speech Bukele proceeded to deliver when he took the stage deftly wove together the story of his own political rise and declaration of war on his country\u2019s gangs.\n\nPresident of El Salvador Nayib Bukel greets attendees after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at Gaylord National Resort Hotel And Convention Center on February 22, 2024 in National Harbor, Maryland. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nThe crowd of conservative activists and headliners responded with a standing ovation.\n\nSix months later, Prince was in El Salvador, touring the country\u2019s notorious mega prison CECOT, which has served as the well-publicized linchpin of Bukele\u2019s frontal assault on the violent gang culture that had ravaged the country in the years preceding his first election victory.\n\nPrince told associates that he was struck by an inmate population that he viewed as \u201cdocile\u201d and totally under control of the guards despite their violent histories.\n\nThe next day, Prince met for the first time with Bukele.\n\nHe told Bukele he\u2019d seen his speech at CPAC, which he said, \u201cwas fantastic,\u201d according to a video of their meeting shared with CNN.\n\nPrince went on to say he was \u201cvery impressed\u201d by what he saw at CECOT and promised to \u201cproudly go back and tell the good news story\u201d he believed the prison represented when he returned to the US.\n\nThe idea that El Salvador could utilize an expanded version of its prison model to take on criminal undocumented immigrants from the US at a fraction of the cost of housing them at US facilities \u201cmade a lot of sense,\u201d Prince would later share with associates, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAsked about his relationship with Prince, a person familiar with Bukele\u2019s international dealings told CNN, \u201cPresident Bukele is incredibly strategic in his business and diplomatic dealings. He wouldn\u2019t enter a deal with someone like Prince if he believed it\u2019d lead to a divide between El Salvador and the United States. This is something he\u2019d thoroughly vet before moving forward with any private contracting agreements.\u201d\n\nPrince also shared his appreciation for another part of El Salvador\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe surfing is fantastic,\u201d Prince would later say during an episode of his podcast, \u201cOff Leash.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a fantastic surfing culture on the pacific coast \u2013 very cheap, good food and some really cool surfing resorts.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s David Culver contributed to this report."

We're not having electricity outages. We're not having lines of gas stations.\"\n\nThe U.S. was breaking records for the most fossil fuels ever drilled under Trump's predecessor. In 2023, the Biden administration produced 12.9 million barrels per day, breaking the record set in 2019 at 12.3 million barrels, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For the last several years, the U.S. has been the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\n\n\"There's no crisis or emergency by any conventional standard or use of the word,\" Noah Kaufman, a senior researcher at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told ABC News.\n\nThe Par Montana refinery along the Yellowstone River that processes crude oil from western Canada is seen, Feb. 26, 2025, just outside Billings, Mont.

The U.S. may be the largest exporter of natural gas in the world, but global demand is falling -- with countries in Europe and Asia decreasing their use of fossil fuels as renewables such as wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles, eat away at the demand for fossil fuels, Nemet said.\n\n\"It's cheaper and more energy secure for them to use renewable power,\" Howarth said.\n\nTrump's attempts to bring oil and gas back to the forefront will set the U.S. behind compared to other G2 countries and their climate goals. the experts said.

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s most important moves among the many important moves that he has made in his first two months in office are those that restored the hard line he had taken towards China in his first term, a very firm line that has quickly been put back in its place of defining priority for our foreign policy and national security. Trump began with his support at the Pentagon and in Congress for defense spending re-focused for the Indo-Pacific region and with tariffs on imports from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n\n\nThe tariff arguments with Mexico, Canada and the European Union can be resolved over the negotiating table. But not so the competition between the superpowers. That competition will hopefully never become an armed conflict, but it would almost certainly have become one if American indifference to the ambitions of the PRC continued.\n\n\n\nThe United States finally began to develop a strategy for containing China\u2019s global ambitions in the first Trump term. All of that effort was wasted by a disastrous four years of a leaderless country during the regency years of Joe Biden\u2019s infirmity.\n\nCHINA, REACTING TO TRUMP TARIFFS, PROMISES TO \u2018FIGHT TILL THE END\u2019 IN TRADE WAR \u2018OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF WAR\u2019\n\n\n\nNow the second part of the first American counter-China strategy is rolling out and it begins with our massive investment in our sea services and our on-shoring of the critical production lines abandoned to our adversary over four decades. President Trump speaks very softly and respectfully about General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping. That is the correct tone for superpower diplomacy. But Trump\u2019s respect for the Chinese dictator\u2019s power is as certain as is his resolve to counter it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all fell for the open secret that Deng Xiaoping proclaimed as China\u2019s key principle during his long run as the PRC\u2019s leader: \"Hide your strength, bide your time.\" Quietly, consistently, China built its economic strength and then its military strength. America\u2019s China lobby helped the process of China\u2019s astonishing growth until Trump arrived on the scene.\n\n\n\nNo documentary source has ever been found for the saying, often attributed to Vladimir Lenin, that \"the Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them,\" but it served nicely as an explanation for the early decades of the Soviet Union\u2019s growth and it most certainly applies to America\u2019s China policy after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R.\n\n\n\nNot now. Never again for the foreseeable future in all likelihood. In early February Trump put a 10% tariff in place against goods from China and China quickly issued retaliatory tariffs. In early March, Trump upped the U.S.\u2019s tariff on China by 25%. More retaliation from China followed.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t expect this confrontation to be toned down or delayed. America has one peer competitor on the world stage across all domains and it is China, and China\u2019s hostility to us and our allies is open and ongoing. The espionage effort against us is vast and has gone mostly unchecked during the Biden years of fog and mumbling. The FBI under Trump raided and shut down the PRC\u2019s Houston consulate. The FBI under Biden raided Mar-a-Lago. Trump is back and new FBI Director Kash Patel will hopefully not disappoint when it comes to CCP espionage.\n\n\n\nThere is talk of summits between Trump and Xi. Fine. Richard Nixon met with both Leonid Brezhnev and Mao. Summits can keep the crises away, conflict below the kinetic level. Both China and Russia have vast nuclear arsenals and emerging new technologies, though not as large or as lethal as ours. It\u2019s good to keep everyone focused on that basic fact set and to not lose sight of our need to keep our guard up there.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nAnd Trump is not a chump of course. He\u2019d rather the competition with China be contained and controlled but he won\u2019t be rolled and he won\u2019t be sold word salad at a summit or three. Trump leaves the table when there is no deal to be had and there is no significant deal to be had with the Chinese Communist Party, which has gone hard-line for the dozen years of Xi\u2019s increasingly iron-fisted rule. Trump has never not seen Xi clearly for who he is or how tough an adversary he has become.\n\n\n\nAdmiral Mark Montgomery (USN, Ret.) talked at some length with me this week about the outline of the long-term strategy for dealing with China. Watch that discussion here.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhat the admiral pointed out to me is that I had seen, but not understood the significance of the visit of the president of Taiwan Semiconductor to the White House. When President Trump shook hands with C.C. Wei, chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington on March 3, that was the signal through all the noise. Along with the China tariffs, along with Trump\u2019s emphasis on the Navy, Marine Corps and shipbuilding, here was a deft delivery of some diplomacy.\n\nThe number one bestseller on the New York Times non-fiction list a week back was Senator Tom Cotton\u2019s new \"Seven Things You Can\u2019t Say About China.\" The senator from Arkansas is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the third ranking member of the GOP conference. He doesn\u2019t speak for the president, of course, but Cotton does speak with Trump. They get along. That\u2019s a very good thing, for if even half of Trump\u2019s and Cotton\u2019s shared, clear-eyed understanding of China spreads throughout Team Trump, the country will be prepared for Trump\u2019s most important fight among many important fights, one that will have to be carried consistently forward for decades.\n\nHugh Hewitt is host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

            "full_content": "Jen Psaki speaks with senior producer Will Rabbe at MSNBC. Photo: Alyssa Schukar/Redux\n\nIf you were to start a media organization in 2025, probably the last thing it would be is a cable-news network. Younger audiences are fleeing television, making cable news a decidedly geriatric business. Earlier this year, CNN said it would eliminate about 200 jobs in its traditional TV operations while adding around the same number for digital positions. And yet building a cable-news channel from the ground up is basically what MSNBC is about to do.\n\nWhen it was announced this past November that Comcast would be spinning off MSNBC \u2014 along with CNBC, E!, and other cable channels \u2014 from NBCUniversal, questions abounded about what the decision would mean for the progressive network. While MSNBC is best known for brainy talking heads like Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes, for nearly three decades it has relied on NBC News for the newsgathering and verification that undergird a lot of its programming. Under SpinCo, the unfortunate provisional name for the new company, would MSNBC just become a pure opinion play? Was MSNBC being set free or cut loose?\n\nMSNBC\u2019s new president, Rebecca Kutler, seemed to answer that question last week when she announced that MSNBC would be building out an independent reporting operation, led by veteran executive Scott Matthews. The network will be hiring more than 100 journalists \u2014 from field producers to correspondents to photographers \u2014 to work across the operation, which will include a bureau in Washington (for which it\u2019s looking for a bureau chief) and a newsroom in New York.\n\nWhat MSNBC is doing is a bright spot for the news industry right now. It\u2019s also an unprecedented experiment in real time in making a cable-news operation that works. \u201cIf you stripped all of these institutions from the systems that created them and remade them in contemporary times, you would do a lot of shit differently. And that\u2019s sort of what SpinCo gets to do,\u201d one senior news executive said. \u201cYes, the economics look different. But they\u2019re not assigned the same rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually think building a news organization from scratch is a really fun idea in this day and age, because, first of all, there\u2019re a lot of good people available, and you can craft a pretty good news organization for a pretty reasonable amount of money,\u201d said former CNN president and NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Zucker. MSNBC is \u201cgoing to actually be building and growing and unencumbered by having to worry about what NBC News thinks about it.\u201d\n\nOthers are more skeptical. \u201cIf it has 100 journalists, that\u2019ll be more than it\u2019s ever had there,\u201d said one longtime news executive. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different animal, and that\u2019s not what it\u2019s built to do.\u201d\n\nThe end product won\u2019t actually look a whole lot different from how it looks today: MSNBC will still be doing a lot of resistance bait, in the mornings, at night, and on weekends. Still, the enterprise journalism it commissions will drive shows throughout the day, offering plenty of opportunities for an openly progressive network to blanket stories that Fox News won\u2019t touch or CNN may be wary of owning, such as the ongoing detention of activist Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nThis is the first time that MSNBC, backed by a $7 billion corporate parent, gets to build something bespoke to its audience. As a prominent talent agent put it: \u201cWithout the pressures of shareholders, stock prices, or external investments, the challenge now is about threading the needle: How does it balance investment in television, where it still makes the majority of its money, while knowing it\u2019s a declining asset, against strategic investments in other growth opportunities?\u201d\n\nLaunching the news operation is the biggest development for MSNBC so far under Kutler, who after more than two decades at CNN joined the network as senior vice-president of content strategy in 2022 and became head of MSNBC in February. \u201cRebecca was tied into most talent decisions at CNN,\u201d another talent executive noted. \u201cShe worked closely with Jeff and cultivated a ton of relationships \u2014 with talent, with contributors, with producers. And a lot of people want to work for her.\u201d\n\nNot least because of her no-bullshit approach to the job \u2014 in her first major change as president, Kutler last month announced an overhaul to MSNBC\u2019s lineup that included canceling Joy Reid\u2019s 7 p.m. show. While Reid has complained that her show \u201chad value\u201d and implied that it was canceled for her outspoken positions on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement, it has often been MSNBC\u2019s lowest-rated show in prime time. Reid will be replaced by a panel hosted by Symone D. Sanders Townsend, Michael Steele, and Alicia Menendez, while Jen Psaki, one of MSNBC\u2019s biggest stars, will take Alex Wagner\u2019s place as host of the 9 p.m. slot. (Wagner will remain with the network as a contributor.) Kutler has also brought on Eugene Daniels (currently a White House correspondent for Politico) and Jacqueline Alemany (currently a White House reporter at the Washington Post), who will co-host a weekend show alongside Jonathan Capehart, and Catherine Rampell (also from the Post), who will join Ayman Mohyeldin in the evenings on the weekend. In addition to the 100-plus journalists the network is hiring for the new newsgathering operation, MSNBC internally posted 100 jobs related to programming when it made the lineup changes a few weeks ago.\n\nFor all the talk of TV\u2019s long-term decline, there\u2019s still money to be made. \u201cWe live in a much more digital era when individual brands and people are enjoying all kinds of success on both sides of the aisle,\u201d one longtime TV executive acknowledged. \u201cHaving said that, Fox News has enjoyed a complete renaissance since the election, and frankly MSNBC still has huge audiences even if they are principally over the age of 65,\u201d they said. \u201cThese are still, even in their diminished state, very profitable businesses.\u201d\n\nAnd MSNBC could grow more profitable still, at least in the short to medium term, thanks to a bottomless desire for anti-Trump content that has lifted up podcasts and Substacks alike. Following a dip after the election, MSNBC has seen growth since Trump\u2019s inauguration. From January 20 to March 7, the channel averaged 1.4 million viewers in weekday prime time, compared to 739,000 viewers for the immediate post-election period, a 95 percent increase. Across the whole day, there was a 44 percent increase in viewership. Even Morning Joe has bounced back after a calamitous overture to Trump shortly after the election, with Joe and Mika hammering the president daily. As a senior news executive put it, \u201cThe audience wants to hear every day that this is not normal; this is not acceptable. And if you lose the thread, you lose credibility. And that\u2019s the whole fuckin\u2019 game.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also plenty of room to diversify. MSNBC is looking closely at starting a streaming service (you can find it on Peacock at the moment) as well as growing its audio and live-events businesses. Digital is also, obviously, a priority, and MSNBC has a strong presence on YouTube, seeing 325 million viewers in February and finishing 2024 as the No. 1 news brand on all of YouTube, per an MSNBC spokesperson.\n\nMSNBC is also looking at partnering with political brands and voices who have built-in audiences, I\u2019m told. There\u2019s no shortage of left-leaning content creators who might fit the bill, such as The Bulwark\u2019s Tim Miller (an MSNBC contributor) and the folks at MeidasTouch. Whether such creators have incentive to cater to TV is a different matter. \u201cWhy would any YouTuber want to go to MSNBC?\u201d one longtime news executive noted. \u201cIt\u2019s a smaller audience for them.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nTim Walz is headed back out on the road \u2013 this time, for a tour of House districts represented by Republicans who have stopped holding in-person town halls amid the raucous receptions some of their colleagues have gotten across the country.\n\nThe Minnesota governor and 2024 vice presidential candidate will start on Friday in Iowa, in the district represented by Rep. Zach Nunn, then head across the border to Nebraska, for the district represented by Rep. Don Bacon \u2013 both of whom won tight races for re-election last year. Walz\u2019s team is already planning stops in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ohio for the coming weeks, with more stops expected to be added.\n\nGiven his national profile after his time on the Democratic ticket last year, Walz said he felt obligated to step up.\n\n\u201cThere was just a primal scream of folks recognizing what\u2019s going on with the Trump administration, their authoritarian tendencies, and what they viewed was a lack of a proper response from their representatives,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cIt was about these Republican representatives recognizing this stuff\u2019s really unpopular, so they\u2019re going to quit the town halls. These folks need to be heard. They need to be heard, and to be candid with you, Democratic leadership needs to hear them.\u201d\n\nWalz\u2019s plans started with a post last week on X, responding to House Republican leaders who advised their colleagues to stop holding town halls. Republicans have accused those town halls of being packed with paid activists \u2013 though those making such accusations haven\u2019t provided any evidence or explanations of why Democratic members\u2019 town halls have also been packed.\n\nWalz said he\u2019d been overwhelmed by the response to that tweet, and his staff has been sifting through what an aide told CNN was hundreds of invitations from local party leaders and candidates asking him to come. He said he found that response reassuring after he and Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\n\u201cI always feared that they would become apathetic after this last election and just check out, but they are not doing that,\u201d Walz said.\n\nOther than independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has taken two swings of his own through the Midwest in the past month, no major Democratic leaders have been stepping forward with similar kinds of public events. Walz chalked that up in part to his party \u201ctrying to find our feet,\u201d but the situation clearly frustrates him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d he said, referencing the Trump administration\u2019s moves to dismantle the Department of Education as a prime example. \u201cI\u2019m going to say ways that they can mobilize to fight back, ways that I think are the most effective ways. And I fully expect them to tell me ways that they\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nAs the Tea Party rose through a different set of town hall protests in the 2010 election cycle, Walz was a congressman in a tight district running for a third term. He won, but that experience was a rough one, he said, and he warned Republicans now to ignore what\u2019s happening at their own peril.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a catalyst to provide them a megaphone to lift up their voice. And I think that\u2019s what people are looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand now my responsibility. I have a little more of a national voice, so I should bring it to them, and I\u2019m going to basically be handing the megaphone to them.\u201d\n\nBut he said when Democrats are \u201cjust being a foil to Trump, we are not crossing into that space we need to, to have them believe us, to know what we stand for.\u201d\n\nAfter going deliberately quiet in the months after the campaign \u2013 following a largely low-profile role as running mate that sources say was designed by the Harris campaign leadership \u2013 Walz has been stepping out more in recent weeks.\n\nMany expect Walz to run for a third term as governor next year, and he downplayed the suggestion that this effort was laying the groundwork for a future national run.\n\n\u201cI will do anything possible to make sure that we win in \u201828. I do not need to be on that ticket,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s not my pursuit here. My pursuit is that I am still in a position where I have a platform and I have some power to make a difference, and if 20 people show up that\u2019s good by me because those 20 people are making a difference. This isn\u2019t about drawing a crowd. I\u2019ll go to states where it wouldn\u2019t matter, but it matters to those people. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d"
