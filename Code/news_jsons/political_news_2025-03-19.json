Reilly, Erik Ortiz, Lawrence Hurley and Allan Smith\n\nThe federal judge at odds with the White House over its immigration enforcement and now the target of impeachment calls driven by President Donald Trump is a bipartisan appointee whose three-decade career in Washington, D.C., has included cases that have favored Trump.\n\nJames Boasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia since 2023, drew Trump\u2019s ire after he temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s effort to carry out migrant deportations by plane over the weekend under a rarely used wartime law.\n\nIn an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News, Trump mentioned impeaching Boasberg, whom he slighted as a \u201clocal judge.\u201d Trump earlier pressed for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment in a social media post and branded him a \u201cradical left lunatic, a troublemaker and agitator.\u201d\n\nThose who know Boasberg and his record insist he is anything but.\n\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush nominated Boasberg as an associate judge of the D.C. Superior Court. In 2011, President Barack Obama selected him to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and he was confirmed by the Senate in a 96-0 vote.\n\nA Washington attorney who frequently appeared before Boasberg, 62, called him an \u201cextremely conscientious\u201d judge who was \u201cvery much down the center\u201d and committed to getting things right.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s known among lawyers and his colleagues to be a brilliant judge,\u201d the lawyer said, speaking anonymously to avoid being seen as pandering to the judge.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nRelated: Judge warns of possible \u2018consequences\u2019 after DOJ push back on questions about deportation flights, Gary Grumbach, Megan Lebowitz and Dareh Gregorian\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWhat the JFK files do \u2013 and don't \u2013 reveal\n\nBy Andrea Mitchell\n\nScholars and conspiracy theorists have spent the last 24 hours going through unannotated PDFs, including some illegible handwritten notes from the FBI and the CIA, about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nPrompted in part by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson\u2019s and his own affinity for the Kennedy assassination, Trump signed an executive order on his fourth day in office to release as many as 80,000 pages of documents from the JFK files in the National Archives, unredacted, a process that began Tuesday evening. During his first visit this week to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which Trump has taken over as chair, he told a reporter, \u201cYou got a lot of reading.\u201d\n\nWhat has been delivered so far has fallen far short of the promise. In the pages that have been released, many of which involved grand jury testimony and tax filings, information was still redacted. None of the documents were catalogued or annotated. And much of what the pages contained was already known from other sources.\n\nThe documents did include surveillance reports on Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s trips to the Soviet Union and Finland, his months spent in Mexico City leading up to the assassination and his anger at Kennedy when he was denied a visa to Cuba, where he wanted to defect.\n\nAnd there is fascinating new material about a covert CIA operation in New York City during the Cold War to open as many as a half-million letters and packages a month to and from the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nWill the release of the JFK files ultimately resolve more than 60 years of doubts about the Warren Report\u2019s conclusion that Oswald acted alone? It\u2019s not likely.\n\nExperts like the University of Virginia\u2019s Larry Sabato said the CIA withheld other documents from the National Archives that weren\u2019t subject to the Trump-ordered release. Other materials, including FBI surveillance recordings of Oswald, have been destroyed.\n\n\u201cI believe Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots. I think all the evidence points in that direction. The question that will never be fully answered is whether he received encouragement or assistance in any way from some other agent, some other organization,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cThese documents will not eliminate that possibility. If anything, it\u2019ll provide fuel to the fire.\u201d\n\nJFK\u2019s grandson, Jack Schlossberg, added blistering commentary on X over all this, posting sharp criticism of Trump\u2019s policies and accusing him of \u201cbeing obsessed with my grandfather \u2014 but not in his life or what he achieved in it.\u201d\n\nPOLL: Do you plan to sift through the JFK files?

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants while refusing to reveal their identities or the evidence against them, prompting complaints from the migrants\u2019 families and from critics who say the administration is trampling on civil liberties.\n\nThe administration says its invocation of a rarely used wartime authority to speed up deportations serves to protect Americans from the \u201cextraordinary threat\u201d posed by suspected gang members who the president has designated as foreign terrorists.\n\nBut administration officials have provided little information that could allow outsiders to independently assess its claims that scores of immigrants who were deported from the country last weekend are affiliated with violent gangs or have extensive criminal records.\n\nSome relatives of the presumed deported migrants, meanwhile, have described a murky and ham-fisted process that disappeared people they say have no ties to organized crime, leaving them isolated from loved ones and legal advocates.\n\nAsked Wednesday by a reporter why the administration wouldn\u2019t share basic information about the detainees, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would not \u201creveal operational details about a counter-terrorism operation,\u201d but added it has \u201cthe highest degree of confidence in our ICE agents.\u201d\n\nYet earlier in that same briefing, Leavitt touted the capture in Mexico of Francisco Javier Rom\u00e1n-Bardales, an alleged senior member of MS-13 who is expected to be delivered to the United States to face charges that include conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists.\n\nThe weekend deportations were roundly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups who accused the administration of acting outside its authority.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said Trump\u2019s administration was \u201cdeporting immigrants without due process, based solely on their nationality.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourts determine whether people have broken the law,\u201d the senator said on X. \u201cNot a President acting solo\u2026 and not immigration agents cherry-picking who gets imprisoned or deported.\u201d\n\nIn a declaration filed in federal court earlier this week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said agents \u201ccarefully vetted\u201d the gang affiliations of each of the 261 deportees and provided broad descriptions of crimes that several of them have been arrested for or convicted of in the United States and abroad.\n\nBut in that same declaration, ICE Acting Field Office Director Robert L. Cerna acknowledged that many of the deportees \u201cdo not have criminal records in the United States.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is because they have only been in the United States for a short period of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat,\u201d Cerna wrote in the declaration, saying the dearth of information about them instead \u201cactually highlights the risk they pose. \u2026 It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\u201d\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request asking them to provide identifying information about some of the migrants described in that declaration. But the governments of both the United States and El Salvador have released videos that depict some of them. The mother of one of the presumed deportees told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that she recognized her son in media released by the Salvadoran government and denied he belonged to any gang.\n\nIn what it described as an effort at transparency, the Trump administration provided a breakdown of the 261 immigrants who were deported to a prison in El Salvador under an agreement with the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele. The administration said 137 of those immigrants were deported pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law which grants the president broad authority to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation during wartime.\n\nThe invocation of that law set up an ongoing showdown between the executive and judicial branches that could plunge the United States into a constitutional crisis if the Trump administration decides to openly defy a court order. Trump has said in recent interviews that he wouldn\u2019t do so.\n\nA judge over the weekend temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s ability to invoke that law to quickly deport migrants, causing Trump to suggest that judge should be impeached. Trump\u2019s statements about the judge in turn caused Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare rebuke of the president.\n\nAnother 101 of the immigrants were Venezuelans who were being expelled under regular immigration laws, officials said. And the other 23 were members of MS-13, another gang.\n\nTrump has suggested that the United States is being invaded by foreign criminal organizations including Tren de Aragua, whose members he has designated as foreign terrorists.\n\nThe administration has faced other questions about whether it has overstated the risks posed by some deportees. Senior Trump administration officials previously said that the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay would be reserved for the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d but court declarations from administration officials would later reveal dozens of people held at the base were considered low-to-medium risk.\n\nCNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nArticles about the Holocaust, September 11, cancer awareness, sexual assault and suicide prevention are among the tens of thousands either removed or flagged for removal from Pentagon websites as the department has scrambled to comply with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s order to scrub \u201cdiversity\u201d content from all its platforms.\n\nA database obtained by CNN shows that more than 24,000 articles could be purged, with many gone already. The scrub goes well beyond just the removal of images from the Pentagon\u2019s visual database, known as DVIDS, and includes articles from across more than 1,000 websites hosted by the department.\n\nThe Pentagon previously said in a memo last month that it would be removing news and feature articles promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) content.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said in a statement Wednesday that the Defense Department was \u201cpleased by the rapid compliance\u201d across the Pentagon with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms.\n\n\u201cIn the rare cases that content is removed \u2013 either deliberately or by mistake \u2013 that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content so it recognizes our heroes for their dedicated service alongside their fellow Americans, period.\u201d\n\nBut dozens of the articles either flagged for removal or removed already \u2014 but still accessible via the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback machine \u2014 and reviewed by CNN have no ostensible connection to DEI programs; race theory; gender ideology or identity-based programs.\n\nAt least half a dozen articles already removed are about the Holocaust and now have the word \u201cDEI\u201d in their URL.\n\nThose include an article about Holocaust survivor Kitty Saks, which remembers the Holocaust as \u201cthe state-sponsored, systemic persecution and annihilation of European Jewry\u201d; an article about Holocaust Remembrance Week; and an article titled \u201cA Cadet\u2019s Perspective: Holocaust Days of Remembrance.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, told CNN that \u201cwe are concerned by reports that the Department of Defense has removed Holocaust-related content, including survivor stories, under the label of \u2018DEI.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHonoring the memory of the Holocaust and those who survived is not a matter of political ideology \u2014 it is a moral imperative and a vital component of education, remembrance, and the fight against antisemitism,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cThe history of the Holocaust, including the liberation of the camps, also reflects the bravery and sacrifice of Allied soldiers \u2014 a legacy that should be preserved, not erased. We urge the DoD to reverse this decision and preserve these vital historical records.\u201d\n\nThis photo from the US Air Force shows Kitty Saks, a Holocaust survivor, displaying the star she wore during the Holocaust to distinguish her Jewish faith in her home in Norfolk, Virginia, in April 2016. An article about Saks posted to a US Air Force website has been removed as part of the Pentagon's effort to remove \"news and feature articles promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) content.\" This photo is still available on the military's Defense Visual Information Distribution Service. Airman 1st Class Kaylee Dubois/US Air Force/DVIDS\n\nArticles related to September 11 remembrance, including service members reflecting on their service and where they were that day, have also been removed. So have articles about cancer awareness, including those related to Breast Cancer Awareness month and colon cancer awareness.\n\nOne such article authored by an Air Force Surgeon General titled, \u201cA healthy lifestyle lowers your risk of getting breast cancer,\u201d was removed and now has \u201cDEI\u201d in its URL.\n\nSeveral articles about sexual assault have also been removed and now have \u201cDEI\u201d in their URL, including \u201cApril is Sexual Assault Awareness Month\u201d and \u201cA call to action \u2013 Three ways to combat sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThis webpage, which previously hosted an article titled, \"Sexual Assault Response Coordinator focused on victim care,\" has been removed and replaced with a \"Page Not Found\" message. From US Air Force Homestead Air Reserve Base\n\nArticles about suicide prevention have been purged, too, including ones titled: \u201cVA releases veteran suicide statistics by state\u201d; \u201cSuicide prevention alliance focuses on troops, veterans\u201d; and \u201cSuicide Prevention Resources That Can Help.\u201d The latter two articles now feature \u201cDEI\u201d in their URLs.\n\nThe content either removed or flagged for removal also includes thousands of articles about contributions made to the military over the years by women, LGBTQ people, people of color and historical figures like Jackie Robinson, who served in the US military during World War II.\n\nMuch of the content has been scrubbed not by individual units, but by an automated script run by DoD\u2019s public web administrators, according to an email explaining the process that was obtained by CNN and three defense officials familiar with the matter. That appears to align with Hegseth\u2019s February 27 memo, which said that DoD\u2019s media arm, Defense Media Activity, \u201cwill support systematic content removal\u201d from across the Pentagon\u2019s many platforms.\n\nThat automated process has led to \u201ca high level of irresponsible collateral damage,\u201d one of the defense officials said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the scope and the carelessness of \u2018unpublishing\u2019 that\u2019s happened,\u201d the official said.\n\nAnother of the defense officials said that the Pentagon understands that the process needs a significant course-correction and is now undergoing a more thorough review of what has been purged to determine if it should be republished.\n\n\u201cBecause of these series of events, the department recognizes that this needs to be a more deliberative process involving human beings to ensure that a thorough review of content is completed,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis may take more time than originally planned.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a letter to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations on a new nuclear deal, made clear that Iran has a two-month deadline to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter\u2019s contents told CNN.\n\nThe directive comes as Trump has said he would like to reach a deal with Iran to gain more control over their nuclear capabilities. Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff delivered the letter to the president of the United Arab Emirates Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan while he was in Abu Dhabi last week, the source said. The UAE later gave the letter to the Iranians.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump made it clear to Ayatollah Khamenei that he wanted to resolve the dispute over Iran\u2019s nuclear program diplomatically \u2013 and very soon \u2013 and if this was not possible, there would be other ways to resolve the dispute,\u201d a spokesman for the National Security Council Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN.\n\nAxios was the first to report on the contents of the letter.\n\nTrump also discussed a potential nuclear deal with Iran during his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, according to a White House readout of the call.\n\nThe readout stated that Trump and Putin \u201cspoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts. They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel,\u201d the readout continued.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump told Fox News that there \u201care two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I\u2019m not looking to hurt Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I hope you\u2019re going to negotiate, because it\u2019s going to be a lot better for Iran,\u2019 and I think they want to get that letter \u2013 the alternative is we have to do something, because you can\u2019t let them have a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump added.\n\nIt is unclear how the US would respond if Iran fails to enter direct talks regarding its nuclear program. However, senior US officials have not ruled out potential military action, whether through the US or Israel, on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in the future.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Trump withdrew from the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and ordered a US-led strike on Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, leading to further backlash from Tehran.\n\nTrump, in his second term, has returned to his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Iran, in an effort to isolate the country economically and diplomatically.\n\nKhamenei recently said calls for negotiations by \u201cbully states\u201d are aimed at dominating others, not resolving issues.\n\n\u201cThe insistence on the part of some bully states on negotiations is not to resolve issues, but to dominate and impose their own expectations,\u201d Khamenei said this month, as cited by Iranian state media outlets."

The researchers have also lost access to all critical resources, like satellite imaging, needed to collect evidence of war crimes.\n\nThe database included information not only on the abduction of the Ukrainian children, but on other Russian war crimes as well: attacks on energy infrastructure, attacks on civilian infrastructure, and destruction of cultural sites, the source said.\n\nThe database was specifically structured to pull together relevant elements for prosecution of war crimes, the source said. It is unclear who has access to the database, what will happen to the critical evidence it holds, and whether it will be able to be shared with the entities like the European Union law enforcement agency Europol.\n\nAccording to the letter from House lawmakers, Yale\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) \u2013 which had been conducting research for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory \u2013 \u201ccompiled three reports, sourced from satellite imagery and biometric data, tracking identities and locations of over 30,000 children from Ukraine at dozens of locations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis data is absolutely crucial to Ukraine\u2019s efforts to return their children home,\u201d the lawmakers said in the letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Wednesday.\n\nThe importance of returning \u201cthe forcibly transferred Ukrainian children\u201d was a key topic in the meeting between top US and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah earlier this month, according to a joint statement after the meeting. In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Wednesday, President Donald Trump asked \u201cabout the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted,\u201d according to a statement about the call. \u201cPresident Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s letter, led by Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, noted that the evidence was being preserved \u201cto be shared with Europol and the government of Ukraine to secure their return.\u201d\n\n\u201cYale HRL\u2019s funding has been terminated and the status of the secure evidence repository is unknown. This vital resource cannot be lost,\u201d it said.\n\nThe lawmakers said they have \u201creason to believe that the data from the repository has been permanently deleted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf true, this would have devastating consequences,\u201d wrote the 17 lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.\n\nBruce and another State Department spokesperson said the data had not been deleted.\n\n\u201cThe State Department does not hold the data for the Conflict Observatory. The data resides on a platform owned by MITRE as part of the program,\u201d the unnamed spokesperson said, referring questions to the non-profit organization MITRE.\n\n\u201cTo the best of MITRE\u2019s knowledge and belief, the research data that was compiled has not been deleted and is currently maintained by a former partner on this contract. Department of State has been made aware of data disposition,\u201d MITRE told CNN."

            "full_content": "TORONTO -- China executed an unspecified number of Canadians earlier this year, Canada's government said Wednesday. Such executions of Westerners are relatively rare.\n\nCanada's Global Affairs office declined to say how many people or give names. Beijing's embassy in Ottawa said the executions were due to drug crimes but declined to provide details. The embassy noted that China does not recognize dual citizenship.\n\n\u201cCanada repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere,\u201d Global Affairs spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said in a statement.\n\nMacLeod said they continue to provide consular assistance to families and requested that media respect their privacy. She said Ottawa continues to advocate for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian who was sentenced to death for drug smuggling.\n\n\u201cChina always impose severe penalties on drug-related crimes,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said. \u201cThe facts of the crimes committed by the Canadian nationals involved in the cases are clear, and the evidence is solid and sufficient.\u201d\n\nChina is believed to execute more prisoners each year than the rest of the world combined, though the total is a state secret. Executions are traditionally carried out by gunshot, though lethal injections have been introduced in recent years.\n\nThe embassy spokesperson said Beijing \u201cfully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned,\" and urged Canada's government to \u201cstop making irresponsible remarks.\u201d\n\nThe two countries have some tensions. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports earlier this month, after Canada imposed duties in October on Chinese-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminum products. The tariffs add to global trade tensions amid rounds of tariff announcements by the United States, China, Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cChina is sending us a message that we have to take steps if we want to see an improvement in the relationship,\u201d said a former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques.\n\nChina is Canada\u2019s second largest trading partner, but relations been bad since Canadian authorities in 2018 arrested a former Huawei executive who the U.S. had charged with fraud.\n\nChina jailed two Canadians shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, on a U.S. extradition request. They were sent back to Canada in 2021, the same day Meng returned to China after reaching a deal with U.S. authorities in her case.\n\nMany countries called China\u2019s action \u201chostage politics,\u201d while China described the charges against Huawei and Meng as a politically motivated attempt to hold back China\u2019s economic and technological development."

            "full_content": "Come together \u2026 over me! Photo: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen you think about it, J.D. Vance has one of the tougher jobs in American politics: being the faithful understudy to the greatest narcissist ever to hold the presidency. Not only must he support the Sun King through thick and through thin, he must also avoid stealing any of the limelight from the jealous god who lifted him to the Senate with a crucial endorsement and then to his current position as heir apparent. Vance\u2019s role as initiator in the Oval Office mugging of Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a job well done; the subtext of the whole incident was the Ukrainian president\u2019s lack of gratitude to Donald Trump.\n\nWhat is apparently Vance\u2019s next major chore for his benefactor is even more crucial, and better yet, isn\u2019t likely to attract too many flattering headlines: He\u2019s appointed himself the healer of the MAGA movement\u2019s breach between \u201cpopulists\u201d and the billionaire tech bros who helped finance the Trump-Vance campaign and are now dictating a vast number of public policies.\n\nAs Vance himself suggested in a \u201cunity\u201d speech he delivered during a conference organized by the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, he is \u201ca proud member of both tribes.\u201d After all, he came to national notoriety as the embodiment of the struggling white working class via his Hillbilly Elegy memoir, but then became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and beneficiary of Silicon Valley reactionary pioneer Peter Thiel, who blazed the path to MAGA prominence now trod by Elon Musk and so many others. He\u2019ll need both \u201cwings\u201d of the movement if he wants to succeed Trump as MAGA chieftain and president. And he can also do his boss a solid by quieting some of the infighting that bubbles beneath the surface of Team Trump\u2019s aggressive pursuit of its agenda.\n\nThe most notable public indication of the rift occurred last December, when a spat broke out between populist social-media figure Laura Loomer and DOGE co-founder Vivek Ramaswamy over the obscure but highly symbolic issue of H1-B visas, which are issued to attract highly skilled immigrants, particularly in the technology field. Ramaswamy inflamed the dispute by arguing that H1-Bs were made necessary by the inferior quality of American labor. But then his buddy and DOGE rival Musk stepped in and escalated matters as only he could do in a response to a tweet from a Loomer ally:\n\nThe reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.\n\n\n\nTake a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot\u2026 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 28, 2024\n\nThen Steve Bannon, the OG populist of MAGA-land, counter-escalated, as my colleague Chas Danner noted at the time:\n\nBannon, posting on right-wing X competitor Gettr, screencapped Musk\u2019s tweet and added, \u201cSomeone please notify \u2018Child Protective Services\u2019 \u2014 need to do a \u2018wellness check\u2019 on this toddler.\u201d\n\nBannon later told an Italian newspaper: \u201cHe is a truly evil guy, a very bad guy. I made it my personal thing to take this guy down.\u201d\n\nAs things threatened to spin out of control on the very brink of Trump\u2019s triumphal return to power, Trump signaled agreement with Musk and Ramaswamy on H1-B visas, and the \u201cMAGA civil war\u201d died down. But given the new administration\u2019s assault on nearly every form of legal as well as illegal immigration, the issue may not have gone away forever.\n\nAt the conference, as Politico reported, Vance asked populists and tech bros to keep their eyes on the prize: their common enemies.\n\nBoth our working people, our populists and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy\u201d \u2014 namely \u201c40 years of failed economic policies\u201d that enabled globalization \u2014 and the same goal: a \u201cgreat American industrial renaissance\u201d that uses innovation to boost worker productivity and drives wage gains.\n\nAs the New York Times noted, the veep argued Trump\u2019s agenda would scratch backs on both sides of the populist/tech-bro barricades. \u201cWe can only win by doing what we always did,\u201d he said. \u201cProtecting our workers and supporting our innovators, and doing both of those things at the same time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s easier said than done. Much of what the \u201cinnovators\u201d are trying to accomplish via DOGE and legislation in Congress involves their triune goals of deep tax cuts, deregulation, and slashing federal spending, including popular services and benefits. Yes, \u201cworkers\u201d may be cut in on some of the bonanza via tax breaks on tips, overtime work, and Social Security benefits. And everyone in MAGA-land can celebrate the pain of \u201cdeep state\u201d bureaucrats and woke university administrators. But ultimately the tech-bro vision of a nation largely run like a corporation by their own selves, deploying AI and discarding excess labor as inefficient, isn\u2019t compatible with any kind of \u201cpopulism.\u201d And conversely, the protectionism and nativism beloved of right-wing populists everywhere and at every time is not really compatible with the so-called innovators\u2019 thirst for free-flowing capital and inexpensive labor.\n\nThe other problem with Vance\u2019s plan to keep the two MAGA wings yoked to the same team is that tensions will likely intensify if, as seems likely, Trump\u2019s agenda becomes increasingly unpopular among the general public. How much political capital will populists want to expend on maximizing high-end tax cuts or slashing their own federal benefits? How hard will tech bros fight for high tariffs that upset their Wall Street colleagues and allies? Will populists go to the wall to defend Elon Musk, who considers beneficiaries of wildly popular entitlement programs \u201cthe parasite class\u201d? How long with tech bros hide their contempt for blue-collar workers as anything other than cannon fodder in their war with government and any sense of collective responsibility?\n\nVance has a tough row to hoe in keeping these people together, but it\u2019s a job he does need to undertake if he wants to inherit a winning coalition in 2028."

            "full_content": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy speaks at a press conference at the Department of Transportation on March 11, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Photo: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration once again has the MTA in its sights.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy wrote a letter to MTA chairman and CEO Janno Lieber, directing him to share the agency\u2019s plans to address crime and public safety on its system. The missive came with a threat. Duffy warned Lieber to respond promptly or risk the federal government withholding funds from the MTA.\n\nIn the letter, Duffy said that the agency \u201cmust ensure a safe and clean environment, reduce crime and fare evasion, and maintain a safe operating system\u201d for its riders, noting that there\u2019ve been several high-profile incidents on the subway. The Transportation secretary then requested that the MTA provide its plans to reduce crime and specific concerns such as transit-workers assaults, fare evasion, and subway surfing and statistics related to those incidents. He also asked for the MTA to detail the funds allocated to those measures.\n\nDuffy said the agency must respond by a March 31 deadline to \u201cavoid further [Federal Transit Administration] enforcement actions up to and including redirecting or withholding funding.\u201d\n\nThe MTA\u2019s letter closely resembles ones sent by the department to Washington, D.C., mayor Muriel Bowser as well as the CEOs of Amtrak and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, or WMATA, the main transit agency in D.C. In those messages, Duffy similarly requested risk assessments and plans to reduce crime and protect riders and transit workers.\n\nMuch of the information that Duffy is requesting is already publicly available through the NYPD, which publishes transit-crime reports, as well as through the MTA, which shares recordings and associated documents from its board meetings and publicizes its funding data. Recent statistics don\u2019t appear to support Duffy\u2019s contention of a transit system out of control. Earlier this month, the NYPD reported a 15 percent decrease in subway crime in February compared to the previous year. That figure follows a reported steep 36.4 percent drop in January.\n\nThe agency relies heavily on federal funding. The MTA previously unveiled its four-year $68 million capital plan, which anticipates $14 billion of that total coming from federal money and grants, per the Daily News.\n\nJohn McCarthy, MTA\u2019s chief of policy and external relations, said in a statement that the agency is ready to discuss its crime-reduction efforts with the federal government. \u201cThe good news is numbers are moving in the right direction: Crime is down 40 percent compared to the same period in 2020 right before the pandemic, and so far in 2025 there are fewer daily major crimes in transit than any non-pandemic year ever. Moreover, in the second half of last year subway-fare evasion was down 25 percent after increasing dramatically during COVID,\u201d he said, per CBS News.\n\nThis warning from Duffy is just the latest in the Trump administration\u2019s focus on the MTA. In February, the Transportation Department officially revoked federal approval for New York City\u2019s congestion-pricing program, setting a March 21 deadline for the tolling to end. However, the MTA immediately challenged the government\u2019s move in court with Governor Kathy Hochul making it clear that congestion pricing will continue until the matter is heard. \u201cThe cameras are staying on,\u201d she said."

            "full_content": "Brazilian Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro, announced on Tuesday that he will seek political asylum in the United States.\n\nBolsonaro, who has been in the U.S. since February, made the announcement in an interview with CNN Brasil. He said that he will request asylum on the grounds that he is the target of a persecution campaign led by Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Minister Alexandre de Moraes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a flight back to Brazil. I have to apply for political asylum to the U.S. government,\u201d Bolsonaro told the outlet.\n\n\u201cBrazil is no longer a democracy. It\u2019s not possible for a parliamentarian to lose his passport for what he says. Where is parliamentary immunity?\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not going to subject myself to this and remain under the thumb of Alexandre de Moraes. I\u2019m taking my leave to represent the interests of my constituents, those who voted for me.\u201d\n\nIn late February, a group of legislators from the ruling leftist Workers\u2019 Party (PT) formally requested that local authorities investigate Bolsonaro and seize his passport for allegedly committing \u201ccrimes against sovereignty\u201d and criticizing the STF alongside U.S. congressmen. The leftists accused Bolsonaro at the time of allegedly \u201cconspiring\u201d with U.S. legislators against the Brazilian judiciary.\n\nThe group\u2019s accusations came shortly after the House Judiciary Committee passed the \u201cNo Censors on our Shores Act,\u201d a piece of legislation that aims to codify into law provisions to bar or deport foreign government officials from the United States if they engage in official acts that violate the First Amendment rights of Americans.\n\nHours before his conversation with CNN Brasil, Eduardo Bolsonaro announced through a video on his personal X account that he would take an unpaid leave of absence from Congress to dedicate himself to seeking \u201cthe appropriate sanctions for those who violate human rights,\u201d specifically mentioning de Moraes.\n\n\u201cHere, in the United States of America, I will focus on seeking justice and the proper punishments for Alexandre de Moraes and his FBI destachment [sic] who blindly follow his illegal orders like Gestapo,\u201d Bolsonaro said in the video. \u201cYou, jellyfish man, small and vain, are not used to dealing with men of conviction.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought you could blackmail me with the benefits and privileges of the politics, but you couldn\u2019t have been more wrong,\u201d the congressman continued. \u201cThe best parliamentarians, those truly called, are not caricatures clinging to bureaucrats\u2019 titles. I ponder and resign to the law of despondence to stay strong to my mission.\u201d\n\nReferring to the request to have his passport seized, Bolsonaro asserted that everyone in Brazil \u201cknows\u201d that de Moraes is \u201ccapable of doing anything, even when it\u2019s clearly illegal or unconstitutional.\u201d He said that if de Moraes wants to seize his passport \u201cor even arrest me so that I can no longer report his crimes in the United States, then this is precisely where I will stay and work harder than ever.\u201d\n\nHours after Bolsonaro posted the video, Brazil\u2019s top court justice ruled to deny the request filed by the Workers\u2019 Party lawmakers on the grounds that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office \u2014 the Brazilian authority exclusively responsible for bringing charges or requesting that an investigation be closed \u2014 was against seizing the congressman\u2019s passport. Brazilian Prosecutor General Paulo Gonet argued that the complaint filed by the leftists did not contain the minimum elements to justify opening an investigation.\n\nIn an interview with the Brazilian outlet Revista Oeste on Tuesday, Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 the conservative former president of Brazil \u2014 said that he would rather see his son free in the U.S. than persecuted in his native country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather he was free in the United States than being threatened here in Brazil. And what we try to do, he will have my full support. He can continue,\u201d Bolsonaro stated. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not in charge of him anymore \u2014 he\u2019s 42, 43 years old \u2014 but he\u2019s doing an excellent job there and will continue to do an excellent job for us here in Brazil.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the federal deputy who received the most votes in the history of Brazil is forced to choose between exile or prison, this country can no longer be called a democracy,\u201d Bolsonaro said in a separate statement posted to his social media. \u201cWhen the law gives way to persecution, what we have is open tyranny \u2013 and now the whole world is paying attention.\u201d\n\nFormer President Bolsonaro was formally charged in February with allegedly plotting to poison current radical leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and stage a \u201ccoup\u201d following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. De Moraes, alongside other members of Brazil\u2019s top court, will rule on March 25 to determine if Bolsonaro will stand trial. On Sunday, Jair Bolsonaro claimed that he had no plans to flee Brazil to avoid a possible arrest ordered by the STF.\n\nBrazilian lawmakers may take a leave of absence of up to 120 days (four months) per legislative session without losing their mandate. CNN Brasil reported on Wednesday morning that Eduardo Bolsonaro\u2019s seat in the Brazilian House of Representatives will be occupied by Missionary Jos\u00e9 Ol\u00edmpio of the conservative Liberal Party (PL) once Bolsonaro is absent for more than 120 days.\n\nChristian K.

These steps will require millions of recipients and applicants to visit agency field offices rather than interact with agency employees over the phone.\n\nThe AP also obtained more information about each lease on DOGE\u2019s list through other publicly available datasets, including their addresses, the dates the leases had started and were originally expected to expire, and the landlords who own the properties.\n\nOf the 47 Social Security Administration offices listed for closure, only some had anticipated dates for when those lease cancellations would take effect.

            "full_content": "Photo: Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times/Redux\n\nFor the first time in two decades, it is impossible to predict who the next Democratic nominee for president might be. Three straight election cycles produced three flawed nominees who were firmly backed by their predecessors. Hillary Clinton was Barack Obama\u2019s preferred successor, and led in just about every single poll over her theoretical and literal competition. Joe Biden seized the nomination four years later, thanks in part to Obama\u2019s 11th-hour intervention to force several competitive center-left candidates, including Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, out of the primary ahead of Super Tuesday. In 2024, following Biden\u2019s implosion, Kamala Harris became the first Democratic nominee in more than a half-century to achieve that status without winning a vote in any of the primaries.\n\nNow it\u2019s all blown open. This makes some Democrats nervous. The party is bereft of a single leader and seems adrift, struggling to respond to Trump\u2019s assaults on the federal bureaucracy and the civil rights of legal residents. The party itself, in most polling, is widely unpopular, and no single course of action feels especially satisfying. Many Democrats wanted Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to refuse to help Republicans keep the government open. His decision to pass a continuing resolution with GOP support has enraged many elected Democrats and activists, especially on the left. But Schumer understood the alternative was no better: Trump and Elon Musk might have reveled in a shutdown, using it as a pretext to purge enormous numbers of government workers. Ken Martin, the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, doesn\u2019t seem like the sort of inspirational figure capable of leading the party out of the wilderness.\n\nBut the state of play isn\u2019t as grim as it looks. The shadow primary underway for 2028 is exactly what Democrats need: a robust contest over ideology and ideas that will be waged in the public square. The best Democrat will win. It was under these conditions that Barack Obama, still in his first term in national office, ascended to the presidency. Since then, for a variety of reasons, Democrats have been allergic to such competition.\n\nIt will be the most public and natural way to define what the future of the Democratic Party might look like. There will be no single interest group or power broker who can boost one candidate to victory at the expense of the rest of the field. Centrist, progressive, populist, or something else entirely \u2014 all ideological factions will get the open playing field. When George W. Bush defeated John Kerry in 2004, there were very few pundits calling for the Democratic Party to nominate a Black former law professor who was strongly opposed to the Iraq War. The primary sorted that out. Now, Democrats will get that opportunity again.\n\nThere\u2019s a long roster of governors, senators, members of Congress, and celebrities who can take the plunge. A short list includes Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, Maryland governor Wes Moore, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, and California governor Gavin Newsom. Senator Christopher Murphy of Connecticut and Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley congressman, seem likely to announce. For Democrats hungry for wealthy, famous outsiders, billionaire Mark Cuban and Stephen A. Smith, the ESPN commentator, could be viable. Pete Buttigieg will probably run again. Both Harris and her old running mate, Tim Walz, might be in the mix. For those nostalgic for bruising centrists, Rahm Emmanuel is floating a trial balloon.\n\nTim Walz and Rahm Emmanuel are very different kinds of Democrats, as are Ro Khanna and Andy Beshear. Democratic voters will get to decide, fully, what the future of their party will look like. It will not be a sham primary like 2024, when it was left to Dean Phillips to wage a hopeless campaign against Biden, or even 2016, when Clinton had hoovered up so much institutional backing that only Bernie Sanders, a septuagenarian from Vermont, could wage a viable campaign. This will be much more wide open. Republicans, in 2015 and 2016, did not quite imagine their party would be remade in the image of Trump \u2014 that is the messy side of democracy, after all, the outside agent who proves more popular than the institutional insiders. But a fear of a Democratic Trump isn\u2019t an excuse to avoid competition. All of this is healthy.\n\nIf Harris, for example, wants to be the nominee once more, let her get battle-tested with a long primary through the early voting states. Primaries are vital for shaping candidates: They learn, like Obama once did, to charm voters on an intimate level and sharpen their arguments for why they should lead the most powerful nation on Earth. Considering the stakes for 2028, when the Democratic nominee is likely to be pitted against J.D. Vance or another Trump-aligned Republican, the party can\u2019t afford to trot out another middling contender who will dodge the media and fail to make a coherent case for themselves. In the meantime, the 2028 primary will allow the eventual nominee to emerge organically and excite, on a grassroots level, an electorate that is going to be deeply weary of Trump.\n\nOne question hanging over the primary that Martin at the DNC will have to resolve is which states vote first. In 2024, Biden reengineered the primary calendar to drop the Iowa caucuses from the start of voting and make South Carolina, not New Hampshire, the very first state to vote. This enraged Democrats in the Granite State who have touted their first-in-the-nation status for decades. Biden boosted South Carolina as a favor to his close ally, Jim Clyburn, and as a way to ensure a primary threat against him was blunted. There was also a social-justice thrust for backing South Carolina, since the state\u2019s Democratic electorate is largely Black. The trouble with keeping South Carolina at the front of the calendar is the state\u2019s actual conservatism: If Black voters lean left, South Carolina itself hasn\u2019t backed a Democrat in a general election since Jimmy Carter. Labor unions were also uncomfortable with the South Carolina pick because the state itself is fiercely anti-union.\n\nEither way, Martin will be free to make the decision without interference from any of the Democratic grandees of the recent past, whether it be Biden, Obama, the Clintons, or Harris. The older generation will be unable to dominate the future affairs of the party. This is how it should be."

            "full_content": "Believe it or not, the president and the chief justice aren\u2019t on the same page when it comes to the powers of the judiciary. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThanks to the abject subservience of Republicans in Congress and the powerlessness of Democrats, it\u2019s been obvious for a while that the federal courts represent the only challenge to the Trump agenda of mass firings and terminations of federal programs, mass deportations of immigrants, and other radical steps beyond the traditional scope of presidential powers. Thus, unsurprisingly, MAGA world is full of talk about impeaching the judges getting in their way. Elon Musk led the way, as Democracy Docket noted earlier this month:\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk in recent weeks has raged in a blizzard of social media posts at federal judges who have ruled against his efforts to disembowel the government and executive orders issued by President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis evil judge must be fired!\u201d he said last month on his social media platform while sharing a photograph of a judge. \u201cThe only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,\u201d he said in another post last week.\n\nCongressional Republicans, of course, have leapt onto the crazy train, as the New York Times observed:\n\nHouse Republicans have filed articles of impeachment against federal judges whom they portrayed as impediments to Mr. Trump, accusing them of acting corruptly in thwarting the administration.\n\n\u201cIf these partisan judges want to be politicians, they should resign and run for office,\u201d said Representative Eli Crane, Republican of Arizona, in filing articles of impeachment against Judge Paul A. Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The judge, who was placed on the bench by President Barack Obama in 2011, had temporarily barred those working for Mr. Musk\u2019s government review team from accessing sensitive Treasury Department records. \u2026\n\nSenator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said in a social media post that \u201ccorrupt judges should be impeached and removed\u201d after earlier suggesting that rulings against the administration smacked of a \u2018judicial coup.\u201d\n\nAnd now, Trump himself has lost his mind over D.C. District Court Judge James Boasberg\u2019s attempted interference with his administration\u2019s deportation of Venezuelans. Initially the Justice Department just asked the court of appeals that supervises Boasberg to reassign the case to another judge. But its boss in the White House wants him removed from the bench entirely, as he demanded in an unhinged Truth Social post:\n\nThis \u201ccan no one rid me of this meddlesome judge?\u201d cry of anguish drew an immediate response from Trump\u2019s faithful servants in Congress, as The Hill reported: \u201cRep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) introduced a resolution to impeach U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who over the weekend ordered the Trump administration to halt deportations of Venezuelans whom it said were gang members.\u201d\n\nThere was enough smoke here that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts felt constrained to advise the world in a March 18 statement that impeaching federal judges because you don\u2019t like their rulings is not appropriate:\n\nFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\n\nThe contrast in tone between the president and the chief justice did not go unnoticed by attorney Ken White at Bluesky:\n\nTrump: the streets will run like rivers with the blood of my enemies. Their heads on spikes will adorn Congress and every federal building and court.\n\nChief Justice Roberts: Actually the GSA is in charge of federal court decorations in consultation with the judicial counsel\n\nBut more to the point, any impeachment drive aimed at federal judges who annoy Trump isn\u2019t going to go very far, at least under the current U.S. Constitution. It would take every bit of Trump leverage available to get articles of impeachment aimed at a judge through the closely divided U.S. House. And as Politico reports, House GOP leaders view the idea as an annoying \u201cdistraction,\u201d even though they dare not denounce it publicly:\n\n[P]rivately there is dread inside Johnson\u2019s leadership circle about the prospect of having to pursue messy, certain-to-fail impeachments that could ultimately backfire on the GOP\u2019s razor-thin majority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d said a senior House Republican aide. \u201cThere aren\u2019t the votes.\u201d\n\nBut the bigger reason it isn\u2019t happening involves the Senate: As Democrats learned after impeaching Trump himself twice, getting the two-thirds vote necessary for a conviction (and removal from office) in the Senate against the wishes of one of the two major parties is well-nigh impossible. Perhaps some of the machers of Team Trump don\u2019t understand that:\n\nThis is a judicial coup.\n\n\n\nWe need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore rule of the people. https://t.co/arUq1FApRq \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 19, 2025\n\nIt\u2019s 67 senators to convict, and that\u2019s on impeachment articles first passed by the House.\n\nIgnorance aside, what\u2019s the point of all the impeaching judges talk? It\u2019s probably designed to intimidate judges who may fear for their lives if not for their lifetime appointments, while giving MAGA yahoos a big if not exactly new enemy to deplore. There is, after all, an ancient history in this country of populist politicians of both the left and the right fulminating against the unelected tyrants of the judiciary. The more alarming possibility, however, is that Trump, Musk, and congressional Republicans are laying the groundwork for a future refusal to obey court orders. Then we\u2019ll have the constitutional crisis that has always loomed over the reign of a president who believes he embodies the nation and stands above all laws."

            "full_content": "Istanbul \u2014 Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.\n\nThe state-run Anadolu news agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.\n\nAuthorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.\n\nRiot police officers stand guard as supporters of the Mayor of Istanbul demonstrate against his detention over a corruption probe in Istanbul, Turkey, March 19, 2025. YASIN AKGUL/AFP/Getty\n\nDespite the ban, a live feed on the Anka News Agency's X account appeared to show protesters clashing with riot police at Istanbul University. One sign read: \"The university will not comply.\" No violence was immediately reported from the demonstrations.\n\nPrivate television network NTV said two Istanbul district mayors were among those detained.\n\nCritics note that the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year, and amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.\n\n\"We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\" Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video posted on social media.\n\nGermany criticized the arrests Wednesday, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer describing them as \"a serious setback for democracy.\"\n\nInternet watchdog Netblocks said Wednesday that its live metrics indicated Turkey was restricting access to X, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms.\n\nErdogan, a populist with what opponents say are increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years and is now the longest-serving leader in the Turkish republic's history. His current term runs until 2028, but he has indicated he'd like to serve longer \u2014 something he could achieve with the help of a friendly parliament.\n\nImamoglu was arrested as police searched his home, but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was confiscated. His wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television network that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken around 7:30 a.m.\n\nThe Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index dropped by 7% over news of his arrest, triggering a temporary halt to trading to prevent panic selling and stabilize the market. The Turkish lira lost some 7% of its value against the dollar.\n\nAnadolu, the news agency, said that Ekrem Imamoglu and several others were suspected of extortion, money laundering and irregularities concerning tenders and procurements, among other crimes.\n\nImamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the report said. The PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency within Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.\n\nEarlier this month, in a move lauded by the U.S., the PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire with Turkey's government, following a call from the group's long-jailed leader for it to lay down arms entirely.\n\n\"An attempted coup against our next president\"\n\nA day earlier, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying him from running in the next presidential race \u2014 a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.\n\nThe mayor's party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was widely expected to be chosen as its candidate in future presidential elections. The national ballot is currently scheduled for 2028, but the vote is expected to be brought forward.\n\nDespite all the arrests Wednesday, CHP party chairman Ozgur Ozel told the opposition-aligned Halik TV channel that its primary would go ahead as planned. Ozel called Imamoglu's detention \"an attempted coup against our next president.\"\n\nIn a social media post written in English, Imamoglu said: \"The will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts. I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens\" of Turkey.\n\nIstanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the Republican People's Party's (CHP) presidential primary candidate, addresses the CHP leadership and parliamentarians to outline his roadmap and strategies during 2028 presidential candidate election meeting, Feb. 27, 2025 in Ankara, Turkey. SERDAR OZSOY/Getty\n\nTurkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.\n\nThe dawn raid on Imamoglu's home and his arrest was a \"disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\" Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.\n\nAs he was being arrested, Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.\n\n\"They think they can silence us and prevent us from defending and supporting Ekrem Imamoglu,\" Ongun said. \"I entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot defeat the nation.\"\n\nPolice also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.\n\nIn nullifying Imamoglu's diploma, the university cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. Imamoglu said he would challenge the decision.\n\nImamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.\n\nHe is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.\n\nImamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019 in a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The president's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.\n\nThe challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party."

But in recent weeks, it also was Roberts who steered the court in its calibrated approach to litigation arising from President Trump\u2019s orders overhauling government \u2013 refusing to give administration lawyers the quick endorsement they sought.\n\nSince 2017, when Trump began his first presidential term, Roberts has been both an enabler and a restraint on Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nAfter weeks of silence to Trump\u2019s rants against the judiciary, Roberts was likely provoked on Tuesday by a heated post referring to a federal judge currently handling a migrant deportation case as \u201ccrooked.\u201d Trump declared the judge \u201cshould be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d\n\nSoon after, Roberts issued a statement: \u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\u201d\n\nFor US district court judges, currently on the front lines of the Trump litigation, Roberts\u2019 defense was heartening, if overdue.\n\nFor retired Justice Stephen Breyer, the statement met the moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s informative. It\u2019s short. It doesn\u2019t blame anyone or praise anyone.

            "full_content": "Tesla, whose pioneering electric vehicles were once a symbol of forward-thinking sustainability, increasingly finds itself the target of public furor.\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.\n\nThere has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.\n\nIn Mr. Trump's first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.\n\n\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They're rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"\n\nMusk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.\n\nString of attacks\n\nThe attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\n\n\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.\n\nA number of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.\n\nAn Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.\n\nFour Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.\n\nIn Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building's front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.\n\n\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some Tesla owners in conservative-leaning states are also facing acts of vandalism, including one Texas man whose Tesla was recently keyed while parked at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\n\"I just bought it because it was an electric car,\" Dallas resident Jeff Nguyen told CBS News Texas. \"This one is pretty fun to drive. It has really just nothing to do with politics or anything like that.\"\n\nTesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn't have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.\n\nMore recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.\n\nMusk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Mr. Trump's adviser.\n\nTesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump's election but has since shed all those gains and this year has tumbled 44%, prompting expressions of concern from Wall Street analysts. Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.\n\nPresident Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"\n\n\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\n\nThe progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \"Musk Or Us\" protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \"it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\"\n\nSome Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle's new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \"I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\" or \"I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\"\n\nPrices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla's most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.\n\n\"We're coming after you\"\n\nThe White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Mr. Trump's political interests. Mr. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \"domestic terror,\" and he has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \"going to go through hell.\"\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said she'd opened an investigation \"to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\"\n\n\"If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\" Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"\n\nColin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.\n\n\"It's not the type of act that I would prioritize,\" Clarke said. \"Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\"\n\nTheresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.\n\n\"Hate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that's fine and dandy, it's your choice,\" she said. \"It doesn't justify ruining somebody's property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There's other ways to get your voice heard that's more effective.\"\n\nSomeone recently slapped a \"no Elon\" sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn't intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.\n\n\"I love my car. It's the safest car,\" Ramsdell said. \"I'm not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\""

They waged war on American energy, and in particular on Texas oil and gas,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"That war on American energy ended on January 20th,\" he added, referring to Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S APPROVAL RATING MATCHES HIS ALL-TIME HIGH, NEW POLL FINDS\n\n\"I think we have a mandate coming out of the election, a mandate to secure the border and mandate to unleash American energy, a mandate to extend the 2017 tax cuts and a mandate to fight for small businesses and jobs,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe we're going to do all of that working hand-in-hand with President Trump,\" he explained, adding, \"It's been an incredible first 50 days. We've got a lot more work to do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are pushing hard on the message that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2013 which include 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and a sweeping 25 percent tariff on aluminum and steel from around the world \u2013 are behind the high prices Americans are seeing in stores and gas stations.\n\nSenator Jeff Merkley, D-WA, believes that Trump is intentionally creating chaos to assert more control over the federal government and country.\n\n\"The Trump recession is on its way,\" Merkley predicted.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US 'SUBSIDIZES' ITS '51ST STATE,' CANADA\n\n\"He's firing people left and right with no thought about what works and doesn't,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"It's not about efficiency; it's about tearing down and replacing professionals with lackeys.\"\n\n\"Trump is driving us into a recession,\" he continued. \"He is doing it deliberately, cultivating complete chaos in everything he does. These tariffs are on, these tariffs are off, stock market is diving, people don't know where and how to invest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-WA, suggested that; \"Trump could stop being so irresponsible about the economy and make sure we\u2019re driving costs down instead of up and stop the trade wars with indiscriminate sweeping tariffs.\"\n\nThough Americans continue to face high prices, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said the country is \"in a period of transition\" in which Trump is \"implementing the formula that we know works.\"\n\n\"Look at President Trump\u2019s results in his first term,\" said Leavitt. \"If people are looking for certainty, look at the record of this president, that\u2019s why the American people re-elected him back to this office.\"\n\nMR. WONDERFUL TALKS 'EXCITEMENT' AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY UNDER TRUMP: AMERICA IS IN A 'NEW PHASE'\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-MA, however, said that Trump \"has to avoid his indiscriminate ham-handed tariffs that are absolutely frightening the markets and frightening small businesses all across our country.\"\n\nHe also bashed the changes brought about by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"He has to just stop with his indiscriminate cuts to programs, which actually provide the economic incentive for the creation of jobs in our society,\" he said.\n\nAsked what can be done to avoid a recession, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-WA, answered simply: \"Don\u2019t have tariffs.\"\n\nGOP LAWMAKER SAYS HE DOESN\u2019T THINK TRUMP TARIFFS WILL \u2018PLUNGE\u2019 US ECONOMY INTO RECESSION\n\nSen. John Hickenlooper, D-CO, said that \"we better get cracking\" to reverse course.\n\n\"I think we should do less tariffs. I think we need to recognize that government plays a role in the economy, but I certainly hope that we can make positive steps to make sure we don't get a recession, the last thing anybody needs,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking with Fox News Digital at a healthcare protest just outside the Capitol building, \"Squad\" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, refused to answer whether the U.S. was heading into a recession, instead insisting \"we should talk about Medicaid.\"\n\n\"Medicaid is one of the most important things,\" said Tlaib. \"It's actually very American. Most American thing you can ever like support because people don't plan to get sick. We got to protect Medicaid.\"\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sen. John Husted, R-OH, told Fox News Digital that Trump\u2019s \"early aggressive approaches\" will \"cause a little disruption, but in the end, I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll get through those.\"\n\nLARA TRUMP: SHIFTING THE STATUS QUO FOR THE ECONOMY TAKES A MULTI-FRONT EFFORT\n\n\"The Biden administration did put us in a terrible box with their policies on immigration, the runaway government spending that led to inflation, their anti-energy policies that really made the cost of energy inputs in every product higher. The president's trying to unravel that,\" said Husted. \"That will lead to some stability going forward, that will help create jobs and get the American economy moving forward.\"\n\nFreshman Sen. Jim Justice, R-WV, meanwhile, said he does not think the U.S. is recession-bound.\n\n\"I really don't think we're headed into a recession. I don't think that at all,\" he said. \"[But] the Senate stands ready to work with President Trump in every way [and] I surely stand ready to work with him on everything.\"\n\nCome what may, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, said that the best way to avoid a recession is to \"implement the president\u2019s agenda\" and help working families.\n\n\"Under Joe Biden, their wages went down, the prices went up,\" he said. \"We need to pass tax relief for working families and get more of their hard-earned money, put it back into their pockets. It's vital.\"\n\nFORBES CHAIRMAN LAYS OUT TAX PLAN FOR 'GOLD ON THE HORIZON'\n\n\"What can we do?\" he continued. \"Open up American energy production, we can get fair and equal trade deals, we've got to get wages up for our people, we've got to get manufacturing back into this country.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The president is doing both of those things. He's going to stop the trade cheating. He's going to get prices down,\" he said. \"I mean, the president knows what to do. He did it in the first term. He gave us the best economy in my lifetime, his lifetime. So, we've got to go full throttle on that.\""

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Associated Press\n\nJoe Biden has always kept a tight circle. Only a few could ever claim to be his right-hand man. There was Ted Kaufman, the early campaign volunteer who became Biden\u2019s senatorial chief of staff; John DiEleuterio, the college friend who went to work as his state director in Wilmington. Plus Jill Biden, of course, and Joe\u2019s sister, Valerie, his right-hand women.\n\nLess remarked upon, over the decades, are the dozens of us who have served in a related but different capacity: as uncredited stand-ins for Joe Biden\u2019s literal right hand via autopen.\n\nLast week, the Heritage Foundation released a (since disputed) report claiming that the Biden White House used an autopen to sign preemptive pardons during its final days. These included, allegedly, the pardons granted to members of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack. On Friday, President Donald Trump took to Truth Social with a dark suspicion: \u201cThe person who was the real President during the Biden years was the person who controlled the Autopen!\u201d That figure, he\u2019d go on to intimate without evidence, was not Biden, who was too checked out; in Trump\u2019s view, this made Biden\u2019s pardons null and void.\n\nFrom there, it seems, we\u2019ve entered a now-familiar cycle: First, Trumpland makes a claim about Biden\u2019s executive functioning or lack thereof; Biden sources then deny the claim. But then, too, a few anonymous \u201cBiden sources\u201d reportedly go rogue to hint that perhaps there\u2019s something there: in this case, that a \u201ca key aide to the then-president may have made unilateral determinations on what to auto-sign.\u201d A few months after that \u2014 we\u2019re not there yet with the autopen \u2014 perhaps a former administration staffer echoes those hints on a podcast, or a panel, setting themselves up for a turncoat book deal down the road.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m willing to break my silence.\n\nIn 2006, I began a summer internship in then-Senator Biden\u2019s Delaware headquarters. A 16-year-old politics nerd from Wilmington and a foreign-policy buff, I was awed by Biden\u2019s stature as the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee. I was welcomed by DiEleuterio \u2014 a lovely man \u2014 and the front-desk admin gave me a tour. The grandest room in the suite was Biden\u2019s office; he wasn\u2019t in that week, she said, but he might be later in the summer, in which case we\u2019d meet. The work was menial: logging calls, opening mail. But most days contained at least one moment of magic: the autopen.\n\nOn the desk, in a back room, the device looked charmingly analog. There was no screen, no \u201cinterface\u201d: You\u2019d just load a pen or Sharpie into the loop at the end of its arm and let it trace its way. On my end, it took \u2014 well, not skill, but care to line the paper up below. Or misalign: I decided that the signature oughtn\u2019t run too parallel to the bottom edge of the page; there should be a gentle, friendly skew. Once engaged, the device would move slowly \u2014 at an uncanny human pace \u2014 along the ghostly path of Joe\u2019s right hand. The slash of his J, the curves of his B, a jagged e that shocked me every time: These are the strokes I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nThen, Joe\u2019s final coup de grace, this little dot he\u2019d add above the last few letters of his surname. Ostensibly meant to crown the i but falling chicly behind, it reminded me of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s beauty mark.\n\nWhen I think back to the work that I did on the autopen that summer, it was all pretty anodyne stuff. There were wedding congratulations and birthday wishes, those kinds of salutations: nice messages that people might want to frame someday as a family heirloom. That\u2019s why we signed them in Sharpie.\n\nWas there more than that? Perhaps some polite letters addressed to government agencies on Delawareans\u2019 behalf? Maybe, but you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\n\nThese past few days have been hard. Yes, I agree with all the legal experts out there, who say that the Biden administration\u2019s autopen use stands as perfectly legal and sound. But at the same time, when I see the New York Post call Joe Biden \u201cAutopen Joe,\u201d I get this pang of guilt because \u2026 well, that\u2019s how I think of him, too; like that\u2019s how I best know Joe.\n\nI never did meet the senator that summer. He never showed, either, at the \u201cJoe Biden high-school youth day\u201d I once attended down in Dover. And I\u2019ve never quite managed to catch him since.\n\nAm I upset by this? Surprised? No: Biden has rarely been the kind of omnipresent, glad-handing politician you might expect a small state to produce. And on a personal level, we Delawareans understand why his clan turned inward after the 1972 death of his first wife and daughter. But in addition to that, there\u2019s a cultural aspect, the way that \u201cDelawareness\u201d has long been characterized by negations and evasions: our good little corporate secrecy haven, neither North nor South.\n\nI do wonder, though: Did the rest of the country know to expect such a ghost? Did they know to read Biden\u2019s presidency as that of a quintessential \u201cDelaware Man,\u201d shot through with blankness? People expected more expansiveness of vision from his presidency, and boldness, too, but he always had this institutionalist streak. He is a company man from the Company State, accustomed to tracing preset paths, like choosing to run for a second term in the first place. He could be called worse than Autopen Joe.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Police in Turkey on Wednesday arrested Istanbul\u2019s mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2014 as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.\n\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu\u2019s close aide, Murat Ongun.\n\nAuthorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.\n\nCritics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.\n\nThe arrest came during a search of Imamoglu\u2019s home, but it was not immediately clear if police confiscated anything at the site.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television station that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken at around 7:30 a.m. local time (11:30 p.m. ET).\n\nSilencing the opposition\n\nA day earlier, a university in Istanbul invalidated Imamoglu\u2019s diploma, effectively disqualifying the popular opposition figure from running in the next presidential race. Having a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen for its candidate in future presidential elections. Turkey\u2019s next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but early elections are likely.\n\nWith all the arrests on Wednesday, it was unlikely that vote would be held.\n\n\u201cWe are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\u201d Imamoglu said earlier in he day in a video message posted on social media. He accused the government of \u201cusurping the will\u201d of the people.\n\nMayor Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul on Oct. 31, 2024.

(AP Photo/Emrah Gurel, file)\n\nISTANBUL -- Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul\u2019s mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.\n\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.\n\nAuthorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.\n\nCritics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan\u2019s ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.\n\nThe arrest came during a search of Imamoglu's home, but it was not immediately clear if police confiscated anything at the site.\n\nThe mayor's wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television station that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken at around 7:30 a.m.\n\nA day earlier, a university in Istanbul invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying the popular opposition figure from running in the next presidential race. Having a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen for its candidate in future presidential elections. Turkey\u2019s next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but early elections are likely.\n\nWith all the arrests on Wednesday, it was unlikely that vote would be held.\n\n\u201cWe are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\u201d Imamoglu said earlier in he day in a video message posted on social media. He accused the government of \u201cusurping the will\u201d of the people.\n\nIn a social media post on English, Imamoglu said: \u201cThe will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts. I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens of (Turkey.)\"\n\nCHP's chairman, Ozgur Ozel, denounced Imamoglu's detention as a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is a power in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,\u201d he said. \"We are facing an attempted coup against our next president.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.\n\n\u201cThe dawn raid and detention of the mayor of the country\u2019s largest city for political motives is a disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries.
