            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemonstrators gathered at more than 50 Tesla showrooms across the United States on Saturday in protest of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s role in slashing government agencies as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency established by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe protests are part of \u201cTesla Takedown,\u201d which, according to its website, hopes to encourage stakeholders to \u201csell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreating a vote of no confidence in him from the shareholders, that would be the ultimate goal,\u201d Alex Winter, a Los Angeles-based actor and filmmaker who is one of the main organizers, told CNN.\n\nThe first Tesla Takedown protest was on February 15 after Winter spoke with Joan Donovan, a sociologist and professor at Boston University, who suggested a Tesla protest on Bluesky, an alternative to Musk\u2019s X.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest person, began leading DOGE on January 20. Musk\u2019s role has received criticism from the start, due in part to buyout offers to federal employees alongside mass layoffs; dismantling the US Agency for International Development; and seeking access to sensitive payment systems.\n\nThe Tesla Takedown movement is also gaining traction internationally. There was a protest Friday in Barcelona, and three protests are set for this weekend in London; Lisbon, Portugal; and Reykjavik, Iceland, according to Winter.\n\n\u201cI am very satisfied, even with where we are now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provided people an easy way to protest during a very difficult time.\u201d\n\nProtests have varied in size, with some of the largest demonstrations taking place in the cities of Boston and Portland, as well as in California and Florida, according to Winter. About 1,000 protesters gathered with signs Saturday in Tucson, Arizona. In Washington, DC, what started as only two demonstrators standing outside a showroom in the Georgetown neighborhood grew to about 20 within an hour.\n\nThe demonstration included chants of \u201cElon Musk has got to go,\u201d as well as drivers honking horns in support.\n\nPeter Jones, a 59-year-old pilot, told CNN that he searched on Friday for upcoming protests but found none. He said if it weren\u2019t for his wife, who heard the chanting and was curious about the protest, they would have missed out.\n\n\u201cIt feels great because right now I feel powerless,\u201d Jones said. \u201cNobody can keep up with all of the destruction. I don\u2019t feel empowered unless we get out into the street; that\u2019s one thing we have is mass.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 wife, Bonnie Jones, said she\u2019s concerned about Musk\u2019s other investments and contracts, including the high-speed internet service Starlink, because Musk has not been properly vetted through a confirmation hearing like other Trump appointees.\n\nProtestors gather at a Tesla showroom in Washington, DC, chanting \u201cDOGE needs to go\u201d and \u201cWho voted for Elon Musk? No one voted for Elon Musk.\u201d Auzinea Bacon/CNN\n\nDonna Powell, a retiree in the Washington, DC, area, told CNN this is her 20th protest against the Trump administration and Musk\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cTesla stock has been going down and we want to see that continue and we want to see Musk hurt,\u201d said Powell. \u201cWe also hope that Congress will grow a spine and do what they\u2019re elected to do.\u201d\n\nHitting Musk where it hurts\n\nDeclining sales, which could lead investors to sell off their stock, hurt Tesla\u2019s value \u2014 which accounts for much of Musk\u2019s net worth. He owns nearly 411 million shares of Tesla, or 13% of the company.\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn December, Musk became the first person to have a net worth above $400 billion. He has since lost $52 billion in net worth as shares of Tesla (TSLA) have plunged 27.6% in February.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Tesla Takedown movement will have much of an impact on the company. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive site Edmunds, noted there hasn\u2019t been a bump in Tesla owners appraising their used cars.\n\nSome hesitation could be that selling a car relies on other factors, including the cost of buying a new vehicle while interest rates are high and because Teslas are now less expensive, she said.\n\nAlthough Tesla may face pushback because of Musk\u2019s involvement in the government, some Tesla owners and potential buyers are likely separating Tesla as a company from Musk, she said. Caldwell added that the attention Musk has received from DOGE is not good for Tesla\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the other car companies, most people couldn\u2019t name another automotive CEO and much less their opinion on politics,\u201d Caldwell told CNN.\n\nTesla reported global sales of 1.79 million in 2024, compared with 1.81 million in 2023. The 1.1% drop was Tesla\u2019s first annual decline in 12 years.\n\nTesla recently reported a 16% decline in sales between December and January. That was an improvement after Tesla sales dropped 24% between December 2023 and January 2024.\n\nAnother explanation for decreased sales could be that Tesla hasn\u2019t made many new changes, Caldwell said. Aside from a few refreshes to old models and the release of the Cybertruck, the cars are \u201ca bit older.\u201d The company is also a smaller share of electric vehicle makers as it faces increased competition from General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and other brands."

            "full_content": "Photo: Al Drago/Getty Images\n\nDisgraced former New York governor Andrew Cuomo has officially entered the race to replace disgraced current New York City mayor Eric Adams. Cuomo announced his long-expected comeback attempt with a 17-minute video on Saturday, framing his candidacy as a solution to a \u201ccity in crisis\u201d:\n\nOur city is in crisis. That\u2019s why I am running to be Mayor of New York City. We need government to work. We need effective leadership. https://t.co/a0vVYRF4iP pic.twitter.com/JIrhD1Edqs \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@andrewcuomo) March 1, 2025\n\nDespite his considerable baggage, Cuomo is widely expected be the front-runner for the Democratic primary \u2014 at least initially \u2014 on name recognition alone, and he is already on top of early polls. In 2021, the now-67-year-old political scion resigned as governor amid a barrage of sexual-harassment allegations (which he continues to deny). He was also accused of mishandling the COVID crisis after his administration was found to have underreported the number of people who died in nursing homes during the pandemic.\n\nBefore his sudden downfall, Cuomo had been expected to surpass his father, Mario Cuomo, by winning a fourth term as governor. He was also once considered a potential presidential candidate, but now he\u2019s literally trying to reintroduce himself to New Yorkers (\u201cHi, I\u2019m Andrew Cuomo,\u201d is how he begins his announcement video).\n\nAnd here\u2019s how Cuomo addressed his past \u201cmistakes\u201d:\n\nDid I make mistakes, some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show that every day. But I promise you this: I know what needs to be done and I know how to do it, and I will give it my all to get the job done \u2014 and it will get done.\n\nIn October, the GOP-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic sent a letter to the Justice Department recommending charges against Cuomo over the nursing-home scandal. It\u2019s not clear if the DOJ will launch its own investigation into Cuomo now that it\u2019s run by Trump political appointees who have already used federal charges against Mayor Adams to their apparent advantage.\n\nSimilarly to how Adams ran for the job, Cuomo is framing his mayoral campaign around fears that the city isn\u2019t safe. In his announcement video, over footage of people living on the street, Cuomo referenced migrants and crime after declaring that \u201cour New York City is in trouble\u201d:\n\nYou feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person, or when the anxiety rises up your chest as you\u2019re walking down into the subway. You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence. The city just feels threatening, out of control and in crisis.\n\nHe also indicated that as mayor, he would be open to working with Trump:\n\nI will work with anyone who wants to work for the benefit of New York. I hope President Trump remembers his hometown and works with us to make it better. But make no mistake, I will stand up and fight for New York. I have done it before and will do it again.\n\nCuomo already has a sizable war chest of money left over from his previous political life, as well as some public proponents, including Representative Ritchie Torres, who this week told the New York Post he was backing Cuomo\u2019s bid. The Bronx Democrat said that New York needs a \u201cMr. Tough Guy\u201d with \u201cthe courage to stand up to extremist politics \u2014 both from the far left and far right.\u201d\n\nOther mayoral candidates quickly attacked Cuomo on Saturday:\n\nWelcome, @andrewcuomo !\n\n\n\nIn honor of your sad attempt to get attention, let's remember your time as Governor of New York\u2014before you resigned for sexually harassing 13 women and leading thousands of elderly New Yorkers to their deaths during Covid-19.https://t.co/JhXFMphn17 pic.twitter.com/zafkiIqD8x \u2014 Brad Lander (@bradlander) March 1, 2025\n\nAndrew Cuomo is now officially running to lead the city he repeatedly threw under the bus as governor.

            "full_content": "Seattle AP \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s plan to pull federal funding from institutions that provide gender-affirming care for transgender youth will remain blocked on a long-term basis under a federal judge\u2019s ruling in Seattle late Friday.\n\nUS District Court Judge Lauren King previously granted a two-week restraining order after the Democratic attorneys general of Washington, Oregon and Minnesota sued the Trump administration \u2014 Colorado has since joined the case.\n\nKing\u2019s temporary order expired Friday, and she held arguments that day before issuing a preliminary injunction blocking most of Trump\u2019s plan pending a final decision on the merits of the case. She rejected a portion of the states\u2019 challenge regarding the order\u2019s protections against female genital mutilation, on grounds that \u201cno credible threat of prosecution exists\u201d in such cases.\n\nTwo of Trump\u2019s executive orders are at issue in the case.\n\nOne, \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism,\u201d calls for stripping federal money from programs that \u201cpromote gender ideology.\u201d\n\nThe other, \u201cProtecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\u201d calls for the federal government to cut off research and educational grants for institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, that provide gender-affirming care to people under age 19. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care, including puberty blockers and hormone treatments, following the order.\n\nMedicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care, and Trump\u2019s \u201cProtecting Children\u201d order suggests that practice could end. It also raises the prospect that medical professionals could be criminally charged for providing gender-affirming care under a law that bans medically unnecessary genital mutilation of underage females \u2014 a notion that the states suing Trump call repugnant and legally unsupportable.\n\nYoung people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth \u2014 a condition called gender dysphoria \u2014 are far more likely to suffer from severe depression and to kill themselves if they do not receive treatment, which can include evaluation by a team of medical professionals; a social transition, such as changing a hairstyle or pronouns; and eventually puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.\n\nWashington Attorney General Nick Brown walks down the steps of a federal court in Seattle after a hearing over President Donald Trump's order against gender-affirming care for youth on Friday, February 28, 2025. Manuel Valdes/AP\n\nIn her ruling Friday, the judge said the order was not limited to children or to irreversible treatments and that it doesn\u2019t target medical interventions performed on cisgender children.\n\n\u201cIn fact, its inadequate \u2018means-end fit\u2019 would prevent federally funded medical providers from providing necessary medical treatments to transgender youth that are completely unrelated to gender identity,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor example, a cisgender teen could obtain puberty blockers from such a provider as a component of cancer treatment, but a transgender teen with the same cancer care plan could not.\u201d\n\nIn his arguments Friday, Washington Assistant Attorney General William McGinty stressed the urgency of the issue.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be young people who are going to take their lives if they can no longer receive this care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe executive order uses derisive terminology \u2014 words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 that contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States. Such care is widely endorsed by the medical community, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nKing, the judge in Seattle, grilled Justice Department attorney Vinita Andrapalliyal in court about the meaning and effect of Trump\u2019s executive orders.\n\n\u201cWhat is gender dysphoria?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYour honor, I am not a medical provider,\u201d Andrapalliyal responded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thing, correct?\u201d King asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a medically recognizable diagnosis?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an official position on that,\u201d Andrapalliyal said.\n\nThe judge continued to press, saying she was \u201clooking for a legitimate government interest\u201d that would justify Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nThe four Democratic attorneys general suing in Seattle argued that the orders violate equal rights protections, the separation of powers and the states\u2019 right to regulate issues not delegated to the federal government.\n\nThe Trump administration disputed those claims in court filings. \u201cThe President\u2019s authority to direct subordinate agencies to implement his agenda, subject to those agencies\u2019 own statutory authorities, is well established,\u201d Justice Department attorneys wrote.\n\nIn addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service; set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender; and would ban transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.\n\nMany legal challenges have been filed."

Sports figures and musicians are doing the Trump dance at major events in front of major crowds. DEI is disappearing as quickly as it appeared, and you can wear a MAGA hat in Los Angeles.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the culture has shifted; and, as Andrew predicted, the political landscape shifted right alongside it as a result.\n\nIt\u2019s been 13 years since we lost Andrew, but his legacy will always live on, and he will be remembered as the original fighter and the one who understood how culture truly affected politics.\n\nNobody understood the media/political landscape better than Andrew, and nobody knew how to take on the left and expose hypocrisy more effectively.\n\nThree years ago we put together a video tribute that brought together so many in the conservative movement who were influenced by this media savvy raconteur who taught us not only how to fight but how to do it with humor, strength, and facts \u2014 the man who taught us all how to walk toward fire.\n\nPlease take a few minutes to hear his words which always proved to be prescient, insightful, and entertaining, as well as the words of so many conservative thought leaders who were influenced by Andrew, the Happy Warrior.\n\nWATCH the entire tribute: LEGACY: Andrew Breitbart in his own words and those who honor him.\n\nIN ORDER OF APPEARANCE (Individual Tributes)\n\nWalk Toward the Fire \u2014 written by Jeffrey Steele and Jon Kahn"

            "full_content": "Jefferson City, Missouri CNN \u2014\n\nA bill before the Missouri State Senate would introduce $1,000 rewards for people identifying undocumented immigrants who are then taken into custody.\n\nThe proposal would make it a state felony for anyone in the US illegally to enter and stay in Missouri. It would create an opportunity for licensed bond agents to become bounty hunters. And it would create a fund not just for the bounty hunters, but anyone who provides information on an undocumented individual that results in their arrest.\n\nSenate Bill 72 is still in committee and may never become law. But opponents say it\u2019s already spreading fear and changing the lives of both legally residing and undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hateful,\u201d Ashley Chavarria told CNN. Chavarria is the US-born daughter of two Mexicans who came across the border illegally in the late 1980s and have stayed ever since. She said she\u2019s already seen Latinos, some undocumented, in Missouri\u2019s capital Jefferson City area staying away from English classes and even afraid to collect their children from school since the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the onset of his mass deportation drive.\n\nAnd the new bill could make things worse, added Chavarria, who works at a social service agency for Hispanic communities made up of both citizens and non-citizens. \u201cIt\u2019s actually going to put more fear into people and turn people against each other,\u201d she said.\n\nAshley Chavarria says she struggles to to explain the current political situation to her children, aged 8 and 9. CNN\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, freshman state Sen. David Gregory took time to criticize what he said had been misinformation about his plan both when introducing the legislation and in a short interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing things like \u2018oh, this places a bounty on people.\u2019 No, it doesn\u2019t\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJust because we\u2019re dispatching bounty hunters after a warrant has been issued is not a bounty. It\u2019s actually a reward system through a hotline.\u201d\n\nThe bill creates a felony of \u201ctrespass by an illegal alien\u201d if an undocumented immigrant enters and stays in the state.\n\nThe text of the bill talks of setting up a toll-free phone line, email address and online portal where people could \u2014 anonymously if they wish \u2014 report suspected violators.\n\nIf an undocumented immigrant \u201cis arrested and imprisoned\u2026as a result of a report to the information system, the person who made the report shall be eligible to receive a reward of $1,000,\u201d it says.\n\nGregory insists that incentive is a reward \u2014 similar to those offered by local and national law enforcement agencies seeking information on crimes \u2014 and not a \u201cbounty.\u201d\n\nMerriam-Webster defines \u201cbounty\u201d as \u201ca reward, premium, or subsidy especially when offered or given by a government: such as \u201ca payment for the capture of or assistance in the capture of an outlaw.\u201d\n\nIn the bill, the punishment for violating the \u201ctrespass by illegal alien\u201d felony is life imprisonment without parole, though it says someone could be released to the custody of the federal government if they were going to be deported within 24 hours. Gregory, who represents parts of St. Louis, told CNN he had heard opposition to the life term and was discussing it with fellow senators.\n\nA separate bill he introduced said a court may conditionally release a defendant charged with the state trespassing felony during their initial court appearance if it \u201cfinds that the defendant is seeking asylum and does not pose a danger to the community.\u201d However, if a \u201ccourt finds that the defendant is seeking asylum but poses a danger to the community, the defendant shall be denied bail entirely,\u201d and remain in custody throughout the course of their trial, the bill states. The bill would only go into effect if Senate Bill 72 became law.\n\nGregory emphasized people would only be approached and detained after an investigation finds evidence against them and a warrant is issued by a judge.\n\n\u201cThese concerns we\u2019re hearing that bounty hunters are just going to be kicking in doors, that\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s illegal now, it\u2019s illegal under my bill,\u201d Gregory told CNN.\n\nState Sen. David Gregory, left, photographed speaking to CNN's Omar Jimenez, said there has been misinformation about his bill. CNN\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m hearing other types of harassment concerns or things like normal, everyday citizens walking up and saying, \u2018hey, you show me your papers,\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s illegal. That\u2019s illegal today. And it\u2019s illegal under my bill,\u201d he said.\n\nThose concerns were raised by some of the dozens of people who spoke against the bill during a senate committee hearing.\n\n\u201cThis bill would not only tear apart families, schools and congregations and communities, but also pit neighbors against one another,\u201d said Yazmin Bruno-Valdez, who introduced herself as a longtime Missouri resident, community advocate and \u201cDreamer\u201d who was brought to the US as a child and is currently allowed to remain.\n\nImmigration and civil rights attorney Javad Khazaeli told CNN Gregory\u2019s stated intention could be overrun if the bill becomes law.\n\n\u201cWhen you put bounties on people, you\u2019re incentivizing grabbing people,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd when you grab people, bad things happen.\u201d\n\nKhazaeli, who\u2019s based in St. Louis, spent a decade as a federal government lawyer advising officers in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies about immigration law. He was aware of times when local law enforcement officers would seek training on immigration regulations as they targeted a specific safety problem. But even with training, there would almost inevitably be problems, he said.\n\n\u201cWe saw issues where local law enforcement officers were arresting Puerto Ricans because they thought Puerto Rico wasn\u2019t part of America. Every time you have any kind of interaction like this, the only possible way for the person on the other end who\u2019s being harassed to get out of it is by showing their papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow this is exactly \u2014 and I\u2019m not trying to be hyperbolic here \u2014 but this is exactly what we had in Nazi Germany,\u201d he added.\n\nThat being said, it could be surprising that the lone voice from a member of the public supporting Gregory\u2019s bill in committee came from Rabbi Ze\u2019ev Smason.\n\nSmason, a rabbi in St Louis for 25 years, rejected the comparisons to the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly were they doing in Nazi Germany? They were turning in neighbors if they had a 16th of Jewish blood within them and then they took them in cattle cars and they exterminated them. That\u2019s what was done in Nazi Germany. Is that what\u2019s being done over here?\u201d he asked.\n\nRabbi Ze'ev Smason was the lone voice speaking in favor of the bill at a public session. . CNN\n\n\u201cI see no reasonable comparison between the two,\u201d he added.\n\nHe told CNN it was a matter of justice. \u201cI think people, even though we\u2019re not a border state, are very concerned about illegal immigration \u2026 because it\u2019s an abrogation of the law and, in general, a spirit of lawlessness is something that\u2019s destructive to our community and our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMistakes could be made, he conceded, but he trusted in the judicial system. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that most of the time our police and our courts get it right,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyer Khazaeli said the publicity around Gregory\u2019s bill has already had a chilling effect, even on immigrants with legal status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing people who\u2019ve been in this country for decades, legally, terrified,\u201d he said, mentioning one woman from Europe who had been a legal permanent resident for 30 years, now looking to become a citizen because she was afraid of what could happen.\n\nAt the state capitol, Gregory said: \u201cMy intention is to make sure that we, as a state, can step up \u2026 and protect our women and our children and our Missourians from the dangerous immigrants. I\u2019m sorry that that scares them but that is not the intent.\u201d\n\nHe said he was optimistic the bill would pass but that it would take time.\n\nIf the senate progresses the bill, it will go to the state House of Representatives.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson wrote, \u201cI have not heard any enthusiasm from House Republicans about doing any bounty hunter legislation. We are pleased that President Donald Trump is addressing illegal immigration at the federal level, including by signing the Laken Riley Act, which enables states to work with the federal government on immigration.\u201d\n\nA similar bill put forward by the Mississippi Legislature was killed in early February.\n\nThat bill had many of the hallmarks of Missouri Senate Bill 72 including: a $1,000 reward for tips that led to the arrest of undocumented immigrants, the creation of a \u201ccertified bounty hunter\u201d program, and also the threat of life in prison.\n\nJavad Khazaeli, an immigration and civil rights attorney, said he was ready to sue if SB72 passed and people were detained illegally. CNN\n\nThe American Immigration Council estimated there were nearly 70,000 undocumented immigrants living in Missouri. State Attorney General Andrew Bailey said there were up to about 100,000.\n\nThey include Chavarria\u2019s parents, who Chavarria said currently have work permits but are also in the process of trying to legalize their status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen my parents asking for a handout,\u201d Chavarria said, rejecting some narratives used against migrants.\n\nChavarria also said she wanted criminals off the streets whatever their citizenship, as did the people she knew. \u201cThe right immigrants know that we have to respect a country that we\u2019re not citizens of,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re aware of that and that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nNow with children of her own, she has at times struggled to explain this moment in American politics. They\u2019re 8 and 9 years old.\n\n\u201cThey tell me that the kids in school will scream \u2018Trump, Trump, Trump\u2019, and I tell them like, well, that\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI do try to let them know just to always be proud of who they are,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go very in depth with them because they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe system is way broken,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we could put the effort that we\u2019re putting into deporting all these immigrants, I wish that that effort could go into fixing that system, setting it up to where there\u2019s an actual pathway to citizenship or residency,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nBut for this bill and this moment, Khazaeli said he and other lawyers were ready.\n\n\u201cIf they push this forward, we\u2019re just going to sue them and we\u2019re going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to start arresting people that they have no right to arrest, they\u2019re going to start detaining people that they have no right to detain.\u201d\n\nHe said he was concerned that even if the \u201cbounty\u201d part of the bill got dropped, other measures he sees as too extreme could pass.\n\n\u201cThis could happen in Missouri, and we\u2019re preparing for that.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDan Bongino, the incoming deputy director of the FBI, suggested on his popular podcast in January that the agency he is now about to help lead was complicit in planting pipe bombs around Washington ahead of the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cI believe the FBI knows the identity of this pipe bomber on January 6th, four years ago, and just doesn\u2019t wanna tell us \u2018cause it was an inside job,\u201d Bongino said on his podcast.\n\n\u201cFolks, this guy was an insider,\u201d he added. \u201cThis was an inside job. And it is the biggest scandal in FBI history.\u201d\n\nA former Secret Service agent and NYPD cop, Bongino has become a successful conservative media personality in part by spreading conspiracy theories about the so-called deep state that alleges federal workers are plotting to undermine the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe FBI is a frequent target of his ire.\n\nBongino has called the bureau \u201ccorrupt\u201d and even suggested it doctored surveillance footage of the pipe bomb suspect, suggesting the bomb was planted by law enforcement to create a narrative that Trump supporters were trying to assassinate then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you this many times,\u201d he added on the January show. \u201cThe person who planted that bomb was definitely an insider. It was not an anti-Trump person. It was someone planting a bomb to create a narrative that crazy MAGA people are trying to assassinate Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nThe unsolved case of who planted two pipe bombs the night before the riot, one near the Democratic National Committee and the other near the Republican National Committee, has fueled a wide range of conspiracy theories, many of which have been fodder for Bongino\u2019s successful podcast.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security watchdog report published in 2024 detailed how close Harris came to the \u201cviable\u201d pipe bomb placed near the DNC that day.\n\nThe Dan Bongino Show is consistently one of the most popular podcasts on the Apple Podcast charts.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Bongino, a White House spokesperson praised him to CNN.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump brilliantly selected Dan Bongino\u2014a highly-qualified former NYPD police officer and U.S. Secret Service agent\u2014as the next Deputy Director of the FBI,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs President Trump said, Bongino will work alongside Director Kash Patel to bring law and order, fairness, and justice back to America, and his willingness to give up his wildly popular podcast shows his dedication to serving our country.\u201d\n\nA FBI spokesperson told CNN, \u201cThe FBI does not have any comment.\u201d\n\nBongino did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n\nKash Patel, the newly-confirmed FBI director, has also raised conspiracy theories about the pipe bomb, including in January, on a conservative podcast.\n\nTogether, Patel and Bongino, two of MAGA world\u2019s most well-known figures, will help President Donald Trump remake the FBI amid his long-standing grievances with the bureau stretching back to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nA CNN KFile review of Bongino\u2019s social media account on X found that he first began to sour on the FBI in May 2017 after a special counsel was appointed to take over the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation, accusing the \u201cdeep state\u201d of trying to undermine Trump. He has since published multiple books alleging an anti-Trump cabal trying to sabotage the president.\n\nCNN also found that Bongino deleted numerous tweets, including one from the day of the Capitol riot that attacked then-Rep. Liz Cheney for saying the states had to uphold the Constitution and certify the results.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when states violate the Constitution? Does a \u2018Constitution\u2019 serve a purpose if it only binds parties that believe it\u2019s a Constitution?\u201d Bongino wrote.\n\nBongino also deleted tweets that refer to the \u201cdeep state,\u201d including one in which he wrote, \u201cThe Deep State is determined to have Trump\u2019s scalp.\u201d It is unclear when the tweets were deleted or why.\n\nBongino routinely doubled down on conspiratorial rhetoric regarding the FBI, adding that if declassified information confirmed the pipe bomb was an inside job, the FBI would deploy another cover-up of a training exercise gone wrong.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to say it was a training exercise. We put these training bombs down there because we weren\u2019t sure the security around Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on January 6th was gonna be any good. We put these training devices to test everyone,\u201d Bongino said. \u201cNo, this was not a training. This was an effort to frame MAGA people.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Winter Hawk contributed to this story."

            "full_content": "The meeting between Trump, Vance, and Zelensky is a great clarifying moment, the first time president Trump or any president has, in a dramatic way, said no to the Washington establishment consensus in foreign policy, or, more informally, the blob. The blob, as most know, always gets its way. Through well-funded think tanks, establishment journalists, the military\u2013industrial complex and its many congressional supporters, tells us the proper way to think about foreign policy. Since the end of the Cold War, it has operated with no real opposition. (During the Cold War, when there was a serious enemy, there was actually more vigorous debate\u2014d\u00e9tente or no d\u00e9tente? Nuclear missiles in Europe? Keep fighting in Vietnam or let it go?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe blob always wins. Bombing Belgrade in support of a Kosovo insurgency, no opposition. Invasion of Iraq, no real debate until the invasion has obviously gone sour. Fighting in Afghanistan for years after anyone entertained any hope that the country could be turned into any kind of viable non Islamist state. Obama showed signs of wanting to circumvent the blob\u2014but political realities compelled him to maintain former Cheney aide Victoria Nuland as his premier official dealing with Russia. Ditto on his hope to curb Israeli settlements, another Obama hope that went down.\n\nBut the blob really kicked into overdrive with Ukraine. The blob wanted NATO expansion (although in the 1990s most foreign policy professionals did not). Ukraine, half of whose population deeply despises the Russian identifying third, wanted American support for its side in its long-running civil war. Its government wanted Kiev to become capital of an American NATO base with American nuclear missiles aimed at St. Petersburg.\n\nThe blob concurred. In 2014, the blob took the side of anti-Russian protesters in a street coup which overthrew an elected Ukrainian president who wanted to maintain strong ties to Russia. Tens of millions of dollars were spent by blob entities (e.g. the National Endowment for Democracy) to support the street putschists. Blob politicians made countless pilgrimages to Kiev\u2014no one doubted on which side virtue lay. (This was well before any Russian seizure of Ukrainian territory; it is remarkable how united the Washington blob could be about a domestic struggle in an obscure country half the world away\u2014whereas anyone in politics usually knows there are two or more reasonable sides to any question.) Russia, having lost the street battle in Kiev, seized the Russian-populated Crimean peninsula, home to its Black Sea fleet.\n\nZelensky was elected hoping to negotiate and calm the civil war between Russian-identifying Ukrainians and their foes. But he was quickly corrected by the Biden administration\u2014to be anti-Russia was the key to winning American support and aid. The blob hated Russia. Zelenskly complied with Biden. Putin, clearly at the end of his tether, massed troops on the border to show his open displeasure, hoping obviously for a negotiation that would push Ukraine off the NATO track. It never came.\n\nSince the 2022 invasion, blob propaganda went into overdrive. Zelensky is \u201cChurchill,\u201d Putin is \u201cHitler\u201d was a message drilled in thousands of times in the American media. If Putin wasn\u2019t stopped, he would march to the English Channel, said the blob. (Putin\u2019s armies couldn\u2019t manage to take Kiev, and for a while seemed as if they might lose the war entirely.) And once Zelensky\u2019s forces, outmanned and outgunned, began to lose, Zelensky faced a dilemma. Probably the only way he could survive was to bring America into the war\u2014survive not just politically but physically. Zelensky could be killed by pro-Russian forces, or by the neo-Nazi formations that are more powerful in Ukraine than in any country. So Zelensky had an objective interest in escalating the war, bringing America in. One could feel sorry for him\u2014he didn\u2019t choose the war, but objectively his interest was in a wider war.\n\nSomehow it took Donald Trump to recognize that a wider war against a nuclear-armed Russia was very much not in America\u2019s interest. No other American candidate for president did. (J.D. Vance, however, did\u2014he said early on that he didn\u2019t \u201ccare that much\u201d about Ukraine, and since our \u201ccaring for\u201d Ukraine has led to hundreds of thousands of dead and maimed Ukrainians, surely there are some in that country\u2014probably millions\u2014 who wished the blob hadn\u2019t cared so much as well.)\n\nStanding up the blob takes enormous self-confidence, a readiness to take on serious, able enemies\u2014real courage. Trump obviously dissed Zelensky in the Oval Office, but, more importantly, he dissed the blob as well. The blob will seek its revenge."

            "full_content": "Washington, DC CNN \u2014\n\nWhite House chefs were at work in the West Wing on Friday laying out plates of rosemary chicken, celery root puree and collard greens when the sound of raised voices began floating over from the Oval Office.\n\nInside, a remarkable scene was unfolding. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had begun berating their guest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a hitherto unseen public implosion of a key global relationship.\n\nFor supporters of Ukraine, the moment was disastrous: Everything that could have gone wrong in a meeting between two headstrong leaders did, in the span of 10 minutes.\n\nYet for all the shock, it was not an unforeseen outcome. Indeed, in the lead up to the talks \u2014 which were intended to culminate in the signing of a new agreement on rare earth minerals \u2014 many allies of both men quietly wondered whether their already combustible dynamic would end in triumph or catastrophe.\n\nEfforts were taken to prepare Zelensky for a successful meeting with Trump, who is famously susceptible to flattery and highly attuned to how he\u2019s being treated. The Ukrainian president was warned to focus squarely on the minerals deal \u2014 and to avoid getting drawn into a fight.\n\n\u201cI told him this morning, \u2018Don\u2019t take the bait. Don\u2019t let the media or anyone else get you into an argument with President Trump. What he\u2019s doing today is resetting the relationship,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was among a group of Republican and Democratic senators who met Zelensky before he came to the White House.\n\nOther European leaders who\u2019d come through the building this week offered Zelensky their own guidance, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who has found success in an approach to Trump that balances adulation with pushback.\n\nStill others \u2014 including some US officials \u2014 tried to discourage Zelensky from making the trip to Washington at all, believing work was still needed to strengthen what had already become a hostile relationship.\n\nStill, by the time Zelensky was pulling into the White House gates on Friday, few could have predicted quite how explosive the ensuing 139 minutes would become \u2014 though some detected early signs of trouble.\n\nStepping from his black SUV wearing what has become his standard uniform \u2014 drab military shirt and pants \u2014 Zelensky did not belie any tension with Trump, who had walked through the halls of the West Wing to greet him.\n\nBut some US officials watching from afar saw a problem: Zelensky\u2019s attire.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re all dressed up,\u201d Trump said with an air of sarcasm as he greeted Zelensky and shook his hand.\n\nBefore the Oval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match, Zelensky was asked by a reporter from a right-wing outlet \u2014 handpicked by the White House to be in the room during the talks \u2014 why he was not wearing a suit in the United States\u2019 highest office.\n\n\u201cI will wear a costume after this war will finish, yes,\u201d Zelensky said, responding in English. \u201cMaybe something like yours, yes, maybe something better. I don\u2019t know, we will see. Maybe something cheaper. Thank you.\u201d\n\nPerhaps taking a lesson from the parade of foreign leaders who had preceded him in the White House over the past month, Zelensky did not arrive empty handed. He brought with him the UFC belt won by the Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk last year.\n\nThe colorful gold belt, which sat propped on one of the end tables as the two men got to talking, went unmentioned during the talks, glinting under the lights.\n\nFor the first 40 minutes of their talks, Trump did not evince outward bitterness toward Zelensky, instead discussing the minerals deal they were planning to sign later in the day.\n\nIndeed, upstairs in the East Room a long wooden table had been prepared for the signing ceremony, with four chairs ready for the signatories.\n\nIt was never to be.\n\nThe vice president speaks up\n\nJoining the conversation after remaining mostly silent, Vance interjected \u2014 \u201cHold on. Hey, I want to respond to this\u201d \u2014 to make the case for Trump\u2019s efforts at bringing the conflict to an end.\n\n\u201cThe path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,\u201d he said, directing his comments to Zelensky.\n\nThat is where everything went south.\n\nA bristling Zelensky \u2013 himself unaccustomed to public rebukes after three years of stalwart Western support \u2013 indignantly laid out the ceasefires Russia had broken in the past.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What \u2013 what do you have \u2013 what do you \u2013 what do you mean?\u201d he asked incredulously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\u201d Vance responded from his place on the sofa next to Trump.\n\nIt only devolved from there.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,\u201d Vance said in a sharp reprimand. \u201cYou should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\u201d\n\nWhen Zelensky tried \u2013 somewhat unsuccessfully \u2013 to get a word in, Trump erupted in anger.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards right now,\u201d he bellowed, talking right over Zelensky when he objected.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people,\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, Trump dismissed the media from the room.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be great television, I will say that,\u201d he called out as reporters filed out.\n\nA rattled Ukrainian delegation \u2014 including the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova, who stopped taking notes during the meeting and simply placed her head in her hands \u2014 left the Oval Office to regroup in the Roosevelt Room, just down the hall.\n\nHuddling with his own key advisers to assess the situation, including Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump was enraged, saying he felt disrespected by Zelensky\u2019s tone.\n\n\u201cZelensky played it as wrong as he could play it. He came into Oval acting like a tough guy. It didn\u2019t play well. Everyone in the room felt insulted,\u201d one US official said. \u201cNow Zelensky will have to figure out how to fix this on his own. We can\u2019t fix it for him.\u201d\n\nThe president ultimately decided that Zelensky was \u201cnot in a place to negotiate,\u201d one White House official said. He directed Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver the message to the Ukrainians who were waiting nearby: It was time for Zelensky to leave.\n\n\u201cTime is not on your side here,\u201d Waltz told Fox News on Saturday, recounting his conversation with Zelensky. \u201cTime is not on your side on the battlefield. Time is not on your side in terms of the world situation, and, most importantly, US aid and the taxpayers\u2019 tolerance is not unlimited.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians protested, saying they wanted to continue the talks, the White House official said. But the request was declined.\n\nAs the plates of salad, chicken and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that had been planned for lunch sat uneaten on carts in a hallway outside the press secretary\u2019s office, the Ukrainians were instructed to leave.\n\nThe surreal day of broken diplomacy unfolded in the span of less than three hours.\n\nZelensky\u2019s motorcade left the White House gates at 1:42 p.m., with no fanfare or sendoff. He was driven a short distance away to the Hay Adams Hotel, where he and his advisers were staying.\n\nLess than an hour later, he sent a message on social media expressing his gratitude to his hosts: \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit.\u201d He added, \u201cUkraine needs just and lasting peace and we are working exactly for that.\u201d\n\nTrump allies rally around the president\n\nBy then, a White House that had started the day looking to make a deal with Ukraine had suddenly changed course and sought to turn the diplomatic uproar into a moment of strength by launching an extraordinary public relations offensive.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and VP Vance are standing up for Americans,\u201d the White House said in the first of several statements Friday afternoon. A few hours later, another message was sent with words of support from members of the Trump cabinet.\n\n\u201cAmen, Mr. President,\u201d Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said.\n\nGraham, a close ally of Trump who had met with Zelensky earlier in the day, strode to the cameras outside the West Wings. He called on Zelensky to apologize or consider stepping aside.\n\n\u201cI have never been more proud of the president,\u201d Graham said.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the East Room of the White House, the set up for a news conference for Trump and Zelensky was dismantled. A large table for the two leaders to sign the agreement, against a backdrop of three Ukrainian and three American flags, was moved away.\n\nFor the next few hours, Trump worked inside the West Wing with his staff. He was seen in the Oval Office with Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, and other advisers before he stepped out to leave the White House for the weekend.\n\nMarine One was waiting, but Trump stopped to talk one more time, trying to put his stamp on the day\u2019s remarkable turn of events.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,\u201d Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to end the death.\u201d\n\nAsked if he wanted Zelensky to step down, Trump declined to answer directly, only saying: \u201cI want somebody that\u2019s going to make peace.\u201d\n\nA whirlwind day in Washington drew to a close as Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to his Mar-a-Lago resort for the weekend. Shortly after takeoff, Zelensky came on Fox News, for an interview that Trump watched on the presidential aircraft.\n\nZelensky said he did not believe he owed Trump an apology for the fiery outbursts in the Oval Office, but expressed his regret that it all unfolded on television for the world to see.\n\n\u201cI think it was not good,\u201d Zelenksy told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. \u201cI think it was not good.\u201d\n\nBut he said he believes his relationship with Trump and America will survive.\n\n\u201cYour people helped save our people,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe are very, very thankful.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this reporting.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

By comparison, former special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s resignation was included in a court filing shortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the matter told NBC News that Weiss submitted his resignation voluntarily \u2014 he was not asked to resign, the sources said.\n\nWeiss did not respond to a request for comment Friday night.\n\nHe was succeeded by acting U.S. Attorney Shannon T. Hanson. Hanson previously worked for Weiss in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here.\n\nIt was expected that Weiss would step down at some point after he concluded his investigation and issued his final report on Biden. That report was made public Jan. 13.\n\nIn it, he bashed President Joe Biden for pardoning his son Hunter.\n\nIn the official White House statement announcing the pardon, the president described the prosecution of his son as a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d which prosecutors for the special counsel later disputed in a court filing.\n\nBiden repeatedly said during the 2024 presidential campaign, including after he dropped out, that he would not pardon his son.\n\nThe cases brought by Weiss led to a guilty verdict on gun-related charges in Delaware and a guilty plea on tax and fraud charges in California. Biden was scheduled to be sentenced in December 2024 for both cases.\n\nAs NBC News previously reported, Weiss pointedly responded to critical statements by Joe Biden about the investigation following the December pardon.\n\nWeiss wrote in his final report that the president could not \u201crewrite history,\u201d suggesting that Biden\u2019s criticism of the case against his son when he announced his pardon decision had maligned \u201cthe public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoliticians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public\u2019s confidence in our criminal justice system,\u201d Weiss wrote. \u201cThe President\u2019s statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.\u201d"

He credits his faith for a reversal in political fortune.\n\nScott is the longest-serving Black senator in U.S. history, and the first Black chair of a standing Senate committee in his role atop the powerful Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\n\n\"If we are to overcome the obstacles in our way, it won't be red or blue. It won't be black or white. It will be green,\" the South Carolina Republican declared to rousing applause.\n\nDuring Black History Month, Scott hosted an Opportunity Summit event where he announced his goal of making $1 trillion in investments accessible in underserved communities over the next decade. He was joined by Walter Davis, a founding member of the holding company, Peachtree Providence Partners.\n\n\"It is incredibly important for us to figure out how to unlock capital for disadvantaged communities,\" Scott explained. \"My goal is to set the kind of parameters that allows for $1 trillion of capital to be set free in disadvantaged communities in the next 10 years. I believe we can get to $2 trillion!\"\n\nScott pointed to his own experience as a small business owner when he ran an insurance firm prior to entering politics.\n\n\"That's called the American way, or at least it's supposed to be the American way,\" Scott said. \"And I aim to make sure that, from a banking perspective, we have the flexibility of regulators so that small business owners with a good plan, with decent credit, have access to the capital to start hiring people from their own communities.\"\n\nScott has made economic development a core pillar of his policy agenda, which includes affordable housing, education, low tax rates and financial literacy and inclusion. He cited proposed legislation, such as the Road to Housing Act that seeks to expand housing supply, and the Empowering Main Street in America Act, meant to streamline access to capital access for more entrepreneurs.\n\n\"Those two things, housing and small businesses, transform minority communities and disadvantaged communities all across America,\" Scott said.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker also continues to champion the expansion of his Opportunity Zones initiative, bipartisan legislation passed as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act he spearheaded to provide federal tax incentives to economically distressed areas. The initiative has generated more than $85 billion in investment, according to Scott.\n\n\"He's the father of Opportunity Zones,\" President Trump touted this month during a White House Black History Month reception. \"He came into the White House, the Oval Office, with this idea, and it's probably the number one economic development project ever in our country.\"\n\nIn an op-ed Friday for Fox News, Scott said he wants to unlock opportunities for others just as his family sacrificed for him.\n\nScott told the story of his grandfather, who was born in 1921 and dropped out of school when he was 8 years old. He said he never learned to read or write, but had a photographic memory and once advised him that \"I could be a victim or I could be victorious, but I couldn't be both\"\n\n\"A man who had no access, lived long enough to watch me beat Strom Thurmond's son for Congress in the place where the Civil War started,\" Scott reflected. \"Our relatives have paid too high a price for us not to see discomfort as a motivating factor for our success.\""
