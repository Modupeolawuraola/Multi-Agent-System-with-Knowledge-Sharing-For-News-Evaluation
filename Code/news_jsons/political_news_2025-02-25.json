He even deputized billionaire Elon Musk to be the face of a new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBut critics say Musk\u2019s chainsaw approach to slashing government programs, contracts and jobs is having the opposite effect, sowing such confusion that it has hamstrung the bureaucracy\u2019s ability to serve the public and carry out key parts of Trump\u2019s own agenda.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s leading to paralysis, and nothing is getting done,\u201d said one Veterans Affairs official who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. The official described \u201cabsolute chaos\u201d at the agency, with even Trump political appointees afraid to misstep and incur a backlash from either the White House or the public.\n\n\u201cThe best employees are starting to look elsewhere,\u201d the official added. \u201cI can\u2019t overemphasize that enough.\u201d\n\nTrump and other White House officials say that the president is thrilled with Musk\u2019s work and wants him to be more aggressive. But there are signs of pushback within the political ranks of the administration, where Cabinet secretaries risk losing the civil servants best equipped to carry out critical government functions, and rank-and-file civil servants say exercises in navel-gazing have become a distraction from important work.\n\nIn short, running the government can be harder than it looks.\n\nEmail ultimatum fallout: Several veteran federal workers who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity said that managers and employers at agencies spent hours on Monday determining how to deal with Musk\u2019s email directive \u2014 beyond just the time it took to assemble bulleted lists.\n\n\u201cProbably spent at least 30-60 minutes sharing thoughts about how to approach it with other federal employee friends from different agencies,\u201d said one of the workers who asked that her agency not be named. \u201cProbably spent 60 minutes thinking about how it might be interpreted and also looked at the banned words to make sure I did not include those.\u201d\n\nThe employee was referring to words \u2014 such as \u201cdiversity\u201d \u2014 that the administration is averse to. \u201cI spent at least 30 minutes drafting [and] shared it with my manager via email before sending it,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMore on DOGE:\n\nTwenty-one civil service employees resigned en masse from DOGE, saying in a joint letter that they refused to use their technical expertise to \u201ccompromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans\u2019 sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Musk will participate in Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting tomorrow.\n\nAnd the White House confirmed that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of DOGE. Her LinkedIn profile has her listed as the senior adviser at the U.S. Digital Service since January, the agency that was morphed into DOGE.\n\nAfter facing blowback from constituents at town halls, several House Republicans are seeking more information and compassion from the DOGE effort.\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nAn economic warning sign for Trump in the polls\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nA flood of new polls this past week offered a snapshot of how Americans are feeling about Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Averaging them together, 46% approve of his job performance and 50% disapprove. That\u2019s hardly great by any historical standard, but also largely in line with what he posted during his first term (and actually at the higher end of that range).\n\nBut there was one noticeable difference: the economy.\n\nDuring his first term, this issue was a rare bright spot for Trump in polling. Over his four years in office, he averaged a 49% approval rating for his handling of the economy, with 41% disapproving, according to NBC News\u2019 polling. But in recent surveys, those numbers are now reversed.\n\nThe difference may not be massive in raw numbers, but it becomes more significant when you consider that Trump\u2019s average first-term rating on the economy outpaced all of his predecessors\u2019 this century.\n\nTrump\u2019s 49%-41% rating on the economy was much higher than his overall average job approval rating (44%-53%). And the contrast between his first-term economic numbers and those of his successor, Joe Biden, provided Trump with a key advantage during last year\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn the early part of his second term, though, Trump\u2019s numbers are in line with those of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, both of whom were weighted down by the economic upheaval of 2007 and 2008 and its lingering effects.\n\nThe administration\u2019s argument is that Trump has inherited a rough situation from Biden and that, in time, the economy will gain strength. But for now, Democrats are sensing a potentially potent political weapon to use against Trump and the GOP in this fall\u2019s off-year elections and next year\u2019s midterms.\n\nIf there\u2019s a silver lining for Trump and his party in his current ratings, it\u2019s that he also started out slow during his first term, posting his worst economic numbers during his initial months in office. Within a year, though, he was firmly in positive territory, something that could certainly happen again.\n\nBut if Trump\u2019s numbers remain where they are, or decline further, this could present a political opening for Democrats that they didn\u2019t have the first time he was president.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2611\ufe0f On the floor: House Speaker Mike Johnson is plowing forward with a vote as early as this evening on a budget resolution to advance Trump\u2019s legislative agenda even as he is still working to sway the holdouts.

            "full_content": "Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has continued to disrupt Washington with massive cuts to federal agencies and mass layoffs of government workers. Yet one question has remained through the organization\u2019s first month: Who exactly is running things?\n\nWhile Musk has long been the public and online face of DOGE, the White House has maintained that the Tesla CEO is not actually in charge. Last week, Joshua Fisher, the director of the White House\u2019s Office of Administration, said in federal court papers that Elon Musk has \u201cno actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\u201d per the Associated Press.\n\nThe administration maintained this posture on Tuesday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt fielded questions as to the identity of the DOGE administrator, a role established by the executive order that created the temporary initiative. Leavitt said that Musk is a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d and that he is overseeing DOGE but declined to say who is currently holding the administrator role.\n\nThen, in a sudden twist, the White House finally provided a name. Semafor reports that Amy Gleason is the acting DOGE administrator, citing an administration official. According to her LinkedIn account, Gleason most recently worked as a senior adviser at the United States Digital Service, the unit that was subsumed by DOGE when it was created. She has experience in health care, having worked as chief product officer for both the investment firm Russell Street Ventures and Main Street Health, which focuses on care in rural areas. The Washington Post reports that Gleason will be in charge of efforts to modernize IT and data at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe reveal immediately prompted questions about the extent of Gleason\u2019s involvement. CBS News reports that when contacted Tuesday, Gleason told the outlet she was in Mexico and declined further comment. Sources told the New York Times that Gleason was unaware that the White House was planning on revealing her role to the public.\n\nOn Wednesday, Leavitt told reporters that Gleason has held the position \u201cfor quite some time\u201d and that it wasn\u2019t a secret to anyone. \u201cEverybody knew and we said who she was to all of you because you are hounds in the media who are so obsessed with this for some reason. So, in the effort of transparency, we told you who that person is,\u201d she said.\n\nDoes Gleason support what her department has become? Is she in touch with Elon Musk? In some ways, this mystery has been solved, but in other ways it continues."

Her position with DOGE was first reported by the Washington Examiner.\n\nShe also worked in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, including being placed on the White House Coronavirus Task Force\u2019s data team, led by Dr. Deborah Birx, because of Gleason\u2019s technology background. In that role, Gleason led the creation of the national Covid-19 case tracker database.\n\nBefore returning to government work, Gleason joined Russell Street Ventures, a firm founded by Brad Smith, who is now a DOGE adviser.\n\nDespite pledging full transparency, the White House has refused or been unable to identify the administrator of DOGE, including during Tuesday\u2019s press briefing. While Musk has served as the initiative\u2019s public face and continues to issue social-media directives to government workers, the White House has maintained that his status is one of a special government employee, and not a full-time worker.\n\n\u201cSo, the president tasked Elon Musk to oversee the DOGE effort,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Tuesday when asked directly who was administering the initiative. \u201cThere are career officials and there are political appointees who are helping run DOGE on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nJustice Department attorneys were grilled in a court appearance Monday about who the administrator was, but none were able to say then, either.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s involved? Who\u2019s in charge? Who\u2019s giving them direction?\u201d Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly asked government attorneys at the hearing, which examined DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive data systems at the Treasury Department.\n\nJudges, including Kollar-Kotelly, have raised the lack of clarity around DOGE\u2019s structure as impeding their ability to decide the emergency disputes before them.\n\nShe and others have raised possible constitutional issues, depending on the chain of command at DOGE and who is behind the sweeping decisions that have the upended federal government\u2019s operations in recent weeks.\n\nThe White House official did not say how long Gleason has been the acting administrator.\n\nIt had been unclear to some employees if Gleason had the acting administrator position when she led an all-staff meeting in person in Washington, DC, last week. She did not make it known nor did people ask at the time. Gleason gave a message at the meeting signaling, \u201cI am here to move the organization forward and to reassure you that all your projects are a priority,\u201d according to a federal employee who has worked with Gleason but asked to remain anonymous because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss her new role.\n\nThe employee described Gleason, in general, as \u201cdirect and to the point.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Sunlen Serfaty, Michael Williams and Shania Shelton contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Youngkin is loyal to Trump but not looking all that happy about it. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump 2.0 enterprise is already conducting a really big gamble with its three-pronged smash-and-grab assault on the federal government via Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE, Russell Vought\u2019s OMB, and congressional Republican budget cuts. Everyone involved understands that the kind of Americans who decide elections tend to dislike big government and bureaucrats as an abstract matter but also like a lot of specific things Washington provides. Much of the game right now involves the size and speed of the inevitable backlash to what the new administration (and particularly Musk) is doing. And for Republican politicians expected to implement and lead cheers for this extravaganza in public-sector demolition, many anxious eyes will be on early electoral tests for the GOP, which now owns the very federal government it\u2019s seeking to disable.\n\nThe bad news for Republicans is that one of the very first and most closely watched tests will be in Virginia (which, along with New Jersey, has one of the two off-year gubernatorial contests of 2025). Virginia has an unusually strong tendency to react negatively to the party controlling the White House (11 of the last 12 gubernatorial races in the state have been lost by the sitting president\u2019s party). Worse yet, vote-heavy northern Virginia is a vast bedroom for the federal employees and contractors that Musk is decimating, cackling like a cartoon villain as he goes. It\u2019s not surprising to see that Trump\u2019s current popularity in the state is sinking. A new Roanoke College poll showed just 37 percent of Virginians approving the job Trump is doing and a record 59 percent disapproving. Republicans had thought Trump was doing relatively well in this state: He lost it by 5.7 percent in 2024 as opposed to a 10.1 percent loss in 2020. Indeed, the GOP was bullish about their prospects in Virginia generally with incumbent (and term-limited) Governor Glenn Youngkin remaining relatively popular and the race to succeed him between his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, and Democrat Abby Spanberger looking very close. But the Roanoke College poll showed Spanberger leading that race by double digits (39 percent to 24 percent).\n\nAside from the near certainty that federal budget cuts and personnel firings are going to be a problem for Republicans between now and the November general election, the Roanoke survey showed other elements of Trump\u2019s agenda not looking great to these highly influential voters. Big majorities felt that wealthy people and corporations do not pay their fare share of federal taxes, which is relevant to Trump\u2019s plans to cut taxes for both. And 76 percent of respondents said undocumented immigrants (of which there are likely many in Virginia) should be allowed to stay in the country \u201cwith conditions,\u201d while only 26 percent flatly favored deporting them.\n\nYou\u2019d think in these circumstances that the relative popular Youngkin could help Republicans distance themselves from Trump and avoid some of the likely backlash to his policies. But in today\u2019s GOP, that\u2019s just not in the cards, as the Bulwark reported:\n\n[F]ear not, DOGE\u2019d-off workers of the Commonwealth! Gov. Glenn Youngkin has a message for you: Your days of leeching off the public may have come to an end, but with a little elbow grease and pluck, you just might successfully transition to actual productive work in the private sector.\n\nThat was the gist of Youngkin\u2019s strikingly tone-deaf press conference yesterday, focused on the cheerful theme VIRGINIA HAS JOBS. \u201cListen,\u201d Youngkin said, \u201cwe have a federal government that is inefficient, and we have an administration that is taking on that challenge of rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse and driving efficiency in our federal government. It needed to happen \u2026\u201d\n\nOnline attempts yesterday to soothe Virginia\u2019s laid-off federal workers weren\u2019t going much better. Lieutenant Gov. Winsome Sears, who is running to replace the term-limited Youngkin, released a direct-to-camera video acknowledging \u201cconcern about the federal government workforce transition,\u201d and sharing five links to \u201cadditional resources to assist.\u201d All five links led to broken \u201c404 Page Not Found\u201d website errors.\n\nBarring an extremely unlikely change of course by the federal administration across the Potomac River, Trump\u2019s policies will continue to be a lodestone for his party in Virginia this year. And the Virginia gubernatorial race will likely remain a source of hope for Democrats looking for concrete signs that the 47th president\u2019s November victory was after all a flash in the pan rather than the sort of remorseless trend MAGA activists seem to assume is in the works. Perhaps Glenn Youngkin\u2019s craven surrender to the team harassing his constituents will earn him a nice ambassadorship somewhere."

Tons of gold.\" pic.twitter.com/NuVU2G15sv \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 24, 2025\n\nThe state of the U.S. government\u2019s gold reserve at Fort Knox has been the focus of conspiracy theories for decades. The highly secure Kentucky military base stores 147.3 million ounces, which is currently worth around $433.7 billion, according to the U.S. Mint. The U.S. left the gold standard in 1971, but if Fort Knox has less gold than the government says \u2014 or none at all \u2014 it could roil gold markets, aside from being a massive scandal.\n\nSo why has this suddenly become a top concern for the Trump administration? Apparently because ZeroHedge tweeted at Elon Musk. On February 15, the DOGE chief had this exchange with the conspiracy-minded financial news site on X:\n\nOver the next few days, Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee \u2014 longtime Fort Knox gold skeptics \u2014 urged DOGE to do an audit. Musk said the American people want to know if the gold is \u201cstolen\u201d or \u201cstill there,\u201d and replied to an Alex Jones post, \u201cIt would be cool to do a live video walkthrough of Fort Knox!\u201d\n\nSince the first gold shipment arrived at Fort Knox in 1937, federal officials have checked on it several times, most recently during the first Trump administration. Per Forbes:\n\nThe Fort Knox depository has only opened its doors to non-authorized personnel on three occasions: In 1943 for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1974 for 10 Congress members to break down \u201ccobwebs\u201d to \u201cre-assur[e] the public that their gold is intact and safe\u201d and in 2017 for a delegation including Sen. Mitch McConnell, R. Ky., and then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \u201cIt is freakishly well secured,\u201d then-Gov. Matt Bevin, R. Ky., said after visiting the Fort Knox depository in 2017. \u201cThe gold is safe,\u201d Bevin added.\n\nAnd last week, Trump\u2019s new Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told iHeart Radio host Dan O\u2019Donnell that the department audits Fort Knox every year, and that \u201call the gold is present and accounted for.\u201d He added that senators are welcome to come see for themselves.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: @USTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirms to me that yes, there is still gold in Fort Knox. pic.twitter.com/NUQzYrexZI \u2014 Dan O'Donnell (@DanODonnellShow) February 19, 2025\n\nBut it seems Trump doesn\u2019t trust his own Treasury secretary on the matter. He has brought up Musk\u2019s Fort Knox audit, unprompted, several times in the past week. On February 19, Trump kept steering the conversation back to gold as he took questions from reporters on Air Force One.\n\n\u201cWe hope everything\u2019s fine with Fort Knox, but we\u2019re going to go to Fort Knox, the fabled Fort Knox, to make sure the gold is there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the gold isn\u2019t there, we\u2019re going to be very upset.\u201d\n\nA day later, Trump told Republican governors that he will join Musk on his as-yet-unscheduled visit to Fort Knox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually going on this one. All my life I\u2019ve heard about Fort Knox. That\u2019s where the gold is kept,\u201d Trump said at a reception in Washington, per The Hill.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a little bit shaky. We\u2019re getting the yips on this stuff. Like, I want to find out,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up the doors. I\u2019m going to see if we have gold there. Did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox?\u201d\n\nSo why is Trump taking time out of his busy schedule to personally investigate the contents of Fort Knox? The likeliest explanation is that he\u2019s just fulfilling a boyish fantasy, like when he played with big trucks and became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. Who wouldn\u2019t want to tour the \u201cfabled Fort Knox\u201d? Here\u2019s how the New York Times described the congressional visit the vault back in 1974:\n\nStacked from the floor 8 feet to the ceiling in a vault 6 feet wide and 12 feet deep were 36,236 bars, glistening in the half\u2010light. The effect of standing in the presence of about $1,775,688,776.85 worth of gold in one room was awesome. \u2026 \u201cOhs\u201d and \u201cahs\u201d arose from 10 members of Congress who were there to see whether, indeed, the gold was still there.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s fixation on the idea that \u201cmaybe somebody stole the gold\u201d is a bit suspicious. The president has a habit of accusing other people of things he\u2019s guilty of himself and a well-known fondness for all things gold. Perhaps he isn\u2019t the most trustworthy detective to put on the case.\n\nThis post has been updated."

Tesla\u2019s market value dropped below $1 trillion for the first time since November 2024.\n\nTesla sales are in an unprecedented slide, and the company\u2019s sales dropped 45% last month across Europe despite the popularity of electric vehicles there, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. And though Musk is a deeply polarizing figure, it\u2019s not clear that his politics are playing a major role in Tesla\u2019s sales slump. Growing competition, especially in China, and sinking demand growth in the United States are playing a major role in Tesla\u2019s slump this year.\n\nNevertheless, Tesla\u2019s stock slide represents a stark change in investors\u2019 attitudes from November 2024, right after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Musk had never been richer, with his net worth hitting a record $347.8 billion, Bloomberg reported, after a steady rally for Tesla.\n\nInvestors believed that Musk\u2019s influence in the Trump administration would usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company. Musk, Tesla\u2019s largest individual shareholder, was roughly $83 billion richer since Election Day by the end of November.\n\nSteve Man, global lead director for auto and industrial market research at Bloomberg Intelligence, told CNN over email that Tesla could still \u201cthrive beyond the noise.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s \u201cpolitical maneuvers steer headlines and spark backlash in parts of the consumer base, but the company continue to drive cutting-edge tech with ambition to build a loyal fanbase,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk\u2019s alliance with Trump pushed his ventures to the forefront. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, as well as the owner of X and the CEO of other ventures, including Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Company. He now oversees the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and has made a number of controversial job cuts and downsizing in the federal government, including thousands of layoffs across agencies.\n\nMusk\u2019s net worth dropped $5.2 billion this past week, according to the latest update to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index. He\u2019s still the richest person in the world with a net worth of $380 billion \u2014 a whopping $144 billion richer than the second-richest person in the world, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThree different federal judges delivered legal setbacks and slap downs to President Donald Trump in the span of an hour and a half on Tuesday in a series of cases challenging controversial moves taken during the early days of his second term.\n\nThe rulings from judges in Washington, DC, and Washington state are the latest to pump the brakes on Trump\u2019s agenda, underscoring the critical role courts have taken on for foes of Trump looking to frustrate his actions.\n\nIn DC, Judge Loren AliKhan issued a preliminary injunction that indefinitely blocks the administration from freezing federal grants and loans. The ruling expands an earlier block the appointee of former President Joe Biden issued last month shortly after the White House ordered the funding freeze.\n\n\u201cIn the simplest terms, the freeze was ill-conceived from the beginning. Defendants either wanted to pause up to $3 trillion in federal spending practically overnight, or they expected each federal agency to review every single one of its grants, loans, and funds for compliance in less than twenty-four hours. The breadth of that command is almost unfathomable,\u201d AliKhan wrote in her ruling.\n\nShe went on to say that the spending freeze was \u201cirrational, imprudent, and precipitated a nationwide crisis.\u201d\n\nThe issue of withholding federal funds has become a major flashpoint during the opening weeks of Trump\u2019s second term, with other pending cases challenging the White House\u2019s decision to suspend all foreign assistance.\n\nShortly before AliKhan issued her ruling, a separate jurist in the DC federal courthouse \u2013 Judge Amir Ali \u2013 ordered the Trump administration to pay foreign aid-related money owed to government contractors and nonprofit groups by Wednesday night, amid the legal fight over the freezing of USAID and State Department funds.\n\nThat order amounted to a legal reprimand after the plaintiffs in the cases repeatedly accused the administration of not complying with Ali\u2019s earlier temporary restraining order that revived the funding contracts and grants that existed at the end of the Biden administration.\n\nAli \u2013 also a Biden appointee \u2013 rebuffed an earlier call by the challengers for the administration to be held in contempt for its alleged non-compliance. But he issued a new order requiring, in more forceful terms, that the government pay money owed to contractors and non-profits for work that had already been completed by the February 13 order.\n\nMeanwhile, across the country in Washington state, a federal judge in Seattle issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday that halts Trump\u2019s executive order suspending refugee admissions and funding.\n\nJudge Jamal Whitehead, who was also appointed by Biden, said that Trump\u2019s \u201cactions amount to an effective nullification of congressional will in establishing the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the president has substantial discretion to suspend refugee admissions, that authority is not limitless,\u201d the judge said.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day back in office, also directed a review of the refugee program and stated that resettlement should only resume if deemed to be in the \u201cnational interest\u201d \u2013 a move critics argue is a de facto refugee ban.\n\nCases advance to next stages\n\nThe administration is facing at least 80 cases challenging a range of actions taken during Trump\u2019s first few weeks back in office.\n\nThe plaintiffs behind those challenges have seen some success as they\u2019ve pressed judges to issue emergency relief during the early stages of the litigation. But the White House, too, has scored some court victories in cases brought against the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal workforce and shutter the US\u2019 foreign aid agency.\n\nMany of the cases are finally getting a more thorough review by judges who are mulling whether to issue preliminary injunctions to block the contested government action. Such a decision is often the final trial court-level ruling issued in cases before they\u2019re appealed by the losing side.\n\nAs AliKhan explained her reasoning for issuing the preliminary injunction in the funding freeze case, she said the nonprofits that brought the case were likely to succeed on their claims that the freeze was unlawful.\n\n\u201cThe scope of power (the Office of Management and Budget) seeks to claim is \u2018breathtaking,\u2019 and its ramifications are massive,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBecause there is no clear statutory hook for this broad assertion of power, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.\u201d\n\nAnd AliKhan noted that her earlier order temporarily halting the funding freeze was just that \u2013 temporary.\n\n\u201cThe relief Plaintiffs now seek is a more durable version of the relief they sought then, when their members were on the brink of extinction,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn sum, Plaintiffs have marshalled significant evidence indicating that the funding freeze would be economically catastrophic \u2013 and in some circumstances, fatal \u2013 to their members.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed and Angelica Franganillo Diaz contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "Photo: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nExcept for a brief low after his attempt to overthrow the government a few years back, Donald Trump has had an iron grip over the Republican Party for close to a decade now. This had led to a lot of grand old sucking up to Trump over the years. But since his second term began, the Republican sycophant industrial complex has moved into a new gear. Below are the most egregious recent examples of the term so far.\n\nA bill to make Trump\u2019s birthday a national holiday\n\nOn February 14, New York representative Claudia Tenney introduced a bill to make Donald Trump\u2019s birthday, June 14, a federal holiday.\n\n\u201cHis impact on the nation is undeniable,\u201d Tenney wrote in a statement announcing the bill. \u201cJust as George Washington\u2019s Birthday is codified as a federal holiday, this bill will add Trump\u2019s Birthday to this list, recognizing him as the founder of America\u2019s Golden Age.\u201d (So far, the golden age has consisted of plunging consumer confidence and fears of more inflation due to Trump\u2019s tariffs.)\n\nA bill to put Trump on Mount Rushmore\n\nFlorida representative Anna Paulina Luna proposed a bill in January to make Mount Rushmore a little more crowded by adding Trump\u2019s visage alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMount Rushmore, a timeless symbol of our nation\u2019s freedom and strength, deserves to reflect his towering legacy \u2014 a legacy further solidified by the powerful start to his second term,\u201d Luna wrote, just eight days into the term. The one-page bill did not detail how or where sculptors would chisel Trump\u2019s face into the 5,725-foot mountain in South Dakota, or how they would get his hair right.\n\nA bill to change the name of Greenland to \u2018Red, White and Blueland\u2019\n\nAnother stunt bill came from Representative Buddy Carter, who proposed legislation changing the name of Greenland to \u201cRed, White and Blueland.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has correctly identified the purchase of what is now Greenland as a national security priority, and we will proudly welcome its people to join the freest nation to ever exist when our Negotiator-in-Chief inks this monumental deal,\u201d Carter said in a statement announcing the bill last month.\n\nA resolution to allow Trump to serve a third term\n\nJust three days into Trump\u2019s second term, Representative Andy Ogles was hoping for a third. The Tennessee Republican filed a resolution to amend the Constitution and void the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. Trump \u201chas proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation\u2019s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal,\u201d Ogles fawned.\n\nA pair of bills to put Trump\u2026on a bill\n\nRepresentative Brandon Gill of Texas announced his plans to introduce legislation to replace the face of founding father Benjamin Franklin with Trump on the $100 bill. The congressman told Fox News that the move \u201cis a small way to honor all he will accomplish these next four years.\u201d His legislation would require the Treasury Department to begin workshopping designs by 2026 with the intention of having the Trump bills in circulation in 2029.\n\nGill isn\u2019t the only member of Congress proposing a currency-based tribute to the president. Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina also introduced the \u201cDonald J. Trump $250 Bill Act\u201d which would direct the Treasury Department to design a $250 bill featuring Trump\u2019s face, in honor of the upcoming 250-year anniversary of the founding of the United States. Notably, Wilson\u2019s bill would also revise a centuries old statute barring living figures from being depicted on currency, adding an exemption for those who have served as president.\n\nA U.S. Attorney that calls himself Trump\u2019s lawyer\n\nEd Martin, the nominee for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has joined Trump\u2019s spat against the Associated Press over the outlet\u2019s refusal to re-designate the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. On Monday, Martin posted on an official government account that his office was serving as \u201cPresident Trumps\u2019 lawyers\u201d and that he would remain \u201cvigilant in standing against enemies like the AP.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the typo, a U.S. Attorney is appointed to uphold the law, not to do the president\u2019s bidding or treat journalists like hardened criminals. Leave that kind of thing to the deputy director of the FBI, Dan Bongino."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson pulled off a stunning turnaround Tuesday night to rescue a critical vote to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda that had seemed doomed just moments earlier.\n\nSurprising even some of his critics, Johnson and his leadership team capped hours of drama in the Capitol by successfully flipping multiple Republican holdouts to pass a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward moving Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda forward. With help from last-minute phone calls from Trump, GOP leaders spent all of Tuesday in a furious pressure campaign to win backing for their plan.\n\n\u201cThe world didn\u2019t end today. But I do see the edge,\u201d Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, said of the whiplash in the House.\n\nRepublicans had punted the vote Tuesday night only to turn around minutes later to call fleeing members back to the floor to muscle through the plan.\n\nIn the end, Johnson lost just a single vote \u2014 fiscal hawk Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 which was all he could afford. The Democrats\u2019 whip team scrambled to get near-full attendance on their side: Rep. Brittany Pettersen flew with her 4-week-old baby to make it in time for the vote and Rep. Kevin Mullin, who is recovering from complications from knee surgery, flew with an IV from California.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Democratic lawmaker brought her newborn son to vote against GOP proposal 01:13 - Source: CNN Democratic lawmaker brought her newborn son to vote against GOP proposal 01:13\n\nBut the drama won\u2019t end there: Johnson and his allies acknowledge that what comes next will be much more difficult. Tuesday night\u2019s vote itself was procedural and GOP leaders from the House and Senate will need to agree on how exactly to move ahead with Trump\u2019s sprawling legislative package now that they have adopted divergent plans. The days-long saga over the House budget blueprint laid bare bitter divisions among Republicans that will make it extraordinarily difficult to pass that package in both chambers.\n\nStill, the win comes at a critical time for Trump and Johnson as their party faces crushing deadlines ahead, including avoiding a government shutdown next month and the threat of an economic default later this spring. As with Tuesday night\u2019s vote, navigating those political landmines will require near total unity from the GOP.\n\nGOP leaders will now get to work on exactly what will make it into Trump\u2019s first legislative package. The newly passed House GOP plan calls for sweeping tax cuts, steep spending cuts and a two-year debt limit hike, as well as new money for border security and energy production. The Senate\u2019s plan, however, contains only national security and energy money, while punting on the more contentious items for later.\n\nThe stakes are high for GOP leaders: Trump is eager to pass his agenda as quickly as possible, even as party leaders must comply with the extremely strict constraints of the budget powers that allow their party to pass a package without Democratic votes. And Republicans will need to tread carefully on reforms to popular programs like Medicaid, food assistance and Pell grants \u2014 concerns that nearly sunk the budget plan this week.\n\nThe successful vote capped a dramatic 12 hours for Johnson. In the morning, he held a tense meeting with House Republicans to convince his members to back the budget blueprint or risk forgoing key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nBut by the afternoon, House GOP leaders were still struggling to lock down the votes, and even the relentlessly upbeat Johnson acknowledged he may need to pull it.\n\nThe votes weren\u2019t there around 7:30 p.m., when the speaker moved to scrap plans to hold the vote at all. But then his leadership team \u2014 with help from a Trump call to Rep. Victoria Spartz \u2014 was able to win over the last holdouts. So, just moments after dismissing members, Johnson called them back to vote and passed the GOP\u2019s budget blueprint.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, said he decided to change his vote after he received \u201cassurances\u201d of a future plan that could survive the Senate to trim discretionary spending, though he offered no specifics.\n\nAnd Spartz added that she spoke with Trump on health care issues, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s on board to get some great things done on health care. \u2026 I trust his word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the last few weeks are showing us how difficult it is to move any package through the House,\u201d Rep. Dusty Johnson, a leadership ally, acknowledged earlier Tuesday. \u201cThis is a motley crew.\u201d\n\nHours before the scheduled vote, hardline conservatives insisted there weren\u2019t enough spending cuts in the plan, even as centrist-leaning Republicans remained uneasy about the size of those cuts and whether they could impact popular programs like Medicaid. And Johnson\u2019s efforts to win support even backfired in some corners. Massie said he left a meeting Tuesday morning even more dug in against the budget than before.\n\n\u201cThey convinced me in there, I\u2019m a no,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said, holding up a thick packet of leadership talking points and railing against their plans line by line. By the time of the vote, Massie remained the only GOP \u201cno.\u201d\n\nJohnson and his whip team had spent the last several days trying to win over their more moderate members, many of whom had raised concerns that the budget plan could ultimately lead to cuts to the low-income health program Medicaid.\n\nAhead of the vote, Republicans from northeastern states were particularly wary of plans to cut $880 billion over a decade from federal health and energy programs, which they fear cannot be achieved without cutting Medicaid, the hugely expensive health program, since Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare.\n\nGOP leaders have strongly pushed back against the idea that benefits would be cut, noting that the budget plan is only a framework and not specific policy. They argue there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits, though it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.\n\n\u201cThis is a procedural vote. You tell me what the cuts are,\u201d House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN when asked about swing seat lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Medicaid cuts.\n\nIn the end, Johnson only recorded a single Republican defection.\n\n\u201cWe will get there, as we always do,\u201d the speaker predicted earlier in the day, when he was still lacking at least a half-dozen votes.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Alison Main, Morgan Rimmer, Veronica Stracqualursi and Aileen Graef contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Timothy Fadek/Redux\n\nOn February 17, President Donald Trump nominated a lawyer named Ed Martin to serve as the acting U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., and Martin jumped into the job with great vigor \u2014 including decisions to dismiss January 6 charges against a defendant he is representing and firing the prosecutors on that case. Unlike almost every person before him who previously served in the role, he has no experience as a prosecutor. But he has plenty of on-the-job training as a Republican operative and pro-Trump partisan. Below are some of Martin\u2019s most brazen efforts yet.\n\nDismissed the Capitol riot prosecutors\n\nMartin spent most of his career in Missouri politics, losing races for governor and attorney general before becoming the state\u2019s GOP chairman. Later, he helped organize the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021 that fed into the riot at the Capitol.\n\nLast last month, the week after Trump issued a blanket pardon to those charged over the Capitol riot, Martin fired 30 federal prosecutors who had worked on cases involving the riot. In an email to his staff, Martin described the prosecutions as a \u201cgreat failure of our office\u201d and has advocated for reparations for those who served time. He then went on the offensive, sending a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer suggesting he may investigate his March 2020 statement that Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would \u201cpay the price\u201d for voting against abortion access. (Schumer later walked it back.) \u201cWe take threats against public officials very seriously,\u201d Martin wrote.\n\nAlso dismissed the case of a Capitol riot convict he was still defending\n\nWhen Trump issued pardons for January 6 convicts on his first day, he also ordered the Justice Department to dismiss any outstanding indictments related to the riot. Martin, on his second day as U.S. Attorney, filed to dismiss these cases \u2014 including one of a defendant named Joseph Padilla who was convicted of assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon. Martin moved to dismiss the case, even as he was on file as Padilla\u2019s defense attorney.\n\nThe day after Reuters reported on the conflict \u2014 lawyers are not allowed to serve in both the prosecution and the defense team \u2014 Martin filed to withdraw as Padilla\u2019s attorney. But he could not step down. The judge on the case determined determined that Martin was \u201cnot in good standing\u201d with the court and was not permitted to file motions because his attorney membership was expired.\n\nCalled himself \u2018President Trumps\u2019 lawyer\u2019\n\nFederal prosecutors are sworn to protect the Constitution, not be loyal to a president. But Martin has so far adapted his role to fit the Trump\u2019s understanding of the Justice Department as an extension of his personal legal team.\n\nOn Monday, following the Associated Press lawsuit against the White House barring them access for refusing to use Trump\u2019s \u201cGulf of America\u201d name, Martin tweeted from the official U.S. Attorney\u2019s account that his office was in fact were \u201cPresident Trumps\u2019 lawyers.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s all in for DOGE\n\nAt the federal level, he has bought into Elon Musk\u2019s campaign to strip the government for parts. In early February, he wrote a public letter to Musk offering his office\u2019s services to the Department of Governmental Efficiency, writing that he would \u201cpursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo testifies before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. Photo: Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nA possible 11th-hour entry by Andrew Cuomo has loomed over the New York City mayoral race for weeks. Now it looks like he\u2019s about to throw his hat in the the ring, and he appears to be in a very good position to do so.\n\nA Honan Strategy Group\u2013conducted poll from Tusk Strategies, first reported by the New York Post, found the former governor leading among likely Democratic voters with 38 percent of the vote, putting him far out in front of the rest of the primary challengers. Leftist Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani received 12 percent, followed by incumbent mayor Eric Adams with 10 percent, comptroller Brad Lander with 7 percent, and former comptroller Scott Stringer with 5 percent. Brooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie came in at 2 percent, and Queens state senator Jessica Ramos at one percent.\n\nThough the survey hails from Cuomo-friendly territory (Politico recently reported that Tusk Strategies\u2019 CEO has been making calls on the former governor\u2019s behalf), its findings are similar to earlier polls that showed Cuomo with a double-digit lead over the crowded field. And another new poll out on Tuesday, by UniteNY poll, has Cuomo leading the primary with 35 percent in the first round. That survey takes into account New York City\u2019s ranked-choice voting system and differs significantly from the Tusk Strategies one beyond the Cuomo number; it shows Stringer in second place with 17 percent and Adams in third place with 15 percent.\n\nCuomo has probably seen enough to finally jump in. Sources tell the New York Times that the former governor could launch his campaign as soon as this weekend with fundraisers to follow within days. He was recently endorsed by his onetime rival Carl McCall and Representative Ritchie Torres and is expected to receive the backing of the New York City District Council of Carpenters, which previously supported Adams, per Politico. More key endorsements are likely to follow.\n\nBut Cuomo\u2019s high name recognition is likely a double-edged sword. In 2021, his long tenure in Albany ended in disgrace following numerous allegations of sexual harassment against him. Though Cuomo resigned, he always maintained his innocence and made moves to sue one of his accusers, Charlotte Bennett, for defamation. The former governor has also been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, facing accusations that his administration knowingly undercounted the number of deaths in nursing homes related to the virus. Last year, Cuomo testified on the issue before a Republican-led House panel that later alleged he lied to Congress and made a referral to the Justice Department. Earlier this year, a Justice Department inspector general report concluded that pandemic investigations into Democratic-led states conducted during Trump\u2019s first term might\u2019ve been politically motivated, something that Cuomo and his team have long argued.\n\nCuomo\u2019s potential challengers have long been prepared for this moment. Myrie has criticized the former governor for being \u201cquiet\u201d on the impacts of Trump\u2019s presidency; his campaign launched a website with a running clock noting the length of his silence. In October, Ramos pushed back on the idea a Cuomo comeback in a lengthy thread on social media.\n\n\u201cLike Donald Trump begging for a second term, Andrew Cuomo wants you to think that it will be different this time \u2014 that if we go back, things will move forward. But we know better: We are not going back,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMamdani and Lander have both sought to draw parallels between Cuomo and Adams:\n\nCuomo is gearing up to run for Eric Adams\u2019 second term. https://t.co/0IyGpWlby3 \u2014 Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) February 21, 2025\n\nA New York Democrat hasn\u2019t sold out his party this bad since Andrew Cuomo formed the IDC. https://t.co/1WMNsCrS8O \u2014 Brad Lander (@bradlander) January 21, 2025\n\nAs for Adams, he has continued to downplay the former governor\u2019s strength in the polls, citing the fact that during his first mayoral campaign Adams also trailed entrepreneur Andrew Yang. \u201cSo in February, Andrew was kicking my rear. And you know what? We don\u2019t say Mayor Yang. We say Mayor Adams,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, polls don\u2019t make mayors. People do.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Will this man suffer to pay for Trump\u2019s tax cuts? Photo: Thomas Barwick/Getty Images\n\nAdminister truth serum to any rock-ribbed True Conservative, and odds are you\u2019ll find a deep (if often suppressed) desire to take a sledgehammer to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Both were perennial targets of the great austerity-budget advocate Paul Ryan during his years as House Budget Committee chairman and then as House Speaker (not to mention 2012 vice-presidential nominee). Much more recently, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership report (you know, the one Trump claimed he knew nothing about but that clearly shaped most of his first steps as the 47th president) referred to Medicare and Medicaid as \u201cthe principal drivers of our $31 trillion national debt.\u201d Medicare, of course, which provides health insurance and other critical benefits to the nation\u2019s seniors, is legendarily a political third rail. So Republican politicians, sometimes with fingers crossed behind their backs, frequently promise not to cut Medicare or its cash-benefit counterpart, Social Security. You can see that promise in Agenda 47, Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign platform.\n\nPrecisely because Medicare is so popular, Republicans who are seeking money to pay for tax cuts or to reduce the size of government often focus their wrath on Medicaid, the federal-state program that mostly provides health insurance to low-income people. That\u2019s what Republicans tried to do in their narrowly unsuccessful Obamacare repeal legislation the last time Trump was president, and this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson will urge Republicans to pass a budget blueprint guaranteeing another assault on Medicaid.\n\nBut Medicaid is very important to those who use it (eligibility varies to a considerable extent by state). As health-policy expert Jonathan Cohn points out, that\u2019s a lot of people; at least 70 million Americans are on Medicaid:\n\nGOP proposals [to cut Medicaid in 2017] provoked an outcry from people who stood to lose coverage \u2015 not just working adults, but also senior citizens and people with disabilities, many of whom rely on Medicaid to pay for home care or nursing homes.\n\nThat coalition today is, if anything, bigger than it was back then. Something like two-thirds of Americans have been on Medicaid or have a family member who has been, according to surveys from the research organization KFF. It has also become a financial lifeline for the health care industry, especially hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income residents.\n\nSo now, Republicans are using their traditional tactic of not acknowledging that Medicaid cuts are Medicaid cuts. Even as his congressional allies debated exactly how much money to wring from the program to help pay for Trump\u2019s border-security and tax-cut demands, Trump himself told Sean Hannity in an interview, \u201cMedicare, Medicaid \u2014 none of that stuff is going to be touched.\u201d Later, the White House \u201cclarified\u201d his remarks by saying the administration sought to protect Medicaid \u201cwhile slashing the waste, fraud and abuse within the program.\u201d Following suit, Johnson blandly asserted that the $800 billion or so in Medicaid savings he\u2019s expecting the relevant House committee to produce will come out of \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d\n\nSome House Republicans are calling b.s. on that chestnut, as Politico reports, quoting Texas congressman Tony Gonzales:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s waste, fraud and abuse in every program in the government, including Medicaid \u2014 but at what point do you stop cutting into the fat and start cutting into the bone? You can\u2019t pull the rug out from millions of people.\u201d\n\nGonzales, who has a large constituency enrolled in the program, already co-authored a letter with seven other House Republicans representing large Hispanic populations asking Johnson to rethink where the GOP is headed on Medicaid. And he said he plans to personally confront the speaker about the issue at a scheduled meeting tonight.\n\nJohnson can only afford to lose one House Republican vote and still pass his budget blueprint. While these Medicaid protectors in the House are generally described as \u201cmoderates,\u201d a warning against deep Medicaid cuts was also issued by MAGA senator Josh Hawley.\n\nWhat stratagems might Johnson & Co. adopt to cut Medicaid spending without directly cutting Medicaid benefits? The most obvious is a Medicaid \u201cwork requirement,\u201d which some states adopted during the first Trump administration without significant results, other than burdening people already working (a big majority of those on Medicaid) with documentation requirements and also afflicting those with caregiving responsibilities. But it\u2019s entirely possible Republicans will redeploy past proposals that don\u2019t cut out \u201cwaste\u201d but instead shift cost responsibilities to the states, such as the per capita cap on federal Medicaid payments that was part of the 2017 Obamacare-repeal legislation, or a Medicaid \u201cblock grant\u201d designed as a way station to a complete state takeover.\n\nSo we could see a Republican revolt against major Medicaid cuts now when they are just in the \u201cblueprint\u201d phase (legislation implementing them will come in the spring or summer), or a battle that flares up before they are final. One thing that\u2019s clear is that Medicaid is tangible and affects an awful lot of people and their representatives in Washington. There\u2019s nothing abstract about fighting Medicaid cuts, particularly when they can accurately be described as being executed to pay for tax cuts for Trump\u2019s billionaire friends. So it very much could become and remain a flash point."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 The House adopted a budget proposal on Tuesday that paves the way for implementing President Trump's legislative agenda, handing a major victory to House Speaker Mike Johnson who had been trying to sway a small number of holdouts in the final hours before the vote.\n\nRepublicans narrowly adopted the resolution in a 217-215 vote with no Democratic support and only one GOP defection \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. With one Democrat absent, Johnson could afford to lose just one GOP vote. Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio, Victoria Spartz of Indiana and Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who had said they would not vote for the resolution, ultimately caved.\n\n\"We got it done,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the resolution's adoption. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We are going to deliver the American first agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step in that process.\"\n\nHouse GOP leadership stalled bringing up the resolution for more than an hour then appeared to pull the vote, before bringing the bill back up minutes later. The House Democratic Whip's Office said Republicans had assured Democrats there would be no further votes before it was brought back up.\n\nJohnson worked the phones with Mr. Trump to persuade holdouts to vote for the package that would enact Mr. Trump's massive defense, border security, energy and tax agenda. At one point before the vote, the House leader huddled in the back of the chamber with Spartz, Burchett and Massie, before leaving the floor with Spartz, who had had a phone to her ear.\n\nThe president was a \"big help,\" Johnson said. He added that he didn't make any commitments to holdouts to get them to flip to yes, saying \"we just got everybody to yes.\"\n\nJohnson has been racing to move forward with the resolution, a crucial step in the budget reconciliation process, after House Republican infighting spurred the Senate to forge ahead with a competing plan earlier this month. Johnson won a key victory last week when Mr. Trump endorsed his chamber's budget outline.\n\nThe House GOP budget plan instructs committees to craft legislation that would cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and at least $1.5 trillion in spending, while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back, according to an amendment to the resolution that was added to appease conservatives.\n\nHouse Democrats widely oppose the measure, and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, wrote a letter to his caucus on Monday telling them \"it's imperative that we are present with maximum attendance.\"\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, who gave birth a month ago in her home state, flew to Washington with her newborn son to vote against the resolution. Rep. Kevin Mullin of California, who has been battling a blood clot and infection after recent knee surgery, also made the vote.\n\n\"We had Kevin Mullin literally leave a hospital bed in California, travel here with an IV on the airplane, because he knows how important this vote is,\" said Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the minority whip.\n\n\"Brittany Pettersen is on maternity leave, but she understood on behalf of her constituents and the American people how important it was to be there,\" Jeffries said.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, was the sole absence. The Arizona Democrat has been battling cancer.\n\nDemocrats have warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits that could be pursued in the budget reconciliation process. The resolution tasks relevant committees with finding billions of dollars in cuts, some of which could target Medicaid, which has prompted concern among some Republicans, especially in battleground districts.\n\n\"This is the very beginning of the process, and they struggled until the very end, Democrats were unified, and we will remain unified throughout this process, because this reckless Republican budget will bring nothing but destruction to the American people,\" Jeffries said.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York was among the Republicans worried about Medicaid cuts, but she met with Johnson on Monday and said he assured her that Medicaid recipients would not be removed from the rolls \"unless they are not fulfilling the work requirements, and they're not citizens.\"\n\nHouse Republican leadership pushed back on the Medicaid concerns on Tuesday, calling it a Democratic talking point. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota said the budget resolution \"merely unlocks the opportunity for committees to begin drafting legislation,\" calling it a \"blueprint to save America.\" And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that the vote is simply one to begin the reconciliation process.\n\nStill, Johnson wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues, and the budget resolution instructs the committee overseeing Medicaid to find $800 billion in cuts. Johnson said cuts to the program would target \"fraud.\"\n\n\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" Johnson said, when asked whether there could be cuts to the program down the line. \"What we're talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste and abuse.\"\n\nThe House vote came after the Senate adopted its budget late last week, while the House was away on recess. Since Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House resolution, Senate Republicans have billed their own budget plan as a backup. The Senate plan would divide the reconciliation process into two bills, with the first aimed at quickly delivering resources for border security and defense, while a later bill would tackle the tax priorities. Senate Republicans also want to make the tax cuts permanent, which the House version does not do.\n\nand contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nDon\u2019t be shocked or awed. The daily explosion of chaos and confusion emanating from the White House during the first month of the new Trump administration is a political strategy intended to minimize accountability by leaving the president\u2019s critics demoralized, distracted, and disoriented, unable to figure out which battles should be fought.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like drinking from a fire hose,\u201d Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia told the New York Times a week after Trump took office. That\u2019s putting it mildly. Daily reports of federal workers being summarily fired by the thousands are running side by side with tales of businessman Elon Musk and his DOGE team ransacking databases and making wild, unproven, and inaccurate claims of government fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration is openly siding with Russia against Ukraine and actively undermining the NATO alliance; trying to drum transgender warriors out of the military; preparing a purge of FBI agents who investigated the January 6 insurrection; weathering an internal mini-revolt at the Justice Department caused by its attempt to rescue Mayor Eric Adams from corruption charges; and, of course, launching a mass deportation campaign.\n\nAll along the way, we\u2019ve seen a steady stream of cheap distractions like Trump renaming the Gulf of Mexico, vowing to eliminate the penny, or pretending to take over the U.S. Postal Service. The official White House social accounts recently posted an image of Trump wearing a crown and proclaiming \u201cLong Live the King.\u201d\n\nSeparating what\u2019s serious from what\u2019s nonsense has not been easy. Congressional Democrats have their work cut out for them, and so do all of us members of the media, who are a primary target of the chaos strategy. \u201cThe Democrats don\u2019t matter,\u201d MAGA operative Steve Bannon told a reporter back in 2018. \u201cThe real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\u201d In a 2019 Frontline interview, he elaborated: \u201cThe opposition party is the media, [and] because they\u2019re dumb and they\u2019re lazy, they can only focus on one thing at a time. \u2026 And all we have to do is flood the zone. Every day we hit them with three things, they\u2019ll bite on one, and we\u2019ll get all of our stuff done. Bang, bang, bang. These guys will never be able to recover.\u201d\n\nEvery self-respecting journalist should take Bannon\u2019s insult as a professional challenge. Those of us working the political beat \u2014 whether in small towns, big cities, remote statehouses, or the White House \u2014 regularly encounter efforts at media misdirection cooked up by slimy, amoral operatives, shady politicians, and the bombastic businessmen who fund them. The stakes are higher this time, but the game has never changed. And political journalists, who are (mostly) neither dumb nor lazy, need to rise to the occasion.\n\nThat starts with identifying \u2014 and downplaying \u2014 sucker bait like Trump\u2019s mid\u2013Super Bowl announcement that he had \u201cinstructed my Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\u201d It might be tempting to churn out stories about how each new penny costs 3.7 cents to produce, but there\u2019s no need, because according to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, only Congress has the power \u201cto coin Money [and] regulate the Value thereof.\u201d So \u201cTrump kills the penny\u201d is a non-story or, at best, a half-story unless it looks like Congress is preparing to take action (they aren\u2019t).\n\nWhenever Trump or his aides start blowing smoke, the question to ask is: What are they trying to hide? In my opinion, the most important story to focus on \u2014 the one that they want us all to ignore \u2014 is the shocking, open corruption and self-dealing by Musk and the Trump family.\n\nA few days before his inauguration, Trump launched a crypto meme coin, $TRUMP, that has no intrinsic value but quickly soared in price. Trump\u2019s stake, on paper, reached $58 billion for a short time before the price collapsed. That was a hint of things to come.\n\nTrump\u2019s conflicts of interest include his stake in Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent group of Truth Social. It\u2019s the largest source of Trump\u2019s wealth, and as a publicly traded company, notes the Times, \u201cwhile foreigners are not allowed by law to make campaign contributions to Mr. Trump, there is no limit on their ability to buy large chunks of stock in his company, perhaps in an effort to intentionally push up the stock\u2019s value and further enrich the Trump family.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s opportunity for a money grab is even more obvious. His companies have been awarded or promised $21 billion in federal contracts since 2008, including more than $20 billion paid or promised by NASA to Musk\u2019s SpaceX company and $5.6 billion promised by the Department of Defense, with a maximum future payout of $32.8 billion, according to the Independent.\n\nMusk is set to begin probing the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has fined him and Tesla and is investigating alleged wrongdoing connected to Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter in 2022. The billionaire and his operatives are also scouring data and recommending changes at the USDA and the Labor Department, which have investigated Musk\u2019s companies.\n\nAnd it was Musk who gleefully announced he had dismantled the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which regulates digital payment systems like the one Musk wants to turn X into. He has also challenged the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board, which regulates the right to form unions and previously clashed with the billionaire over his treatment of employees.\n\nAll news reports about the Trump-Musk dismantling of our government should include phrases like \u201cthe businessman, whose companies currently hold billions of dollars in government contracts from the very agencies he is probing\u201d or \u201cMusk, who stands to make money by weakening the agencies that regulate his private business.\u201d And White House claims that the self-dealing billionaire is engaged in an honest, disinterested search for waste and fraud should be challenged or ignored.\n\nThe response to Trump and Musk from every newsroom in the country should be to flood the zone with truth."

            "full_content": "In one of many sweeping changes to the functioning of the federal government, reports suggest that President Trump plans to take control over yet another independent agency, the U.S. Postal Service. Not content to have his handpicked postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, a holdover from the first Trump presidency, in place, Trump has signaled a desire to fundamentally alter the agency by bringing the service under direct executive branch control within the Commerce Department.\n\nThe purported goal of such a takeover is to make it operate with greater efficiency. But any Trump-controlled version will just bring us closer toward post office privatization, or serve as a means by which the administration could control a critical channel of communication among Americans that has largely protected our privacy for centuries.\n\nThe Post Office Act helped spread commerce and civic associations that were the lifeblood of the nation in the early 19th century.\n\nThis storied system, warts and all, predates the republic. It needs to remain free and independent, and must continue to serve as a lifeline to communities, not just another means through which the president can exert further control over America\u2019s communications and reward his political supporters.\n\nIn the 1770s, prior to the \u201cofficial\u201d start of the American Revolution, the upstart Continental Congress knew the value of a functioning and free postal system, creating what they called a \u201cconstitutional\u201d postal system that would enable them to communicate throughout the colonies without fear that their letters would be opened by loyalist postmasters. The Founders then wrote into Article I of the Constitution: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power to establish Post Offices and post Roads.\u201d\n\nIn October 1791, President George Washington transmitted his third annual address to Congress. In it, he stressed that a strong and modern postal system would spread \u201cknowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government,\u201d and protect the people \u201cagainst the effects of misrepresentation and misconception.\u201d\n\nCongress would then pass the Postal Act of 1792 that didn\u2019t just create the system as authorized by the Constitution, it also baked into the law the privacy of our communications, set mail rates and allowed lower rates for newspapers. Like Washington, James Madison believed a strong and effective postal system would ensure that \u201call virtuous Citizens\u201d would understand \u201cevery salutary public measure\u201d taken by government officials. It would give such citizens \u201cconfidence\u201d in their elected representative and ensure the population\u2019s \u201ccooperation with\u201d government actions.\n\nWhat is more, the Post Office Act encouraged the growth of the postal system and helped spread commerce and civic associations that were the lifeblood of the nation in the early 19th century.\n\nAt the end of John Adams\u2019 term as president, the nation had already created over 900 post offices, with over 21,000 miles of post roads. That system would continue to grow, and several decades later, the American postal system was larger than that of England, France and Russia at the time. Given its breadth and reach into virtually every community in the new country, for many Americans the postal system was the federal government, and its workforce rivaled even that of the standing army.\n\nToday, the USPS is the largest civilian employer in the government, with roughly 600,000 workers, many of them holding civil service and union jobs.\n\nThe postal system has been a political flashpoint at different moments in our nation\u2019s history. Andrew Jackson threatened to censor abolitionist tracts sent over the mails into slave states, claiming such information would result in a slave revolt. In the 20th century, during World War I and the later McCarthy era, law enforcement engaged in surveillance of those suspected of disloyalty to the nation.\n\nThe postal system was also no stranger to corruption, and charges of nepotism and political cronyism led to passage of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 that made the U.S. Post Office an independent agency, to prevent it from being used for nefarious political purposes.\n\nToday, the USPS is the largest civilian employer in the government, with roughly 600,000 workers.\n\nThe post office of the 19th century was often found in a dry goods store or other, similar commercial establishment in far-flung rural communities, serving as a hub of information and connecting such communities to the larger nation. Today, the postal system and post offices, in particular, continue to serve for many as their connection to loved ones and the economy. Low-income people without ties to financial institutions use the post office to obtain money orders to pay their rent and utility bills.\n\nBringing the Post Office under direct control of the executive branch would make crippling it even easier, lead to the destruction of the civil service and union protections of its hundreds of thousands of workers, and open the door for companies, like Amazon \u2014 that both deals in e-commerce for itself and other e-commerce companies, and whose CEO has been cozying up to and palling around with the president of late \u2014 to have a field day. They could raise rates and fill in the void created by a severely weakened postal system.\n\nSuch a system would also serve, like the colonial postal system, as a source of surveillance and monitoring of the president\u2019s critics.\n\nShould the president take such an action, which would defy the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, it will invite lawsuits that are likely to prevail. Like with so much else the administration is doing, however, that specter does not seem likely to prevent such action. But the courts can, and should, protect this critical and independent American institution on which many rely and in which many place their trust.\n\nAlthough not perfect, it is still better than any alternative the Trump administration might come up with, which is likely to be simple privatization and would leave Americans at the mercy of the private companies that would seek to step into the void. In this instance, like democracy, a free and independent postal system may not be the best possible system, it is just superior to any possible alternative that has been tried."

            "full_content": "Hours after his party\u2019s victory in Germany\u2019s federal elections, likely incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz began to soften his stance on immigration as he looks to form a coalition with leftist parties rather than the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany.\n\nWhile Merz campaigned as a supposed immigration hardliner, the successor to Angela Merkel as the leader of the Christian Democrats and the likely next leader of the country appears to be following the tradition of notionally right-wing politicians abandoning their election-time promises once the votes have been counted.\n\nAhead of the election, Merz put forward a plan to increase deportations and enact strict border restrictions to prevent illegal migrants from entering Germany from other EU nations, including those who claim to be asylum seekers. He argued that such restrictions should be made permanent and was joined in a controversial vote by the AfD. However, after winning the election on Sunday, Merz said that such measures should only be \u201ctemporary\u201d, broadcaster NTV reports.\n\n\u201cNone of us wants to close the borders,\u201d Merz claimed on Monday in a blatant attempt to court the establishment leftist Social Democrats to form a new government. During the campaign, the leftist parties argued that enacting border controls with its neighbours would be a violation of EU rules and, therefore, refused to support his plan.\n\nThe SPD was roundly rejected by German voters on Sunday, the party suffering its worst electoral loss since the Second World War. For the first time, it has come third place rather than first or second, possibly heralding the very end of the two-party system. Nevertheless, Merz appears intent on continuing the \u201cfirewall\u201d around the AfD, in which establishment parties in Berlin refuse to work with the populist-right party.\n\nThis likely means Merz will need to temper his positions to court the Social Democrats. Indeed, SPD leader Lars Klingbeil said on Monday that he expects that \u201cMerz will change his course and his tone significantly\u201d from the campaign if he hopes to form a government with the left-wing party. The SPD will also likely look to pressure Merz to ignore Germany\u2019s limits on debt, as it seeks to expand welfare and funding for Ukraine.\n\nShould Merz succeed in wooing the ousted SPD back into government with his CDU, it would mark the return of the so-called \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that governed the country during the European Migrant Crisis of 2015, which was facilitated in large part by the then-Angela Merkel-led government in Berlin.\n\nAfD leader Alice Weidel branded the likely chancellor\u2019s comments as an acknowledgement of \u201celection fraud\u201d from the CDU leader, saying that he \u201cthrew all his election promises overboard.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Merz] no longer wants to close the borders and wants to talk to the Greens and SPD about reforming the debt brake. This is politics against the will of the voters!\u201d\n\nThe issue of migration played a central role in the collapse of the former left-wing government, with a string of migrant terror attacks breaking out across Germany over the past year, including in Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg, and Munich.\n\nAfter Merz doubled down on his pledge to seek a coalition with the SPD rather than with the AfD, Weidel predicted that Merz would become merely an \u201cinterim\u201d chancellor and that his government would not last its full term, given that it would have to bend to the leftist agenda that voters rejected on Sunday.\n\nMerz is also facing challenge from within his own party, with powerful Minister-President of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik W\u00fcst calling for a significant increase in deportations, saying: \u201cWe need full planes every week that take people to where they are already entitled to an asylum procedure in Europe.\u201d\n\nW\u00fcst argued that Berlin needs to take the lead in reforming EU immigration policy, including increased external border protections, the registration of people who enter the bloc, and particularly the Dublin Regulation which stipulates that supposed refugees should apply for asylum in the first EU nation they arrive in.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just let it continue like this at random,\u201d he said."

            "full_content": "It is difficult if not impossible to parody that which has already become a parody of itself. And perhaps, when taking the measure of last weekend\u2019s Principles First conference in downtown Washington, parody isn\u2019t quite the right register to sound. Disgust will do just fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Principles First summit bills itself as the anti-MAGA alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. As such, the timing of the summit, which on Sunday afternoon was briefly interrupted by a bomb scare, was not accidental. A few miles south, across the river from Alexandria, CPAC was underway. Vice President J.D. Vance, fresh off giving our European friends a lesson on how self-styled democracies ought to behave, was greeted with a hero\u2019s welcome. By comparison, the star power at Principles First was decidedly second rate\u2014dinner theater for DeSantis die-hards.\n\nThe lineup of guest speakers was a who\u2019s who of a Republican Party that thankfully no longer exists.\n\nAmong the headliners was arch-neocon Bill Kristol. Kristol has been a fixture on the speakers and podcast circuit in the years since Rupert Murdoch shut down his neoconservative rag, The Weekly Standard. As Tucker Carlson once observed, \u201cUnder ordinary circumstances, Bill Kristol would be famous for being wrong.\u201d But credit where it is due, he\u2019s taken that talent and turned himself into the country\u2019s premier NeverTrump grifter.\n\nIn the eyes of the self-styled defenders of the republic such as those who gathered at the Principles First conference, Kristol isn\u2019t among the leading villains of our recent and blood-soaked past but a source of solace. He reassures his dwindling conservative followers that the age of Trump is an aberration\u2014the country has momentarily taken leave of its senses\u2014and we, the true elite, only have to wait out the Barbarians.\n\nJoining this esteemed company was none other than former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. After dropping out of the Republican presidential race in February 2016, he wormed his way back into Trump\u2019s good graces. By May of 2016 he was named chairman of Trump\u2019s presidential transition team. Yet when the governor was unceremoniously shown the door, Trump went from being a potential meal ticket to, in Christie\u2019s telling, a \"coward\" a \"puppet of Putin\u201d and \u201cthe cheapest S.O.B. I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work for Christie who, after illegally closing down the approach to the George Washington Bridge in 2013, hung his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, a single mother of four, out to dry. She served 13 months in prison. He ran for president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Alberto Gonzales. For an organization which bills itself as one in opposition to lawlessness and an out-of-control chief executive, the inclusion of Gonzales, former attorney general under George W. Bush, is really a bit of a head scratcher. According to the human rights attorney Scott Horton, even a cursory inventory of the crimes committed by Gonzales would include \u201cperjury, violations of the Hatch Act, misrepresentations to Congress, suborning perjury and obstruction of justice,\u201d to say nothing of his role \u201cin the introduction of torture into intelligence interrogation practices in violation of the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Convention on Land Warfare.\u201d\n\nThere were of course the usual suspects from the Conservatism Inc. echo chamber. Alumni from the ill-fated Weekly Standard who now run under the banners of The Bulwark and The Dispatch were among the featured guests. Stephen Hayes, author of a 2004 book about the alleged \u201cconnection\u201d between Obama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein appeared alongside Jonah Goldberg, another purveyor, in the early years of the War on Terror, of the conspiracy theory that Iraq\u2019s leader and al Qaeda were in cahoots. Goldberg lectured the audience about the importance of truth in politics.\n\nAt some point, it gets to be enough already.\n\nThese ghosts of GOP past have, since 2016, with the enthusiastic help of corporate and legacy media outlets such as CNN and MSNBC, laundered their reputations and emerged as lonely, courageous and principled defenders of the American constitutional order\u2014but only after having spent most of the last 25 years doing their level best to trash it.\n\nThe real reason these people fell out with Trump was because they perceived him not as a threat to the constitution but as a threat to their careers. Look at Christie and the super-hawk John Bolton. These opportunists looked at Trump with stars in their eyes when he gave them a seat at the table\u2014but once he pulled the chair out from under them, they became his most vociferous opponents. You\u2019d have to be about as clueless as former Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah (who, as it happens, was another honored guest at Principles First) to think there\u2019s anything more at work at one of these confabs than grievance\u2014grievance that Trump took away their party without so much as breaking a sweat.\n\nThe backdrop to these cross-town conferences is the brewing battle over Elbridge Colby \u2014 whose confirmation as undersecretary of defense for policy is being contested by the Ghosts of Republican Party Past.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s Zombie Caucus, including Senators Mitch McConnell, Roger Wicker, Lisa Murkowski and of course, the very same members of Conservatism Inc. that brought us, among other niceties, Iraq, Guantanamo, torture, black sites, ISIS, and a new and dangerous nuclear arms race, are determined to derail Colby for being insufficiently in awe of neoconservatism\u2019s track record since 9/11.\n\nThe problem facing the Zombie Caucus is that even in the event they are able to block Colby their brand of Republicanism has about as much popular appeal as another Christie presidential run: zero.\n\nMeanwhile, As Politico pointed out last week, Vance and other administration officials are sending \u201ca clear message to the world that Republican foreign policy as they have known it is dead \u2014 and they\u2019re not sorry about it.\u201d\n\nLooks like the undead at Principles First have yet to get the memo."
