            "full_content": "Astronauts on Boeing's Starliner say politics is not a factor in extended stay in space\n\nStarliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.\n\n\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"\n\nSpace station commander Nick Hague, center, flanked by Starliner commander Butch Wilmore (left) and pilot Sunita Williams (right) during an orbital news conference Tuesday. NASA\n\nWilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.\n\n\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.\n\nThe Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.\n\nIn mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.\n\nTo minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nThe Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.\n\nThe four Crew 9 fliers inside the Crew Dragon that will carry them back to Earth around March 19. Left to right: Starliner pilot Sunita Williams, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, commander Nick Hague and Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore. NASA\n\nOn Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"\n\n\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nHours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"\n\nMusk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"\n\nWilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.\n\n\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"\n\n\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"\n\nNASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"\n\nWhen asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"\n\nWilliams said he disagreed.\n\n\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"\n\nGiven that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"\n\nIf all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.\n\nOnce on board, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help their replacements settle in before undocking and returning to Earth around March 19."

            "full_content": "U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan delivered the Democratic response to President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night.\n\nIn remarks delivered from Wyandotte, Michigan (about 15 miles south of Detroit), Slotkin criticized Mr. Trump's economic plans.\n\n\"President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America,\" Slotkin said. \"And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life.\"\n\nSlotkin said she would keep her response short, delivering a 10-minute remark after Mr. Trump wrapped his speech, the longest of its kind in decades.\n\nWhat to know about Sen. Elissa Slotkin\n\nSlotkin, 48, was a former CIA officer who worked in national security roles in the Pentagon and both the Bush and Obama administrations and has touted her work across the aisle as a moderate Democrat. During her time as an officer, she served three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military.\n\nIn the Obama administration, Slotkin briefed the former president on some of the most sensitive national security issues before she was nominated to serve as the assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at the Pentagon, according to her bio on the Senate website.\n\nSlotkin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018 and was reelected in 2020 and 2022. She was mostly known for pledging on the campaign trail to bring her bipartisan approach to the upper chamber. Slotkin said her bipartisan approach comes mostly from living in a household where her father was a Republican and her mother was a Democrat.\n\n\"I believe in bipartisan legislation. It's always better when it's bipartisan,\" Slotkin told CBS News Detroit in a one-on-one interview in October 2024.\n\n\"The idea that I would just be so partisan that I couldn't have Thanksgiving dinner with my dad just doesn't work for me. National security, we're just not trained that way,\" she added.\n\nWithin months of longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow announcing that she would not seek reelection, Slotkin announced her bid shortly for the seat, becoming the first Democratic candidate to enter the race. In the August 2024 primary, Slotkin held a strong lead against actor Hill Harper before taking on Republican Mike Rogers in the general election.\n\nThe Slotkin-Rogers race became one of the most watched because Michigan had not elected a Republican in over three decades. Slotkin narrowly beat Rogers in November, resealing the Democratic control over the two U.S. Senate seats.\n\nShe received four committee assignments in the Senate: Armed Services, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Agriculture, and Veterans. She was one of four Democrats to win a U.S. Senate race in a state where Mr. Trump won.\n\nPrior to the 2024 election, Slotkin told CBS News Detroit that she was focused on the military and economic threat, particularly from China.\n\n\"I think it's a different type of threat, but because we depend on them, we have a globalized economy; but whether it's their military advantages that they have in some cases or it's the way they have just dominated our supply chains and have a veto on our economic security, to me, it's really important, on a bipartisan basis, for us to come up with thoughtful plans on how to make sure we're prepared militarily if we need it, but also that we take a real serious approach to China investing in things like our farmland, our manufacturing facilities,\" Slotkin said."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is addressing a joint session of Congress tonight. We spoke with voters in a key battleground state about how they\u2019re feeling about the opening weeks of the new administration. And Steve Kornacki breaks down the key groups Trump may need to assure with his speech, which starts at 9 p.m. ET. Follow along with coverage on our live blog.

Tammy Baldwin; and one is a swing voter who supported Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden before switching to Trump.\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n1. Jeff Scrima, the 47-year-old former mayor of Waukesha who now works in real estate, told NBC News he\u2019s \u201cfeeling very good\u201d because after years of watching politicians fall short on their promises, \u201cTrump is already doing what he said he\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country is in trouble if we don\u2019t change things, at least from a financial standpoint. We\u2019re going to go bankrupt. So I think that Trump and the administration understand the urgency, and they\u2019re taking the necessary steps to sort of right the ship,\u201d he said.\n\n2. Chip Schneider, 53, ultimately cast his ballot for Trump because he thought he had a clearer plan of action. Six weeks in, he told NBC News he feels \u201cgreat and cautious.\u201d He said that Trump is \u201cdelivering what he said,\u201d but warned he still has concerns, tariffs chief among them.\n\nWhile he added that he\u2019s \u201cwilling to suffer a little bit of pain to even out the score\u201d by punishing other countries with reciprocal tariffs, and that he thinks it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to judge\u201d whether Trump will be able to lower prices, \u201ca year is a fair amount of time to start seeing a bend in the curve.\u201d\n\nWhile Scrima loved the speed at which Trump is enacting his agenda, Schneider said he wants the president to \u201cslow down to really dig into it deeper.\u201d And while he\u2019s supportive of Trump\u2019s efforts to deport violent criminals in the country illegally, he wants to find a way to help \u201chard-working\u201d undocumented immigrants find a pathway to citizenship.\n\n3. Zack Lindsay, a 28-year-old who voted for Democrats in 2016 and 2020, showed slightly more skepticism. He praised Trump\u2019s recent executive order banning transgender athletes from participating in women\u2019s sports and said the world feels more stable under Trump than it would have been under Biden or Harris.\n\nBut he questioned the decision to slap tariffs on Canada. Lindsay said he thought that Trump\u2019s threats were mostly bluster aimed at securing a better deal for the U.S. and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really think he would go through with it.\u201d He also criticized the \u201cblow up in the Oval Office\u201d during Trump\u2019s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which he felt should have been handled behind closed doors.\n\nEven still, he shared Schneider\u2019s belief that it\u2019s too early to judge Trump on key issues, including on prices.\n\n\u201cThings don\u2019t necessarily change in a day. I\u2019d say a year to two years, and then I\u2019ll have a rough assessment of how I really think,\u201d he said, adding that his perception of Biden started to shift one year into his term.\n\nRead more: Polls show Americans are split on Trump ahead of his address to Congress, by Bridget Bowman and Ben Kamisar\n\nTrump's speech will provide an opportunity to reassure his coalition\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress tonight is an opportunity for the president to persuade the voters who elected him that they are getting the kind of change they demanded last November.\n\nTrump\u2019s winning coalition was strikingly blue-collar compared to previous Republican presidential campaigns \u2014 less affluent, more racially and ethnically diverse, and overwhelmingly made up of voters without four-year college degrees. Many of his backers were first-time voters, while others hadn\u2019t previously voted Republican. Overall, it was a coalition that prioritized strong leadership in a host of areas, with one towering above all others: the economy.\n\nHere the contrast between Trump\u2019s voters and Kamala Harris\u2019 voters was stark. On the basic question of the state of the economy, there was virtual unanimity among Trump supporters, according to exit polls: Ninety-five percent of them rated it as fair or poor, while a clear majority of Harris backers (59%) said it was in good or excellent shape.\n\nThese clashing assessments explained why each coalition\u2019s sense of priorities differed widely.\n\nFor that matter, 77% of Trump voters last November said that their own economic situation had worsened over the previous four years, while only 16% of Harris voters said the same. And 90% of Trump voters called inflation a hardship for the families, compared to 60% on the Harris side. In Trump, his voters saw a forceful leader and agent of change.\n\nThe first six weeks of Trump\u2019s second presidency have certainly been eventful. In his characteristically blunt style, the president has initiated action on multiple fronts. He has also, in characteristic fashion, drawn loud criticism and opposition.\n\nEspecially when it comes to the new voters Trump attracted last year, it\u2019s fair to wonder how they are perceiving all of this. Trump\u2019s challenge tonight is to reassure them that what they are witnessing isn\u2019t unfettered chaos but is instead the unavoidable noise that comes from necessary change.\n\nPOLL: How long will Trump\u2019s speech be?\n\nHistorically speaking, Trump has a penchant for delivering long joint addresses to Congress and State of the Union speeches. According to the University of California-Santa Barbara\u2019s American Presidency Project, the average of Trump\u2019s four speeches during his first term was about 80 minutes. That compares to 67 minutes for Joe Biden, 63 minutes for Barack Obama and 53 minutes for George W. Bush.\n\nBill Clinton was closest to Trump, averaging about 75 minutes during his presidency. But Clinton also holds the record for the longest joint address/State of the Union, going for nearly 89 minutes in 2000. Dating back to 1964, Richard Nixon gave the shortest speeches of this variety, with an average of roughly 35 minutes.\n\nSo, how long do you think Trump will speak for tonight? Vote in our poll:\n\nTrump follows through on tariffs threat, risking higher prices \u2014 and a trade war\n\nPresident Donald Trump has moved forward with a plan to put sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico, threatening a trade war with its closest trading partners \u2014 and higher prices for Americans on thousands of consumer goods, Shannon Pettypiece reports.\n\nThe U.S. was scheduled to begin collecting a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, according to a draft public notice of the rules posted Monday. Canadian energy products would be levied at a lower rate of 10%.\n\nOn Monday, Trump also added an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China on top of the 10% tariff he put on Chinese goods last month.\n\nSwift responses: As Jennifer Jett and Peter Guo report, China will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her country would enact countermeasures Sunday in response to the U.S. tariffs, adding that they would include both \u201ctariff and nontariff measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally, and we don\u2019t want to see you hurt either, but your government has chosen to do this to you,\u201d Trudeau said during a press conference Tuesday in remarks directed at the American people.\n\nThen, pivoting to speaking directly to Trump, Trudeau said: \u201cEven though you\u2019re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\u201d\n\nAn off-ramp? Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an appearance on Fox Business that an interim agreement with Canada and Mexico could come as soon as tomorrow that would allow their tariffs to be rolled back to some degree.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to figure out you do more, and I\u2019ll meet you in the middle some way, and we\u2019re going to probably be announcing that tomorrow,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cSo somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome the president moving with the Canadians and Mexicans, but not all the way.\u201d\n\nMore on the tariffs:\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Trump-Zelenskyy fallout: The Trump administration last night paused military aid to Ukraine after last week\u2019s Oval Office clash.

Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s long-awaited tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect Tuesday after he made clear that, unlike last month, there would be no last-minute reprieve. The 25 percent tax on imports from two of America\u2019s top trading partners has plunged the country into a trade war, and unchartered economic territory.\n\nAs Trum prepares to address the nation Tuesday night in his first joint address to Congress this term, it\u2019s unclear how long the tariffs will remain in effect. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled in an interview on Tuesday that the president is potentially close to a resolution that could be announced as soon as tomorrow.\n\n\u201cBoth the Mexicans and the Canadians were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they\u2019ll do better and the president is listening because you know he\u2019s very very fair and very reasonable,\u201d he said, in a sentiment that Trump\u2019s trading partners probably wouldn\u2019t agree with. \u201cSo I think he\u2019s gonna work something out with them.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average had already dropped by 650 points at the end of Monday, and markets continued to fall on Tuesday as the tariffs went into effect, wiping out all of Wall Street\u2019s post-election gains. The Dow ended up down 670 points by the end of the day.\n\nThe fallout from American allies was also swift.\n\nMexican president Claudia Sheinbaum denounced Trump\u2019s actions during a press conference, indicating that her government is prepared to retaliate. She said that she has a call with Trump scheduled for Thursday and will announce how exactly Mexico will respond during a public event on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason, rationale, or justification to support this decision that will affect our people and nations,\u201d she said per Reuters.\n\nCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said that his government has already levied retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. \u201cCanada will be implementing 25 percent tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods. Starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion of American products in 21 days\u2019 time,\u201d he said.\n\nIn strong remarks, Trudeau suggested that the tariffs were intended to harm Canada financially and that they stem from Trump\u2019s repeated aims to annex Canada and make it the 51st state:\n\nTrudeau: \"I heard he talked about banking again this morning in a tweet, which doesn't make any sense because 16 banks are currently active in Canada holding about $113b worth of assets in this country, so American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9Sexw914j1 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 4, 2025\n\nTrudeau also made a direct plea to the American people, framing Canada\u2019s move as an unavoidable consequence of their government\u2019s actions. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally. And we don\u2019t want to see you hurt either, but your government has chosen to do this to you,\u201d he said.\n\nTrudeau: I want to speak first directly to the American people\u2026 your government has chosen to do this to you. Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk. They have chosen to raise costs for American consumers on everyday essential items\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WQWpBVQxG4 \u2014 Acyn (@Acyn) March 4, 2025\n\nTrump called out Trudeau following his announcement, writing on social media, \u201cPlease explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\u201d\n\nRepublicans leaders appear mixed on Trump\u2019s tariffs. Senate majority leader John Thune signaled his hopes that the taxes will be quickly resolved. \u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019re a means to an end and not the end itself. I think they\u2019re hopefully temporary \u2014 designed to achieve a specific result,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, however, seemed willing to give the measure and the president the benefit of the doubt. \u201cThis is to continue good relationships and trade policies. I think this initiative will achieve that desired result,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAs the president said, just have a little patience with this. Let it play out, see how it develops, and I think at the end of the day America is going to be better off.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the new taxes on Canada and Mexico, Trump increased the current tariffs on China from 10 percent to 20 percent. This sparked a response from China, which levied tariffs of up to 15 percent on U.S. agricultural products including wheat, soybeans, and meat per the New York Times."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemocrats are rejecting House Republicans\u2019 plan to pass a stopgap spending bill through the end of September, raising the specter of a government shutdown in President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days and setting up a test of how far Democrats are willing to go to counter his administration.\n\nTop Democrats in the House and Senate are sharply opposed to Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s strategy for a six-month funding extension, insisting it would give even more leeway to Trump and Elon Musk to slash government programs. They also fear that agreeing to the GOP\u2019s lengthy extension could weaken some of the only leverage they have in a GOP-controlled Congress, and could potentially damage an argument in court cases challenging the White House\u2019s spending actions.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, called the GOP\u2019s plan for a one-year funding extension \u201ca non-starter\u201d and predicted Democrats would be \u201cunified in opposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in charge. And we\u2019ve tried to negotiate,\u201d DeLauro said, insisting it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s responsibility to fund the government since they control both chambers of Congress. \u201cElon Musk wants a shutdown. Why? Because then it\u2019s carte blanche \u2014 open parks, get rid of EPA, no research. It\u2019s carte blanche. He is for that.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders still believe that Democrats will ultimately fold in the face of a possible shutdown after the March 14 deadline and deliver the votes to help a funding bill reach Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nWith Republicans in control of Washington, Democrats are limited in what they can do, but Republicans will need their votes to pass a spending bill through Congress, creating an opportunity for the party locked out of power to make demands and potentially extract concessions.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have not yet communicated a plan to their members. Yet Democrats appear emboldened at a moment in which they have few other options to stand up to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink government, fire federal workers and shutter the work of agencies Congress already funded. And many Democrats argue that Republicans \u2013 not Democrats \u2013 would face public backlash for shutdown because they control the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks during a January 6 commemoration press conference on January 6, 2025, in Washington, DC. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThey run around telling everybody they have this great big mandate. Well, put on your mandate pants and pass what you want. If you want to work with us then they know what they have to do,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Juan Vargas said Democrats are in no mood to help bail out Republicans when they are focused on trying to fight against billionaire giveaways.\n\n\u201cThey want us to be part of that? Hell no. We\u2019d rather close down the government. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. Because they don\u2019t want to compromise,\u201d Vargas said.\n\nIf Democrats remain dug in, Johnson would need to deliver the votes for his so-called clean continuing resolution with Republican support alone. But with a small majority \u2014 and two Republicans, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Tony Gonzales of Texas, already opposed \u2013 Johnson may fall short of the votes he needs to execute on that plan, too.\n\nDemocrats say their preference is to force Johnson into a shorter-term spending bill that would allow appropriators to finish full-year spending bills and could give them more leverage to ensure Congress \u2013 not the administration \u2013 has power to dictate how federal funds are used.\n\n\u201cWe are in a position to enact an appropriations bill and we need a little more time so why wouldn\u2019t we buy ourselves a little more time. There actually is no need for this brinkmanship,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democratic appropriator from Hawaii, said.\n\nPrivately, House GOP leaders acknowledge it will be difficult to pass the plan without Democratic votes and are leaning hard on their conservatives \u2014 with help from the White House \u2014 to back it. Trump\u2019s budget director, Russ Vought, made the case behind the scenes to Freedom Caucus members on Monday night, arguing that the government needs to stay open for the work of DOGE to continue, according to a person in the room.\n\nThe next morning, Rep. Andy Harris, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told CNN that he would support it \u201cbecause the president wants it.\u201d And a group of House conservatives are planning to meet with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe GOP plan would essentially put government spending on autopilot for the next six months, alongside some small adjustments or \u201canomalies,\u201d such as funding for certain military projects. But Democratic leaders say they would reject that extension because it doesn\u2019t carry the usual legal constraints that come with bipartisan, negotiated packages \u2014 such as requiring the White House to abide by Congress\u2019s funding wishes, according to multiple people familiar with those high-level discussions.\n\nAnd if the White House chooses not to fund certain agencies or programs, Democrats insist they will have a weaker legal argument to challenge that in court.\n\nDemocratic leadership circulated a memo outlining the argument against a full-year stopgap over the weekend. The seven-page memo drafted by Sen. Patty Murray, which was obtained by CNN, labeled Trump\u2019s plan as a \u201cpower grab\u201d that would allow Trump and Russ Vought to turn off cash for blue states for \u201cwhatever vindictive or punitive reason they think up\u201d while giving them authority over \u201clarge slush funds\u201d for any new money.\n\n\u201cCongress should not pass a full-year CR that would cede immense discretion and authority to President Trump, Elon Musk, and Russ Vought to zero out programs and redirect funding as they see fit,\u201d the memo states.\n\nRepublicans, though, are making clear that they are not adding what they view as \u201cpoison pill\u201d language to attempt to win Democratic votes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to write a CR that\u2019s non-objectionable to every quarter as we can make it, whether you\u2019re in the Freedom Caucus or in the Democratic caucus. We\u2019re not trying to put 40 pills in, trying to hide anything. We\u2019re not trying to fool you. I don\u2019t want to give you an excuse to vote no,\u201d House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole told reporters, adding that it would include no new language on DOGE.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not putting any DOGE cuts in the CR,\u201d the Oklahoma Democrat said.\n\nNegotiators still have more than 10 days to find a path ahead but senior Democrats are warning that the full-year stopgap would not be acceptable even if it doesn\u2019t include cuts that would enshrine DOGE, as Johnson previously floated.\n\nDemocrats have been cautious in their messaging around the upcoming deadline, with top lawmakers stressing that Republicans are the ones in charge of Washington. But behind the scenes, many Democrats are insisting that they are not afraid of political ramifications and believe voters will blame Trump and the GOP for any fallout.\n\nThe memo is a key signal that Democrats are preparing their members to dig in on the fight, though it remains unclear whether a handful of Democratic senators would join Republicans to avert a shutdown.\n\nThere are other signs around the Capitol that a government funding clash is coming: Some House offices have made temporary changes to their payroll to ensure that staff can be paid in advance in case of a shutdown, and one group of congressional staffers saw a pre-planned trip canceled for the weekend of March 15.\n\nCNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi, Annie Grayer and Manu Raju contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Elizabeth Oyer\u2019s job as the U.S. pardon attorney is to run the process by which people apply for and receive clemency. A onetime federal public defender from Maryland, she is a nonpartisan advocate for second chances.\n\nThat\u2019s why two statements from her in the past month carried so much meaning.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nOne came after President Donald Trump appointed former federal inmate Alice Marie Johnson \u2014 who was once serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime \u2014 as his new \u201cpardon czar\u201d late last month. Oyer applauded the move.\n\n\u201cAlice is an inspiring and effective advocate, a wonderful and genuine person, and living proof that second chances make us safer and stronger,\u201d she wrote in a post on her LinkedIn page of Johnson, whose prison term Trump commuted in 2018 before pardoning her in 2020.\n\nBut just over a month ago, Oyer sent a much different communication. In an email to U.S. attorneys across the country, she conveyed deep frustration after then-President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 2,500 drug offenders, which he said was necessary in a justice system that disproportionately punishes Black and other minority offenders for nonviolent crimes.\n\n\u201cWhile I am a strong believer in the possibility of second chances through clemency, the process by which yesterday\u2019s action was carried out was not what we had hoped and advocated for,\u201d Oyer said in the Jan. 18 email, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cI understand that some of the clemency grants are very upsetting,\u201d the letter stated, according to the Journal.\n\nThe comments from Oyer, who was appointed by Biden in 2022, were some of the most notable in a series of criticisms from victims, prosecutors and even other Democrats about Biden\u2019s pardon process in his waning hours in office \u2014 with one U.S. senator going so far as to say the episode merited an overhaul of the federal pardon process.\n\n\u201cI am proposing that we actually impose some guardrails on the president of the United States, requiring an explanation, at the very least, some explanation for why pardon has been accorded, and some notice to the prosecutors,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told a Connecticut NBC station.\n\nDays after Biden\u2019s clemency announcement, President Donald Trump enacted his own politically motivated action. On the day he took office, Trump pardoned rioters involved in the attack on the U.S Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe ability to pardon someone is one of the few areas where the president\u2019s power is completely unchecked. There\u2019s no constitutional mandate for a president to go through a certain process, and they\u2019re free to pardon any person \u2014 no matter the crime or whether it could put a potentially dangerous person back on the street.\n\nThere have been plenty of calls to abolish the pardon power over the years, and presidents of both parties have used it to grant relief for friends, family members and donors.\n\nThe back-to-back presidential clemencies by Biden and Trump leaned on politics, drawing intensive scrutiny of the process and its potential for abuse.\n\nWhile Biden hailed his extensive clemency as \u201can important step toward righting historic wrongs\u201d and boasted that he had issued \u201cmore individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history,\u201d he only further inflamed some Justice Department officials, who were already angered over Biden\u2019s characterization of the agency as infected with \u201craw politics\u201d when he pardoned his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThey then saw Biden\u2019s mass clemency as both rushed and careless, according to two people with knowledge of the events.\n\nAs part of that move, only 10% of those granted clemency were Justice Department recommendations, according to one of the sources. Those who are recommended tend to already have been vetted to be sure that underlying violent conduct is not missed. There are some 6,100 people with active applications seeking shortened sentences or full pardons.\n\nAmong those who benefited from Biden\u2019s action \u2014 drawing outrage \u2014 was an inmate named Adrian Peeler who was convicted in the 1999 murder of an 8-year-old boy and his mother. Peeler, 48, had served his sentence for the murder but faced more prison time for dealing crack cocaine. He was not due to be released from a West Virginia prison until 2033.\n\nAnother was Lairon Graham, convicted of sex trafficking and trafficking fentanyl.\n\nAt the time of Graham\u2019s 2023 plea deal, Trini E. Ross, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, described Graham\u2019s crimes in stark terms.\n\n\u201cThis defendant not only sold dangerous and illegal drugs in our community, he used the addiction of vulnerable women to prey upon them and force them to commit sex acts for his financial benefit,\u201d Ross said in a statement. \u201cWe as a society cannot, and will not, tolerate this type of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s action means Graham\u2019s sentence was reduced from 22 years to 12\u00bd years.\n\nDanielle Sassoon, who resigned as the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York after the Trump administration pressured her to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, also sharply criticized Biden\u2019s commutations. In a Feb 2. op-ed in The Wall Street Journal (before her resignation), she said it was \u201cdisheartening to see some of the most dangerous offenders released on the readily disprovable misconception that they are nonviolent.\u201d\n\nThe frustration of many at the Justice Department was knowing that they have a backlog of thousands of requests for clemency \u2014 many of which officials saw as sympathetic \u2014 and watching Biden turned to his own agenda late in the game, according to one person familiar with the process, with Biden not making unfairly imposed lengthy prison terms a clemency priority until the 11th hour.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly rushed,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt was done with very little consultation with the pardon attorney\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nFurther frustrating Justice Department officials were the pardons handed out to members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, other members and aides of the House Jan. 6 committee, and Capitol and Washington Metropolitan police officers who testified before it. Biden timed the public announcement of those pardons for his last day in office \u2014 before one final strike: pre-emptive pardons for his family members, according to the person with knowledge of the process.\n\nA Biden spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAfter the Biden moves, Trump compounded frustrations in the Justice Department by pardoning all Jan. 6 Capitol rioters, even after his own vice president had said that those convicted of assault on police officers \u201cobviously\u201d shouldn\u2019t be pardoned. The department is now facing mounting challenges of another kind under Trump, including the demotion of prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 prosecutions who have been demoted to entry-level positions by Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia whom Trump appointed to lead the office on a permanent basis.\n\nJudges have made clear their displeasure at both the Trump and Biden pardons.\n\n\u201cNo \u2018process of national reconciliation\u2019 can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity,\u201d Judge Beryl Howell, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said in January.\n\nJudge Gary Brown, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, said that some of the Biden commutations \u201cspotlight the problems that invariably arise when a president\u2019s unreviewable pardon authority is deployed impetuously, resulting in careless execution of the president\u2019s directives. In this matter \u2014 involving sex trafficking, narcotics distribution and perjury \u2014 the grant of executive clemency seems inconsistent with its purported rational.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Johnson laid out what some of her newly created position entails, including looking for appropriate candidates for clemency. She stressed she would follow-up with those released from prison to be sure they receive appropriate support.\n\nZ\u00f6e Towns, executive director of FWD.us, an organization that advocates for criminal justice reform, said she applauds the moves made by the Biden administration, but in general, clemency should be a daily part of governing \u2014 not a last-minute action.\n\n\u201cThis should not be something we wait until the last gasps of any gubernatorial or presidential administration,\u201d Towns said. \u201cPeople should have a lot of chances to have their sentences re-examined, whether that\u2019s through parole boards that are meeting or judges that are doing second look sentencing reviews, and also clemency.\u201d\n\nTowns added support to Johnson becoming pardon czar, calling it \u201cextremely encouraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that somebody with her experience is in the role, and it\u2019s also really great that it\u2019s a role that has been created this early in a presidential term, and we\u2019re hopeful that it can mean really good things to come,\u201d Towns said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s case first came to Trump\u2019s attention after reality TV star Kim Kardashian championed her as a candidate for clemency based on Johnson\u2019s exorbitant non-violent drug sentence.\n\nJohnson was in federal prison for more than 21 years after she was convicted in connection to a drug trafficking conspiracy. In 2018, she told MSNBC she did not dispute her conviction, only the length of her sentence.\n\n\u201cI believe that I deserved some time, I really do. But I also believe that that time should be just and fair based on the crime. You can\u2019t tell me that a non-violent, first-time offender should have been given a life without parole sentence,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cDo you really think I deserved the same prison time as the Unabomber? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tapping of Johnson has drawn scorn from critics who accuse him of putting on a kind public face, even as he says drug dealers deserve the death penalty \u2014 something he repeated one day after he announced Johnson\u2019s appointment.\n\nLast month, at a Black History Month reception in the East Room of the White House, Trump praised Johnson and said he was empowering her to take a hands-on role.\n\n\u201cAlice, you\u2019ve been an inspiration to people, and we\u2019re going to be listening to your recommendation on pardons,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find people just like you \u2026 It should not have happened. So you\u2019re going to look and you\u2019re going to make recommendations, and I\u2019ll follow those recommendations, OK?\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix\n\nMeghan Markle dropped a new Netflix lifestyle show on Tuesday. The eight-episode series is primarily about the Duchess of Sussex claiming she\u2019s a relatable working mom while carefully slicing raspberries in half and arranging a rainbow-shaped fruit plate for her children. But there\u2019s a surprising secondary theme: dizzying name changes.\n\nThe drama started on February 18, when Meghan announced she was changing the name of her yet-to-be-launched business venture from American Riviera Orchard to As Ever. Although the Duchess wrote on Instagram, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to introduce you to As Ever,\u201d it appears she then tweaked the name again: The brand name is styled As ever (lowercase e) on the new website, which features a variety of fruit preserves, teas, and \u201cflower sprinkles\u201d that you can\u2019t actually purchase yet.\n\nNow Meghan has revealed that she, too, has a new(ish) moniker: the last name Sussex. This information is unveiled in a passive-aggressive exchange with Mindy Kaling during episode two of With Love, Meghan (just to add to the confusion, the Netflix show about the As Ever founder is named after a different sign-off phrase.)\n\nAs Meghan is explaining that she grew up as an average American \u201clatchkey\u201d kid who ate a lot of fast food, she informs Kaling that she\u2019s addressing her incorrectly.\n\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t think anyone in the world knows that Meghan Markle has eaten Jack in the Box and loves it,\u201d Kaling quips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny, too, that you keep saying \u2018Meghan Markle.\u2019 You know I\u2019m Sussex now,\u201d the Duchess replies in a tone that suggests she\u2019s not actually amused.\n\nThere\u2019s an awkward pause, then Meghan continues: \u201cYou have kids, and you go, \u2018Now I share my name with my children.\u2019 And that feels so \u2014 I didn\u2019t know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go, \u2018This is our family name, our little family name.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now I know, and I love it,\u201d Kaling says.\n\nOh yes , you are meghan MARKLE!!! Sussex is a county about which you have no idea!! Shameless creature!!! \ud83e\udd75pic.twitter.com/IHRKyOoH8Z \u2014 Suzie (@wuikle) March 4, 2025\n\nMeghan also talked about her fondness for Sussex in this week\u2019s People cover story:\n\nMeghan says the Sussex name \u2014 bestowed upon her and Harry by Queen Elizabeth on their 2018 wedding day \u2014 holds a deeper significance than she could have imagined before motherhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our shared name as a family, and I guess I hadn\u2019t recognized how meaningful that would be to me until we had children,\u201d she says. \u201cI love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H and I all have together. It means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nThe Sussex name, she adds, \u201cis part of our love story.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Duchess would rather not be referred to by her maiden name. (Catherine, the Princess of Wales, has been trying to get people to stop calling her Kate Middleton since 2011, to no avail.) But the fact that she is Meghan Sussex is, in fact, not well known.\n\nThere\u2019s generally a lot of confusion about royal surnames. The British royal family\u2019s official website has a whole page explaining how they\u2019ve changed over the past century. \u201cMembers of the Royal Family can be known both by the name of the Royal house, and by a surname, which are not always the same,\u201d it says. \u201cAnd often they do not use a surname at all.\u201d\n\nKing Charles\u2019s five grandchildren have always used different surnames. Prince William\u2019s three children go by Wales, the same surname he and Prince Harry used at school and in the military. But Harry and Meghan\u2019s children were originally Mountbatten-Windsor, and at some point, the whole family adopted Sussex as a surname, as People reported last month:\n\nWhile their 4-year-old son, Prince Archie, and 2-year-old daughter, Princess Lilibet, were previously known as \u201cMaster Archie Mountbatten-Windsor\u201d and \u201cMiss Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor,\u201d the children were afforded the titles of prince and princess when their grandfather King Charles became monarch in Sept. 2022.\n\nMeghan, 42, and Prince Harry, 39, used their children\u2019s royal titles for the first time in March 2023 when they announced Lili\u2019s christening, and their names have been updated to \u201cPrince Archie of Sussex\u201d and \u201cPrincess Lilibet of Sussex\u201d on the royal family\u2019s official website.\n\nPEOPLE understands that Sussex is their family surname.\n\nIf you can\u2019t keep all of this straight, don\u2019t feel bad; Meghan Sussex may be a bit confused too. The closing credits of With Love, Meghan list the royal as \u201cMeghan, Duchess of Sussex\u201d rather than \u201cMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex.\u201d Dropping \u201cthe\u201d is incorrect, according to GB News: \u201cTraditionally, the royal style difference is used by divorced members of the Royal Family after they lose the title.\u201d"

Habba defended the cuts and said she had no sympathy for the thousands of people who have lost their jobs.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t feel sorry for them,\u201d Habba said. \u201cThey should get back to work for the American people, like President Trump and this administration.\u201d\n\nA reporter then noted that some military veterans have been part of that group.\n\n\"That\u2019s something the president has always cared about \u2014 anybody in blue, anybody that serves this country. But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer dollars to pay people that actually work,\" she said.\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t mean that we forget our veterans by any means,\" she added. \"We are going to care for them in the right way, but perhaps they\u2019re not fit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work. And we can\u2019t, you know, I wouldn\u2019t take money from you and pay somebody and say, 'Sorry, you know, they\u2019re not going to come to work.' It\u2019s just not acceptable.\"\n\nHabba, who previously served as Trump's personal lawyer, said the president planned to highlight the cuts, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, in his speech Tuesday night.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs and VA Secretary Doug Collins didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWe\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers who have been laid off. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.\n\nHabba's remarks drew swift backlash from some veterans.\n\nEmily Erroa, an Army veteran who was fired from the Department of Energy last month alongside other employees who did not yet have full civil service protections, called Habba\u2019s statement \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\"The narrative that remote/teleworkers do not work is not accurate and insulting,\" Erroa, who had recently taken a job at the Energy Department after spending three years at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said. \"Especially when it comes to veterans that have [a] specific diagnosis due to fighting and serving the country.\"\n\nJesus Tony Ruiz, an Army veteran who was laid off from the VA last month, also criticized Habba's remarks.\n\n\"I lost my job in the VA thanks to Donald Trump,\" said Ruiz, who was invited to speak to lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday by the progressive group VoteVets. \"So what did I do for my country? I served my country, and now they fired me. So no, they\u2019re not helping me out whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAnother veteran, who requested anonymity because they still work in the federal government, called her remarks a \"slap in the face to those who have served, sacrificed and ... carry the scars both mental and physical from their service.\"\n\n\"Coming to work? It\u2019s not always as simple as showing up. Some days, I can\u2019t even stand up, and the pain is excruciating,\" this person said, adding, \"Does that make me unemployable in his [Trump's] eyes? Apparently so.\"\n\nAlina Habba, counselor to the president, questioned whether veterans who were fired from their federal jobs were \"fit\" to work. Jim Watson / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nThe Trump administration has fired thousands of federal workers over the last several weeks as part of the Elon Musk and DOGE-driven effort to find waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government and drastically cut federal funding across departments and agencies. The largest cuts were of probationary employees \u2014 people who were generally in their roles for less than two years, although some had much more experience in the federal government.\n\nThe heads of the White House budget and personnel offices informed federal agencies last week that they should start preparing for large-scale layoffs in the coming weeks and months.\n\nFormer workers, as well as a number of groups representing federal employees, have filed several lawsuits over the layoffs. A federal judge last week said that a memo from the Office of Personnel Management directing agencies to plan for mass layoffs was \"illegal.\" The ruling did not reinstate the fired employees, though.\n\nMilitary veterans work across the federal government and many work for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In February, the VA fired more than 2,400 employees, though it's unclear how many served in the military. On Monday, the VA terminated 585 \"non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts.\"\n\nA Navy veteran who works at the VA called Habba's comments \"insulting and demeaning.\"\n\n\u201cI work with approximately 50% veteran co-workers,\" the person said, adding, \"Without exception, I can tell you that, at least from my experience, veterans work exceptionally hard, presumably owing to the discipline and culture of the military.\""

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune expressed wariness Tuesday over some of President Donald Trump\u2019s recent policies, including new tariffs from the administration that threaten to raise the prices Americans pay for a wide array of goods.\n\nThune, who represents South Dakota \u2013 a state that relies heavily on trade with Canada, said while he thinks the president is attempting to secure \u201can outcome that addresses a concern that the American people have\u201d with his recently imposed tariffs on the country along with Mexico and China, the economic impacts are an issue.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an issue in my view. I mean, I think you have to think about the economic impacts through inflation,\u201d Thune told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash when pressed on whether the tariffs, and potential cost to every day Americans, are good policy.\n\n\u201cI think you have to look at growth in the economy and how that\u2019s impacted by all this. Those are, those are real issues. And so the administration is going to have to take, in my view, as they, as they evaluate some of these policy decisions the macro-economic impacts of these,\u201d he continued on \u201cInside Politics.\u201d\n\nThe comments from the top Senate Republican come ahead of the president\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term. Trump will deliver his \u201cThe Renewal of the American Dream\u201d-themed remarks just hours after the 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada took effect, causing a volatile morning on the markets and raising alarm among some red-state senators about the impact.\n\nBut the Republican leader did not go so far as to write off Trump\u2019s move entirely, saying, \u201cI think this is a president who has used that authority in ways that have gotten outcomes and results,\u201d and adding that he thinks \u201cthe markets, in time, will stabilize.\u201d\n\nStresses need for US leadership on world stage\n\nIn the wake of the administration\u2019s pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine following Trump\u2019s heated Oval Office argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, Thune cautioned against American isolationism and stressed the need for continued US leadership on the world stage.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want America to become isolationist,\u201d Thune told Bash. \u201cNow again, what form America\u2019s involvement and support takes is a matter of debate. And, you know, we can talk about whether soft power, hard power, what components that ultimately entails. But I think in the end, people look to us to be a leader, and we have to provide that leadership.\u201d\n\nCalling last week\u2019s heated Oval Office meeting \u201cunfortunate,\u201d Thune suggested the pause was \u201cdesigned to get the players to the table.\u201d\n\nThe Republican leader, who has historically supported Ukraine in its war against Russia, said the pause was the president\u2019s attempt to get European nations more engaged in providing security for the country, while acknowledging America\u2019s global leadership role.\n\n\u201cI think we have very extensively invested heavily in Ukraine. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s probably the political support for continued financial investment there, but if the European nations can step up and with American support in terms of training and intelligence sharing and all the things that we can provide and offer, we still have to be the deterrent to bad behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nWarns federal workers must be treated as \u2018real people\u2019\n\nDuring his remarks, the president is expected to point to Elon Musk\u2019s reshaping of the federal government as evidence of the administration\u2019s change in Washington.\n\nMusk, who has spearheaded the Trump administration\u2019s swift reduction of the federal workforce through his Department of Government Efficiency, is expected to be in the House chamber for the president\u2019s speech, a White House official told CNN.\n\nAsked about the appearance and how the world\u2019s richest man is \u201cgoing about business,\u201d Thune said: \u201cI think that he\u2019s kind of going about business as you would in a private business. And obviously there are nuances in dealing with the federal government that are probably different than what he\u2019s accustomed to in the private world.\u201d\n\nThune said he thought Musk was addressing some Americans\u2019 concern that the federal government is a \u201cbloated bureaucracy\u201d but, he told Bash, \u201chow they go about it matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are, any time you do this, it\u2019s, you know, you also have to pay attention to the aftermath of that and how it impacts people. I mean, these are real people. They need to be treated that way,\u201d he said of the impacted federal workers.\n\nThune said \u201cthe overall goals and objectives are the right ones. And I think he brings an eye to this that probably, you know, we you couldn\u2019t have gotten just by having, sort of the Congress or somebody else do it,\u201d but argued that \u201cprobably better-attuned\u201d Cabinet officials and agency heads will be in place to make decisions.\n\nCNN\u2019s Melissa DePalo contributed to this report."

Oh, that seems fair to me, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Tuesday morning.\n\nCNN and others debunked Trump\u2019s claim a month ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing prohibiting American banks from operating here, including having retail branches,\u201d Cristie Ford, a professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s law school, said in an email in February.\n\nCanada tightly regulates the banking industry, and it requires various government approvals before a foreign-owned bank can open in the country. But US banks have been operating in Canada for well over a century; the Canadian Bankers Association, an industry group, said in a February statement that \u201cthere are 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches with around C$113 billion in assets currently operating in Canada\u201d and that \u201cU.S. banks now make up approximately half of all foreign bank assets in Canada.\u201d\n\nTyler Meredith, former head of economic and fiscal policy for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, noted on social media in February that Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, US Bank, JPMorgan, and Northern Trust are among the US banks with current Canadian operations. You can see the others here and here.\n\nMeredith said in an interview that \u201cwe take a very careful look at people who want to come into our banking sector, because we consider financial services to be a core asset to Canada and to the Canadian economy\u201d and try hard to avoid the \u201ccascading consequences\u201d the world has seen with bank failures in the US \u2013 \u201cbut there are existing American institutions, Chinese institutions, Japanese institutions, and European institutions\u201d that have permission to operate in Canada.\n\nUS banks can apply to launch a subsidiary in Canada, which is known as a \u201cSchedule II\u201d entity, or a \u201cbranch\u201d in Canada (not to be confused with a retail branch), which is known as a \u201cSchedule III\u201d entity.\n\nWhen a non-Canadian bank establishes a Canadian subsidiary, \u201cthat subsidiary will be subject to the same regulatory regime and capital requirements as a domestically owned and operated bank,\u201d said Bryce Tingle, a professor at the University of Calgary\u2019s law school, in a February email. \u201cIt will have exactly the same powers and market access as a Canadian bank.\u201d\n\nJeremy Kronick, director of the Centre on Financial and Monetary Policy at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Toronto, explained in a February email that there are downsides to the subsidiary option from the perspective of foreign banks: A subsidiary is \u201ca separate legal entity from their parent, thus requiring their own local capital and liquidity structures.\n\nFrom the foreign bank\u2019s perspective, this is obviously inefficient.\u201d\n\nMost US banks operating in Canada have chosen the \u201cbranch\u201d option that does not subject them to the requirements of a subsidiary. However, there is a different restriction on branches: They are not allowed to accept deposits lower than $150,000 CAD.\n\nThat, of course, means they can\u2019t conduct retail operations for average Canadian citizens \u2013 but they can engage in various profitable activities, for companies and wealthy individuals, that are less visible to the general public. The Canadian Bankers Association said the US banks in Canada \u201cspecialize in a range of financial services, including corporate and commercial lending, treasury services, credit card products, investment banking and mortgage financing.\u201d\n\nKronick said: \u201cBottom line: there are trade-offs to each option, but foreign banks certainly can operate in Canada. A case could probably be made that the restrictions on both options prevent full competition with Canadian banks, but not that \u2018Canada doesn\u2019t even allow US Banks to open or do business there\u2019 as Trump stated.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Charles Krupa/AP Photo\n\nLast month, the NHL\u2019s 4 Nations Face-Off tournament lent hockey the kind of jolt the sport has spent years searching for. The inaugural event\u2019s finals, which pitted the U.S. against Canada, garnered incredible ratings, with 10.4 million viewers tuning into ESPN at one point. That made it the highest-rated hockey game ever on ESPN and the biggest non-NFL event ever on ESPN+. I had multiple friends tell me it was the first hockey game they\u2019d watched in years.\n\nThis was the sort of cultural event that could only explode to such an extent because of outside forces, a narrative that was larger than the game itself. Those outside forces are not in short supply. The game took place amid the madness currently unfolding in the United States \u2014 specifically, President Trump\u2019s deranged rants about making Canada the U.S.\u2019s 51st state. Trump\u2019s comments are the sort of dead-brained slop that Americans have (foolishly or not) mostly stopped taking seriously, but which Canadians (quite understandably) have met with unmitigated fury and righteous national pride. That Trump called the U.S. hockey team before the game added fuel to the fire, but it also confirmed the driving story line of the game: Unlike at the Miracle on Ice 45 years ago, we were the bad guys this time. Canada was David; we were Goliath.\n\nDavid, a.k.a. the Canadians, triumphed. And while most American sports fans have since shifted their attention over to spring training and NFL free agency, Canadian fans are far from done using sports as a venue to express outrage at the U.S. Essentially every time the American national anthem plays at a Canadian venue, vigorous booing now follows. It happened in Montreal during the first 4 Nations matchup between the U.S. and Canada and at an MLS event in Vancouver over the weekend, and it happens at every Raptors game. During a Netflix WWE event in Toronto on Sunday night, it got so loud you could barely hear the song.\n\nCanadians loudly boo during the U.S. National Anthem at WWE in Toronto tonight to show their opposition to Donald Trump and his administration pic.twitter.com/QYUDku65cW \u2014 MeidasTouch (@MeidasTouch) March 2, 2025\n\nNow, soccer and hockey are one thing, but when the anthem gets booed at a rasslin\u2019 event, you can count on America\u2019s dumbest meatheads to get involved: \u201cKinda sucks that it\u2019s in the terrible country of Canada that booed our national anthem to start this entire thing!\u201d said ESPN\u2019s $85 million goon Pat McAfee. Unfortunately for him, the booing is unlikely to stop anytime soon. It will likely become a regular occurrence at Toronto Blue Jays games beginning in April, and it may well become the signature story line of the upcoming Stanley Cup playoffs. It turns out that when a powerful madman challenges his neighbor and oldest ally\u2019s sovereignty, that neighbor gets a little pissy about it.\n\nAnd in the wake of the horrifying disaster in the Oval Office last week, in which Trump and Vice-President J.D. Vance berated Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and made it clear (if it wasn\u2019t already) that America will be standing with Russia against Ukraine and no-longer-under-any-illusions European allies, I feel confident in saying that this is just the start.\n\nIf you were watching the 4 Nations Face-Off, you might have noticed the absence of one rather prominent hockey country. There are currently 66 Russian players in the NHL \u2014 more than Finland, for what it\u2019s worth \u2014 but they weren\u2019t a part of the event for the same reason Russia hasn\u2019t been a part of the last few Olympics: Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. (There were only 15 Russian Olympians in Paris, all listed as \u201cindividual neutral athletes.\u201d) The IOC is not totally on an island with this. While Russian and Belarusian athletes have been allowed to participate in international tennis tournaments since 2022 (except for one Wimbledon), they are forbidden from playing for their countries and officially compete under the banner of no nation.\n\nSo, uh, here\u2019s the thing: If the United States is supporting Russia against Ukraine \u2014 which it sure feels like it unequivocally is \u2014 and the United States is aggressively antagonizing its traditional allies both here in North America and in Europe, well \u2026 is it our turn?\n\nIt may not be an academic question. Just last month, the Trump administration began a pressure campaign aimed at forcing the IOC to stop allowing transgender athletes to compete at international competitions, which it has permitted since 2004. That is a battle, as anyone who watched the Paris Olympics and the nonsensical right-wing backlash to it knows, that is unlikely to fizzle out anytime soon. We are only two months into the new administration and, more to the point, we are now less than a year from the Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy. Do you think the United States is going to get more in the international community\u2019s good graces between now and then? After all, the IOC and ITF \u2014 and, really, any international athletic ruling body \u2014 is made up primarily of transatlantic allies; there aren\u2019t many people in charge of these sports from countries who didn\u2019t vote for the United Nations\u2019 resolution supporting Ukraine sovereignty last week. It\u2019s basically nations that are already banned from these organizations \u2014 and, now, us.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely anyone\u2019s going to be blacking out the American flag anytime soon; we are still (for now) the most powerful country in the world and remain the linchpin \u2014 and often founder of \u2014 key international organizations. Trump has also not (yet) invaded another country, and even if he did, nobody was banning the U.S. post\u2013Iraq War. But America\u2019s increasingly close association with a pariah country, combined with our relentless turn against historical allies, does come with an undeniable cost. It\u2019s not just boos and sour looks from locals when we\u2019re on vacation in Europe, either.\n\nTrump and his \u201cAmerica first\u201d crew won\u2019t care about sports-bureaucrat scolding. But over the next three years, the two largest sporting events on earth are coming to the United States: the World Cup next year, and the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. While it might seem extreme to imagine the United States so isolated from the rest of the world that countries might consider not sending their athletes or teams to those events, well, think about how far the United States has fallen in the world\u2019s estimation in just the first two months of Trump 2.0. Now imagine it a year from now, or a year and a half from now. If Russia were scheduled to host an Olympics right now \u2014 as it last did in 2014 in Sochi, which I attended, and which happened during Putin\u2019s invasion of Crimea \u2014 do you think countries would actually go? Now think about where we\u2019ll be this time next year, or 2026. Do you think Trump & Co. are going to work to rejoin the international community over the next 24 months? Or will they do the opposite? Even if boycotts aren\u2019t on the table, it\u2019s easy to imagine the World Cup and Olympics becoming political bargaining chips in all kinds of unseemly ways (a country could threaten to skip them unless Trump revokes tariffs, for instance). It\u2019s also not hard to imagine the U.S. welcoming Russia back onto the global sports stage, as surreal as that would be. And forget about the mega-events: Anytime an American sports team travels abroad the next three years, they will likely be cast as villains.\n\nThis is the thing about isolating ourselves, about recklessly tearing down international alliances that have existed for more than 100 years: The rest of the world is, in fact, watching. Eventually, we will have to cross paths with them, whether you want to or not. The United States is turning away from the world. The world, however begrudgingly, is starting to do the same to the United States. Are we ready to be the bad guys? Like, really the bad guys? One thing is for certain: Pat McAfee better start getting used to boos."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA majority of the Supreme Court appeared prepared Tuesday to shut down a lawsuit from the Mexican government alleging American gun manufacturers should be held responsible for cartel violence on the Southwest border.\n\nThe justices debated the high-profile case in their quiet, ornate courtroom as relations between Washington and Mexico City were fraying in real time. President Donald Trump allowed a 25% tariff on Mexican goods to take effect and the president of Mexico vowed to impose retaliatory duties within days.\n\nMexico sued Smith & Wesson and six other major US gun makers in 2021 for $10 billion in damages, alleging that the companies design and market their guns specifically to drug cartels that then use them in the \u201ckilling and maiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and ordinary citizens throughout Mexico.\u201d\n\nBut the Supreme Court \u2013 both conservatives and at least some of the liberal justices \u2013 peppered the lawyer for Mexico with questions indicating they were concerned with the prospects of allowing the lawsuit to go forward. And the broader diplomatic context was clearly on the mind of several members of the court.\n\n\u201cMexico says that US gun manufacturers are contributing to illegal conduct in Mexico,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, said at one point. \u201cThere are Americans who think that Mexican government officials are contributing to a lot of illegal conduct here.\u201d\n\nSuppose, Alito pondered, a US state decided to sue Mexico for what it viewed as aiding and abetting crime in the United States. Would Mexico, he asked, \u201cbe willing to litigate that case in the courts of the United States?\u201d\n\nPart of Mexico\u2019s argument is that American gunmakers are manufacturing and marketing guns that appeal to cartels and that they\u2019re selling them to distributors that are known to deal with organized crime.\n\nBut Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether Mexico had cleared the legal bar it needs to by pointing to products like the Super \u201cEl Jefe\u201d pistol.\n\n\u201cThose are all things that are not illegal in any way,\u201d said Roberts, a conservative. \u201cThere some people who want the experience of shooting a particular type of gun because they find it more enjoyable than using a bb gun.\u201d\n\nNot a Second Amendment fight\n\nThe case does not center on the Second Amendment, but gun-control and gun rights groups are nevertheless closely engaged in the fight.\n\n\u201cThe gun industry defendants are trying to use this case to rewrite the law and dramatically expand their immunity to include actions that break the law,\u201d David Pucino, legal director with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence told CNN. \u201cThe Supreme Court should reject that dangerous invitation to shut the courthouse door on victims of gun violence.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican government argues that between 70% and 90% of guns recovered at crime scenes in its country are made in the United States. There is only one gun store in all of Mexico, its lawyers said, and \u201cyet the nation is awash in guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is facing a choice: Hold the American gun industry accountable for fueling organized crime at the southern border or give American manufacturers near total immunity,\u201d Hudson Munoz, executive director of Guns Down America, told CNN.\n\nBut even some of the Supreme Court\u2019s liberals, who have tended to side with gun control groups in the past, said they were concerned about Mexico\u2019s position.\n\nWhat Mexico is asking for, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said, appeared to \u201camount to different kinds of regulatory constraints that I\u2019m thinking Congress didn\u2019t want the courts to be the ones to impose.\u201d\n\nNRA slams Mexico\u2019s suit\n\nGun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, say that the lawsuit is an effort to \u201cdestroy\u201d the American firearms industry by making it easier to sue for huge sums, despite a 2005 law meant to protect gun makers from an increasing number of lawsuits filed by Democratic governors and mayors nationwide.\n\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act generally shields gunmakers from liability for crimes committed with their products. An exception permits those suits when there\u2019s a close connection between the harm \u2013 in this case, the use of guns in Mexico \u2013 and the companies\u2019 actions.\n\n\u201cMexico has extinguished its constitutional arms right,\u201d the NRA told the Supreme Court in a brief. \u201cNow (it) seeks to extinguish America\u2019s.\u201d\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, picked up on that position during the arguments, questioning what would stop all sorts of lawsuits against companies that make products that wind up being used illegally.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a real concern, I think, for me about accepting your theory,\u201d he told the lawyer for Mexico.\n\nMexico also argues the gunmakers have resisted design changes to their products \u2013 such as making serial numbers harder to tamper with \u2013 that would make the guns less appealing to gangs because the weapons could more easily be traced.\n\nThe manufacturers, Mexico said in court documents, advertise the guns as \u201cmilitary-grade\u201d and design special-edition products like the Super \u201cEl Jefe\u201d pistol the country says are targeted for sale to gangs.\n\nA federal district court backed the gun makers, but the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals concluded Mexico\u2019s suit could go forward. The gun companies appealed to the Supreme Court in April.\n\nGuns, cartels and social media\n\nSome of the argument Tuesday focused on a decision it handed down just two years ago in a case dealing with the social media company now known as X.\n\nIn Twitter v. Taamneh, the family of a victim killed in a 2017 terrorist attack in Turkey tried to sue the social media giant for contributing to the attack because it hosted content helping ISIS recruit followers and raise money. In a unanimous decision, the court said the connection between the content at issue and the attack wasn\u2019t closely related enough to allow the family to sue.\n\nIt\u2019s a point the gun manufacturers are quick to highlight in their written arguments. The short version, according to the companies, is that they have no control over what people do with the guns they make.\n\n\u201cThis court has repeatedly held that it requires a direct connection between a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury,\u201d the gun manufacturers told the high court in their appeal. \u201cIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy.\u201d\n\nBut the appeals court ruling in favor of Mexico, which was also unanimous, said that the gunmakers\u2019 conduct may have been something more than what was alleged against X. All three appeals court judges who reviewed Mexico\u2019s case were appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\n\u201cThey are not mere passive observers of the buyer\u2019s illegal activity,\u201d the three-judge panel wrote, \u201cbut more akin to a calculated and willing participant in the supply chain that ends with a profitable illegal firearm market in Mexico.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated following oral arguments."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night will act as an extension \u2013 and explanation \u2013 of the rapid change he\u2019s unleashed in just 44 days of his new term.\n\nHe will face his biggest audience yet as he pushes for congressional Republicans, who have narrow majorities, to turn his agenda into law \u2013 the outcome of which will go a long way toward shaping the success of his presidency.\n\nRepublicans have largely rallied around the president, but there have been early cracks in party unity over some of the administration\u2019s actions to cut government services and Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric toward Ukraine. Late Monday, Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, which is already raising concern in some corners of the GOP even as many Republicans have praised Trump for last week\u2019s Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech is also coming on the same day as 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada went into effect, causing a volatile morning on the markets amid fears of a global trade war and raising alarm among some red-state senators about the impact on their states.\n\nTrump is mindful of the skepticism and criticism he is facing from many Republican lawmakers over the emerging trade war, with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other top advisers fielding calls \u201call day long,\u201d one senior administration official told CNN.\n\nThe president is unfazed by the criticism, aides say. But to deflect from the furious critiques over tariffs, Trump plans to shine a light in his speech on a series of executive orders he has signed on cultural issues that are widely popular with the Trump base.\n\n\u201cWatch,\u201d the senior administration official told CNN, \u201cour Republicans will be clapping all night long.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced Monday evening that \u201cThe Renewal of the American Dream\u201d is the theme of the speech.\n\n\u201cTomorrow night will be big,\u201d Trump wrote Monday on social media. \u201cI will tell it like it is.\u201d\n\nHere is what to watch during Trump\u2019s first address to Congress of his new administration:\n\nHe\u2019ll try to deliver on his campaign pledges \u2013 but will there be specifics?\n\nAfter becoming the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote, Trump now faces pressure to deliver on campaign promises, like lowering prices.\n\nHis party has full control of Congress, but given how fast political winds can shift in Washington, Trump\u2019s advisers have made speed their priority in pushing his agenda \u2013 targeting the two-year window before the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nTrump himself has taken a lesson from his first term \u2013 he\u2019s not waiting for the perfect moment to execute on his promises. Instead, he signs executive orders almost every day, sometimes deciding only in the minutes beforehand which to sign.\n\nOne Trump adviser said a goal of the president\u2019s speech would be connecting his flurry of early moves to the lives of average Americans. Trump will likely address his plan to lower prices, although the specific contours of his speech were still coming together Monday.\n\nExplaining whiplash-inducing changes\n\nSince taking office a second time, Trump has overseen a dramatic reshaping of the federal government, much of it at the hand of the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest man, who has emerged as one of the most visible and influential advisers to Trump, will be in the House chamber for the speech, a White House official told CNN, and will be held up as a leading example of the administration\u2019s swift action to change Washington.\n\nEntire agencies \u2013 which in a previous age would be sending their priorities to the White House for inclusion in the speech \u2013 have been gutted in the new Trump era. Tens of thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs.\n\nNot all Republicans are fully on board. Some lawmakers been bombarded with constituent phone calls and voters at town halls who are angry at the dramatic cuts to the federal government.\n\nRallying GOP Congress behind his agenda\n\nThe president\u2019s address comes amid disagreement among House and Senate Republicans over how to enact a budget that aims to reduce spending, protect Social Security and make permanent the signature tax cuts from Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nHe is poised to rally Republicans behind his agenda, advisers said, without offering specific guidance for how to achieve it.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who will sit behind Trump\u2019s left shoulder, has proven more than willing to accommodate the president\u2019s whims.\n\n\u201cThere is no daylight between the House Republicans and Senate Republicans,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cWe all have exactly the same idea and mission and that is to deliver the America First agenda.\u201d\n\nHow much will he speak to foreign affairs?\n\nTrump\u2019s speech will be heavily focused on his domestic agenda, an official told CNN, with Trump previewing his core policy proposals for the next four years.\n\nStill, one of the main areas of interest is how the president uses the global stage to address the wars abroad, specifically between Russia and Ukraine \u2013 and how hard a line he takes against Ukraine after pausing aid.\n\nTrump has discarded decades of American foreign policy orthodoxy, forging ahead in pursuit of new deals with countries like Russia \u2013 while other allies like Ukraine are left as collateral damage. Foreign ambassadors who customarily attend the address have been scrambling to explain the changes to their capitals.\n\nIt was only a year ago that Biden administration officials tried to get Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine\u2019s president, to Washington as a guest at the 2024 State of the Union speech (she couldn\u2019t make it, citing scheduling conflicts). Trump\u2019s address comes four days after Trump castigated her husband in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump said a day ahead of the speech that he would address the Ukraine situation.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you know. We\u2019re making a speech, you probably heard about it, tomorrow night, so I\u2019ll let you know tomorrow night,\u201d he said Monday when asked if he thought the mineral deal with Ukraine was dead.\n\nHow Democrats respond\n\nBack in 2020, Trump\u2019s rivals felt emboldened. After his address that year, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be seen on camera ripping up a copy of his speech.\n\nAn open question this year is how Democrats respond in the room. Party leaders are still scrambling to settle on a message and a plan for how to present a counterbalance to Trump, mindful of the drubbing that Democrats took in the November elections.\n\nThe party has tapped freshman Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan to deliver the formal rebuttal, an often thankless task that can still elevate a junior politician\u2019s profile. A former CIA analyst and member of the US House, Slotkin won Michigan last year at the same time that Trump carried the state.\n\nMade-for-TV moments\n\nEver the television showman, Trump has long relied on an element of surprise for his primetime addresses to Congress.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s speechwriting team has been working on multiple drafts, aides said Monday that Trump has spent little time on the address \u2013 aside from a few theatrical moments that are intended to resonate with the audience on television and inside the House chamber.\n\nUnlike during Trump\u2019s first term, top adviser Stephen Miller hasn\u2019t taken the lead in crafting this speech, leaving the task to other speechwriters. However, he and Trump\u2019s other senior aides will all be involved in edits heading into Tuesday evening.\n\nTrump is expected to take a victory lap, touting his election win \u2013 something he argues delivered him a mandate to enact sweeping change, despite its relatively small margin \u2013 as well as lauding what one senior White House official referred to as the \u201csuccesses and accomplishments\u201d from his first six weeks in office.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "full_content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Every morning for 47 years, Gaily Cowart\u2019s mother woke up in her sun-filled bedroom overlooking a lush garden and the San Gabriel Mountains beyond.\n\nThat garden and much of her mother\u2019s home are now covered in ash and soot after the Eaton Fire ripped through Altadena on Jan. 7, destroying more than 9,000 residences in the foothill community north of downtown Los Angeles. At least 17 people died, and thousands more were displaced.\n\nCowart\u2019s childhood house survived the flames but is surrounded by charred homes and razed businesses near what used to be Altadena\u2019s bustling business corridor. The neighborhood off Lake Avenue sustained some of the worst damage in one of two major fires that swept through Los Angeles County in January.\n\nThe garden of Gaily Cowart's childhood home in Altadena, Calif. Courtesy Gaily Cowart.\n\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires displaced about 150,000 residents, and many remain in rentals and hotel rooms nearly two months later. Survivors whose homes are standing face ballooning smoke remediation and restoration costs, as well as insurance companies that are lowballing payouts even though some offer smoke damage coverage.\n\nNBC News spoke with seven homeowners whose houses survived the fires. Six of them paid for smoke damage coverage through insurance, and one did not have the option through the state\u2019s insurer of last resort.\n\nStill reeling from the destruction, they now face tens of thousands of dollars in costs or more to deep clean and remediate remaining toxins inside their homes. They anticipate being displaced for months as they begin rebuilding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really tricky being in a home that did not burn down,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a gray area with insurance thinking, \u2018Just wipe everything down and it\u2019ll be back the way it used to be.\u2019 But it\u2019s like, 'No, I\u2019ve got soot and ash that I can see with my eyes.'\u201d\n\nThe insurance industry has long been fraught in California, where wildfires are getting bigger and deadlier every year. Major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies or are refusing to renew existing ones to offset skyrocketing costs across much of the state.\n\nResidents were blindsided last year when State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurer, announced it would drop coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments. It blamed costs associated with inflation, catastrophe exposure, reinsurance and regulations for its need to protect its bottom line.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Altadena resident Andrea-Marie Stark emerged from a State Farm information tent frustrated by the lack of progress in getting her remediation estimate approved. Service was scheduled to start Monday on her three-bedroom, two-bathroom ranch-style house facing Eaton Canyon, where the fire was first reported.\n\nBut State Farm had not yet approved the estimate, which ranged from $80,000 to $100,000 to pull insulation from the walls, remove harmful particles from all surfaces and replace furniture, clothing and appliances exposed to excessive smoke and ash.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to lose my place in line,\u201d Stark said of the approval delay. \u201cAnd then I could lose a place to live.\u201d\n\nAndrea-Marie Stark and her husband in their smoke-damaged home in Altadena. Courtesy Andrea-Marie Stark\n\nStark\u2019s house is one of several that survived the inferno on her block, but its proximity to the flames meant everything inside was coated with a thick layer of soot. Christmas decorations turned gray in the ash, and her clothing has the strong odor of smoke.\n\nA charred smoky smell lingers on Stark's street. A neighboring house has been razed to its foundation, with only the chimney left standing. In the distance, green moss and leaves sprout amid the burned branches and fallen limbs of Eaton Canyon.\n\nStark and her husband evacuated to a friend\u2019s home the night of the fire after they secured their four rabbits, five chickens, three cats, a dog and a horse in their crates. They have been jumping from friend\u2019s home to friend\u2019s home ever since. They hoped to return to Altadena by mid-March after having booked a smoke remediation company that said it could complete the work quickly.\n\nBut State Farm had not responded to her claim for two weeks, and she worried she would need to pay for the remediation herself, plus rent if her appointment had to be rescheduled.\n\nIn an emailed statement, State Farm said it is \u201ccommitted to paying what we owe, promptly, courteously, and efficiently.\u201d As of Feb. 26, it has received more than 11,750 fire and auto claims related to the fires and paid nearly $2.2 billion to customers, it said.\n\nTo cope with the anxiety associated with surviving a catastrophic event, Stark and her husband started a Monday night support group for residents whose homes are still standing. It is a way for people to speak openly about what few others can understand.\n\n\u201cSafeness is an internal feeling. Safety is external, and they\u2019re both ruptured right now,\u201d said Stark, a trauma-trained counselor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to express this to someone without a home, you know, because I don\u2019t want to disrespect their experience and make them think that I\u2019m not grateful. That\u2019s called survivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d\n\nThe smell in Marcie Habell\u2019s Altadena home nauseates her. A remediation company recommended taking it down to the studs to fully restore it. She cannot imagine returning to it right now, let alone sitting on her fabric couch or using any of her towels or linens.\n\n\u201cI can be in my house for less than five minutes,\" said Habell, whose home is one of just two standing on her block. \"It\u2019s insane that it happened, and then on top of it, the way that insurance is behaving just compounds the tragedy.\u201d\n\nShe has been quoted upward of $22,000 just for toxicity testing, and she expects rent could run $4,000 to $4,500 a month. That's on top of paying her mortgage if her insurance company does not agree to cover the full cost, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are getting zero guidance from anyone for those of us who happen to have a standing home and are surrounded by the apocalypse,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Sollner, California's deputy insurance commissioner, said in a statement that \"smoke damage is real and insurance companies must investigate claims properly, not deny them outright or pressure homeowners into accepting less than they are owed.\"\n\nMore than 33,710 insurance claims related to the Los Angeles-area fires have been filed, and nearly $7 billion in claims have been paid, according to state Insurance Department.\n\nGaily Cowart and her mom, Faye Cowart whose home in Altadena is just one of a few left standing on her block. Courtesy Gaily Cowart\n\nCowart is handling her mother\u2019s smoke damage claim from Dallas, where she has been living for more than a decade. She flew to Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to pick up her mother from a friend\u2019s house and took her back to Texas. Cowart\u2019s mother, Faye Cowart, has early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and struggles with being in a new place. But Cowart fears her old neighborhood is too toxic to return to.\n\nInitial estimates to remediate the Spanish-style two-bedroom, two-bathroom house started at $55,000. A landscaper bid $3,000 to restore the garden and remove potentially toxic soil. Including furniture removal and buying new clothing, Cowart fears, the cost to fully restore her mother\u2019s home and everything in it could quickly top $100,000. Howard\u2019s Allstate adjuster has not finalized their payout or agreed to pay long-term rent while Howard remains displaced, Cowart said.\n\n\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t go home,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cJust on a basic human level, no one has told us what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d\n\n\"We continue to support California customers with wildfire claims and are working to resolve them with speed and care,\" a spokesperson for Allstate said in an emailed statement, adding the company has paid more than $750 million to California customers since the fires started.\n\nRob Rhatt, an insurance analyst for Lending Tree, said it is \u201cfrustrating and not surprising\u201d that insurance companies are slow to handle smoke damage claims. Unlike damage from fires, which is structural and clearly visible, damage caused by invisible smoke does not neatly fall into most categories. It requires professional testing, cleaning and restoration with expensive outside vendors.\n\nSimply put, homes in high wildfire-risk areas are bad for business.\n\n\u201cThese catastrophic losses have really cut into their profitability,\u201d Rhatt said of insurance companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not just cutting into their profitability where they\u2019re making less money, but it\u2019s actually threatening their solvency to the point where they\u2019re losing money insuring homes in California.\u201d\n\nPacific Palisades resident Ian Hardcastle said he never had the option to fully insure the 2,600-square foot home he shared with his wife and 14-month-old child near Temescal Gateway Park, where the Palisades Fire sparked.\n\nAfter they bought their house in 2021, he signed up for the California FAIR Plan, which provides coverage for those who cannot obtain insurance from private companies, and hoped any wildfires would stay tucked in the mountains and canyons, as they had historically.\n\nBut on Jan. 7, a wind-driven inferno ripped through the state park behind his house and devastated the surrounding neighborhood. His home was overwhelmed with billowing smoke and toxic ash for several days. Hardcastle can stand to be inside for only a few minutes at a time.\n\nHis adjuster quoted $1,826 for remediation, but a $5,000 deductible means Hardcastle will receive no payout for work that could cost much more.\n\n\"This, this little plot of land was our special happy place, so we're happy it's still here,\" Hardcastle said Thursday as he toured his property. \"We want to come back, but again, we don't know when that will be.\""

It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cThe president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,\u201d the White House official said.\n\nAfter more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Monday\u2019s pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putin\u2019s hand.\n\nThe pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelensky\u2019s bad behavior last week.\n\nUkraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks \u2014 perhaps until the start of the summer \u2014 before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. The Biden administration rushed shipments of weapons to Ukraine in its waning days, providing the country with large stockpiles of advanced weapons.\n\nIt is those sophisticated weapons \u2014 including the long-range ATACMS missiles \u2014 that have allowed Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, a strategy that could suffer if those weapons remain paused.\n\nWhile European nations may be able to replace US shipments of artillery, supplemented by Ukraine\u2019s own growing defense industry, the most advanced weapons used by Kyiv come from the United States.\n\nImpact could be \u2018crippling\u2019\n\n\u201cThe impact is going to be big. I would call it crippling,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has closely followed the war.\n\nCancian estimated that Ukraine would feel the impacts of the pause in aid within two to four months, as aid from European countries helps Kyiv remain in the fight for now. \u201cThat\u2019s why they don\u2019t fall off a cliff, but when your supplies get cut in half, eventually that shows up on the front lines,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cTheir front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse \u2013 even catastrophic \u2013 peace settlement.\u201d\n\nBut Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces. \u201cThere might be a way out of this, but it\u2019s going to be extremely humiliating for Zelensky,\u201d Cancian said.\n\nThe White House made the decision to pause military aid to Ukraine for now as officials seek an acknowledgement from Zelensky about the breakdown in relations following Friday\u2019s blowup in the Oval Office.\n\nAccording to several officials, Trump and his senior aides are seeking an acknowledgement from Zelensky \u2013 potentially in the form of a public apology \u2013 before moving ahead with a deal on Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, which had been close to agreement before Friday\u2019s meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday in an interview on CNN.\n\nThe halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States\u2019 traditional European allies like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone,\u201d one US official said.\n\nA European official called the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pause military aid to Ukraine \u201cpetty and wrong.\u201d\n\nThe official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beyond disappointed,\u201d the official told CNN\n\nSince the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. The largest of these packages was nearly $3 billion, though most were far smaller. Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the US for the weapons on social media, as well as in calls and meetings with American officials.\n\nThe pause comes one day after a defense official told CNN that military aid to Ukraine announced by the Biden administration was still flowing. Those shipments included critical munitions such as anti-tank weapons, thousands of artillery rounds, and rockets. Those shipments were expected to continue for several weeks, but the decision from the Trump administration freezes the aid that was en route.\n\n\u201cDoD is also providing other capabilities, such as armored vehicles, as soon as required repairs are completed,\u201d the defense official said on Sunday. The US had set up facilities in Poland to repair Western equipment damaged on the battlefield before sending it back to the Ukrainian military.\n\nThere are also multiple longer-term contracts between arms manufacturers and the US to send weapons systems and air defense systems to Ukraine.\n\nMixed reaction from Republicans\n\nRepublicans in Congress, where the party holds majorities in both chambers, have been split on continuing aid to Ukraine amid its three-year war with Russia.\n\nEarlier Monday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes \u201cso far,\u201d saying, \u201cthe American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and there\u2019s no end in sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, \u2018Let\u2019s bring an end to it,\u2019\u201d the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, \u201cthen we will.\u201d\n\nHowever, he warned if Zelensky \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to negotiate peace, then it\u2019s not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war.\u201d\n\nGOP Sen. Susan Collins, however, denounced the pause on Monday night, arguing that the US needs to continue backing its ally.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical time for Ukraine. And I managed the Ukraine supplemental last year that provided additional help to Ukraine, and I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It\u2019s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,\u201d the Maine Republican said.\n\nCollins acknowledged that Congress may not be able to do anything to ensure Ukraine continues to receive aid from the US.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is linked to the president\u2019s drawdown authority,\u201d she noted, pointing to accusations during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term that he had \u201cslow walked\u201d aid.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve seen this movie before, and I remain convinced that it\u2019s not only in Ukraine\u2019s interest but our interest to back Ukraine because Putin is not going to stop there,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chair Republican Rep. Brian Mast told CNN he \u201cknew it was an option\u201d for the Trump administration to pause all US military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think people can assume that everything is on the table with Ukraine right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Morgan Rimmer, Annie Grayer, Ali Main, Manu Raju and Sarah Davis contributed to this report."
