            "full_content": "Officers with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Photo: Patrick Fallon/Reuters\n\nAmerican tourists planning trips overseas are probably familiar with U.S. State Department \u201ctravel advisories,\u201d which warn about the risks of visits to war-torn or totalitarian countries as well as those experiencing high crime or suffering from poor infrastructure. These up-to-date looks at local conditions abroad are meant to help Americans avoid not only bodily harm but also extreme unpleasantness or drastic interruptions in derailed vacations or business trips. Here\u2019s a current example, for Israel:\n\nDo Not Travel To: \u2022 Gaza due to terrorism and armed conflict \u2022 Northern Israel within 4 kilometers/2.4 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders due to Israel\u2019s continued military presence and activity\n\nReconsider Travel To: \u2022 Israel due to terrorism and civil unrest \u2022 West Bank due to terrorism and civil unrest\n\nThat\u2019s all entirely understandable considering the ongoing crisis in that country. It\u2019s also understandable that European countries have now begun warning their citizens about the risks of travel to the United States of America. That\u2019s because they have determined that under the new regime of Donald Trump, the U.S. has become the kind of country where every foreigner better have their papers in order unless they want to risk extreme consequences. Forbes reports:\n\nThe United Kingdom updated its foreign travel advice for the U.S. on Mar. 15, recommending visitors comply with U.S. authorities, which \u201cset and enforce entry rules strictly\u201d and warning, \u201cYou may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d An archived version of the webpage from Feb. 1 shows the guidance had previously said: \u201cThe authorities in the U.S. set and enforce entry rules\u201d with no mention of arrest or detention.\n\nGermany\u2019s Federal Foreign Office updated its website Tuesday, advising travelers that even having a valid authorization permit or U.S. visa doesn\u2019t guarantee the right to enter the country and, if refused, \u201cthere is no legal recourse against this decision.\u201d A new paragraph warns: \u201cCriminal records in the United States, false information about the purpose of their stay, or even a slight overstay of their visa upon entry or exit can lead to arrest, detention, and deportation.\u201d\n\nTourists who run afoul of the Trump administration\u2019s cultural conservatism could have additional problems. Germany, Denmark, and Finland have warned their citizens that the U.S. may deny entry to transgender and nonbinary tourists since the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization used by Europeans for visa-free travel doesn\u2019t allow foreign visitors to select anything other than \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale.\u201d Germany and Denmark both allow their citizens to designate \u201cX\u201d as their gender on passports.\n\nAs NPR notes, a handful of countries have previously warned their citizens about the risk of gun violence when traveling in the U.S., but not about the risks of dealing with the U.S. government.\n\nAside from the intense scrutiny tourists trying to visit this country may encounter, the Trump administration\u2019s overall attitude toward select foreign countries is having a dampening effect on tourism. That\u2019s particularly true of the single largest source of U.S. tourism, our neighbors to the north. Canada has updated its travel advisory for the U.S., urging extra caution in dealing with U.S. authorities. And as the New York Times reports, Canadians unhappy with Trump\u2019s claims that their country will be America\u2019s 51st state have lost interest in visiting the other 50, including New York:\n\nMore than one million Canadians visited New York City last year, injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy. Now, they are canceling trips in droves. School groups have called off end-of-semester trips. So have busloads of retirees, as well as newlyweds planning honeymoons, friends celebrating birthdays and a family from Quebec that had planned to visit twice this year. Often, the reason cited is President Trump\u2019s escalating hostility toward Canada and repeated threats to make it the 51st state, which has stirred sweeping pledges to boycott American goods and abandon over-the-border vacations to the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to the rest of the world is now creating real costs for Americans. We\u2019re paying in dollars and cents, and in the long-revered reputation of this country as a marvelous place to visit where freedom is revered.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Friday! In today\u2019s newsletter, we\u2019re diving into the Trump administration\u2019s various legal cases, including several where judges are starting to get annoyed. We\u2019re also taking a look at how the White House is handling potential conflicts of interest for Elon Musk, given his business interests, and how Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is handling a swell of Democratic anger at him. And last but not least, we answer another reader question using data from the latest NBC News poll. Enjoy the newsletter, and enjoy your weekend.\n\n\u2014 Scott Bland\n\nThe Trump administration's many court cases heat up\n\nSeveral federal judges expressed frustration this week with how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is pushing forward his sweeping agenda, as Trump and his allies got even more aggressive in their criticism of the judiciary, Dareh Gregorian, Gary Grumbach and Chloe Atkins report.\n\nTrump called for the impeachment of a judge who temporarily halted deportations being carried out under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act, while also blasting the jurist on his Truth Social platform as a \u201cgrandstander\u201d whose rulings are \u201cinept.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration currently has over 15 appeals pending, including from rulings this week reining in the power of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Governmental Efficiency.\n\nYou can read more about those appeals and other cases here. But first \u2014 more on Musk, and how the White House is handling potential conflicts of interest for the world\u2019s richest man-turned-\u201cspecial government employee.\u201d\n\nAs the public face of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has an expansive portfolio that spans across the many levers of government \u2014 and that could intersect with his wide range of business interests, Ben Kamisar reports.\n\nBut unlike another high-profile \u201cspecial government employee\u201d working in Trump\u2019s White House, AI and crypto czar David Sacks, there\u2019s no evidence that Musk has obtained a conflict-of-interest waiver. Such a waiver would outline the steps he\u2019s taken to avoid overlaps between his business interests and his government work, include an explanation from the White House counsel about why it feels comfortable with Musk\u2019s arrangement, and identify areas where Musk has the green light to weigh in despite his business holdings.\n\nInstead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Musk has already pledged he\u2019d avoid potential conflicts of interest, and like all Trump-appointed \u201cspecial government employees,\u201d he\u2019s \u201cabiding by all applicable laws.\u201d\n\nIn response to an NBC News inquiry about a potential waiver for Musk, the White House counsel\u2019s office replied that \u201cthe White House has no disclosures responsive to your request.\u201d And while some ethics documents are not immediately available for release, instead becoming public weeks after submission, the White House press office did not directly address whether Musk has sought or received a conflict-of-interest waiver that has not yet been released publicly.\n\nAnother special government employee, Sacks, did receive a conflict-of-interest waiver, which has been posted publicly on the White House\u2019s public disclosure portal (releasing these documents publicly upon request is mandated by federal law). That 11-page memo, written by White House Counsel David Warrington, provides a road map to the kinds of conflict-of-interest rules that govern special government employees. The memo shows how Sacks has sought to divest his assets to satisfy the White House\u2019s lawyers, and it demonstrates why he is receiving a conflict-of-interest waiver in the first place that allows him to participate in \u201ccertain particular matters regarding regulation and policy related to the digital asset industry.\u201d\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nMusk visited the Pentagon on Friday for a briefing that Trump insists was focused on the tech mogul\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts, disputing a New York Times report that the meeting would include a discussion of plans for any potential war with China.\n\nTrump said that the Small Business Administration, instead of the Department of Education, would handle the country\u2019s federal student loan portfolio.\n\nThe Trump administration is launching an AI tool for government use.\n\nTrump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared together in the Oval Office to announce a Boeing contract to build the new F-47 fighter.\n\nAngry Democrats are taking aim at Schumer. But is this his \u2018Biden moment?\u2019\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is facing ongoing calls to step down from left-leaning activist groups and even some members of Congress upset with his decision to advance a Republican spending bill and avert a government shutdown. But Schumer remains defiant and has continued to insist he is the best leader for the party in the Senate at this moment.\n\nI pressed Schumer on his future in leadership when I spoke with him this week in an interview airing on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday.\n\nStill, it doesn\u2019t seem like Schumer is facing the same level of opposition that confronted President Joe Biden when he stepped down as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee last summer. In that moment, scores of elected Democrats from both chambers of Congress came forward to call on Biden to end his campaign. (Schumer himself reportedly pushed Biden to drop out of the race, according to The New York Times.)\n\nIn this moment, most of the pushback so far is coming from Democrats in the House. And some Senate Democrats who were outspoken about Biden are holding their fire on Schumer.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., one of the first Democratic members of Congress who called on Biden to step aside last year, sidestepped a question at a recent town hall about whether Schumer should remain in his leadership post, notably stopping short of calling on Schumer to pass the torch. Bennet said, \u201cIn dodging your question, let me just say it\u2019s important for people to know, you know, when it\u2019s time to go. And I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we\u2019re going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who has emerged as a leading voice urging Democrats to more aggressively take on Trump, also told me on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last week that he still supports the minority leader.\n\n\u201cLeader Schumer has a very difficult job. I don\u2019t envy the job that he has,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd the question is really for the members of his Democratic caucus: Are we willing to fight?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic angst has continued to simmer, boiling over at recent town hall meetings. And Democratic voters want their party to put up a fight, according to the latest NBC News poll.\n\nSo is Schumer making the same mistake as Biden and overstaying his welcome as a leader of the Democratic Party? I asked him that question directly, so tune in on Sunday to hear his response. Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, will also be joining \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this week.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2600\ufe0f Sunshine State showdown: The Democrats running in a pair of April 1 special elections for deeply Republican House districts in Florida have raised a whopping $15.7 million combined in two months, but they still face steep uphill climbs in the upcoming campaigns.

One reader asked how voters in red states are viewing President Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders and Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to slash the federal government via the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTo answer that, we turned to one of our resident polling experts, Ben Kamisar. Here\u2019s his response:\n\nIt\u2019s a great question \u2014 obviously not everyone in a red state voted for Trump or is on board with everything he\u2019s doing. But voters in these states do give Trump more leeway given his increased level of popularity there.\n\nOne way to answer this question is to dig into our polling data and split out respondents from states that voted for Trump. Then, we can compare their ratings of the president to the overall numbers.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating in states that voted for him in 2024 is 57%, compared to 47% among registered voters nationally. Trump-state voters are also more likely to approve of his handling of key issues. But they\u2019re effectively split on whether they approve or disapprove of his handling of the economy and the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAs for DOGE, Trump-state voters are more likely to have a positive view of Musk and the department than registered voters at large (49% of these voters viewed Musk positively, compared to 39% of registered voters nationwide, while 49% of Trump-state voters viewed DOGE positively compared to 41% of registered voters nationwide). And a majority of Trump-state voters, 53%, say DOGE is a good idea.\n\nThat\u2019s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today\u2019s newsletter was compiled by Scott Bland and Faith Wardwell.\n\nIf you have feedback \u2014 likes or dislikes \u2014 email us at politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a fan, please share with everyone and anyone.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNow, if you were in that crowd and weren\u2019t intubated and drip-fed, you understood that it was the fat-cat Democrats who got the most money and spent the most money in the last presidential election.\n\nBy far.\n\nI would have called their event the \u201cHow Stupid are You?\u201d Tour, but I understand why they didn\u2019t. That could have alerted any sentient beings at Arizona State University\u2019s Mullett Arena that they were being conned.\n\nThey enjoyed so much largesse from billionaire and millionaire backers that they doubled Republican spending.\n\nIn fact, so much money poured into Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign coffers that even the Democrat-friendly New York Times couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cHow Kamala Harris Burned Through $1.5 Billion in 15 Weeks,\u201d The Times\u2019 headline intoned.\n\nJust how hard were the money clouds raining down on Harris?\n\nSo hard that even her closest campaign ally, Bakari Sellers, told The Times. \u201cWe had so much money it was hard to get it out the door.\u201d\n\nDemocrats: Do as we say, not as we do\n\nSo, here\u2019s what the \u201cFight Oligarchy\u201d tour is really about.\n\nOligarchy is great when they\u2019re our oligarchs. Oligarchy is evil when they\u2019re not.\n\nFor decades now, the Democrats have hobnobbed with the rich and famous, and they've dutifully served their masters. Then some of the rich and famous \u2012 the moneybags in Silicon Valley \u2012 switched sides in 2024 and America\u2019s liberal party suddenly lost its taste for caviar and champagne.\n\nThey won't tolerate it anymore.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept a society today in which we have massive income and wealth inequalities where the very rich have never done better and working families are struggling to put food on the table,\" said the multimillionaire Bernie Sanders to the Tempe crowd.\n\nAnd little point of clarity here. Understand that Sen. Sanders is rich. So forgive him his little faux pas on Thursday night.\n\nWhen you\u2019re part of the American aristocracy, you take your latte in bone china in leather chairs.\n\nYou don\u2019t buy Joe in paper cups from Circle K.\n\n\u201cYou got 9/11s here?\u201d Sanders asked the crowd, as 20,000 eyebrows furrowed at once.\n\nSilly him.\n\nHe meant 7-Elevens.

They draw from the dreary little lives of the 95% to make a metaphor that, in Sanders' case, had something to do with convenience stores and \"CEOs of major corporations who are robbing us every single day.\"\n\nOh.\n\nWhere the 'Fight Oligarchy' tour should go next\n\nNext stop for the \u201cFight Oligarchy\" tour is Colorado and then back to Arizona and Tucson, reported The Republic\u2019s Stephanie Murray.\n\nMight I suggest a couple detours \u2013 ideal sites to rail against the fat cats who run the country. Here are just a couple:\n\nMartha\u2019s Vineyard. This is where the man who started it all for the Democratic Party now lives in luxurious, sunlit splendor.\n\nBarack Obama.\n\nIn 2013, the nonprofit student political organization Democracy Matters \u2013 an organization once endorsed by Sen. Sanders \u2013 published a piece by one of its founding members that noticed how the Democratic Party had transformed in the age of Obama.\n\nThe essay titled \u201cThe New Oligarchy\u201d noted, \u201cThe rise of a political oligarchy has changed the funding base of the Democratic Party more than the Republican.\"\n\nEnough that by 2012, \u201caffluent donors contributed four times more money to Democrats than did unions. ... In short, the Democrats cannot any longer be considered a bulwark against the power of wealth.\u201d\n\nDavid Samuels, who made his name writing commentary for The New Republic, The Atlantic and New Yorker, noted last year: \"The policy of aligning the Democrats with the wealthiest Americans, while taking from the middle class and rewarding the poor with symbolic identity politics victories, was Obama\u2019s creation \u2013 hardly a surprising coinage from a BLM-promoting Harvard Law School graduate who once told an intimate that the two things he wanted, as he left the White House, were a private jet and a valet.\u201d\n\nAdded Samuels, \"Obama\u2019s central position in the Democratic Party is both practical and symbolic: in his person, he represents both the elite institutions such as Harvard Law School and the large American foundations and billionaire funders who backed his political rise in Chicago.\u201d\n\nNassau, The Bahamas. This capital city was the headquarters of FTX cryptocurrency exchange, where billionaire Democratic Party benefactor and conman Sam Bankman-Fried \u201corchestrated one of the largest financial frauds in history, stealing over $8 billion of his customers\u2019 money,\u201d according to federal prosecutor Damian Williams in sentencing him to 25 years in prison last year.\n\n\u201cThe scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight,\u201d wrote the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nBankman-Fried stole the nest eggs of Americans to build a fortune of $26 billion. To keep the regulators off his back, he contributed more than $100 million in political campaign contributions before the 2022 U.S. midterm elections \"to mostly Democratic candidates and causes,\" according to NBC News.\n\nThis is the party Bernie Sanders has served for decades. He is an independent, but he caucuses with the Democrats and has run twice for president in Democratic primaries.\n\nFor decades he has railed against oligarchy. He was, in fact, shocked, shocked, that the party he served had become the servants of oligarchs, marinating in their billions of largesse.\n\nWhich begs the question ...\n\nIf you couldn\u2019t crush the oligarchy in your own party, what makes you qualified to crush it in the other?\n\nPhil Boas is an editorial columnist with The Arizona Republic, where this column originally published.

You know you\u2019re talking about a potential war with China,\u201d Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a potential war with China, but I can tell you, if we did, we\u2019re very well equipped to handle it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came amid speculation over why Musk was at the Pentagon on Friday morning, where he met with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth for over an hour. The New York Times reported Thursday that Musk was receiving a briefing on the US military\u2019s plan for potential conflict with China. Pentagon officials resoundingly dismissed the reporting on social media on Thursday.\n\nTrump acknowledged Friday that Musk also has his own business interests in China, which could pose a conflict of interest if he was briefed on a potential war plan with the nation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to show that to anybody \u2013 but certainly, you wouldn\u2019t show it to a businessman who is helping us so much,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that \u2013 but it was such a fake story.\u201d\n\nCNN has reported that Musk \u2014 who is serving as a special government employee under Trump \u2014 has a top-secret security clearance. The meeting also comes as the Pentagon is weighing significant cuts to the top of the military amid efforts across the Trump administration to shrink the government.\n\nHegseth has said the Defense Department would be working with Musk\u2019s DOGE to find fraud and waste within the department.\n\nThis photo released by the Department of Defense shows Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth welcoming Elon Musk to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on March 21, 2025. Senior Airman Spencer Perkins/Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs\n\nMusk maintains lucrative contracts with the Defense Department. In October 2024, the US Space Force awarded $733 million in launch contracts to Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nMusk arrived at the Pentagon just before 9 a.m. for his meeting with Hegseth and other senior Pentagon leaders. Upon arrival he went upstairs towards Hegseth\u2019s office, and did not emerge from the office for roughly an hour and 20 minutes. Photos of the meeting shared by the Pentagon showed Musk and Hegseth sitting at a table with six other individuals, including Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff Joe Kasper.\n\nAsked by CNN about the meeting as Musk and Hegseth exited Hegseth\u2019s office, Musk responded, \u201cIt\u2019s always a great meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here before, you know,\u201d Musk quipped, as he and Hegseth laughed and began walking down the stairs. Neither Hegseth nor Musk answered shouted questions about whether they discussed China in their meeting or if it was a classified briefing.\n\nAsked by the New York Times after Musk\u2019s departure what the two discussed, Hegseth said, \u201cWhy would I tell you?\u201d\n\nHegseth later characterized the meeting as \u201cfantastic\u201d while at the White House for the announcement of a new fighter aircraft.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is a patriotic American and I appreciate him,\u201d Hegseth said, without elaborating on what the two discussed."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the Pentagon\u2019s decision to move forward with a next-generation fighter jet titled F-47 on Friday in joint remarks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth from the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cAt my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world\u2019s first sixth-generation fighter jet, number six, sixth generation, nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it\u2019ll be known as the F-47,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump announced that Boeing had been awarded the contract for the newest US fighter aircraft.\n\nThe president went on to say an experimental version of the F-47 has been flying for almost five years. At the end of the first Trump administration, the Air Force acknowledged that it had flown a full-scale prototype of the jet.\n\n\u201cAfter a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America\u2019s top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the next generation air dominance platform to Boeing,\u201d Trump announced.\n\nUntil now, the program had been known as Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD). But in an apparent reference to his own presidency, Trump said the aircraft would be known as the F-47. Aircraft designations are normally announced by the Air Force.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something the likes of which nobody has seen before,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand this has been in the works for a long period of time.\u201d\n\nTrump also promised the F-47 would be able to cooperate with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are a major focus of the military, especially as the US has watched Ukraine and Russia effectively use drones in relatively inexpensive long-range attacks and employed drone swarms to overwhelm aerial defenses.\n\n\u201cThis plane flies with drones. It flies with many, many drones, as many as you want,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a technology that\u2019s new, but it doesn\u2019t fly by itself. It flies with many drones, as many as you want, and that\u2019s something that no other plane can do.\u201d\n\nIt was the Air Force\u2019s decision to award the F-47 program to Boeing, but Trump\u2019s celebration of the announcement was somewhat of a surprise, since he has repeatedly criticized the company.\n\nTrump has railed against Boeing for the cost overruns and delays with the next Air Force One. \u201cWe are getting a new Air Force One, if Boeing could ever finish the damn thing,\u201d Trump said in February. Boeing\u2019s leadership said they would try to move the delivery schedule up, but there\u2019s \u201cno silver bullet\u201d for the program.\n\nAnother major Boeing program for the Air Force - the KC-46 tanker - is projected to be more than seven years behind its original timeline for reaching full-rate production, according to the Government Accountability Office, a far cry from the Trump administration\u2019s goal of producing systems faster and more efficiently.\n\nFor decades, Boeing produced the backbone of the US bomber fleet, from B-17s and B-29s in World War II to B-52s that rolled off the assembly line in the 1960s and are still flying today. Boeing now produces the F-15EX Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet, two major platforms for the Air Force and the Navy, respectively. These fighter aircraft are derivatives of designs initially developed by McDonnell Douglas, an aircraft manufacturer that merged with Boeing in 1997.\n\nThe last production fighter designed and built exclusively by Boeing is the P-26 Peashooter, which first flew in 1932. Boeing also designed and built the X-32 Joint Strike Fighter, which ultimately lost out to the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.\n\nLate-last year, the Air Force paused the decision on how to proceed with the sixth-generation fighter. The Air Force said in December that then-Secretary Frank Kendall would defer the decision to the Trump administration.\n\nThe Next Generation Air Dominance program is intended to produce the US military\u2019s sixth-generation fighter jet, newer and more advanced than the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, which has suffered from major cost overruns and delays.\n\nElon Musk has railed against the F-35, instead advocating for unmanned drone swarms as a cheaper, more effective weapon. On social media in November, Musk said \u201cMeanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.\u201d\n\nWhen Lockheed Martin was awarded the F-35 in October 2001, the weapons maker said the program would cost approximately $200 billion. The company\u2019s CEO promised the F-35 would be \u201ccapable and affordable\u201d and be produced \u201con schedule and cost.\u201d More than two decades later, the total cost of the program has exceeded $2 trillion, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), as the military services \u201cplan to use it less.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Angry Democrats explode at Chuck Schumer. Photo: Leonardo Munoz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWithout any question, rank-and-file Democrats are furious right now. They are angry at the Trump administration, of course, for the multi-pronged attack underway on the public sector; on judges; on immigrants; on universities; on our allies; and on the U.S. Constitution. They are angry at a Republican Party that is egging on Trump, Elon Musk, Russell Vought, and the unruly gang of social-media trolls, Christian nationalists, and tech bros who have been empowered by the new administration, at the expense of congressional Republican authority. But most of all, they\u2019re angry at their own party\u2019s leaders for losing a winnable 2024 election and then retreating into confusion and fecklessness in dealing with emergency conditions that look a lot like every authoritarian takeover in modern world history.\n\nDemocrats are losing confidence in their party at historic rates, with Chuck Schumer\u2019s abrupt decision to abandon a filibuster against a GOP/Trump spending bill becoming a real flash point. A recent Quinnipiac survey showed 49 percent of self-identified Democrats disapproving the job performance of the congressional party. The palpable unhappiness at the grassroots has led multiple observers to suggest that we may be on the brink of an intraparty revolt similar in intensity and significance to the tea-party movement that convulsed Republicans during the Obama administration, and which (many believe) paved the way for the equally angry MAGA movement that is now in charge of the country.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the tea party of the right began with angry grassroots Republicans infuriated by Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 election victory, the 44th president\u2019s bold legislative agenda, and the GOP Establishment\u2019s difficulties in countering it. And it did most strikingly manifest itself in a midterm primary upset of a congressional Republican leader, when a nobody named Dave Brat defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his Virginia stomping grounds. We are now being told that Democrats in Congress who aren\u2019t sufficiently \u201cfighting\u201d Trump could meet the same fate.\n\nBut the differences between the current moment and the one that sparked the tea-party movement are at least as striking as the similarities. The most important difference is that the uprising on the right was sharply ideological, and went far beyond demands for greater partisan combativeness. Its impetus was pretty clearly the bipartisan actions taken to mitigate the financial collapse that occurred late in the Bush administration, including the TARP bailout of investment institutions, but more importantly, the relief provided to regular folks who defaulted on mortgages.\n\nThe tea-party movement\u2019s moment of birth was famously \u201cSantelli\u2019s Rant,\u201d an on-air tirade by business telejournalist Rick Santelli aimed at the deadbeats turned freeloaders who took on unsustainable debt and expected their more responsible fellow citizens to rescue them with taxpayer dollars. This very pointed complaint metastasized into broad-based resentment of income redistribution and a near-libertarian belief that much of the modern welfare state violated the U.S. Constitution. While tea-party protests may have been aimed at TARP and then Obamacare, they really represented a revolt against the New Deal and Great Society legacy of beneficent government and a clear and powerful right turn for the Republican Party. Much of what the hard-core conservative House Freedom Caucus stands for came right out of the tea-party movement, along with some significant MAGA flourishes added by Donald Trump.\n\nWhile progressives certainly believe the unprincipled character of party centrists has contributed materially to Trump\u2019s return to power and the paralysis of congressional Democrats, it\u2019s not accurate to say that the current wave of anger is ideological or the product of an aroused Left. As Politico notes, Democrats unhappy with their party are not at all united in any ideological diagnosis or prescription:\n\nDespite the restive energy in the party\u2019s progressive wing, the Democratic discontent does not seem to be centered around a desire to pull the party to the left or the right. Democrats cannot seem to agree on which direction the party should move in \u2014 recent Gallup polling found that 45 percent wanted the party to become more moderate, while 29 percent felt it should become more liberal, and 22 percent wanted it to stay the same.\n\nI\u2019m reasonably sure very few of the original tea-party activists wanted the GOP to become \u201cmore moderate.\u201d\n\nSo if an ideological uprising is not in store for Democrats, how is the current wave of anguish likely to manifest itself, or to be resolved?\n\nCongressional leadership, rather than garden-variety Democratic incumbents, seem the most likely target of grassroots rage going forward, which would mean a shakeup within the Senate and possibly the House leadership to show a willingness to deploy more aggressive tactics. But before that sort of revolt can take shape, the underlying conditions in the country could change the intraparty dynamics. If, for example, federal courts indeed slow down or stop the most outrageous actions of Team Trump, and particularly if the Supreme Court reestablishes constitutional \u201cguardrails,\u201d then perhaps Democrats will become less insistent that their elected leaders throw themselves upon the MAGA ramparts. And inversely, if Trump, Musk, and company intensify their authoritarian efforts and are not restrained by the courts (either because the judiciary surrenders or is simply ignored), the anger, fear, and panic among the Democratic grassroots could move onto the streets in open resistance instead of being focused on Democratic members of Congress who obviously can\u2019t be expected to stop an extraconstitutional coup.\n\nIn a less apocalyptic scenario, the closer we get to the 2026 midterms the more likely it is that Democratic activists will be focused on winning general elections and flipping Congress rather than on purging Democratic incumbents who have failed to turn the tide. Already, small-dollar donors are pouring money into long-shot Democratic candidacies in two Florida special elections to fill House seats. The categorical imperative of busting up the Republican trifecta in Washington seems sure to deter Democrats from the sort of suicidal conduct that led tea-party bravos to back doomed Republican primary candidates like 2010 Delaware Senate nominee Christine O\u2019Donnell or 2012 Missouri Senate nominee Todd Akin.\n\nIn general, we\u2019re not likely to see left-of-center activists don tri-corner hats and scream about DINOs out of anguish at what Trump\u2019s doing to their country and its institutions. As longtime tea-party observer (and sometimes supporter) David French noted, it\u2019s not a good temperamental fit anyway:\n\n[T]he Democratic Party is more of a party of institutions \u2014 including government institutions \u2014 than the Republican Party is now. This means they\u2019re less likely to want a demolition than to urge a renovation. If the Tea Party revels in being the bull in the china shop and glories in the wreckage, the Democratic Party might want better inventory or new management, but it doesn\u2019t want to trash the place.\n\nDespite the alleged proclivity of Democrats to form \u201ccircular firing squads\u201d and fall into \u201cdisarray,\u201d the odds are good that they will focus more on the common enemy."

The head of that office, James Dennehy, who had angered the Trump administration for non-Epstein-related reasons, said he was forced to submit his resignation a day later.\n\nSo now, the Trump administration is trying to move on from this debacle by swinging far in the opposite direction: Rather than throwing together a binder that contains too little information, the FBI has a jaw-dropping number of agents focused on the Epstein files instead of their regular, extremely important work.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re picturing 50 or even 100 agents sifting through Epstein documents. But ABC News reports you need to think a lot bigger:\n\nAs many as a thousand FBI agents, many of whom are usually focusing on national-security matters, have been enlisted to help with the effort, sources said.\n\nSources told ABC News that Bondi pressured FBI Director Kash Patel in \u201ctense private exchanges\u201d to prioritize the release of more Epstein files, so now agents are working around the clock to make it happen:\n\nJustice Department officials have made it clear to others throughout the Trump administration that it is now a top priority of the attorney general to sort through the materials related to Epstein and decide what can be publicly disclosed in the days ahead, sources said, and FBI agents have been told to expect to work on this into the early morning hours.\n\nThe DOJ and FBI both released statements downplaying reports of tension between the agencies, saying they are working together to deliver \u201ctransparency\u201d for the American people.\n\nBut Vanity Fair reported that the FBI\u2019s New York office is bearing a lot of the pressure from the Justice Department, with dozens of agents focused on reviewing and redacting sensitive information from Epstein-related documents rather than doing less important tasks, like, say, fighting terrorism and drug trafficking:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally all hands on deck,\u201d one source familiar with the matter tells me, adding that dozens and dozens of agents are working around the clock on the case, instead of on their regular duties. \u201cI even saw an agent walking in with a pillow,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe New York field office is an epicenter for FBI counterintelligence, counterterrorism, public corruption, international drug trafficking, and financial crime investigations. The redeployment of agents to comb over the file of the notorious sex trafficker Epstein, who died nearly six years ago, is an indication of the Justice Department priorities in this second Trump administration. One FBI veteran calls it a \u201cludicrous\u201d situation.\n\nBut at least this \u201cludicrous\u201d scramble will pay off when we all get our hands on the fabled \u201cEpstein client list\u201d? Don\u2019t bet on it, reports ABC News:\n\nSources tell ABC News that the Justice Department\u2019s national security division is devoting many of their resources to the effort, despite some top law enforcement officials believing that the information Bondi is demanding be reviewed contains no new revelations.\n\nIn fact, though Bondi has claimed that as a result of her efforts the FBI turned over a \u201ctruckload\u201d of evidence on the Epstein case, some doubt that actually happened. Per Vanity Fair:\n\nThe FBI veteran noted that this was an odd way for Bondi to describe the matter. \u201cThere\u2019s no master file in the New York office. That doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d the veteran added. \u201cThere\u2019s not some crusty agent with his feet on bankers\u2019 boxes.\u201d\n\nObviously, the public has a right to know the full extent of Epstein\u2019s horrific crimes. But perhaps Pam Bondi making huge promises live on Fox News, then having FBI agents scramble to turn her claims into reality, isn\u2019t the best way to go about this."

            "full_content": "One of a kind who can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be replicated. Photo: Jim Vondruska/Reuters\n\nAt a time when plenty of people have advice for unhappy progressive Democrats, one of their heroes, Bernie Sanders, had a succinct message: Don\u2019t love the party, leave it. In an interview with the New York Times, he previewed a barnstorming tour he has undertaken with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but made it clear he wouldn\u2019t be asking audiences to rally \u2019round the Democratic Party. \u201cOne of the aspects of this tour is to try to rally people to get engaged in the political process and run as independents outside of the Democratic Party,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nIn one respect, that isn\u2019t surprising. Though he has long aligned with the Democratic Party in Congress and has regularly backed its candidates, Sanders has always self-identified as an independent, even when he filed to run for president as a Democrat in 2020. Now, as before, he seems to regard the Democratic Party as inherently corrupted by its wealthy donor base, per the Times:\n\nDuring the interview on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders repeatedly criticized the influence of wealthy donors and Washington consultants on the party. He said that while Democrats had been a force for good on social issues like civil rights, women\u2019s rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, they had failed on the economic concerns he has dedicated his political career to addressing.\n\nStill, when Democrats are now already perceived as losing adherents, and as many progressives believe their time to take over the party has arrived, Sanders\u2019s counsel is both oddly timed and pernicious. Yes, those on the left who choose independent status may still work with Democrats on both legislative and electoral projects, much as Sanders does. And they may run in and win Democratic primaries on occasion without putting on the party yoke. But inevitably, refusing to stay formally within the Democratic tent will cede influence to centrists and alienate loyalist voters as well. And in 18 states, voters who don\u2019t register as Democrats may be barred from voting in Democratic primaries, which proved a problem for Sanders during his two presidential runs.\n\nMore fundamentally, Democrats need both solidarity and stable membership at this moment with the MAGA wolf at the door and crucial off-year and midterm elections coming up. Staying in the Democratic ranks doesn\u2019t mean giving up progressive principles or failing to challenge timid or ineffective leadership. To borrow an ancient cigarette-ad slogan, it\u2019s a time when it\u2019s better to \u201cfight than switch.\u201d\n\nThat said, there may be certain deep-red parts of the country where the Democratic brand is so toxic that an independent candidacy could make some sense for progressives. The example of 2024 independent Senate candidate Dan Osborn of Nebraska, who ran a shockingly competitive (if ultimately unsuccessful) race against Republican incumbent Deb Fischer, turned a lot of heads. But while Osborn might have been a \u201cpopulist\u201d by most standards, he wasn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call a progressive, and in fact, centrist and progressive Nebraska Democrats went along with Osborn as a very long shot. They didn\u2019t abandon their party; they just got out of the way.\n\nPerhaps someday, the popularity of electoral systems without party primaries or with ranked-choice voting will spread to the point where candidates and voters alike will gradually shed or at least weaken party labels. Then self-identifying as an independent could be both principled and politically pragmatic.\n\nBut until then, it\u2019s important to understand why American politics have regularly defaulted to a two-party system dating all the way back to those days when the Founders tried strenuously to avoid parties altogether. In a first-past-the-post system where winners take all, there\u2019s just too much at stake to allow those with whom you are in agreement on the basics to splinter. That\u2019s particularly true when, as is the case right now, the other party is rigidly united in subservience to an authoritarian leader. Sanders is one of a kind in his ability to keep his feet both within and outside the Democratic Party. His example isn\u2019t replicable without making a bad situation for progressives a whole lot worse."

Trump\u2019s Executive Order,\u201d USDA said in a press release.\n\nThe USDA temporarily paused funding for UMS, which is comprised of eight public universities in the state, last week over the issue and reinstated funds just days later. The department said the university system is now in compliance with Trump\u2019s order. Still, it warned that \u201c[a]ny false claim by the UMaine can, and will, result in onerous and even potentially criminal financial liability.\u201d\n\nBy Feb. 26, 2025, UMaine responded to USDA\u2019s questions, confirming that it does not have males participating in women\u2019s sports and complies with NCAA regulations. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) notably banned males from competing in women\u2019s sports less than 24 hours after Trump\u2019s order rewriting Title IX. USDA said UMaine has had access to federal funds since it confirmed its compliance.\n\n\u201cThe choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding,\u201d USDA added.\n\nUMS Chancellor Dannel Malloy told Fox News Digital that UMaine is \u201crelieved\u201d to \u201cput the Department\u2019s Title IX compliance review behind us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe University of Maine System has always maintained its compliance with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture also affirmed in a press release today,\u201d Malloy said.\n\n\u201cWe are relieved to put the Department\u2019s Title IX compliance review behind us so the land-grant University of Maine and our statewide partners can continue to leverage USDA and other essential federal funds to strengthen and grow our natural resource economy and dependent rural communities through world-class education, research, and extension,\u201d he continued.\n\nAccording to the report, USDA awarded at least $29.78 million to UMS for research in the 2024 fiscal year alone. In a letter to the system, the USDA said it has awarded over $100 million to UMS in recent years.\n\nRELATED: Boy Wins High School Girls\u2019 Pole Vault Competition in Maine After State Pledged to Flout Trump Order\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order on \u201cKeeping Men out of Women\u2019s Sports\u201d was created to protect female student athletes from having \u201cto compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.\u201d The order also mandates each federal department to \u201creview grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,\u201d which protects women \u201cas a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\u201d\n\nFollowing his order, several Democrat-run states said they planned to flout to order, including California, Minnesota, and Maine. Then, in February, a transgender-identifying boy claimed the victory in the Maine Class B championship for the Greely High School girls\u2019 track and field team.\n\nTrump subsequently vowed on Feb. 20 during a GOP governors\u2019 meeting at the White House to cut funding to Maine if it continues to allow males in female sports. Maine Gov. Janet Mills\u2019 office threatened legal action against the Trump administration the following day.\n\nTrump then had a spat with Mills at the White House during a bipartisan meeting of governors.\n\n\u201cAre you not going to comply with [the order]?\u201d Trump asked Mills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m complying with state and federal laws,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED: Maine Democrats Punish GOP Rep. for Opposing Transgenderism\n\n\u201cWell, we are the federal law,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cWell, you better do it. You better do it because you\u2019re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, your population, even though it\u2019s somewhat liberal \u2014 although I did very well there \u2014 your population doesn\u2019t want men playing in women\u2019s sports,\u201d he added.\n\nMills said she would see Trump in court, and he declared he looked forward to it.\n\n\u201cThat should be a really easy one, and enjoy your life after governor because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be in elected politics,\u201d he said to conclude the back-and-forth.\n\nHours later, the U.S. Department of Education announced an investigation into the state for potential IX violations. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities receiving federal funding.\n\nThe Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ultimately concluded that the state and the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) violated Title IX.\n\nHHS warned MDOE, the Maine Principals\u2019 Association, and Greely High School that it will refer the state to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) if it does not agree to comply with Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cWhat HHS is asking of the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals\u2019 Association (MPA), and Greely High School is simple \u2014 protect female athletes\u2019 rights. Girls deserve girls-only sports without male competitors. And if Maine won\u2019t come to the table to voluntarily comply with Title IX, HHS will enforce Title IX to the fullest extent permitted by the law,\u201d HHS OCR acting Director Anthony Archeval told Fox News Digital.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Witkoff went back to Moscow for a face-to-face with Russian president Vladimir Putin last week to try to advance the administration\u2019s ceasefire proposal.\n\nWitkoff is \u201cflying all over the world playing secretary of state,\u201d said a person familiar with the dynamic. \u201cHe has one thing that no one else has \u2014 he has Trump\u2019s 100% confidence.\u201d\n\nRubio, meanwhile, has dived into his role with trips to Central America to discuss immigration, to the Middle East, Europe and Canada for discussions on the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and to meet with G7 partners.\n\nAt times, he has appeared uncomfortable with some of the administration\u2019s moves: he reportedly feuded with Elon Musk in a Trump Cabinet meeting earlier this month, and was notably photographed in what one Rubio ally called a \u201ccouch slouch\u201d in the Oval Office as Trump and Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe optics have raised questions about Rubio\u2019s influence with Trump, according to people familiar with the State Department. Though Rubio was the first cabinet member confirmed\u2014 unanimously at that \u2014 his role has lacked some of the profile and portfolio traditionally enjoyed by previous secretaries of state. And there\u2019s a contingent of MAGA faithful still skeptical of his hawkish foreign policy views.\n\n\u201cI think he is frustrated,\u201d a senator still in touch with Rubio told CNN.\n\nWhile foreign diplomats have praised Rubio for his engagement, multiple sources familiar with Rubio and the job say he appears ill at ease by how the White House has minimized his role.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what he expected,\u201d said one person. \u201cWitkoff came out of the blue,\u201d they added. \u201cTrump loves him.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, only Rubio carries the full trappings of the secretary\u2019s office. While Witkoff often flies on his own Gulfstream private jet, Rubio is welcomed with pomp upon arrival in foreign countries, traveling with a large security detail and on the government\u2019s C-32 jumbo jet emblazoned with \u201cUnited States of America.\u201d\n\nAfter the story published on Friday, Rubio posted on X attacking CNN and saying Witkoff is \u201cone of the people I work with the CLOSEST on our team.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Witkoff said he had a \u201cwonderful working relationship\u201d with Rubio.\n\n\u201cHe is already a great Secretary of State and in my view will go down as one of the greatest,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cWhere the media gets these nonsense stories I will never know so I have now learned to dismiss them. Every single issue I am working on comes with the collaboration of Marco Rubio.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s allies in the administration argue he and Witkoff are complementing each other rather than dueling, and both the State Department and the White House pushed back on the notion that he is in any way being overshadowed by Witkoff.\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN. \u201cSecretary Rubio is a pivotal leader on President Trump\u2019s national security team having spearheaded a number of foreign policy initiatives, especially as it relates to negotiating a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine and driving policy in the Western Hemisphere. President Trump has amassed a talented team who are working around the clock to deliver results for Americans.\u201d\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement, \u201cYour premise is false. Secretary Rubio and Special Envoy Witkoff have a fantastic relationship, and are working together to advance President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, the president praised Rubio\u2019s work ethic, telling reporters unprompted in the Oval Office, \u201cHe\u2019s worked so hard. He\u2019s gone to so many different countries already.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic person \u2013 a great man,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think he has a chance to be our best secretary of state.\u201d\n\n\u2018Witkoff is a golf buddy\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s public reliance on Witkoff has already led to speculation in Washington about how long Rubio will want to stay in the job.\n\nOne longtime friend of Rubio\u2019s said he approached the job mindful of the revolving door of the first Trump administration, notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who lasted 13 months. Another person familiar with Rubio\u2019s thinking said he took the job to \u201cburnish his credentials\u201d and still has presidential ambitions that were not reached after his 2016 bid fell short to Trump.\n\nHe will view his role as a success if he serves for 18 months to two years, the friend added, which would allow him time to plan for a potential presidential run in 2028, should that opportunity present itself.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio listens as President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet Meeting at the White House on February 26, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nSources familiar with Rubio also point out there is a potential upside for him keeping some of the biggest foreign policy crises at arms\u2019 length, with major questions still looming about how Trump will navigate an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the broken ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\u201cI think Marco will find his groove and his niche,\u201d said a former Republican senator who worked with Rubio. \u201cIt probably won\u2019t be with the hot-button areas of the world \u2014 and he\u2019d probably be wise to leave that with the White House to deal with.\u201d\n\nRubio built a lengthy foreign policy resume in the Senate, serving as the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a long-term member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That experience helped him land on Trump\u2019s VP shortlist, even though he was ultimately passed over for Vance.\n\nRubio has already played a key role in several diplomatic efforts. He led a US delegation to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, where Ukraine accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposal, easing tensions with Kyiv after the Zelensky Oval Office blowup.\n\nFor some veteran diplomats back in Washington, it\u2019s been tough watching Rubio\u2019s first two months on the job \u2014 fighting cuts from Musk\u2019s DOGE and ceding some of the traditional diplomatic role of the secretary of state to one of Trump\u2019s New York real estate friends.\n\nWhile Rubio was tasked with soothing and reassuring America\u2019s closest allies during last week\u2019s formal G7 meeting in Quebec, Canada, Witkoff was headed to Moscow, for a one-on-one meeting with Putin.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio is a real foreign policy guy,\u201d said one former senior State Department official familiar with both Rubio and Witkoff. \u201cThe idea that Steve Witkoff is going to sit around with Putin in the Kremlin, I mean really. Come on, Witkoff is a golf buddy\u2026 it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u2018Rough times are for politicians\u2019\n\nThe G7 meeting last week in Canada was the first real chance for Rubio to explain directly to counterparts the vision of the Trump agenda, a senior US official close to Rubio told CNN, emphasizing that it \u201cisn\u2019t a passing fad\u201d but something that will \u201crequire everybody to adjust.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t make it easy for him.\n\nJust as Rubio was sitting down for a long day of meetings with frustrated allies, Trump sent out a caps-filled social media post announcing a new 200% tariff on European alcohol, targeting some of the countries whose ministers were with Rubio at the G7 meeting.\n\nAs the assembled diplomats shared Trump\u2019s message with each other, they recognized the difficult position Rubio was in.\n\nHours later, Trump struck again, declaring from the Oval Office, \u201cCanada only works as a state.\u201d\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio, second from right, attends the G7 foreign ministers meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, on March 13. S\u00e9bastien St-Jean/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 51st state question dogged Rubio throughout his trip to Canada. He answered like a diplomat: \u201cThere\u2019s a disagreement between the president\u2019s position and the position of the Canadian government,\u201d Rubio told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a mystery coming in and it wasn\u2019t a topic of conversation, because that\u2019s not what the summit was about.\u201d\n\nBoth in public and private, Rubio and other G7 officials emphasized a need to ignore the Trump-fueled chaos and focus on what they could try to move forward, like a ceasefire in Ukraine, according to sources who requested anonymity.\n\nTo some foreign diplomats at the G7, the ease of working with Rubio behind closed doors contrasted with the difficulties of dealing with the temperamental Trump White House.\n\nHe\u2019s \u201ca very valuable interlocutor,\u201d one senior European official told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t feel this hostility\u201d that Trump expresses, the official added.\n\nIn the resort hotel that hosted the three-day G7 event, foreign officials privately expressed surprise and anger over Trump\u2019s actions, though they roundly praised Rubio for his professional diplomacy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a pure politician with a very good pedigree,\u201d said another senior European official who attended several of the G7 meetings with Rubio. \u201cRough times are for politicians.\u201d\n\nInternational officials said that behind closed doors, Rubio did not stray from his public praise of Trump and desire to enact Trump\u2019s agenda, however controversial.\n\n\u201cHe is a truly experienced diplomatic hand,\u201d said a third foreign official.\n\nSeveral officials did however raise the question of how much influence Rubio has on Trump.\n\nFollowing the G7, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy flew to Washington where he met with Vance on Sunday, despite having just seen Rubio, his counterpart, in Canada.\n\nThe view from Foggy Bottom\n\nInside the State Department, Rubio is getting mixed reviews.\n\nThere have been scores of retirements of diplomats, sources told CNN, far more than in previous years. And because of the government-wide hiring freeze, the Department has stopped offering the foreign service exam and rescinded offers for an April entry-level class of foreign service officers.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio shakes hands with Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez during a tour at the Miraflores locks of the Panama Canal in Panama City on February 2. March Schiefelbein/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time, it seems that Rubio has been able to push back against some of DOGE\u2019s biggest cuts, two foreign service officers said, noting that there has not yet been a widespread firing of State Department personnel.\n\nAlthough they do expect potentially \u201cmassive\u201d reductions, \u201cthe effort to protect us from the most immediate and most sort of extreme cuts were good,\u201d one of the foreign service officers said.\n\nStill, this person said they were disappointed Rubio hadn\u2019t been more of a moderating influence.\n\n\u201cThe earliest signals were that there was going to be kind of a fight between the Rubio people and the Trump people. Rubio does not seem like he is interested or capable in fighting back on policy issues,\u201d the officer said, pointing to \u201cthe utter abandonment of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable what he has done to Ukraine,\u201d the person added.\n\n\u2018Up until 3am\u2019\n\nAnother challenge Rubio has faced is Trump\u2019s sweeping suspension of foreign aid. He is now in charge of a dismantled USAID, whose mission he long supported as a senator.\n\nRubio has spent long hours trying to work through lists of waiver requests for critical programs, according to the senator who\u2019s stayed in touch with Rubio.\n\n\u201cI talked to him a couple weeks in, when all the first USAID things were happening, and he said he\u2019d been up until 3 am trying to go through waivers,\u201d the senator said.\n\n\u201cHe expressed concern about waivers for programs that are important for humanitarian reasons in terms of our national security, but that has not translated into having those programs turned back on by a large degree,\u201d the senator added.\n\nIn the end, however, it was Rubio himself who sent the memo putting in place the foreign aid freeze with waivers only for life-saving programs.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThey quit the United States for Spain in 2022, and Laura Hamlin and her husband Allan Amer describe the experience as like leaving a \u201cbad relationship.\u201d\n\nAccording to Laura, originally from New York, struggled to feel at home after moving from New Jersey to Florida in 2012, and the \u201cdivisive\u201d political environment was wearing her down.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for America to feel like it used to feel,\u201d Laura, who previously worked in real estate, tells CNN Travel, adding that it felt like \u201cleaving a relationship that you knew was a bad one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want what you had in the beginning. And it\u2019s just not there.\u201d\n\nPolitical tensions\n\nThe couple say they didn't feel comfortable living in Florida due to the \"divisive\" political environment. Laura Hamlin\n\nLaura and Allan, who\u2019ve been together for 27 years, eventually decided to spend a few years traveling around in a campervan before moving to Spain.\n\nHowever, things have been far from smooth sailing since then. In fact, the couple were forced to return to the US just six months in, after an unfortunate accident.\n\n\u201cLife has been a roller coaster in pain and pleasure,\u201d says Laura.\n\nReflecting on their decision to leave Florida, Laura explains that they felt uneasy in the Sunshine State due to the political climate.\n\n\u201cPeople were very opinionated and political and holding nasty signs\u2026\u201d she says, before explaining that they moved around, but didn\u2019t feel welcome anywhere.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like we couldn\u2019t find a place that felt like home\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel comfortable there anymore.\u201d\n\nAccording to Laura and Allan, they chose Spain because it was a country that they\u2019d visited on several occasions and \u201cstayed longer each time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the Spanish politics is crazy because we don\u2019t speak the language well enough,\u201d jokes Allan. \u201cBut we do know that the US is crazy. Laura wanted to escape more. I just wanted to travel.\u201d\n\nBut before embarking on a new life in Spain, the couple decided to go on a road trip together.\n\n\u201cI looked at Laura and said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to live anywhere for 12 months,\u2019\u201d says Allan.\n\nLaura adds that she\u2019d spent a lot of time traveling while working in the military during her younger years, and never lost the \u201cwandering bug.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am married to Laura the Explorer,\u201d adds Allan.\n\nAfter selling their three properties, which included two rentals, they set off on a road trip to Idaho, traveling through Minneapolis and Colorado.\n\n\u201cSome definitely looked at us as if we had lost our minds,\u201d Laura recounts.\n\nBefore leaving Florida, they began the process of applying for a non-lucrative visa, which allows non-EU nationals to live in Spain without working as long as they can prove that they have enough money to support themselves.\n\n\u201cIt was tedious,\u201d Laura says. \u201cIt did take three months. We had to hang around in the United States waiting for it (the visa) to come through.\u201d\n\nWhen their visas were finally approved in December 2022, the couple, who were in Germany at the time, flew home on the \u201cmost expensive flight ever on Aer Lingus to Florida\u201d to deal with the paperwork before heading to Spain to begin their new lives.\n\n\u201cWe arrived on December 22,\u201d says Laura. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t spend Christmas with our families.\n\n\u201cBut by that point, after hopping around waiting for our visa approval, they were ready for us to go.\u201d\n\nNew beginning\n\nLaura and Allan suffered a major setback six months into their time in Spain, when Allan was injured during a fall at a grocery store. Laura Hamlin\n\nThe couple took to life in Spain quickly, and were thrilled to finally be living out their dream.\n\n\u201cOur first few months were exciting,\u201d says Laura. \u201cI had to pinch myself. I couldn\u2019t believe we really did it.\u201d\n\nOnce they\u2019d gotten settled, Laura and Allan made a point of traveling to as many parts of the country as they could.\n\n\u201cWe would do day trips, and we would do weekend trips,\u201d says Allan. \u201cWe went to Granada, we went to Cordoba. We went to Toledo\u2026 We stormed a lot of castles.\u201d\n\nLaura points out that she\u2019s fascinated by Spanish history and loves being able to explore the country\u2019s many historical monuments.\n\n\u201cBeing an American, we\u2019re kind of babies at that,\u201d she adds.\n\nLaura and Allan were having the time of their lives until things took a disastrous turn when Allan tripped in a grocery store, suffering kidney damage and six broken ribs, around four months after they arrived.\n\nAlthough they\u2019d paid for private Spanish medical insurance for a year in advance in accordance with the requirements of their visa, they learned that they weren\u2019t actually covered yet.\n\n\u201cThere is a stipulation that you cannot use it within six or eight months of being in the country,\u201d explains Laura. \u201cThey dropped us and refused to pay for Allan.\u201d\n\nAs a result, they ended spending a chunk of their savings on Allan\u2019s four-week stint in a Spanish hospital.\n\n\u201cI regret that we didn\u2019t read the small print,\u201d Laura adds.\n\nDuring this time, Allan lost a huge amount of weight and was unable to walk.\n\n\u201cAfter enjoying the Spanish hospitals, and no insurance, I decided I better get back to the US,\u201d he adds.\n\nSo just six months after moving to Spain, Laura and Allan were on their way back to the US \u2014 Laura hired a private nurse to help take care of her ailing husband during the journey.\n\n\u201cWe rented a house near my daughter in Spring Hill (north central Florida) and he recuperated there,\u201d she says.\n\nOnce Allan was back on his feet, they hit the road in their campervan once again, traveling to Montana and Glacier National Park.\n\nWhile Laura and Allan intended to go back to Spain as soon as possible, their return was delayed due to various health setbacks.\n\n\u201cSince 2019, I\u2019ve had problems \u2014 feet, neck,\u201d says Allan. \u201cAnd my back, my accidents. So it\u2019s been hard for her (Laura). She\u2019s my angel.\u201d\n\nAlthough they almost gave up on the idea, the couple ultimately decided to try again.\n\n\u201cWe were in assisted living for two months, having moved our stored furniture in, thinking we would stay there,\u201d says Laura. \u201cBut Allan bounced back remarkably.\u201d\n\nLaura and Allan returned to Spain in November 2023, arriving in just enough time to fulfill the amount of time allowed out of the country as part of their visa requirements.\n\n\u201cWe just made it,\u201d says Laura. \u201cThis time around is much better.\u201d\n\nLaura and Allan have been happily living near Cartagena, located in the Murcia region of southeast Spain, since then and plan to remain there for the foreseeable future.\n\nThey say they love the Spanish way of life, as well as the \u201ctravel and the cheap wine.\u201d\n\nAlthough Laura and Allan admit that the Spanish schedule, which sees some businesses close for siesta in the afternoons, was \u201cfrustrating in the beginning,\u201d they stress that they\u2019re \u201cnot bothered by it\u201d now.\n\n\u201cEven in the US, around three o\u2019clock, I would be taking my nap after exercising,\u201d says Allan, before explaining that he\u2019d often go for a morning swim while living in a condo association with a pool in Florida.\n\n\u201cBy three o\u2019clock, I\u2019d be exhausted and I\u2019d be sleeping. So siesting here fits my lifestyle perfectly.\u201d\n\nLaura notes that they sometimes find themselves looking at the clock in the afternoon and realizing that the banks are about to close.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Forget it. We\u2019ll do it tomorrow,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one aspect of life in Spain that they\u2019ve always struggled with \u2014 learning the language.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe couple returned to Spain in 2023 and say that things are going very well so far. Laura Hamlin\n\nLaura and Allan are taking online Spanish classes and using apps \u2014 \u201cthe one with the owl.\u201d\n\nHowever, they confess that their Spanish still leaves much to be desired, and their attempts at attending in person classes haven\u2019t gone so well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s free Spanglish classes at the library every Friday,\u201d says Laura. \u201cWe went to three, but we\u2019re Googling because we don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, the woman that leads the class said, \u2018You don\u2019t know enough Spanish to be here. Just come back when you know more Spanish.\u2019\u201d\n\nMedical insurance was also an issue for the pair in the beginning, particularly due to Allan\u2019s health issues.\n\n\u201cWe overpaid for private insurance because we had to have it, and there\u2019s so many limitations for me,\u201d says Allan.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the coverage, there were four paragraphs of what they cover and four pages of what I\u2019m excluded from.\n\n\u201cNow luckily, I qualify for the Spanish system.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s universal healthcare system, known as the SNS or Sistema Nacional de Salud, is available to residents of the country.\n\n\u201cWhen I go to my local doctor here, he takes his computer, puts his Google Translate up, and we have a fine conversation,\u201d adds Allan.\n\nLaura and Allan have made numerous friends, mainly from the United Kingdom, during their time in the country and say that their social life is actually better now than it was in Florida.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a social butterfly. I hate people,\u201d jokes Allan.\n\nFor the couple, one of the biggest differences they\u2019ve noticed about Spain is that \u201ceverything is smaller, including grocery stores.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also healthier,\u201d says Laura. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have so many processed things to choose from.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a whole aisle of sugar cereals\u2026 There\u2019s certain things that I can\u2019t find, but it\u2019s not a big deal.

Laura Hamlin\n\nLaura and Allan find Spain to be far more affordable than the US, pointing out that they always notice the increase when they return for visits to see their families \u2013 both have children from previous marriages.\n\n\u201cI know that it\u2019s sticker shock when we go home to visit and go in the grocery store\u2026\u201d says Laura.\n\n\u201cI know my family back there, my friends are all worried about it and complaining about the cost of living right now.\n\n\u201cThe cost of housing has escalated tremendously there. So we\u2019re glad to have a more affordable, simple life here.\u201d\n\nThey pay 550 euros a month for their three-bedroom apartment, which has a view of the mountains.\n\n\u201cWe love our landlady,\u201d adds Laura.\n\nWhile things certainly haven\u2019t always gone to plan since their big move, Laura and Allan try to have a relaxed approach, taking any setbacks in their stride for the most part.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there\u2019ll be learning curves and there\u2019ll be problems,\u201d says Allan. \u201cAnd when we take trips, it\u2019s never uneventful.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something that comes up that we have to figure out and deal with, whether it be the SIM card or phone.\u201d\n\nLaura admits that they struggle with the \u201cbureaucracy of things\u201d at times, but notes that she tends to get more nervous \u201cbecause I don\u2019t speak the language.\u201d\n\nThe couple are currently in the process of renewing their non-lucrative visa, which will allow them to remain in Spain for a further two years.\n\nWhen asked if they\u2019d ever return to the US, Laura stresses that she doesn\u2019t envision herself returning to Florida, as she was never happy there.\n\n\u201cIt might have been different if we would have lived in a different area or state,\u201d she concedes, explaining that she enjoyed living in Buffalo, New York. \u201cMy family is still in that area, and I still have friends there.\u201d\n\nHowever, they\u2019ve discussed potentially heading back to Buffalo if Allan\u2019s health were to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cIf it got to the point where he needed to be taken care of \u2013 which I don\u2019t see happening at all, because he\u2019s exercising now and getting much better,\u201d says Laura.\n\n\u201cBut he does sometimes have difficulty walking long distances and stuff like that\u2026 So if he needed care, we\u2019d probably go back.\u201d\n\nWhile she\u2019s hopeful that this won\u2019t be necessary, Laura is keeping an open mind.\n\n\u201cIf someone would have told me I\u2019d be living in Spain six years ago, I would have said they were crazy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you never know what life has in store\u2026 I never say never anymore.\u201d\n\nAs for Allan, he\u2019s happy living anywhere provided his beloved wife is by his side.\n\n\u201cWhile we love the country, I\u2019m very fortunate to have an angel,\u201d says Allan. \u201cI tell people that Laura is the key to my enjoying life no matter where we are.\u201d"

            "full_content": "A Salvadoran government photo of inmates allegedly linked to criminal organizations at CECOT on March 16. Photo: Salvadoran Government/Getty Images/Salvadoran Government via Getty\n\nWhen President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador eagerly volunteered to receive 261 deportees the Trump administration had possibly illegally airlifted from the U.S. in mid-March, he instantly became one of the biggest stars in American conservative politics. After the planes landed, disgorging alleged members of Venezuelan and Salvadoran gangs, Bukele wallpapered his X profile with shout-outs from from Elon Musk, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, Jr., Matt Gaetz, U.S. Senators Mike Lee and Eric Schmitt, and Libs of TikTok, among others. \u201cThank you to El Salvador and, in particular, President Bukele,\u201d President Trump wrote on Truth Social. When Judge James Boasberg ordered the flights carrying the deportees to return home, Bukele posted, \u201cOopsie \u2026 Too late,\u201d followed by the \u201ctears of joy\u201d emoji.\n\nBukele\u2019s social-media blitz was arranged around a slickly produced three-minute video \u2014 basically an extended commercial for his regime. Over pulsing music straight out of a Sicario-style organized-crime thriller, the footage captures the dramatic nighttime arrival of the deportees at a Salvadoran airport. With guards gripping their hair and the backs of their necks, the men are perp-walked down a jetway amid a small army of security personnel in helmets and body armor, then escorted as part of a militarized convoy along jungle-lined highways and through the Olympian front gates of CECOT, the largest maximum-security prison in the world.\n\nOnce they are inside, it becomes apparent how brutal the conditions will be. The new prisoners are forced to kneel inside a massive processing hangar, then ordered to shout their names for the camera before guards shave their heads. They are changed into white uniforms and herded toward a series of 80-person cells, where they will be locked for 23 hours a day, with overhead lights that are never turned off. \u201cThe only furniture is tiered metal bunks with no sheets, pillows, or mattresses,\u201d CNN reported after a visit in February. The response from American conservatives to this Leni Riefenstahl\u2013style display of authoritarian theater was sheer delight. \u201cThis is exactly what I voted for!\u201d wrote Libs of TikTok. Schmitt described the prison as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\nIt was easy to mistake this episode for an example of a Central American leader expediting the inevitable, offering up his country as a dump site for Trump\u2019s deportees before the administration could resort to threats, as it has against Panama and Costa Rica. But that would underestimate how much of an aspirational figure Bukele is for American conservatives, many of whom yearn to implement his authoritarian transformation of El Salvador at home. In fact, in many ways, Bukele\u2019s El Salvador is already here.\n\nFor more than a week, Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder, has been held without charges for participating in pro-Palestine protests while he was a student at Columbia University and, in his only public statement, has described the Louisiana detention center where he was being held as a place where prisoners are \u201cprecluded from the protections of the law.\u201d Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen, was spirited to a series of ICE detention centers where the filthy cells were ice cold and the \u201cfluorescent lights shined on us 24/7,\u201d all because of an apparent visa mix-up. On March 17, masked ICE agents abducted a Georgetown University researcher named Badar Khan Suri, whom the Trump administration claims, without offering evidence, was \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda.\u201d All while the administration openly flouts orders from the judiciary, determining by fiat who is a terrorist or gang member and can therefore be deported and left to rot in a Central American prison. Legal scholars tell the New York Times that it is no longer a question of whether the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis \u2014 rather, whether Trump\u2019s contortion of the constitutional system will be permanent.\n\nIt is worth stressing that none of the hundreds of deportees now in Bukele\u2019s prisons appear to have undergone due process or been charged with any crime. One of them, Jerce Reyes Barrios, is a Venezuelan professional soccer player who was tortured by the Maduro regime in Venezuela, applied for asylum to the U.S., and has no criminal record in either country. This indiscriminate persecution is of a piece with Bukele\u2019s general approach to law and order that has endeared him to the global right. Since he took office in 2019, he has received credit for dramatically curbing his country\u2019s gang problem, especially homicides. Combined with his edgy appeal to young voters \u2014 he has called himself \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d \u2014 he has become the most popular leader in the Americas with a January approval rating of 83 percent, according to a Gallup poll. Bukele\u2019s methods include the mass suspension of civil liberties and the arrest of more than a full percent of El Salvador\u2019s population of 6.8 million \u2014 or more than 80,000 people, including children.\n\nWhen, in 2022, El Salvador\u2019s National Assembly declared a \u201cstate of exception\u201d that allows cops to arrest anyone they deem suspicious and imprison them without due process, it presaged Trump\u2019s invocation of obscure legal codes, like the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to grant himself sweeping powers to jail and deport any non-citizen he wants \u2014 even people who have not been convicted of crimes, from pro-Palestine protesters on college campuses to anyone he claims is a member of Tren de Aragua or MS-13. When Bukele replaced key Supreme Court magistrates with loyalists who would allow him to run for a second term as president, which was not allowed under El Salvador\u2019s Constitution, it anticipated Trump\u2019s defiance of the judiciary, his disregard for democratic processes, and his own musings about running for a third term.\n\nBut it was Bukele\u2019s 2023 opening of CECOT that truly captured the scale of his ambition and cemented his relationship with the American far right. In February, CNN reported that the 40,000-capacity facility, intended as a regional lockup, was open to receiving prisoners from as far away as the U.S. \u2014 a topic that Rubio had met with Bukele to discuss earlier that month. It took almost no time for that concept to reach fruition. \u201cThey were immediately transferred to CECOT,\u201d Bukele wrote on X on March 16 about the Trump deportees. \u201cThe United States will pay a very low fee for them.\u201d He explained that the financial sustainability of the prison, which reportedly costs $200 million a year to operate, will depend in part on payments like the $6 million that Trump is sending, thereby layering an economic incentive for Bukele to fill its beds.\n\nHe also has a political incentive: Once he ran out of gang members to jail, he started rounding up people with only tenuous connections to gang activity to keep his campaign going \u2014 which has ominous implications for Trump\u2019s tough-on-crime-and-immigration agenda back home.\n\nSome of these implications are evident in the work of Bukele\u2019s most ardent acolytes, the right-wing intellectual muses, like Richard Hanania and Christopher Rufo, who lay the conceptual groundwork for what often becomes Republican policy. In a 2023 Substack post, Hanania, a onetime regular on white-supremacist websites like VDare, argued that Bukele\u2019s draconian policies must be imposed on high-crime Black neighborhoods in the U.S. \u201cAs I argue in my articles on El Salvador, any polity that has a high enough murder rate needs to make solving crime its number one priority,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis was true for that nation before Bukele came along, as it is for major American cities today. It\u2019s not a big mystery how to do this, it\u2019s just politically difficult, because literally everything that works is considered racist.\u201d One of the data points he embedded was a screenshot of Elon Musk remarking on the mortal danger that Black people supposedly pose to white people.\n\nIn an X post promoting the article, Hanania stated plainly, \u201cWe need more policing, incarceration, and surveillance of black people. Blacks won\u2019t appreciate it, whites don\u2019t have the stomach for it.\u201d One of the lessons of Trump\u2019s infatuation with Bukele-ism is that, increasingly, they do.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

The wide-ranging legal action covers prize money, the rankings system and schedule, the investigative processes of the ITIA, and name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation, among other areas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some changes, but there are some fundamental changes that are still yet to be made and I really hope that all the governing bodies, including PTPA, will come together and solve these issues,\u201d 24-time grand slam singles champion Djokovic told reporters at the Miami Open on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is a classic lawsuit, so lawyers to lawyers type of situation. So to be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit, and then there are also things that I don\u2019t agree with.\u201d\n\nTwelve players \u2013 including PTPA co-founder Vasek Pospisil and 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios \u2013 are named as plaintiffs in the complaint filed in the US.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s name is not included on the complaint, and he said on Thursday that he has previously been \u201cvery active in tennis politics\u201d but didn\u2019t sign because he \u201cwant(s) other players to step up.\u201d\n\nThe world No. 5 added: \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan and supporter of division in our sport, but I\u2019ve always fought for better representation and influence of and positioning of the players globally in our sport, which I think is still not where it should be and where most of the players think it should be.\n\n\u201c(That\u2019s) not just in terms of prize money, but in terms of many other points that have been also stated in that document.\u201d\n\nIn a news release, the PTPA claimed that the sport\u2019s governing bodies exhibit a \u201cdisregard for players,\u201d which includes forcing them to compete in 100-degree Fahrenheit heat, in matches that finish at 3 a.m., and with different \u201cinjury-inducing\u201d tennis balls. It added that the 11-month-long season allows players little time to recover.\n\nThe PTPA also alleges that the tours \u201ccollude\u201d to cap prize money, prevent new competitors and tournaments from entering the market, impose a \u201cdraconian\u201d ranking points system, and award players no compensation from NIL rights.\n\nThe ATP and WTA both expressed their dissatisfaction with the lawsuits and said that they would defend their positions \u201cvigorously.\u201d The ITIA said that it is aware of the filings, while the ITF said that it would take time to consider an appropriate response.\n\nOn Wednesday, four-time grand slam champion Carlos Alcaraz said that he doesn\u2019t support the PTPA\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn\u2019t aware of it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t support that letter because I wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u201d\n\nDjokovic, winless in his past three singles matches, faces Australian Rinky Hijikata at the Miami Open on Friday, while Alcaraz plays Belgium\u2019s David Goffin."

            "full_content": "Photo: Bonnie Cash/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEvery single time the Trump administration loses a court ruling, count on this: It\u2019ll rail against the evils of a single, unelected district-court judge upending the president\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nThis week, a district judge in D.C. temporarily blocked President Trump\u2019s ban on transgender military troops. \u201cIndefensible judicial tyranny,\u201d White House adviser Stephen Miller responded on social media.\n\nAnother judge put a hold on the deportation of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act (or tried to; the Trump administration was less than fastidious in implementing his order). Trump called for the impeachment of this \u201cRadical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator,\u201d prompting a rare public rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nA string of federal judges paused the efforts of Elon Musk and DOGE to fire federal employees and dismantle government agencies. \u201cWhat is the point of having democratic elections if unelected activist \u2018judges\u2019 can override the clear will of the people? Well, that\u2019s no democracy at all!\u201d Musk asked himself and answered, recirculating a post invoking a \u201cJUDICIAL COUP.\u201d\n\nThe public rhetoric from Trump and his brass has become overwrought, and they seem to be dueling to out-emote one another. But when you strip away the histrionics, they\u2019re not wrong.\n\nThe argument against these \u201cnationwide injunctions\u201d has plenty of commonsense appeal. We have 700 or so presidentially nominated, Senate-confirmed (but unelected) federal district-court (trial-level) judges in all, divided among 94 geographic districts. Why should any one of those judges in, say, the Northern District of California or the Western District of Texas have the power to dictate policy across the entire country, contrary to the priorities of the duly elected president?\n\nTrump is hardly the first president to see his policy agenda stifled by nationwide injunctions \u2014 though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, and he\u2019s gotten it the worst. An April 2024 Harvard Law Review article calculated that federal judges issued six nationwide injunctions against the George W. Bush administration, 12 against the Obama administration (including its signature immigration programs), 14 against the Biden administration (including the student-loan-debt-forgiveness program), and \u2026 64 against the first Trump administration.\n\nOf those 64 original Trump-era injunctions, 59 came from judges appointed by Democrats. Before you start howling (or cheering), consider that all 14 Biden-era injunctions were issued by Republican-appointed judges. Indeed, one criticism of nationwide injunctions is that they encourage and reward judge-shopping. There\u2019s a reason why so many of the anti-Obama and anti-Biden injunctions came from the Northern and Western Districts of Texas, while liberal anti-Trump plaintiffs flock to the federal district courts in D.C., New York, and California.\n\nNow, during Trump\u2019s first two months back in office, district-court judges have already issued more than a dozen nationwide injunctions blocking his policy initiatives. He\u2019s on pace to shatter his own record.\n\nWe can read these stats either way. From one perspective, it looks like judges (almost all of them nominated by Democratic presidents) have engineered a successful judicial Trump resistance where actual elected Democrats have failed. Or the stats could simply reflect that Trump has tried to enact more unlawful policies than his contemporaries did. Could be both.\n\nThe conundrum is that nationwide injunctions are easy to criticize but hard to fix. What\u2019s the alternative? Impressive think pieces abound, often voicing the valid complaint that judges who issue nationwide injunctions effectively bind not only the actual parties to the lawsuit but also many outside non-parties, contrary to core tenets of judicial moderation and fairness.\n\nBut solutions are elusive. If each district court can reach its own independent ruling, binding only on the participants in that case, we would land in chaos.\n\nWhat if, for example, one district judge ordered a pause on the military transgender policy but another allowed the policy to be implemented? What if 11 judges across the country purported to block Trump\u2019s effort to withhold federal funding from USAID but nine others ruled to the contrary? It\u2019s unworkable.\n\nThere might be some way to get these cases up the appellate chain more quickly. That could help expedite resolution of interdistrict conflicts, but it doesn\u2019t fully solve the underlying problem of inconsistent application of law based on geography (and it would require a complicated fix that is plainly not imminent).\n\nThe good news is that we might soon get some guidance from the Supreme Court itself. The dispute over Trump\u2019s effort to end birthright citizenship has now reached the Court, at least in a procedural posture. The Trump administration has asked the Court to narrow a series of three district-court rulings that rejected his position and to hold that those decisions apply only within the geographic districts in which they were rendered (and do not, therefore, bind the entire country). \u201cUniversal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team argues.\n\nWe know how at least one of the nine justices feels. When Samuel Alito found himself on the short end of a recent ruling that effectively blocked the Trump administration\u2019s effort to withhold foreign-aid funding, he fumed in dissent: \u201cDoes a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? \u2026 I am stunned.\u201d\n\nThe birthright-citizenship case may provide us with meaningful answers, but it also neatly underscores the practical problems. Even if one agrees with the Trump administration\u2019s position, how exactly would this work? Children born to noncitizen parents in the Western District of Washington (where a Reagan-appointed judge temporarily halted Trump\u2019s birthright-citizenship initiative) are citizens \u2014 while those born in, say, the Eastern District of Louisiana are not?\n\nIt\u2019s become a default diversionary tactic to rail against nationwide injunctions. Don\u2019t like a ruling? Point to the dictatorial, unelected judge usurping the president\u2019s power. Tiptoe up to the line of open defiance of a court order? Blame some unelected, self-aggrandizing political wannabe in a black robe.\n\nBut when we cut through the hyperbole and the transparent scapegoating, Trump and his supporters are on to a legitimate complaint that has dogged presidents of both parties for decades."

            "full_content": "I grew up in middle-class America as the daughter of a teacher and a school psychologist, that is to parents who were lucky to receive a reasonable salary and excellent insurance and retirement benefits throughout their careers. They saved their money and helped put my sister and me through college and provided some support for me through medical school.\n\nThat\u2019s why I never knew that my parents weren\u2019t ready for retirement until it was obvious they weren\u2019t. The cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid. Even though my family\u2019s story is extremely common, the inability to pay mounting medical bills comes as a surprise to nearly all families, because few of us face the facts of aging until we have to.\n\nThe cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid.\n\nMy mom was the glue that held our family together and kept the household running. But when she started losing her memory around 60, running everything became Dad\u2019s responsibility, and he already had a myriad of his own health problems: diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure. My sister and I were fairly oblivious then to what was happening. I was busy working full time and raising children, and she lived halfway around the world. Like many aging parents, ours insisted that everything was OK, and they did a pretty good job covering up that it wasn\u2019t. But given the speed of Mom\u2019s memory decline and the severity of Dad\u2019s chronic illnesses, they couldn\u2019t cover things up long.\n\nThe author poses with her parents at her 2007 medical school graduation. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nThey needed more care than they could provide each other and more than home health care visits could provide. They began by transitioning to what\u2019s called \u201cindependent living\u201d for my dad and assisted living for my mom. Even though my parents enjoyed comfortable retirement pensions, Social Security and private insurance, their new living arrangement was barely financially feasible, and I was constantly worried about what would happen when they needed a higher level of care.\n\nThis all came to a head about two years later when exacerbations of chronic health problems landed my father in the ICU. His health deteriorated so much with this hospitalization that it became obvious that he could no longer live independently. In fact, he needed so much help that he needed full-time skilled nursing \u2014 a nursing home. And I soon realized that despite my being a physician, there was so much that I didn\u2019t know about nursing homes. I didn\u2019t realize, for example, that my parents\u2019 \u201cgood\u201d private insurance didn\u2019t cover nursing home care. But that\u2019s fine, I thought; Dad\u2019s old enough for Medicare. That\u2019s when I learned Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for nursing homes, either.\n\nThe private pay rate for the nursing home in his \u201clife community,\u201d I learned when I started investigating it, was $13,000 per month! I thought that surely was a mistake or that we had somehow chosen a particularly expensive place. But, no, in 2019 in greater Milwaukee, which has a relatively low cost of living, that price was about average. Some places cost slightly less, and some cost much more, but I, a physician, didn\u2019t find a single place we could afford. We were already paying almost $6,000 per month for my mom\u2019s assisted living. To pay for Dad\u2019s nursing home care on top of that would have cost $200,000 per year, more than my parents ever made when they worked full time. They certainly didn\u2019t have that kind of money saved.\n\nMy sister and I discussed one of us quitting our jobs but realized that even if one of us did, we couldn\u2019t provide Dad the skilled care he needed at home. And neither of us could quit our jobs and still pay all our bills. I, specifically, was in the middle of the classic sandwich generation dilemma. I had a toddler and a child in elementary school. I was trying to pay off medical school loans, pay for child care, pay the mortgage, save for my kids\u2019 college and my own retirement. Everything was untenable. We didn\u2019t understand how people managed these situations.\n\nThe author with her sister and her parents for Christmas 2013. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nAn amazing social worker helped me understand that most non-wealthy Americans spend down their savings and apply for Medicaid. I was floored. My parents were average Americans with decent pensions and modest savings. What need did they have for Medicaid when they had private insurance? How could skilled nursing care cost so much that most people who need it are priced out of it?! That\u2019s when I learned that Medicaid is how the majority of America receives skilled nursing care. At the time, 2019, Medicaid was the primary payer for 59% of nursing home care. As of July 2024, that proportion had risen to 63%.\n\nWhile enrolling my father was extremely complicated, I believe the process ensures that those who apply are truly eligible. What we learned is that almost all of my father\u2019s pension and Social Security benefits went to pay his nursing home. He got to keep $30 per month for personal items. Also, the Medicaid negotiated rate for the nursing home was much lower than the $13,000 a month I\u2019d been quoted. This arrangement was lifesaving for my father and will be lifesaving for my mother if she ever requires this level of care. The families of many elderly Americans may never imagine they\u2019ll need Medicaid \u2014 until they need it.\n\nRepublicans are proposing $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts in programs that fall under the purview of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A cut of that magnitude would almost certainly slash Medicaid. That would be disastrous for the hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans who live in nursing facilities. The Republicans supporting this bill most likely have or will have family members who depend on Medicaid.\n\nIt\u2019s wrong of Congress to take an ax to the floor of the boat keeping so many Americans afloat. Slashing Medicaid would be that kind of heartless move."

            "full_content": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 loss in the presidential race has given rise, again, to whispered worries in the Democratic Party about female candidates and electability \u2014 resurrecting a fraught conversation that bubbled for years after President Donald Trump\u2019s first victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe whisper campaign has started to some extent in New Jersey, where this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race will be one of Democrats\u2019 first big electoral tests since Trump won his second term.\n\nIn the Trump years, some Democratic voters and strategists have worried aloud about whether it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to back female candidates if there are male voters who wouldn\u2019t support them in general elections. It was a theme for parts of the Democratic presidential primaries in 2020, when the party was choosing a candidate to take on Trump.\n\nEven as some are once again questioning women's electability, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the only woman in the crowded New Jersey Democratic primary for governor, has been racking up support in large part because her backers believe she is best positioned to win in November. But Sherrill did acknowledge that broader questions about women\u2019s ability to win persist.\n\n\u201cI hear that from insiders,\u201d Sherrill said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd it\u2019s funny, that\u2019s always been kind of the case,\u201d she added, saying someone at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told her during her first run for the House in 2018 that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t think a woman could win in New Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018What? Watch me,\u2019\u201d Sherrill said. She flipped the longtime Republican seat, winning it by 15 percentage points.\n\nSherrill has touted her electoral wins, along with her background as a Navy helicopter pilot and a prosecutor, as she looks to succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who can\u2019t run for re-election because of term limits.\n\nSome Democrats in New Jersey are anxious about the race after the state shifted 10 points toward Trump in November, compared with 2020, and after Murphy won re-election four years ago by just 3 points. It has also been more than 60 years since the same party has won three consecutive terms for governor.\n\nAlthough Harris still carried New Jersey, her loss nationally has prompted some party officials and voters to raise questions about whether a woman can win this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race, according to four sources connected to New Jersey Democratic politics who described hearing those thoughts in conversations. (Several of Sherrill\u2019s supporters said they haven\u2019t heard those electability questions.)\n\n\u201cHonestly, I have heard: \u2018Ah, I don\u2019t know, maybe women aren\u2019t electable. Maybe there\u2019s an issue here,\u2019\u201d said an official who was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations, noting that the questions began after November and have persisted in the primary for governor.\n\nDemocratic strategist Julie Roginsky said, \"It\u2019s part of the same chatter that has always kept women from ascending in the Democratic Party in New Jersey.\u201d Roginsky, who isn\u2019t involved in the governor\u2019s race, said she has also heard party officials raise the electability questions.\n\n\"This is not a particularly feminist Democratic Party in New Jersey,\u201d Roginsky added later.\n\nMaking her case\n\nSherrill faces five other major candidates in the Democratic primary: Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, former state Senate President Steve Sweeney and former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller, who leads the state\u2019s teachers union.\n\nSherrill has already racked up endorsements from party leaders, and she has won several county party conventions, earning the backing of the local parties\u2019 rank-and-file members. (Fulop has declined to participate in conventions as he runs an anti-establishment campaign, while Gottheimer is skipping conventions where he believes \u201cthe fix is in,\u201d according to the New Jersey Globe.)\n\nSeveral supporters of Sherrill, a veteran of battleground House campaigns, said they are backing her because they view her as the strongest general election candidate.\n\nElectability was \u201cthe most important factor\u201d for Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo Jr.\n\n\u201cI think she is our strongest candidate to win the primary and also the general, which I\u2019m very much concerned about,\u201d DiVincenzo said, noting that former state Assemblyman Jack Ciatarelli is running for governor again after having almost defeated Murphy in 2021.\n\nDiVincenzo and other Sherrill allies pointed to her win in the 11th District in northern New Jersey in 2018 as proof that she can win tough races. GOP Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a scion of a political family who chaired the powerful House Appropriations Committee, had represented the seat for more than two decades before Sherrill launched her campaign. Frelinghuysen announced his retirement several months later.\n\nSherrill went on to defeat GOP Assemblyman Jay Weber, flipping a district Trump had narrowly won in 2016. Sherrill said that in that race and subsequent campaigns she has won over Republicans and independents and built broad coalitions of progressives, union members and disillusioned voters.\n\n\u201cThrough building that huge coalition, I was able to win with the largest red-to-blue swing in the entire nation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that speaks to what I\u2019ve been able to do, who I\u2019ve been able to turn out, the coalitions I\u2019ve been building. I think that is something that people are taking into account as they think about this primary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf this field has never even run against a real Republican challenger,\u201d Sherrill also said, appearing to refer to Fulop\u2019s, Baraka\u2019s and Spiller\u2019s mayoral races.\n\nSweeney defeated a Democrat-turned-Republican incumbent for the state Senate in 2001, but he lost re-election 20 years later to underfunded Republican truck driver Ed Durr, who is also running for governor this year.\n\nGottheimer does have experience winning in Republican territory, having defeated GOP Rep. Scott Garrett in 2016 in his 5th District even as Trump narrowly carried the seat.\n\nBut Sherrill\u2019s allies believe her victories stand out.\n\nEMILY\u2019s List, which backs female candidates who support abortion rights and has endorsed Sherrill, detailed in a memo this month how Sherrill has earned more votes than her New Jersey Democratic colleagues and run ahead of candidates for higher office.\n\n\u201cIn any crowded primary, it\u2019s really important to show that strength,\u201d said EMILY\u2019s List President Jessica Mackler, who said questions about electability typically come from \u201cpundits and the media.\u201d\n\nSherrill believes her record in office will also win over primary voters, even as \u201cinsiders\u201d question female candidates\u2019 electability.\n\n\u201cI certainly think that insiders are always making these calculations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I think what people on the ground, what voters, care about is: Are you somebody that they trust? Are you somebody that can really deliver for them?\u201d Sherrill said before she referred to a designation she received from the Center for Effective Lawmaking. \u201cAnd after being named the most effective lawmaker in the New Jersey House delegation after only my second term in Congress, I think people see that I deliver.\u201d\n\nStill an \u2018all-boys club\u2019?\n\nSome New Jersey Democrats say the electability doubts following Harris\u2019 loss underscore a broader challenge for female candidates in the state.\n\nDemocrats have nominated a woman for governor only once, backing then-state Senate Sen. Barbara Buono to take on GOP Gov. Chris Christie in 2013. (New Jersey has had one female governor, Republican Christie Whitman, who served from 1994 to 2001.)\n\n\u201cWe knew they weren\u2019t going to let us into the all-boys club, so we just decided we\u2019ve got to kick in the door,\u201d Buono said after her bruising loss to Christie.\n\nLeslie Huhn, a former Sussex County Democratic Committee chairwoman, said that there has been more support for women in the years since then but that \u201cthere\u2019s still more work to be done in this area, no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nHuhn, who runs the grassroots group Door to Door Democracy, which is backing Sherrill, has also heard electability questions from party insiders, but not from the grassroots. But Huhn isn\u2019t concerned that the \u201call-boys club\u201d will be an obstacle for Sherrill, saying plenty of men are also drawn to Sherrill\u2019s military background.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not worried that she\u2019s not tough, because they know she\u2019s tough. They know she\u2019s strong,\u201d said Huhn, who also said Sherrill has a unique ability to also be \u201cwarm and relatable.\u201d\n\nSherrill is ready for a fight.\n\n\u201cWorking in the military or working in New Jersey politics, these are some intense people, and they\u2019re not afraid to throw punches here,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cThe lessons you learn are just taking it on. Don\u2019t shrink from it; don\u2019t back away. If somebody wants to test you, meet the test and engage.\u201d\n\nBut does Sherrill still see the state as the \u201call-boys club\u201d that Buono described?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing. ... It is really rough and tumble. But I guess, I\u2019ve been through a POW training camp in the Navy. I\u2019m used to rough and tumble,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Downers Grove, Illinois CNN \u2014\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have faced eruptions of anger at town hall meetings across the country this week, as constituents have coupled their fury over President Donald Trump\u2019s actions with deep frustration over what they see as a feckless Democratic response.\n\nArizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego were told to \u201cfight dirtier\u201d and \u201cget in the mud\u201d with Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority,\u201d a man told Maryland Rep. Glenn Ivey.\n\n\u201cThey should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party,\u201d an attendee groused to CNN at a town hall held by Illinois Rep. Sean Casten.\n\nThe sharp criticism from voters comes as Democrats are out of power across all levels of the federal government and lacking a clear leader, exposing deep divisions along ideological and tactical lines over the party\u2019s direction. The schism emerging within the party on the heels of a contentious government funding fight has prevented the caucus from uniting behind a single strategy to counter Trump and attempt to make political inroads ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThe tension between Democratic lawmakers and their voters spilled into public view days after the Republican-led House and Senate narrowly averted a shutdown by approving a short-term government spending measure \u2014 with the help of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others in his caucus who cleared a pathway for the bill.\n\nEager to avoid embarrassment as Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk slash federal spending and remake the federal government, Republican leaders told the party\u2019s House members not to hold town hall meetings during this week\u2019s congressional recess.\n\nMost Republicans heeded those calls. Those who didn\u2019t \u2014 Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood and Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman, among them \u2014 faced heckling and pointed questions, including some from Republican voters, at their events.\n\nFlood was asked how he \u201cpersonally stomachs\u201d limiting funding for medical research after his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nCarol Moseman, a Republican who voted for Flood, told CNN she doesn\u2019t want Congress to give up its role as a check on the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI want to hear that he and other Republicans are going to stand up for democracy that they\u2019re not going to let Mr. Trump take over using executive powers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe voted for Congress to enact laws, and that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nHageman faced concerns in her deep-red district over federal spending cuts and frozen grants. Kindergarten teacher Tomi Sue Wille said she supports Trump\u2019s push to dismantle the Department of Education but worries that crucial federal funding for special needs children won\u2019t reach her students.\n\n\u201cI do believe that Congress needs to take some control in making sure how that funding is still distributed to the states,\u201d Wille told CNN.\n\nAt another town hall, a voter who identified herself as a retired military officer and Republican, pressed Hageman on allegations of fraud in the government in a tense exchange.\n\n\u201cYou are a lawyer, where is this fraud?\u201d the voter asked Hageman, according to CSPAN video of the town hall. The voter added: \u201cWhat company, what organization, what personnel are we going after?\u201d\n\nHageman pointed to spending by the US Agency for International Development \u2013 which the Trump administration and DOGE are attempting to dismantle \u2013 as the fraud. \u201cThis is what it is. This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud, spending is the fraud,\u201d Hageman asserted, to the dissatisfaction of the constituent and other attendees, who repeatedly interrupted her as she attempted to cite numbers.\n\nA federal worker and Republican in Wyoming, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, said GOP rhetoric about federal employees has been a let-down \u2014 including Musk\u2019s \u201cfork in the road\u201d email offering months of severance pay, which the worker described as \u201ca little off-putting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re all parasites\u201d the federal worker told CNN. \u201cI try not to take it too personally. I know what I do. I know how committed I am.\u201d\n\nGoing into the week, Democrats took most Republicans retreating from public view as an invitation to meet with their constituents and drive a forceful argument about how Republicans\u2019 government funding plan would slash spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nBut the anger that greeted Democrats at their own town halls left them returning to Washington next week without appearing to have gained great political momentum during their time at home \u2013 instead offering a vivid window into the party\u2019s struggles during the first two months of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low of just 29%, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month found \u2014 an outcome fueled in part by dimming views from its own frustrated supporters.\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-aligned independents say, 57% to 42%, that the party should mainly work to stop the Republican agenda, rather than working with the GOP majority to get some Democratic ideas into legislation.\n\nBranding it a \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has aimed to galvanize those looking for some form of political action with rallies across the country. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow progressive, joined the swing through competitive Western states Thursday \u2013 but, underscoring the party\u2019s divide, that answer to Democratic voters\u2019 demands for action drew public criticism from some corners of the party.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, at an event in Las Vegas, Nevada, said Trump has \u201chanded the keys to Elon Musk and is selling this country for parts to the richest people on the planet for a kickback.\u201d But she also had sharp words for her own party.\n\n\u201cWe need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cBut what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\u201d\n\n\u2018What is the plan?\u2019\n\nAt the town hall meetings, attendees who voted for Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election, said they felt let down by the party\u2019s failure to show it\u2019s up to the task of matching their furor and responding with force.\n\nIn Scottsdale, Arizona, when Kelly and Gallego argued at a joint event Monday that there was a path to convince Republicans to preserve Medicaid, Jacie Czerwinski had heard enough.\n\n\u201cWhen are they going to take the gloves off and actually do something,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cThey\u2019re preaching to the choir.\u201d\n\nCzerwinski, a Democrat who owns a rock-climbing gym in the area, had called Kelly\u2019s office multiple times since the start of the Trump administration. And when Kelly told the audience to leave voicemails to senators as a way to make their voices heard, she shouted: \u201cYours is full!\u201d\n\nThe swing state\u2019s two Democratic senators ducked an attendee\u2019s shouted question about whether they support removing Schumer from his leadership post after his public support for the spending measure last week. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on this right now,\u201d Gallego said, noting the town hall was billed as one focused on what Democrats characterize as a Republican push to cut Medicaid spending.\n\nQuianna Brown, who said her 10-year-old daughter\u2019s Medicaid coverage is at risk now that she is no longer in the foster system, pushed back on the senators who described cuts to Medicaid as yet to be determined.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do? We feel incredibly powerless trying to plan for our family. We can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s done. We need to know how to prepare what may come down the hatch. We are trying to shield ourselves before we\u2019re wounded, and we don\u2019t know how,\u201d Brown said.\n\nKelly described Brown\u2019s story as \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d and asked for her name in order to share it with Republicans in Washington. Gallego said Democrats \u201cwould all love to be able to snap our fingers right now and have that solution, but it\u2019s not going to happen that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to fight them down. We have to grind them to the point where they give up on this fight. Because if you give an inch, they will take it all,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the event, Brown told CNN she appreciated the senators hearing her out but wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cI wanted more. I think as a parent at any time when you feel that you can\u2019t protect your kid, you want a game plan. Like what is the plan?\u201d she said.\n\nThe senators, she told CNN following the event, were being \u201ctoo business as usual.\u201d\n\nJefri Knazan, who had taught in Canada but returned to the United States for family reasons and is currently on Medicaid, was so frustrated by how the senators answered Brown that she changed her question to push them to \u201cbe straight with us\u201d on how to take the fight \u201cto the next level.\u201d\n\nMultiple attendees took their blunt assessments even further in conversations with CNN, saying the party lacks a clear leader and an effective message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think showing up with hand fans at a speech does much,\u201d said retired Navy veteran Tom Dyson, referring to signs Democratic lawmakers held up during Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month. \u201cI think you have to take action. I think you have to speak out.\u201d\n\nFor retiree Donald Bandy, frustration with the Democratic Party is an \u201cunderstatement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t seem to be organized. We don\u2019t have a coalition. We don\u2019t have any power. Republicans control everything and everyone\u2019s afraid of Trump. It\u2019s what he says goes,\u201d Bandy said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'You are not fighting!': Voters demand answers at Democratic lawmaker town hall 01:11 - Source: CNN 'You are not fighting!': Voters demand answers at Democratic lawmaker town hall 01:11\n\n\u2018We need you to be less polite\u2019\n\nAt a town hall for Ivey, the second-term Democratic congressman, held in Forestville, Maryland, attendees lambasted the role Democrats, particularly Schumer, played in helping congressional Republicans approve the continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThe message that was sent by Democrats in Congress with the CR catastrophe was clear,\u201d a man who identified himself as John told Ivey. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you are in the minority, it\u2019s that you aren\u2019t even working together on a shared strategy. And that is failure.\u201d\n\nIvey listened as the man continued, raising his voice.\n\n\u201cWe are not interested in hearing that you are in the minority \u2013 we know that!\u201d John yelled into the mic. \u201cWe want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority. We want you to show fight and you are not fighting!\u201d\n\nAnother constituent, Donya Williams, complained Ivey didn\u2019t know the people in his district well enough \u2014 because he admitted earlier that he didn\u2019t know who popular podcaster Joe Rogan was until the middle of the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about a podcast, and as a Democratic (lawmaker) who\u2019s representing all of these people, you don\u2019t know how to reach them,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo therefore, you don\u2019t know us.\u201d\n\nIvey countered that he and other members of Congress are trying to do more to connect with younger voters on social media. \u201cThe key is to make sure that we turn to each other and not on each other in doing the outreach,\u201d he said.\n\nIvey kept his composure throughout the evening, drawing a compliment from one woman. But then she, too, turned critical: \u201cWe need you to be less polite.\u201d\n\n\u2018Be the opposition party\u2019\n\nIn the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove, attendees at Casten\u2019s town hall Wednesday night were largely complimentary of the congressman\u2019s opposition to Trump. But, they told CNN before the town hall got underway, they were furious with Sen. Dick Durbin\u2019s vote to advance the spending measure last week.\n\n\u201cDick Durbin needs to be primaried in two years,\u201d said Ben Holinga, a 43-year-old salesman and Democratic voter from nearby Willowbrook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very upset with how Democrats in the Senate handled the continuing resolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party.\u201d\n\nRick Lunt, a 68-year-old retiree and Democratic voter from Palos Hills, said he is happy with Casten and \u201cwanted to be here to show him support.\u201d But he said he\u2019d like to see Democrats take more measures to show their opposition to Trump, even if they are purely symbolic.\n\nDemocrats could, he said, \u201cpropose a resolution of impeachment or something\u201d to remove Trump from office \u2013 acknowledging that \u201csometimes just a symbolic effort, movement on that part, is enough to inspire the rest of us.\u201d\n\nCasten\u2019s town hall was repeatedly interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters \u2014 with one protester who declined to share his name with CNN climbing on stage and refusing to leave.\n\nChants of \u201cCasten\u201d and \u201cleave, leave, leave\u201d rang through the room as some sought to drown out the protests, but after more than 45 minutes of interruptions, local police asked the congressman to end his event.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of what you\u2019re doing is that the good people in this room are going to decide not to come to town halls anymore,\u201d Casten told protesters, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not productive.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy and Danny Freeman contributed to this report."

But they also had some strong words for their own party.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told the fired-up crowd gathered at the Craig Ranch Amphitheater to see her and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \u201cBut what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\u201d\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez did not mention any Democratic leaders by name, the crowd broke out into multiple \u201cPrimary Chuck\u201d chants \u2014 a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who backed down from a funding fight with Trump last week. The move enraged the base and prompted some of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s House colleagues to encourage her to mount a primary challenge to Schumer, her fellow New Yorker, in 2028.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., greet the crowd during a rally at Craig Ranch Regional Park in North Las Vegas on Thursday. K.M. Cannon / Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNS via Getty Images\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Sanders \u2014 stars on the left who are channeling a fighting spirit at a time when Democrats say that\u2019s what they want to see more of \u2014 are looking to turn the party\u2019s anger into action and mobilize voters in the fight against Trump and his MAGA movement.\n\n\u201cI think unfortunately, the conservatives are playing a really good game of chess, and now it\u2019s time for the Dems to go ahead and step up to the plate and figure out how we\u2019re going to go ahead and take our democracy back,\u201d said Samantha Petras, a resident of Phoenix who attended the pair's second event of the day, in Tempe, Ariz.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez made a direct appeal Thursday to working-class voters \u2014 a populist message they hope will particularly resonate in a battleground state like Nevada, which is home to one of the largest hospitality workers unions in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have two very different Americas. In one of those Americas, the wealthiest people have never, ever, in the history of our country, had it so good. People on top are doing extraordinarily well today,\u201d Sanders said, prompting boos from the crowd. \u201cWe have more income and wealth inequality in our country than we have ever had.\u201d\n\nDemocrats plan to hold nearly 30 town hall events this week, while Republican lawmakers continue to largely stay away from in-person constituent events because of voter backlash over Trump and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s sweeping cuts to the federal government. Democratic lawmakers, though, are also hearing an earful from constituents who want their elected officials to stand up to Trump more aggressively.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez expect more than 51,000 people to turn out for their events this week, which will also include stops in Denver and Greeley, Colo., and Tucson, according to Sanders\u2019 office. Sanders, 83, launched his \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour last month with a pair of events in Iowa and Nebraska in a bid to target Republican voters dissatisfied with Trump and Musk.\n\nSanders planned the events in districts narrowly won by Republicans in 2024 to pressure lawmakers to vote against any cuts to entitlement programs, housing, nutrition or education, his office said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez acknowledged that not everyone in the crowd may agree with all of her politics or may not have even voted in the last election, but she encouraged the crowd to unite around an agenda that puts working-class voters first.\n\n\u201cWe might all come from different places, but we share a lot of the same experiences. So to all those who came here today unsure of whether or not this is where you belong, I want to say that you do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do, no matter who you voted for, no matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender, identity or status, no matter, even, if you disagree with me on a bunch of things. But if you are willing to fight for someone you don\u2019t know, you are welcome here, regardless of who they are, how they identify or where they come from \u2014 you are welcome here.\u201d\n\nEven as Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders tried to broaden their appeal beyond the typical base, plenty of criticism was aimed squarely at Trump.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept an authoritarian form of society with a president who undermines the Constitution every day and is working aggressively to take away our freedom of speech and freedom of assembly,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNo, we will not accept the society of massive economic inequalities where the very rich are becoming much richer while working families across the country struggle to put food on the table.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Party is struggling to find its footing amid historically low approval numbers and a voter base that wants its leaders to put up a fight against Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Democrats say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if it risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, compared with 32% who want them to make legislative compromises with Trump, according to NBC News\u2019 most recent poll.\n\nThe polling mirrors backlash Democratic lawmakers have received at their own town hall events, where voters this week complained about the party\u2019s \u201cpassive\u201d response to Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, empowerment of Musk and cuts to the federal workforce.\n\nThe frustration among Democratic voters and lawmakers alike intensified last week after Schumer led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, even as House Democrats warned the measure would codify spending cuts Trump pushed for.\n\nOcasio-Cortez skewered Schumer last week for his support of the Republican-led funding measure, calling it a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and suggesting it could weaken the \u201ctrust\u201d between House and Senate Democrats.\n\nDemocratic voters, too, said they were dismayed by Schumer's approach.\n\n\u201cWe should have shut the government down,\u201d 55-year-old Marc Borzcon of Chandler, Ariz. said on Thursday at the event in Tempe. \u201cI have no doubt in my mind that that was the proper thing to do under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speak, Borzcon encouraged Democrats to \"fight a little lower.\"\n\n\"I think we've seen the other side continuously break the rules and thumb their nose at the rules. So at some point you got to say, 'Hey, we don't play by the rules either,'\" he said.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nThere is also speculation she could mount a run for president, though her team insists she isn\u2019t thinking about her own political future at the moment.\n\nBut the crowd in Las Vegas certainly is: \u201cAOC 2028\u201d pins were being sold at a merchandise stand outside the venue.\n\nMelanie Zanona reported from Las Vegas, Nnamdi Egwuonwu from Tempe, Ariz., and Brennan Leach from Washington, D.C."
