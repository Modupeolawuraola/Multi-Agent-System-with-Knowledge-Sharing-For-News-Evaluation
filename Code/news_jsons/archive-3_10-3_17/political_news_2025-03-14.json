            "full_content": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday said South Africa's ambassador to the U.S. was no longer welcome in the country, while calling him a \"race-baiting\" politician who hates America and President Donald Trump after he said the commander-in-chief is leading a global White supremacist movement.\n\nOn Thursday, South African Ambassador Embrahim Rasool addressed the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA) in Johannesburg while explaining Trump's opposition to his country's expropriation law and its anti-Israel stances.\n\nHe said Trump's Make America Great Again movement was a White supremacist response to demographic changes in the U.S.\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL LAND SEIZURE BILL, ERODING PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n\"What Donald Trump is launching is an assault on incumbency, those who are in power, by mobilizing a supremacism against the incumbency, at home, and, I think I\u2019ve illustrated, abroad as well,\" he said. \"So in terms of that, the supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white.\"\n\nRubio, in a post on X, blasted Rasool over his remarks.\n\n\"South Africa's Ambassador to the United States is no longer welcome in our great country,\" the secretary said. \"Emrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates @POTUS. We have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA.\"\n\nTrump has criticized South Africa over a land expropriation law that allows the government to make land seizures without compensation. In February, Trump issued an executive order penalizing South Africa.\n\n\"In shocking disregard of its citizens' rights, the Republic of South Africa recently enacted Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, to enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation,\" the order states.\n\nTRUMP FREEZES AID TO SOUTH AFRICA, PROMOTES RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES FACING RACE DISCRIMINATION\n\n\"It is the policy of the United States that, as long as South Africa continues these unjust and immoral practices that harm our Nation: (a) the United States shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa; and (b) the United States shall promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.\"\n\nThe order also took aim at South Africa's position against Israel, which it has accused in the International Court of Justice of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, as well as reinvigorating its relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.\n\n\"The United States cannot support the government of South Africa's commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy, which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests,\" the order said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe South African government has claimed Whites of all backgrounds, not just Afrikaners, still own approximately 70% of South Africa\u2019s land. The government is on record saying the Expropriation Act will only be used to take land needed for public purposes \u2014 such as for a new school \u2014 from people of any color when the owner refuses to sell, and even then there would be \"fair and equitable compensation.\""

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President JD Vance acknowledged Friday that Elon Musk has made \u201cmistakes\u201d while executing mass firings of federal employees and emphasized that he believes there are \u201ca lot of good people who work in the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cElon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I\u2019m accepting of mistakes,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News.\n\n\u201cI also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes. But I\u2019m also very aware of the fact that there are a lot of good people who work in the government \u2014 a lot of people who are doing a very good job. And we want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible, while eliminating what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s gentler tone represented a contrast from the chainsaw approach that Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has taken as he leads President Donald Trump\u2019s initiative to slash federal spending and reorient the federal bureaucracy. The firings of thousands of government employees has been the centerpiece of Musk\u2019s work over the first seven weeks of Trump\u2019s second White House administration, with the cuts yielding lawsuits and pushback from judges. Musk has broadly characterized federal workers as \"fraudsters\" who can\u2019t be trusted to do their jobs.\n\n\u201cI think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job,\u201d Vance said when asked about such comments from Musk. \u201cNow, how many people is that? I don\u2019t know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it\u2019s a few thousand or much larger than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people\u2019s business,\" he added. \"That doesn\u2019t distract or detract from the fact that you do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work. But I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don\u2019t want the person who doesn\u2019t show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s comments came during an exclusive and wide-ranging interview aboard Air Force Two, as the vice president and second lady Usha Vance returned from a visit to a plastics factory in Bay City, Michigan. His motorcade\u2019s ride into town illustrated how different life is now for him and his young family.\n\nDozens of protesters had lined the street leading to the factory, greeting Vance and his traveling party with middle fingers and vulgar signs, one of which featured a crossed-out swastika and read \u201cGo home, scumbag.\u201d The previous night, Vance was booed while arriving for a performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington. And while walking with his 3-year-old daughter near their home in Ohio last weekend, Vance found himself in a civil but, in his description, upsetting conversation with pro-Ukraine demonstrators.\n\n\u201cThe thing at the Kennedy Center I thought was funny,\u201d Vance said aboard his plane Friday afternoon. \u201cThe thing by my house I thought was kind of annoying. I think you just kind of take the good with the bad. \u2026 I kind of just see it as, depending on your perspective, a feature or a bug of this new life.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks at the factory, where he was welcomed by a friendlier, pro-Trump audience filled with local Republicans, Vance touted the administration\u2019s commitment to manufacturing and economic recovery while tempering expectations for the rapid turnaround that Trump promised on the campaign trail.\n\nA majority of respondents in two polls released this week \u2014 56% of adults surveyed by CNN, 54% of registered voters surveyed by Quinnipiac University \u2014 said they disapproved of how Trump is handling the economy. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s push for tariffs on foreign products has ignited fears of a trade war that could raise consumer prices.\n\n\u201cNow I have to be honest with you,\u201d Vance said in Bay City. \u201cThe road ahead of us is long, but we are already, in just seven short weeks, starting to see early indications of the president\u2019s vision becoming our shared American reality.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Vance frequently spoke of a woman he had met who said that she and her husband could no longer afford their weekly tradition of grilling steaks on Friday nights. Reminded of that story aboard his plane Friday, Vance described recent lower gas prices as a positive sign.\n\nVance also acknowledged that \u201cyou already see things leveling off to, not an ideal situation, but a much better and more significant improvement\u201d while casting blame on former President Joe Biden, whose policies he said had left Trump in a hole.\n\n\u201cMy ambition is that we see some pretty quick results, that you start to see at least a pathway towards financial stability,\u201d said Vance, specifically noting 10,000 manufacturing jobs added last month. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see progress. I think it\u2019s going to be incremental progress. But I also think it\u2019s important to be honest with people that you don\u2019t get to $2 trillion deficits overnight. You\u2019re not going to get out of $2 trillion deficits overnight.\u201d\n\nVance also discussed his early role in shaping and articulating Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda, from a provocative speech at last month\u2019s Munich Security Conference to an extraordinary Oval Office clash two weeks ago with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Vance had accused of being insufficiently thankful for U.S. aid.\n\n\u201cI just try not to be overly scripted,\u201d Vance said before recalling his speech in Munich, which upbraided European leaders over issues such as free speech and mass migration. \u201cThe classic thing to do in Munich would have been to show up and give a speech about NATO or give a speech about where the Ukraine-Russia thing was at that moment in time, and just sort of thought to myself, like, 'What is it that I think is really important to say?' And the president was OK with me saying it, so I said it.\u201d\n\nVance added that he doesn\u2019t \u201cgo into these things trying to be like a spokesman for the administration. Some of that happens naturally, but fundamentally, the president is the spokesman for the administration, and everything flows from there. I try to do a good job. I try to say things both that I think are true but also are in accordance with the president\u2019s preferences. And let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is constitutionally barred from serving another term, raised eyebrows in a Fox News interview last month by saying it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to anoint Vance as his successor in 2028. Vance and others close to Trump have since brushed off the question and Trump\u2019s answer to it, agreeing that such talk was premature.\n\nAsked a variation of the question Friday \u2014 does he view himself as Trump\u2019s successor? \u2014 Vance replied that he\u2019s not thinking about a presidential campaign at the moment. He related the story of how he felt on Election Night, when, surrounded by his closest friends and family, it became clear he had won the vice presidency.\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m the vice president-elect of the United States,\u201d Vance recalled thinking. \u201cAnd, you know, if I never go further in politics, I\u2019m totally fine with that, but we get a really good opportunity to do a lot of really good s--- the next four years.\"\n\n\u201cIf I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself. \u2026 Now, like, yeah, in two and a half years, will that become harder? Will people be more focused on politics than on what the White House is maybe doing that particular day? Maybe,\" he added.\n\n\u201cI mean, man, if I was like a central figure to getting the Russia-Ukraine crisis solved, who gives a s--- what I do after this?\" Vance said. \"That\u2019s kind of the attitude I take. So I\u2019m very focused on doing a good job.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Demcession Rising: Democrat Panic Could Hurt the Economy\n\nConsumer sentiment is collapsing, and the cause isn\u2019t economic fundamentals\u2014it\u2019s politics.\n\nThe latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey shows confidence plunging to 57.9 in March, its lowest level since November 2022. While sentiment declined across all demographics, the drop is overwhelmingly driven by Democrats, whose economic expectations have fallen to an all-time low. At 28.2, their outlook is now worse than during the financial crisis, the depths of the pandemic, or Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nBy contrast, Republican expectations remain high at 95.7, maintaining a 67.5-point gap between the two parties\u2014the largest ever recorded. Independent voters, usually a middle ground, now sit closer to Democrats than Republicans, indicating a broad shift in sentiment among those outside the GOP base.\n\nThis kind of partisan divide isn\u2019t new, but it has reached unprecedented levels. For years, political affiliation has been the most important factor in shaping how Americans perceive the economy, often outweighing actual economic conditions. But what\u2019s happening now goes beyond perception. When consumer sentiment is shaped by politics rather than reality, it can have real economic consequences.\n\nJust Because It\u2019s Partisan, Doesn\u2019t Mean It Isn\u2019t Real\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss the latest survey as a reflection of Democrats irrationally reacting to Trump\u2019s policies. They see a second Trump term and assume disaster, despite stable job growth and resilient consumer spending. But politics can trump economics, and when people believe the economy is in freefall, they act accordingly.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Curtin\u2014the now retired guru of consumer sentiment surveys\u2014warned as far back as 2017 that partisan-driven expectations can shape consumer behavior, and that\u2019s exactly the risk today. If millions of Democratic consumers expect an economic collapse, they may cut back on spending, delay major purchases, or pull back on investments.\n\nConsumer sentiment matters because it drives consumer behavior, and consumer behavior drives the economy. This dynamic played out under Biden, when Republicans, convinced his policies would lead to a deep recession, became more cautious with spending and investing. Now, the roles have reversed\u2014Democrats are bracing for catastrophe, and their collective retreat could slow down growth.\n\nCan Inflated Fears Inflate Prices?\n\nThat panic is also showing up in inflation expectations. During Biden\u2019s presidency, Republicans were far more concerned about inflation, correctly anticipating its persistence while many economists and Fed officials downplayed the risks. (As it turned out, Republicans got that one right.) Now, that trend has completely reversed. Democrats now expect inflation to surge to 6.5 percent, while Republicans expect virtually no inflation at all\u2014just 0.1 percent. Independents, at 4.4 percent, are once again positioned between the two extremes.\n\nThis shift in expectations is remarkable. From 2021 to 2023, Republicans were convinced inflation would remain a problem, and Democrats insisted it would fade quickly. Now, the gap has flipped completely, and the difference between the two parties is the largest ever recorded. This highlights how inflation fears are no longer just about economic indicators; they have become political. But just as before, expectations shape reality.\n\nHere at Breitbart Business Digest, we\u2019re skeptical of the theory that inflation expectations do all that much to shape inflation. It doesn\u2019t seem plausible\u2014and there is little evidence\u2014that worker wage demands drive inflation or are much influenced by inflation expectations. Rather than setting wage requirements based on expectations, workers typically react to recent past inflationary patterns. That is, they demand higher wages not because they see inflation coming but because the inflation that has already happened has eaten away their standard of living.\n\nWhatever role expectations may play, the rate of inflation appears to us to be dominated by fiscal and monetary policy. But that doesn\u2019t mean inflation expectations can be safely ignored.\n\nIt pays to watch what is happening with expectations because the Federal Reserve is convinced that they matter a lot. And this means that record high inflation expectations are likely to influence the path of monetary policy\u2014even if they don\u2019t do much to influence inflation itself. That raises the risk that the Fed could make the mistake of keeping monetary policy too tight, which in turn would put the economy at risk of slipping into a recession.\n\nThere\u2019s another way inflation expectations affect the economy\u2014and it is almost the opposite of what the Fed thinks. When consumers expect prices to rise rapidly in the future, they scale back purchases in order to pre-emptively save so that they can afford higher-prices later. They take on less consumer debt, most of which is at adjustable rates that tend to go up when inflation rises, which holds them back from making major purchases. So, rising inflation expectations are actually a drag on the economy rather than an inflationary accelerant.\n\nThe Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself\n\nThe biggest risk to the economy right now isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s tariffs or Federal Reserve policy\u2014it\u2019s the fact that one-half of the country believes the economy is both collapsing and on the precipice of a surge of inflation. Add to that the fact that the Fed sees rising inflation expectations as a reason to tighten monetary policy. If Democratic consumers stop spending, economic growth could slow. If businesses see declining demand, hiring could weaken. If markets react to consumer pessimism, investment could pull back. And the Fed is likely to refuse to loosen monetary policy because it reads inflation expectations backward.\n\nNone of this means Trump\u2019s economy is actually in trouble yet; but if enough people believe it is, their behavior can create real economic drag.\n\nPartisan consumer sentiment gaps have been growing for years, but we\u2019ve now entered uncharted territory. The key takeaway isn\u2019t just that Democrats are panicking\u2014it\u2019s that their panic could have real economic consequences. If enough Democratic consumers start behaving as though we\u2019re in a recession, they could slow down the economy\u2014even if the fundamentals remain strong. Sentiment is political, but spending is real. And that\u2019s what conservatives should be watching in the months ahead."

But prior to final passage, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and nine other Democrats helped the measure clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle in the GOP-controlled chamber.\n\nIt was that decision that has stoked deep divisions with the Democratic Party, which is facing a reckoning over how to respond to Trump.\n\nTensions boiled over after Schumer first announced on Thursday he would vote in favor of advancing the GOP spending bill, despite Democratic fears that the measure passed by the House would enable Trump and Elon Musk to further lay off government workers and seek to eliminate programs without congressional input.\n\nBut Schumer took to the Senate floor again this morning and argued that shutting down the government would only embolden Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cMusk has told everybody he wants a shutdown because he knows it will help him achieve his horrible goal of just decimating the federal government from one end to the other,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIn other words, if government were to shut down, DOGE has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction.\u201d\n\nTrump praised Schumer on Truth Social, calling his announcement a \u201creally good and smart move\u201d that took \u201cguts and courage.\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California responded to the president\u2019s post: \u201cWhen Donald Trump wakes up in the morning and says, \u2018You\u2019re doing the right things Senate Democrats,\u2019 we don\u2019t feel that is the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe reaction from Democrats has been furious. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leading progressive opposed to the bill, called Schumer\u2019s move \u201cdevastating\u201d and a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d\n\nIn a stunning move, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling on Democratic senators to reject the bill, defying Schumer. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., declined in a press conference to answer whether it\u2019s time for new leadership in the Senate.\n\nI\u2019ve been speaking to a number of Democratic sources, and while some were relieved by Schumer\u2019s move, one congressional aide told me to expect \u201csevere\u201d blowback from the base. The aide also noted the divide seems to be falling largely along generational lines, with some of the newest voices in the Senate being some of the staunchest opponents to Schumer\u2019s strategy.\n\nWhy the backlash? Well, one, a number of vulnerable House Democrats in Trump districts opposed the bill earlier this week, and now feel like they took a tough vote for no reason. Second, some Democrats feel as though keeping the government open is basically giving Trump and Musk a green light to move forward with their deep cuts. And third, perhaps most importantly, many in the party saw this fight as the best opportunity to register their opposition to Trump. The question is: If not now, when?\n\nThe episode has been a real test of Schumer\u2019s leadership at a critical moment when Democrats are still trying to find their footing. And it all underscores that there is a deep divide in the party about the best way to take on Trump in the opening months of his second administration.\n\nWe\u2019ll get our first real sense of how voters are reacting to all of the moves out of Washington in our new NBC News poll, which Steve Kornacki will debut on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday. Plus, I\u2019ll talk to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nExclusive interview: Vice President JD Vance told NBC News\u2019 Henry J. Gomez that \u201cthere will almost certainly be a high-level agreement\u201d to sell TikTok and keep the social media app running in the U.S. by the April 5 deadline.\n\nVice President JD Vance told NBC News\u2019 Henry J. Gomez that \u201cthere will almost certainly be a high-level agreement\u201d to sell TikTok and keep the social media app running in the U.S. by the April 5 deadline. Vance was booed upon arriving at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Thursday night.\n\nA federal judge ordered that thousands of federal workers fired by the Trump administration be temporarily reinstated.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security agents executed search warrants on two Columbia University residences days after graduate student and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was arrested by immigration authorities.\n\nTrump touted his \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as he once again called the U.N.-sanctioned state a \u201cnuclear power.\u201d\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nPam Bondi reshapes the DOJ around Trump\u2019s priorities\n\nBy Ken Dilanian\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Pam Bondi to be attorney general initially prompted sighs of relief in some Democratic and legal circles.\n\nTrump\u2019s first pick, then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who had been investigated by the Justice Department in connection with allegations of sex trafficking \u2014 he denied the allegations and the DOJ decided not to bring charges \u2014 was seen as someone chosen because he would do whatever Trump asked, regardless of the ethics or law.\n\nBondi was seen as a professional with deep legal experience: She had served as Florida\u2019s attorney general for 10 years. It was true that she had served as one of Trump\u2019s lawyers during his first impeachment trial and supported his conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Still, Democrats and Republicans who knew her believed she was someone who\u2019d stand up to Trump in a way Gaetz wouldn\u2019t and refuse if the president asked her to do anything illegal or improper.\n\nBut since Bondi took the reins, the Justice Department has been operating in a manner dramatically at odds with how it has been run in the 50 years since Attorney General John Mitchell was sent to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.\n\nVowing to end the politicization she says occurred during the Biden administration, Bondi has implemented her own regime of politicization, critics say. The Trump administration, with Bondi\u2019s help, appears to be seeking to transform the Justice Department into a political instrument of the president \u2014 something that no Republican or Democratic administration has done since Richard Nixon.\n\nRead more from Ken \u2192\n\nRelated: Trump calls for jailing his perceived opponents in Justice Department speech, by Nnamdi Egwuonwu and Ryan J.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday said that South Africa\u2019s ambassador to the United States \u201cis no longer welcome in our great country.\u201d\n\n\u201cEbrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates\u201d President Donald Trump, Rubio alleged in a post on X.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA,\u201d Rubio wrote. Declaring someone persona non grata (PNG) is a severe diplomatic rebuke and usually forces them to leave the host country.\n\nRasool must leave the US by March 21, a State Department spokesperson told CNN Saturday.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa called the decision \u201cregrettable\u201d and expressed his commitment to building a \u201cmutually beneficial relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Presidency urges all relevant and impacted stakeholders to maintain the established diplomatic decorum in their engagement with the matter,\u201d Ramaphosa\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nRubio\u2019s post linked to an article from the right-wing news outlet Breitbart about Rasool\u2019s comments to a think tank Friday about Trump\u2019s election and presidency.\n\nThe PNG declaration against Rasool is the latest chapter in the plummeting relationship between the US and South Africa. There had been tensions between the two countries under the Biden administration. However, since Trump began his second term the US has taken a series of punitive measures against South Africa, whose government has been met with ire not only from Trump, but also his ally tech billionaire Elon Musk, who was born and raised in the country.\n\nBoth Trump and Musk have alleged that White farmers in the country are being discriminated against under land reform policies that South Africa\u2019s government says are necessary to remedy the legacy of apartheid.\n\nIn the comments that seem to have triggered Rubio\u2019s PNG declaration, Rasool was discussing the \u201ccontinuities\u201d from the Biden administration as well as the \u201cdiscontinuities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Donald Trump is launching is an assault on incumbency, those who are in power, by mobilizing a supremacism against the incumbency at home and \u2026 abroad as well,\u201d said Rasool, who was on his second tour as ambassador to the US. He presented his credentials in mid-January to then President Joe Biden and previously served in Washington, DC, under the Obama administration.\n\nHe said that the Make America Great Again movement was a response \u201cnot simply to a supremacist instinct,\u201d but to shifts in US demographics \u201cin which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that needs to be factored in, so that we understand some of the things that we think are instinctive, nativist, racist things, I think that there\u2019s data that, for example, would support that, that would go to this wall being built, the deportation movement, etc. etc.,\u201d he said as part of his nearly 20-minute-long remarks to the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA).\n\nRasool said \u201cit\u2019s no accident\u201d that Musk has involved himself in far-right British politics and that Vice President JD Vance met with the leader of a far-right German political party before the elections there.\n\n\u201cThat then begins to say what was the role then of Afrikaners in that whole project,\u201d he continued. \u201cVery clearly it\u2019s to project white victimhood as a dog whistle.\u201d\n\nIn January, South Africa enacted the Expropriation Act, seeking to undo the legacy of apartheid, which created huge disparities in land ownership among its majority Black and minority White population.\n\nUnder apartheid, non-White South Africans were forcibly dispossessed from their lands for the benefit of Whites. Today, some three decades after racial segregation officially ended in the country, Black South Africans, who comprise over 80% of the population of 63 million, own only around 4% of private land.\n\nThe expropriation law empowers South Africa\u2019s government to take land and redistribute it \u2013 with no obligation to pay compensation in some instances \u2013 if the seizure is found to be \u201cjust and equitable and in the public interest.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa said the legislation would \u201censure public access to land in an equitable and just manner.\u201d But the White House disagrees and Trump and Musk believe the land reform policy discriminates against White South Africans.\n\nThe policy has prompted a strong reaction from the Trump administration.\n\nIn early February, Rubio announced he would not attend the meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Johannesburg, saying at the time that \u201cSouth Africa is doing very bad things.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpropriating private property. Using G20 to promote \u2018solidarity, equality, & sustainability.\u2019 In other words: DEI and climate change,\u201d the top US diplomat alleged. \u201cMy job is to advance America\u2019s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism.\u201d\n\nJust days later, Trump suspended aid to South Africa, alleging discrimination against White farmers. In that same executive order, the president said the US would \u201cpromote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump said in a post on social media that \u201cany Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship.\u201d\n\nThe State Department spokesperson told CNN Saturday that the agency \u201cis coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security and has begun implementing refugee resettlement\u201d for Afrikaners, adding that \u201cinitial interviews are underway.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Nimi Princewill and Lucas Lilieholm contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump made multiple false claims in a Friday speech at the Department of Justice in which he discussed the legal system and crime but also a wide range of other topics, including immigration, the war in Ukraine and former President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump also made numerous allegations for which he provided no evidence, alleging unspecified \u201cegregious crimes\u201d in the government during the Biden administration, corruption among unspecified judges, illegality by media outlets that he claimed cover him too negatively and \u201ccrooked\u201d behavior by law firms connected to cases involving Trump.\n\nHere is a fact check of some of his assertions.\n\nTrump\u2019s prosecutions and Biden: Trump repeated his regular unsubstantiated claim that former President Joe Biden used his office to wield the legal system against Trump.\n\n\u201cEtched onto the walls of this building are the words English philosopher John Locke said: \u2018Where law ends, tyranny begins.\u2019 And I see that, and I saw it over the last four years when somebody was allowed to attack, viciously, with this department and the FBI, his political opponent. How did that work out? It didn\u2019t work out too well, but it wasn\u2019t pleasant. I was attacked by a political opponent,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThere has never been any evidence that Biden personally used the Department of Justice or FBI to attack Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s two federal prosecutions, one over Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and one over his retention of classified documents after his first presidency, were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed in November 2022 by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is not proof that Biden was involved in the prosecution effort, much less that Biden personally attacked Trump using the department; Garland said in 2023 that he would resign if Biden ever asked him to act against Trump, and added that he was sure that would never happen.\n\nTrump\u2019s two other prosecutions were brought by local district attorneys, one in Manhattan, New York, and one in Fulton County, Georgia. Both are Democrats, but there is, again, no evidence that Biden or his White House directed their decisions. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in the Manhattan case; the Georgia case was put on hold in June 2024 while an appeals court considered whether the district attorney, Fani Willis, should be disqualified from the case.\n\nThe two federal cases were dropped by Smith because of Trump\u2019s 2024 election victory. The documents case had previously been dismissed by a Trump-appointed federal judge, but Smith had appealed her ruling that his appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional.\n\nBiden documents investigation: Trump falsely claimed in his remarks that former President Joe Biden was \u201cessentially found guilty, but they said he was incompetent and therefore let\u2019s not find him guilty, I guess.\u201d He added, \u201cNobody knows what the ruling was.\u201d He continued, \u201cI think I would have rather been found guilty than what they found with him. They said he didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing and therefore \u2026 let him go.\u201d\n\nBiden was not found guilty, \u201cessentially\u201d or not, and there was no judicial \u201cruling\u201d at all; Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel who was appointed to look into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents, Robert Hur, wrote in his public report that \u201cthe evidence does not establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.\u201d\n\nTrump appeared to be referring Friday to the fact that Hur wrote in the report, \u201cWe have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d But Hur did not say he would have brought charges against Biden if not for this. Hur wrote at length about various facts of the case and possible Biden defenses that meant that he thought would make it too difficult for the government to win a unanimous guilty verdict.\n\nImmigration under Trump: Trump repeated two false claims about immigration statistics during his presidencies.\n\nFirst, he said, \u201cIn our first full month in office, we achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings ever recorded.\u201d He could have accurately said the number of migrant apprehensions by the Border Patrol in February 2025 \u2013 8,347 \u2013 was the lowest in many decades, but it\u2019s not the lowest number on record. Official federal statistics show there were fewer Border Patrol encounters with migrants at the southwest border in some of the months of the early 1960s and in years prior.\n\nSecond, he said that \u201cby the time I got out\u201d of office the first time, \u201cwe had the lowest numbers ever. My favorite chart of all time was brought down that day and, on that chart, it said we had the lowest numbers ever.\u201d But the chart doesn\u2019t actually show that illegal immigration was at its lowest level at the time Trump left office, though text beside a red arrow on the chart claims that\u2019s what it shows. In fact, the arrow actually points to April 2020, when Trump still had more than eight months left in his first term and when global migration had slowed to a trickle because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter hitting a roughly three-year low (not an all-time low) in April 2020, migration numbers at the southern border increased each month through the end of Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nUS and European aid to Ukraine: Trump repeated his debunked claim that the US has spent \u201cmaybe $350 billion\u201d aiding Ukraine compared to $100 billion from Europe.\n\nNeither figure is correct. The $350 billion figure Trump has repeatedly cited is particularly inaccurate.\n\nAccording to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, Europe \u2013 the European Union plus individual European countries \u2013 had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December 2024 (about $269 billion at current exchange rates) than the US committed (about $129 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $144 billion) than the US allocated (about $124 billion).\n\nIt\u2019s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s \u201c$350 billion\u201d figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response says on its website that the US had appropriated about $183 billion for the Ukraine response through December 2024, including about $83 billion actually disbursed \u2013 and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.\n\nUS elections: Trump, vowing to restore \u201cfairness\u201d in the country, baselessly impugned the integrity of US elections, saying, \u201cThe elections, which were totally rigged, are a big factor.\u201d He didn\u2019t invoke the 2020 election in particular, as he usually does, but there is nonetheless no basis for a broader claim that recent \u201celections\u201d in this country, plural, have been \u201ctotally rigged.\u201d\n\nIran and terror groups: Trump repeated his false claim that when he was president, Iran was \u201ctotally broke\u201d and therefore \u201cthey weren\u2019t giving any money to Hamas or Hezbollah.\u201d Iran\u2019s funding for terror groups did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions on Iran had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN in 2024. In fact, Trump\u2019s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah. You can read a longer fact check here."

I just hope you can all watch for it, but it\u2019s totally illegal, and it was so unfair what they were doing to her,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAfter deeming the United States\u2019 withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 as \u201cthe most humiliating time in this history of our country,\u201d Trump repeated his false claims of a rigged election in 2020.\n\n\"What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail,\" he said, without specifying anyone by name. Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that Democrats interfered in the 2020 contest.\n\nOn Friday he also said, \"Our predecessors turned this department of justice into the department of injustice,\" adding that he would \u201cinsist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\u201d\n\nFollow live politics coverage here.\n\nCalling former special counsel Jack Smith \u201cderanged,\u201d Trump referred to the hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants he pardoned on his first day in office as \u201chostages\u201d and said the Justice Department would not return to what he declared as an era of weaponization.\n\n\u201cThose days are over, and they are never going to come back,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump was indicted in two separate federal cases: one involving his handling of classified documents, and another involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The cases were dismissed after the 2024 election, and career prosecutors who had worked on Smith\u2019s team were fired when Trump took office, as were numerous federal prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks are not the first time he has called to imprison his political opponents. But the venue of his speech \u2014 delivering the remarks at the Justice Department to a room full of its top officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \u2014 demonstrates how his previous campaign threats of vengeance and retribution have taken on significantly higher stakes now that he wields the enormous power of the presidency.\n\nTrump noted the significance of his remarks at the Justice Department, on Friday becoming the third president this century to deliver a speech at the agency\u2019s headquarters.\n\n\u201cI was asked to do it, and I said, \u2018Is it appropriate that I do it?\u2019 And then I realized it\u2019s not only appropriate, I think it\u2019s really important, and I may never do it again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI may never have another chance to do it again, because this is something that I\u2019m leaving to the greatest people I know, the best people, the smartest people, the toughest people I know, and they\u2019re going to do an incredible job.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump finished his speech, a mainstay of his campaign rallies, the song \u201cY.M.C.A.,\u201d played over the speakers inside the Justice Department\u2019s Great Hall."

Masks are a common practice to protect protesters' identities at large demonstrations, like the pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University this past year.\n\nHowever, Sanders' \"Fighting Oligarchy\" events are not protests. Events in the Blue Wall states of Michigan and Wisconsin last weekend operated like a traditional campaign rally, with thousands of supporters lining up to earn a spot inside to hear the headline speaker.\n\nSanders announced the West Coast leg of his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour with Ocasio-Cortez in a social media video on Friday.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nCongress averted a government shutdown Friday just hours before the funding deadline, after the Senate approved a House-passed spending bill that exposed deep rifts within the Democratic Party.\n\nThe stopgap measure to fund the government into the fall now heads to the desk of President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.\n\nSenate Democrats came under intense pressure to oppose the Trump-backed bill, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and others are now facing backlash after they helped to clear a path for its passage.\n\nThe rising tensions within the party spilled into public view as lawmakers raced toward a shutdown that would have had far-reaching consequences across the federal government \u2013 highlighting the struggle Democrats face in attempting to counter Trump and the Republican monopoly on power in Washington.\n\nSome 90 minutes before Senate Republicans staved off a shutdown on a nearly party-line vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others crossed the aisle to advance it in a key procedural vote \u2013 despite intensifying pressure from their caucus to sink it outright. The legislation, however, only required a simple majority in the chamber for final passage, and all but two in the group ultimately opposed it.\n\nSchumer argued his party had only bad options when it came to shutting down the government \u2013 possibly for months \u2013 to challenge Trump, or accepting a GOP bill that Democrats have warned would cut spending to programs like veterans\u2019 health care or Washington, DC, firefighters and police.\n\n\u201cI believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,\u201d Schumer argued in defense of his decision to clear a pathway for the bill\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cClearly, this is a Hobson\u2019s choice. The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\u201d he continued.\n\nLawmakers who crossed party lines to advance the spending bill, from left to right, first row, Sens. Chuck Schumer, John Fetterman, Catherine Cortez Masto, Dick Durbin and Brian Schatz. From left to right, second row, Sens. Maggie Hassan, Kristen Gillibrand, Gary Peters, Jeanne Shaheen and Angus King. Getty Images\n\nTrump praised Schumer for announcing he would support the measure, telling reporters after the vote Friday: \u201cI appreciate Senator Schumer, and I think he did the right thing, really. I\u2019m very impressed by that.\u201d\n\nOutside of Schumer\u2019s leadership team, many Senate Democrats as well as House Democrats seethed at the Democrat\u2019s move, which they saw as a capitulation in the party\u2019s first real leverage point in Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nThe initial vote, while procedural, had been closely watched by Democrats across the country, who saw it as a test of their party leaders\u2019 willingness to fight Trump.\n\nUltimately, the Senate voted 54-46 to approve the stopgap bill to fund the government through September 30. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the party, voted in favor of the bill and just one Republican \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2013 opposed it.\n\n\u201cOnce I had voted for cloture, it was an opportunity to pass the bill, and I thought it was more honest to vote for it,\u201d Shaheen told CNN, adding: \u201cI thought, much as I didn\u2019t like the CR, I thought a government shutdown would be worse and would give Trump and Elon Musk and the DOGE operation more of an opportunity to fire people, to shut down agencies and to close the work of the government.\u201d\n\nAfter voting to pass the stopgap bill, the Senate approved a separate measure to allow Washington, DC, to maintain control over its funds after Democrats warned the Republican funding package would cut $1.1 billion of the city\u2019s funding. The measure would next need to be passed by the House, where its fate is unclear.\n\nAt the urging of prominent Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, voters had been flooding senators\u2019 offices with calls urging them to block the bill and take on Trump for his dismantling of the federal government. Ultimately, many Democrats believe, Schumer failed that test.\n\nThe New York Democrat\u2019s strategy has faced fierce blowback from all corners of the Democratic Party, including in his own chamber, though no senators have publicly said they would challenge his leadership over the move.\n\nEarlier in the week, top House Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, led a fierce whip operation against the bill, ultimately losing just one of their members on the vote. But it was not enough to sink the bill, which passed the House Tuesday.\n\nJeffries would not answer Friday when asked whether he had lost confidence in Schumer, with whom he diverged on the funding issue.\n\n\u201cNext question,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nDemocrats contemplate path forward\n\nSenate Democrats are now grappling with how to move forward as a caucus after the government funding bill split their party.\n\nSchumer told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Friday evening that he \u201calways knew there would be disagreements,\u201d but maintained that a \u201cgovernment shutdown would be far worse\u201d than voting for the GOP-led measure.\n\n\u201cMy job as leader is to lead the party and if there\u2019s going to be danger in the near future, to protect the party. And I\u2019m proud I did it, I knew I did the right thing, and I knew there would be some disagreements. That\u2019s how it always is,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer also defended his leadership position, saying, \u201cMy caucus and I are in sync.\u201d\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would not say whether he thought the party needed a new leader, telling reporters: \u201cThat\u2019s a conversation for inside the caucus. I\u2019m not going to debate that out here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Leader Schumer has been very effective in a lot of battles, but we also need to \u2014 these are new times, and we need to all come together. And so, you know, second guessing Leader Schumer out here isn\u2019t going to accomplish the kind of community that we\u2019re going to need to be able to stand up to the president. So, we\u2019ll have that conversation inside caucus,\u201d the New Mexico Democrat added.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he has \u201cfaith in Chuck Schumer,\u201d but acknowledged that the caucus had a \u201cchoppy week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI voted no on the CR. I heard that overwhelmingly from folks, and again, recognizing I got tons of federal workers. But I have total respect for the folks who reached another conclusion, and the idea that they would have had a shutdown that would have put us into the abyss with, unfortunately, parts of this administration, doesn\u2019t follow the law,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cI think the Democrats need to have a pro-growth agenda that recognizes fairness, and that is, frankly, not the debate though, that we just took place. That we just took place, it was two awful choices.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Lauren Fox and Annie Grayer contributed to this report."

They ripped what they've ripped down is incalculable.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA spokesperson for Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\nTrump also accused the judicial branch of conspiring with the media, and accused newspapers and TV networks of functioning as a \"paid political operative.\"\n\n\"It has to be illegal,\" Trump said Thursday. \"It's influencing judges \u2026 and it just cannot be legal. I don't believe it's legal, and they do it in total coordination with each other.\"\n\nTrump also accused a \"corrupt group of hacks and radicals\" within the American government of targeting him and his family over the years, and claimed they sought to prevent him from ever returning to the White House again. Specifically, he said the government employed those like Marc Elias, the former chair of law firm Perkins Coie's political practice.\n\nIn April 2016, Perkins Coie hired opposition research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research into then-presidential candidate Trump on behalf of Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nFusion GPS then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who authored the so-called \"Steele dossier,\" which contained shocking and mostly unverified allegations, including details that Trump engaged in sex acts with Russian prostitutes.\n\nThe FBI also used the dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump routinely has denied the allegations included in the dossier, and signed an executive order on March 4 cutting off security clearances and federal access for Perkins Coie attorneys.\n\nIn response, the law firm filed a motion in a federal court in Washington Tuesday requesting a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from rescinding its access to federal resources, and U.S. Judge Beryl Howell approved the request Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is absurd that a billion-dollar law firm is suing to retain its access to government perks and handouts,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a Wednesday evening statement to Fox News Digital.\n\nFox News\u2019 Breanne Deppisch and David Spunt contributed to this report."

The three justices handling Trump\u2019s appeals on Friday asked for a response from the groups challenging Trump by April 4, a far longer timeline than is usual on the court\u2019s emergency docket.\n\nThe birthright citizenship appeals made their way to the high court at a moment when judges are wrestling with a slew of controversial executive actions that seem designed to push the boundaries of the law. The Supreme Court has already twice declined to overturn lower courts that blocked Trump initiatives since January 20.\n\nThose cases have drawn fiery dissents from some conservative justices questioning the power of lower courts to force the administration to slow down. Trump\u2019s latest appeal \u2013 which repeatedly cites conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2013 appears designed to build further support for that position.\n\nBut experts say the birthright citizenship case may be a particularly improbable vehicle for changing how lower courts do business.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because of the controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s position on birthright citizenship. For more than 150 years, courts have understood the 14th Amendment\u2019s text to guarantee citizenship to anyone \u201cborn or naturalized in the United States,\u201d regardless of the immigration status of their parents.\n\n\u201cThere are strong arguments about the scope of injunctions,\u201d said Amanda Frost, a professor at University of Virginia School of Law. \u201cThis is a pretty weak case to bring that kind of argument.\u201d\n\nCourts have issued sweeping injunctions requiring Trump to halt implementation of his birthright citizenship plans \u2013 among a wave of early legal defeats the new president has faced. A federal judge in January described Trump\u2019s effort as \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d Three federal appeals courts declined to lift those orders.\n\nThe administration framed its request of the Supreme Court as \u201cmodest,\u201d noting it\u2019s not seeking to lift the injunctions entirely \u2013 only to narrow their scope to the parties who sued. But if a majority of justices grant the request, it would have the practical effect of allowing the administration to move forward with an executive order against all but a handful of people.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s argument is anything but \u2018modest,\u2019\u201d said Rupa Bhattacharyya, legal director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, which is representing two of the groups challenging Trump. \u201cIt would destroy the very concept of the United States as a nation if children born in Tennessee were denied citizenship while children born in Washington state were granted it.\u201d\n\nTransgender care to immigration\n\nIn one sense, Trump is pressing a decades-old legal argument and taking a position that has, at times, drawn bipartisan support. In the final weeks of the Biden administration, for instance, the Justice Department also urged the Supreme Court to consider limiting the use of so-called universal injunctions \u2013 an invitation the court declined.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court waded into the issue just last year in an emergency appeal dealing with Idaho\u2019s strict statewide ban on gender-affirming care for minors. A majority allowed Idaho to enforce its ban, shutting down a lower court\u2019s sweeping injunction that had blocked its implementation.\n\nGorsuch, in a lengthy concurrence, lamented lower courts\u2019 injunctions that extended beyond the people who challenge the policy in the first place.\n\n\u201cLower courts would be wise to take heed,\u201d Gorsuch warned in an opinion joined by Thomas and Alito. \u201cRetiring the universal injunction may not be the answer to everything that ails us. But it will lead federal courts to become a little truer to the historic limits of their office.\u201d\n\nGorsuch\u2019s concurrence is the very first Supreme Court opinion the Justice Department cited in its appeals Thursday.\n\nHarris argued that courts have not taken heed but have instead doubled down. She did not address the counterargument: That courts are simply reacting to a president who openly ran on shaking up the status quo in ways everyone knew would invite legal challenges.\n\n\u201cDistrict courts have issued more universal injunctions and TROs during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPresidents of both parties tend to complain about nationwide injunctions, even as their allies often pursue them when the other party is in power. The Biden administration was forced to pause policies dealing with immigration, Covid-19 and student loan forgiveness.\n\nThe emergency orders don\u2019t decide the merits of a case, but they often have significant practical implications. In 2021, the Supreme Court declined to block a Texas law that banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy \u2013 even though the law conflicted with the court\u2019s landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. Months later, the court overturned Roe.\n\nEven with that history, there have been signs that some justices are restive about the recent flood of lower court orders.\n\nWhen a majority of the court this month let stand a ruling requiring the Trump administration to quickly spend nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, Alito wrote a scathing dissent accusing the lower court of \u201cjudicial hubris.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cThe answer to that question should be an emphatic \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlito was joined by Thomas, Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 one vote shy of a majority.\n\n\u2018Micromanaging\u2019 Trump\n\nThe Trump administration is also making a backup argument at the Supreme Court \u2013 one that could find some purchase.\n\nIf the justices are unwilling to allow officials to implement the order, the administration argues, then the court should at least let the executive branch make plans to do so.\n\nThe lower court orders block such internal planning in rulings the administration said, \u201cmicromanage the internal operations of the executive branch.\u201d\n\nThe orders \u201chave prevented executive agencies from developing and issuing public guidance explaining how the executive branch would carry out the citizenship order,\u201d Harris told the Supreme Court. Those orders, she said, \u201cexceed the courts\u2019 authority\u201d under the Constitution.\n\nIf a majority of the court wants to give the administration a win on part of its request without addressing the more substantial questions involved, the issue of internal planning would have the most limited impact.\n\nUS District Judge Deborah Boardman, nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, questioned why officials would want to move forward with planning an order widely understood to be illegal.\n\n\u201cSurely, the government has no valid interest in taking internal, preparatory steps to formulate policies and guidance on an unconstitutional executive order,\u201d Boardman wrote last month.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court precedent from 1898 affirmed the idea that people born in the United States are citizens, and the modern court hasn\u2019t signaled a desire to revisit that holding. Some conservatives have argued that those long-held views are wrong because the 14th Amendment includes a phrase that citizenship applies only to people who are \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States."

Photo: Dana Edwards/Reuters\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it has arrested a second Columbia University student as part of the Trump administration\u2019s long-promised crackdown on college protests against the war in Gaza. The move comes just days after federal agents arrested and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at the university and a green-card holder who led protests there last year.\n\nIn a press release, the DHS said Leqaa Kordia was arrested for overstaying her student visa. The agency said her visa had been terminated in January 2022 for \u201clack of attendance.\u201d The DHS said Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, had previously been arrested last April for taking part in Gaza protests on Columbia\u2019s campus.\n\nThe agency also said another Columbia student, Ranjani Srinivasan, self-deported. According to the DHS, Srinivasan, an Indian national, entered the U.S. on a student visa to attend Columbia as a doctoral student studying urban planning but had her visa revoked this month. The agency also released a video it claims shows Srinivasan using the Customs and Border Protection Home app to self-deport.\n\nEchoing the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, the DHS claims without evidence that the two students arrested were supporters of Hamas, at one point misspelling the organization\u2019s name as \u201cHammas\u201d in the press release. \u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self-deport,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.\n\nOn Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio made it clear that this round of student-visa revocations will not be the last. \u201cIn the days to come, you should expect more visas will be revoked as we identify people that we should have never allowed in,\u201d he said, according to Reuters.\n\nAs Trump has moved to quell college protests since taking office, his administration has continued to escalate its actions against Columbia. On Thursday, Katrina Armstrong, the university\u2019s interim president, said DHS agents with judicially approved warrants had searched two student residences on campus. \u201cNo one was arrested or detained. No items were removed, and no further action was taken,\u201d she said.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche indicated Friday that the searches were part of an investigation into whether Columbia was hiding students who were in the country unlawfully. \u201cJust last night, we worked with the Department of Homeland Security to execute search warrants from an investigation into Columbia University for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus,\u201d Blanche said, per the Associated Press. \u201cThat investigation is ongoing, and we are also looking at whether Columbia\u2019s handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes.\u201d\n\nLast week, the federal government announced it would be revoking $400 million in grants and contracts from Columbia, alleging the university has failed to address antisemitism on its campus. The administration then laid out additional steps for Columbia to potentially get those funds back, calling for enforcement of its disciplinary policies, a mask ban, and immediately placing its Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump keeps telling a story about how he sent fire-plagued Los Angeles the critical water he says California\u2019s leaders foolishly refused to provide.\n\nBut the story, which Trump delivered in an especially colorful form at the White House on Thursday, is not true.\n\nThe 2 billion-plus gallons of water Trump had released from two dams in California\u2019s Central Valley agricultural hub in late January and early February did not actually go to Los Angeles. In reality, the water was directed to a dry lake basin elsewhere in the Central Valley \u2013 more than 100 miles north of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cNot one drop of the water released into the Tulare Basin by the Army Corps of Engineers at the direction of the White House made it to Southern California,\u201d said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow in the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California think tank.\n\n\u201cThe only way that water got to LA is if an Angeleno driving by got mud on their tires,\u201d said Brent Haddad, an environmental studies professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nThat\u2019s because the dams Trump had opened by the US Army Corps of Engineers have no automatic link to the California-run State Water Project that serves Southern California. The federally run Central Valley Project \u201cdoesn\u2019t reach Los Angeles\u201d and \u201cends around Bakersfield,\u201d Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, noted on Thursday.\n\nWater policy experts and local water authorities widely described Trump\u2019s order to release the water from the dams as wasteful, harmful to farmers and poorly planned \u2013 and said it could have been catastrophic if the Army Corps of Engineers had released the 5 billion-plus gallons Trump initially made clear he wanted to flow, which experts said could have caused deadly flooding.\n\nCNN asked the White House for comment about why the president keeps telling the false story about the water releases flowing to Los Angeles and why he also falsely claimed Thursday, as he has before, that some of California\u2019s water comes from Canada. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly responded by denouncing CNN, criticizing Newsom\u2019s fire preparedness efforts, and asserting that Trump released the water to save people from more tragedy.\n\nGallegos said, \u201cThe federal administration appears to have some issues with basic geography.\u201d\n\n\u2018I invaded Los Angeles\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday while sitting beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte: \u201cI broke into Los Angeles, can you believe it? I had to break in. I invaded Los Angeles, and we opened up the water, and the water is now flowing down; they have so much water they don\u2019t know what to do. They were sending it out to the Pacific for environmental reasons.\u201d\n\nThat story doesn\u2019t make sense even using \u201cinvaded\u201d as a figure of speech. Nothing about the water releases actually involved Los Angeles.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers branch that manages the dams from which the water was released was shocked by the White House release order, two sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen. A memo obtained by The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times showed that the Army Corps knew the water \u201ccould not be delivered to Southern California directly\u201d and \u201cwould remain in the Tulare Lake Basin\u201d without special coordination with California\u2019s water department to employ a rarely used connection to the state\u2019s water system. California\u2019s water department made clear it could not get involved on such short notice, the memo said.\n\nThe White House noted to CNN that the connection exists and was used in 2023; California\u2019s water department said then that this was the first time it was used since 2006. Regardless, it wasn\u2019t used this time, so Trump\u2019s repeated claims that the water flowed to Los Angeles remain untrue.\n\nTrump had the water released from the dams after complaining, baselessly, that Los Angeles had not been sent enough water for wildfire prevention or firefighting efforts because California\u2019s Democratic leadership wanted water kept in the northern part of the state to help an obscure fish species. The Los Angeles area had more than enough water to fight the January wildfires, though there were some localized water shortages in particular neighborhoods amid the extreme demand of the battle, and experts emphasized the fires and the fish had nothing to do with each other.\n\nWhen the Army Corps of Engineers began releasing the water on January 30, firefighters happened to be reaching 100% containment on the January wildfires in Los Angeles. Fire officials said that 100% containment was reached on January 31; the unrelated federal water releases continued until February 2."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Pam Bondi to be attorney general last fall prompted sighs of relief in some Democratic and legal circles.\n\nTrump\u2019s first pick, then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who had been investigated by the Justice Department in connection with allegations of sex trafficking \u2014 he denied the allegations and the DOJ decided not to bring charges \u2014 was seen as someone chosen because he would do whatever Trump asked, regardless of the ethics or law.\n\nBondi was seen as a professional with deep legal experience: she had served as Florida\u2019s attorney general for 10 years. It was true that she had served as one of Trump\u2019s lawyers during his first impeachment trial, and supported his conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Still, Democrats and Republicans who knew her believed she was someone who\u2019d stand up to Trump in a way Gaetz wouldn\u2019t and refuse if the president asked her to do anything illegal or improper.\n\nBut since Bondi took the reins, the Justice Department has been operating in a manner dramatically at odds with how it has been run in the 50 years since Attorney General John Mitchell was sent to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.\n\nVowing to end the politicization she says occurred during the Biden administration, Bondi has implemented her own regime of politicization, critics say. The Trump administration, with Bondi\u2019s help, appears to be seeking to transform the Justice Department into a political instrument of the president \u2014 something that no Republican or Democratic administration has done since then-President Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is not independent of the President of the United States,\u201d said Mike Davis, a lawyer and Republican activist who has advised Trump on DOJ issues and who said Bondi was doing exactly what Trump had promised. \u201cEvery federal prosecutor and agent reports to the deputy attorney general, who reports to the attorney general, who reports to the president, who is elected by all Americans. Anyone who thinks otherwise proves that the Deep State is not a conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is doing the unthinkable in Washington \u2014 he\u2019s doing what he promised voters he would do and Pam Bondi is helping,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s done more in a month than the last several attorneys general did in years.\u201d\n\nIn her first month in office, Bondi has presided over a purge of career Justice Department lawyers who are supposed to be protected under civil service rules but who were fired or reassigned without explanation, current and former officials told NBC News. She also backed her department\u2019s push to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams so he could help with immigration enforcement, which prompted the largest wave of resignations by career prosecutors since Watergate. And she has remained silent as Ed Martin, acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., has threatened Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Georgetown University and others over politics. She has also openly promised to fire DOJ civil servants herself if they \"despise\" Trump. Experts say that is prohibited under federal law.\n\n\u201cThese firings seem designed to make room for someone who is a political loyalist, someone who will do the White House\u2019s bidding, in an effort to reshape the department into something that it has never been before,\u201d a senior career Justice Department official said on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nBondi has also spoken in nakedly partisan terms in six appearances on Fox News, her only news media interviews.\n\nIn an interview with Sean Hannity, she said she was appalled when she discovered on her first day as attorney general the portraits of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and her own predecessor, Merrick Garland, still hanging in the secure areas of the National Security Division\u2019s 7th floor offices in the Justice Department's headquarters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how bad it was,\u201d she told Hannity. \u201cSo I personally took those off the wall. But that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nBondi told Hannity she planned to \u201croot out\u201d Justice Department employees \u201cwho despise Donald Trump,\u201d and \u201cthey will no longer be employed.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Harrison Fields disputed that Trump was trying to seize control of the Justice Department, saying in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump cannot be more clear in stating that his Department of Justice will act independently of the White House and any assertion otherwise is a lie.\u201d\n\nBut that is at odds with how Trump has viewed and related to the Justice Department in the past. It\u2019s also at odds with how many of his allies and supporters in the legal sphere see things.\n\nBondi declined a request for an interview but said in a statement to NBC News: \u201cThis Department of Justice is focused on making America safe again, which includes prosecuting violent criminals, illegal aliens, and dangerous cartel and gang members which the previous administration ignored. The Department and its resources are being used to uphold the rule of law and ensure there is one tier of justice for all Americans.\u201d\n\nOutside of television studios, Bondi has rarely been seen in public as attorney general. She appeared in photos alongside other senior national security officials \u2014 posted on X by FBI Director Kash Patel \u2014 wearing a camouflage FBI ballcap and windbreaker at Dulles Airport when an accused terrorist extradited from Pakistan landed in the United States.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, three Justice Department officials who work in different parts of the agency said Bondi has not been a visible presence in DOJ offices.\n\n\u201cGarland sent a positive note to DOJ upon arriving,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cBy contrast, she went on talk shows about all the corruption she claims to have found in DOJ and FBI.\u201d\n\nThe official said typically people at the Justice Department headquarters would see some public presence from a new attorney general, like appearances in the building\u2019s Great Hall. Instead, he said, the headquarters feels \u201clike a ghost town.\u201d\n\nThat is slated to change Friday, when Trump is expected to give a speech in the building \u2014 a building where, just months ago, prosecutors were working to try to put him in prison.\n\nA shaky start and a dramatic shift\n\nJust days after her swearing in, Bondi stepped up to the podium in the Justice Department\u2019s seventh floor conference room for her first news conference as attorney general. Behind her stood federal agents in black jackets emblazed with \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cATF Police\u201d and \u201cDEA.\u201d Next to her was a woman whose daughter had been murdered by an illegal immigrant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today because we have filed charges against the state of New York. We have filed charges against Kathy Hochul,\u201d she opened. \u201cThis is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans.\u201d\n\nReporters arrayed in chairs in front of her looked up in surprise. Did Bondi mean criminal charges? Was the governor of New York about to be arrested?\n\nIt quickly became clear she was talking about a civil lawsuit, not a criminal complaint. The Justice Department was suing New York over policies it says impede immigration enforcement. No one was going to jail.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 12. Daniel Heuer / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nIt was a small verbal misstep, but one that some observers saw as indicative of an attorney general not in command of her material.\n\nBondi\u2019s larger message that day, however, came through loud and clear. The Justice Department would take action against state and local governments that follow so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d policies restricting how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nIt was no accident that Bondi\u2019s first news conference was about immigration. On her first day in office, she issued a series of orders that amounted to a sea change in the Justice Department\u2019s priorities. She disbanded a task force focusing on seizing money from Russian oligarchs and an FBI effort to counter foreign influence operations on social media.\n\nShe pared back the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and other laws governing whether U.S. corporations can pay bribes overseas.\n\nThe orders largely underscored a theme. Many of the programs being eliminated or downgraded were ones that Trump and his allies said had been improperly used to investigate them. Instead, the Justice Department would now prioritize the enforcement of immigration law and the war against Mexican drug cartels that import fentanyl.\n\nIn recent weeks, more memos from the Justice Department's senior leaders, obtained by NBC News, have instructed federal prosecutors to charge immigration offenses whenever they can, and elements of the FBI and the DOJ, including those devoted to fighting terrorism and organized crime, have been repurposed to target illegal immigrants and drug cartels.\n\nBondi aides have been pointing multiple media outlets, including NBC News, to a series of what they view as significant accomplishments achieved by the Justice Department since Trump took office.\n\nTheir list includes the arrest and transfer from Pakistan of a man alleged to have helped kill 13 service members in the Abbey Gate terrorist attack; the move by Mexico to hand over 29 drug cartel figures, including a kingpin accused of orchestrating the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent; threats of federal lawsuits against states over the issue of transgender women playing women\u2019s sports; ending lawsuits begun under Biden that Bondi viewed as supporting racially discriminatory policies; and launching a federal task force advertised as combatting antisemitism at universities.\n\nBut a major change in law enforcement priorities and emphasis when a new president takes office in itself is neither unusual nor unexpected. Administrations have long set policy priorities for the Justice Department that change from president to president, and Trump got elected after promising to crack down on immigration and the drug cartels.\n\nWhat is dramatic and unprecedented about Trump\u2019s second crack at overseeing the Justice Department is the extent of the effort to shape the career workforce into one seen as more willing to do the president\u2019s bidding.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the roughly 100,000 people who work at the Justice Department, the FBI and other agencies the DOJ oversees are not appointed by the president. They are career civil servants hired under federal rules that are supposed to offer them a measure of protection from politically motivated actions against them.\n\nDays after Trump took office, at least a dozen of the most senior public servants at the department were removed from their jobs in the national security and criminal divisions, actions not taken by other post-Watergate administrations. They were offered jobs in a working group tasked with taking action against sanctuary cities. Some took them, some left.\n\nThe Justice Department also quickly fired several prosecutors who had worked on the criminal investigations of Trump, while making no allegation that they did anything improper. Many experts say the firings were illegal, but many of the lawyers have opted to move on with their lives rather than challenge them. This past Friday, several other career leaders in the department were reassigned, including top lawyers in the national security division, the head of the office that investigates lawyer misconduct, and the pardon attorney, current and former officials said.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBC News broke the news that the Justice Department was sharply downsizing the Public Integrity Section, which for decades has focused on prosecuting political corruption and was involved in the cases against Trump. Prosecutors in the unit, which had employed dozens of people, were being told to take details to other positions within the department.\n\nBondi has yet to fill some of the key roles opened up in this purge. Officials say the national security division in particular is bereft of senior leaders. But several Justice Department officials said the widespread understanding within the agency is that people sympathetic to Trump\u2019s politics are being elevated to senior jobs.\n\nOne official said he had seen an example of that happening. This official noticed a rank-and-file lawyer in the department who is a Trump supporter suddenly stopped coming to work, saying he was on special assignment in the deputy attorney general\u2019s office. A few weeks later, that lawyer was leading the criminal division at a major U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nNot the president's lawyer\n\nThis has not happened before. Over the last five decades, the Justice Department adopted policies and norms designed to keep the institution protected from political pressure from the president.\n\nAmong those policies was one limiting who from the White House could speak to people in the Justice Department. Garland was so concerned about distancing himself from the White House that he tried to avoid even being in the same room with Biden, who by some accounts grew angry about how Garland handled the investigation of his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nAttorneys general of both parties have sought to emphasize that they are not the president\u2019s lawyer \u2014 they represent the people of the United States.\n\nBondi, by contrast, has boasted in her Fox News appearances about her close relationship with Trump and her pride in being a member of a team that carries out his wishes.\n\n\u201cWe all have known each other, the majority of us, for so long, and we\u2019re friends, and that\u2019s what makes a difference,\u201d she told Fox News host Jesse Watters. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re getting things done so fast for Donald Trump and to make America great again.\u201d\n\nBondi also boasted to Hannity about the firing of prosecutors who worked on criminal prosecutions of Trump for special counsel Jack Smith, many of whom had long and distinguished Justice Department careers.\n\n\u201cThe Jack Smith team, gone,\u201d she told Hannity. \u201cThat was low hanging fruit. Get rid of them, get rid of the people that raided Mar a Lago.\u201d\n\nTrump allies who have spoken publicly \u2014 including Davis \u2014 say the purges are justified and necessary because the Justice Department and the FBI were hijacked by closet Democrats, who worked closely with the Biden White House to target Trump for prosecution when the evidence didn\u2019t merit it.\n\nA Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that leaders did not believe lawyers who spent years trying to put the president in prison could be trusted to carry out his agenda.\n\nBondi has articulated that view herself, repeatedly decrying what she called the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Justice Department in the last administration.\n\n\u201cThey targeted Donald Trump,\u201d she said during her confirmation hearing. \u201cThey went after him. Actually, starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him. That will not be the case if I am attorney general..\u201d\n\nBut Bondi and other Trump supporters have not offered any evidence to support the claim that career FBI and Justice Department officials investigated and prosecuted alleged crimes by Trump involving classified documents and January 6th in order to damage him politically. They have dismissed statements by Smith and other prosecutors that they honestly believed Trump broke the law by refusing to return classified documents and spreading a false narrative about 2020 election fraud that helped spark the storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nShortly after taking office, Bondi announced a \u201cweaponization working group,\u201d designed to review the Trump prosecutions. That group likely now has access to every text, email and memo Smith and his team wrote on government computers and phones. If they have found any evidence of wrongdoing or bias, critics say, they should make it public.\n\nDave Aronsberg, a Democrat who until January was district attorney of Palm Beach County and worked closely with Bondi over the years, was among those who expressed relief when Trump named her attorney general. Aronsberg told NBC News this week that he still believes Bondi will stand up to the president if he asked her to do something illegal.\n\n\u201cShe is loyal to Trump,\u201d he said, but \u201cI still don\u2019t believe that she will prosecute Trump\u2019s enemies for political reasons. That\u2019s where she differs from Matt Gaetz others who might have taken the job.\u201d"

            "full_content": "What does Hakeem Jeffries think of Chuck Schumer now? Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nFor the record, I\u2019m usually disinclined to promote the hoary \u201cDemocrats in Disarray\u201d narrative whereby the Democratic Party is to blame for whatever nightmarish actions Republicans generally, or Donald Trump specifically, choose to pursue. That\u2019s particularly true right now when Democrats have so little actual power and Republicans have so little interest in following laws and the Constitution, much less precedents for fair play and bipartisanship. So it really makes no sense to accuse the powerless minority party of \u201callowing\u201d the assault on the federal government and the separation of powers being undertaken by the president, his OMB director, and his tech-bro sidekick. If congressional Republicans had even a shred of integrity or courage, Senate Democrats would not have been placed in the position this week of deciding whether it\u2019s better to let the government shut down than to let it be gutted by Trump, Vought, and Musk.\n\nHaving said all that, Senate Democrats did have a strategic choice to make this week, and based on Chuck Schumer\u2019s op-ed in the New York Times explaining his decision to get out of the way and let the House-passed spending bill come to the floor, he made it some time ago. Nothing in his series of rationalizations was new. If, indeed, \u201ca shutdown would be the best distraction Donald Trump could ask for from his awful agenda,\u201d while enabling the administration to exert even more unbridled power over federal programs and personnel, that was true a week ago or a month ago as well. So Schumer\u2019s big mistake was leading Senate Democrats right up to the brink of a collision with the administration and the GOP, and then surrendering after drawing enormous attention to his party\u2019s fecklessness.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just look bad and feel bad for Democrats demanding that their leaders do something to stop the Trump locomotive: It also gives the supreme bully in the White House incentive to keep bullying them, as Josh Marshall points out in his postmortem on the debacle:\n\n[P]eople who get hit and abused and take it tend to get hit and abused again and again. That\u2019s all the more true with Donald Trump, a man who can only see the world through the prism of the dominating and the dominated. It is a great folly to imagine that such an abject acquiescence won\u2019t drive him to up the ante.\n\nThe reality is that this spending measure was the only leverage point congressional Democrats had this year (unless Republicans are stupid enough not to wrap the debt-limit increase the government must soon have in a budget reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered). Everyone has known that since the new administration and the new Congress took office in January. If a government shutdown was intolerable, then Democrats should have taken it off the table long before the House voted on a CR. Punchbowl News got it right:\n\nLet\u2019s be blunt here: Democrats picked a fight they couldn\u2019t win and caved without getting anything in return. \u2026\n\nHere\u2019s the lesson from this episode: When you have no cards, fold them early.\n\nInstead, Democrats have taken a defeat and turned it into a debacle. House and Senate Democrats are divided from each other, and a majority of Senate Democrats are all but shaking their fists at their own leader, who did in fact lead them down a blind alley. While perhaps the federal courts will rein in the reign of terror presently underway in Washington (or perhaps they won\u2019t), congressional Democrats must now become resigned to laying the groundwork for a midterm election that seems a long time away and hoping something is left of the edifice of a beneficent federal government built by their predecessors from the New Deal to the Great Society to Obamacare. There\u2019s a good chance a decisive majority of the general public will eventually recoil from the misrule of the Trump administration and its supine allies in Congress and across the country. But at this point, elected Democrats are going to have to prove they should be trusted to lead the opposition."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s high-profile effort to transfer migrants from the United States to the Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is being buffeted by concerns inside and outside his administration over living conditions there and the arduous, expensive process of making it a suitable site for deportees.\n\nLast month, the administration took the unprecedented step of sending migrants to Guantanamo Bay on US military aircraft, sparking fierce backlash from immigrant advocates and prompting a lawsuit from immigrant advocacy groups. The last flight by military aircraft to Guantanamo Bay was March 1, a US official told CNN, and there are no DOD flights to the base expected in the coming days.\n\nAs of Thursday, there were no migrants detained at the Naval base, and 40 people were flown back to the US this week, the official said. CNN reported in February that plans to house migrants in tents were being halted amid concerns the structures didn\u2019t meet detention standards required by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAmid those stumbles, the administration has already spent roughly $16 million on the operation, according to Democrat Rep. Sara Jacobs, who visited the base last week as part of a congressional delegation visit.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw really was that there is very low capacity there, and it\u2019s really expensive, and I could see no operational reasons for using Guantanamo Bay for immigration detention,\u201d Jacobs told CNN. \u201cIt was clearly just because Donald Trump liked the optics.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department declined to comment for this article and referred further questions to ICE. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\ufeffLegal challenges have been filed to the administration\u2019s plans for Guantanamo, but on Friday, a federal judge rejected requests for emergency intervention in a lawsuit dealing with the legality of using the military base for immigration detention. In a second case, the judge zeroed in on issues detainees have had accessing legal counsel there. The rulings from US District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump-appointee, hung largely on the fact that there are currently no immigrants with final removal orders being held at the base, though he signaled that the challengers might have other issues in their case.\n\nStill, Nichols said there were \u201cserious questions\u201d about whether the administration had the authority to use Guantanamo for immigration detention purposes and made clear that some of the plaintiffs \u2013 10 immigrants being detained in the US with final removal orders who feared they could be transferred to Guantanamo \u2013 would be able to file new requests for quick judicial intervention if they were transferred to the base.\n\nFor weeks, federal agencies including the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security have scrambled to execute on Trump\u2019s direction to prepare to house up to 30,000 migrants \u2014 though the base can barely accommodate a fraction of that number. The current capacity is 225 people, according to Jacobs.\n\nJuan Lopez-Vega, ICE official who oversees the operations at Guantanamo, recently said in court records that a total of 290 migrants from multiple countries had been transferred to the base.\n\nIn late February, the administration deported 177 Venezuelan migrants \u2014 who were held in Guantanamo Bay after being transferred from the US \u2014 to Venezuela.\n\nThe US official told CNN that DOD and DHS recently signed a memorandum of understanding formalizing each department\u2019s role and DOD\u2019s support to ICE at Guantanamo.\n\nAnother US official described the facility as \u201cnot a primary course of action,\u201d saying instead that officials are looking more intently at using US military bases to house migrants.\n\nThe use of Guantanamo has also been cited in plans to detain migrants deemed to be dangerous, like members of criminal organizations including the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, one source said. The second US official also said it was likely the Naval base could be used for detaining cartel members. Tren de Aragua was recently designated a foreign terrorist organization and is the primary target for the expected use of a sweeping wartime authority.\n\nBut one of the sticking points facing officials has been trying to meet rigorous ICE detention standards, which outline requirements for facilities holding immigrants, and trepidation among contractors given the logistical challenges, one source said.\n\nJacobs told CNN that of the money spent by DOD, $3.1 million was spent solely on setting up tent structures, which ultimately were not in use and still not operational. As of now, the tents that were set up at the Naval base are expected to be left up for potential use during hurricane season, the second US official said.\n\nAside from the tents, Camp VI \u2014 the detention facility at Guantanamo \u2014 consists of single-person cells with toilets and sinks and has daily access to a communal day room, whereas the already-existing Migrant Operations Center is outfitted dormitory-style and allows outdoor recreation, according to court documents describing the facilities.\n\nConditions at the facilities have come under scrutiny. Some detainees have refused meals, which has led to weight loss, the US military officer overseeing the task force in charge of detention operations at Guantanamo Bay, Lt. Col. Robert Green, said in court documents. Green also said a restraint chair was used six times on February 28 \u2014 each time because of Venezuelan detainees who were engaging in self-harm.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ang\u00e9lica Franganillo-D\u00edaz and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAlan Simpson, a longtime Republican senator from Wyoming who championed bipartisan solutions and steadfastly advocated for a moderate blend of conservatism, has died. He was 93.\n\nSimpson died early Friday after struggling to recover from a broken hip in December, according to a statement from his family and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West provided to The Associated Press.\n\nSimpson, a man of blunt rhetoric whose towering 6-foot-7 stature made him an instantly recognizable figure on Capitol Hill, made a career of taking on difficult congressional assignments, bringing his signature candor to epic legislative battles.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Simpson was at the heart of seminal debates over environmental protection, nuclear regulation, and care for veterans \u2013 always injecting a healthy dose of humor to his work. \u201dIn your country club, your church and business, about 15% of the people are screwballs, lightweights and boobs, and you would not want those people unrepresented in Congress,\u201d he once said.\n\nSimpson largely aligned with his party on key votes and championed GOP prescriptions for social welfare rollbacks, immigration and foreign policy. But he wasn\u2019t afraid to cross party lines on pressing issues, as he supported abortion rights and was an early GOP advocate for same-sex marriage. \u201cI\u2019ve worked very closely with the gay-lesbian community; we\u2019re all human beings, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said in 2008.\n\nSimpson\u2019s support for same-sex marriage was especially apparent in a contentious interview with comedian Bill Maher in 2004 after Maher quipped that he\u2019d apologize to \u201cthe two gay people in Wyoming\u201d for a joke about gay Republican lawmakers.\n\n\u201cOh come on, pal. That\u2019s just bullsh*t,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to come on this program \u2013 I don\u2019t have to come on this program when Matthew Shepard was killed in this state and the people of this state were offended. So put that one in your pipe.\u201d\n\nSimpson was also a fierce supporter of federal support of the arts. \u201cIf you\u2019re just interested in politics alone, it\u2019s barbaric. That won\u2019t keep you alive,\u201d he once said.\n\n\u201cYou have to have the marvelous softening agents of books and letters and art and culture and theater, and I love that, and that\u2019s what Ann and I have always thoroughly supported and loved and independently and also politically.\u201d\n\nHis unapologetic nature attracted friendships as much as it challenged them. Simpson\u2019s decades-long alliance with former Vice President Dick Cheney, for example, survived a tense dispute with Cheney\u2019s wife, Lynne, who reportedly told Simpson to \u201cshut up\u201d at a reception in 2013. According to Simpson, the exchange took place after Cheney\u2019s granddaughter asked him to sign a football for charity but couldn\u2019t confirm if it would be used to raise money for Liz Cheney\u2019s Senate campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not out to hurt anyone,\u201d Simpson said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n\nSimpson is survived by his wife of 70 years, Ann, and their three children; Colin, Susan and William.\n\nA \u2018monster\u2019 in his youth\n\nBorn in Denver on September 2, 1931, Simpson grew up in Cody, Wyoming, a town of fewer than 10,000 people. His father, Milward Simpson, served in the Senate and as governor of Wyoming, while his mother, Lorna Kooi Simpson, served as president of the Cody Red Cross.\n\nA self-proclaimed \u201cmonster\u201d in his youth, Simpson was on federal probation for two years after shooting mailboxes with his friends. His behavior reached an inflection point after he says he \u201cbelted\u201d a police officer trying to arrest him after Simpson had shoved another man outside a pool hall. Simpson ended up in jail for a night in a \u201csea of puke and urine.\u201d\n\nSimpson, spurned from the experience, described a \u201ccreeping maturity\u201d that shifted the trajectory of his life. \u201cThe older you get, the more you realize \u2026 your own attitude is stupefying, and arrogant, and cocky, and a miserable way to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnybody in our society \u2212 unless they are totally out to lunch \u2212 can understand that a guy of 25 or 35 is not the same guy of 17. You can\u2019t just throw a kid in the clink forever.\u201d\n\nAfter completing high school in Cody, he graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1954 and earned his law degree from the school four years later.\n\nTwo years in the US Army and work as a private attorney would precede a winding political journey that began in earnest in 1965 when Simpson was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives, a post he would hold for more than a decade.\n\nSimpson would leverage those years, and his reputation for bringing life experiences to the job, into a successful Senate bid in 1978. The tallest senator in US history until 2017, Simpson served as Republican whip from 1985 to 1995 and was even considered a potential candidate for vice president in 1988.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a legislator. I love to legislate,\u201d he told the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center in 2008. \u201cPlotting, strategizing, philosophizing, those things mean nothing to me. I\u2019m a trigger guy. Give me an issue; let me wrench the emotion, fear, guilt, and racism out of it and get some facts into it and see if we can pass the son-of-a-bitch.\u201d\n\nSimpson declined to run for reelection in 1996 and went on to teach at Harvard University. But his years away from Capitol Hill didn\u2019t dull his disdain for partisanship. In 2010, he co-chaired a bipartisan Presidential Commission on deficit reduction alongside Democrat Erskine Bowles. The panel, created by then-President Barack Obama, was tasked with identifying policies to \u201cimprove the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run.\u201d\n\nWhile the group\u2019s plan failed to gain traction, Simpson\u2019s role in the effort vaulted him back into the political spotlight as a commanding voice on national debt, an issue he tried to impress upon young people.\n\n\u201cStop Instagramming your breakfast and tweeting your first world problems and getting on YouTube so you can see \u2018Gangnam Style,\u2019\u201d he said in a 2012 video in which the octogenarian hopped to the song in an effort to raise awareness about the national debt.\n\nIn a statement released after Simpson\u2019s death, former President George W. Bush described Simpson as \u201cone of the finest public servants ever to have graced our nation\u2019s capital\u201d and noted how the former senator delivered a eulogy at the funeral for his father, former President George H. W. Bush, in 2018.\n\n\u201cMy family will remember him best not for his many accomplishments, but for his loyal friendship \u2013 and sharp sense of humor,\u201d Bush said.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden cited Simpson\u2019s \u201cspirit\u201d when he presented his former Senate colleague with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in July 2022.\n\nIn this July 2022 photo, President Joe Biden presents former Sen. Alan Simpson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe allowed his conscience to be his guide. And he believed in forging real relationships even with people on the other side of the aisle, proving we can do anything when we work together as the United States of America,\u201d Biden said from the White House.\n\n\u201cIt matters, it matters, it matters. We need more of your spirit back in the United States Senate on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nIndeed, by the end of life, Simpson had also identified the growing political divide in Congress as a key threat to the nation\u2019s well-being, lamenting to CNN in 2018, \u201cYou can see the bitterness that goes on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see the fact that if they\u2019re a Democrat, you just ignore them, or if they\u2019re a Republican, you ignore them.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Michael Williams contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nWhen White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced at the very beginning of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term that new and independent media would be invited to play a big role in covering the administration, the collective eye roll from traditional media was as immediate as it was condescending.\n\nWe all remember Trump\u2019s first term, when his press conferences often devolved into a full-contact sport, with former CNN correspondent Jim Acosta wrestling a female White House aide for the microphone, for example, amid nothing but constant \"gotcha\" questions.\n\nMARK HALPERIN AND FORMER POLITICO REPORTER SCORCH \u2018LIBERAL MEDIA BIAS\u2019 ON NETWORKS LIKE MSNBC\n\nThe snarky back and forth from the media in those days created entertainment, but a lot more heat than light. The White House press in Trump\u2019s first term sought always to expose Trump for this or that, but almost never to truly understand the administration\u2019s policies.\n\nThere were exceptions, of course, such as your favorite cable news network, whose White House correspondents play it down the middle no matter who\u2019s in office. But in general, Trump faced a daily inquisition, while his successor, President Biden, more or less got a free pass throughout his abysmal four years as president.\n\nToday, the addition of independent outlets such as Epoch News, The Post Millennial, OAN, and others has transformed Trump\u2019s press availabilities from a hackling shouting match, into a substantive, almost daily discussion of the administration's actions and priorities.\n\nWith the exemption of the recalcitrant Associated Press, which has weirdly decided to die on the hill of defending the name \"Gulf of Mexico,\" all the old Trump haters from The New York Times to NBC News are still in the room; they just don\u2019t completely dominate it anymore.\n\nIf you listen to a news conference with Trump now, as opposed to five years ago, you do not come away with the impression that he is some sort of pariah who everyone hates and thinks is a liar. We have a full spectrum of media in there, and it has brought comity to the process, but there are still tough questions, too.\n\nDoes the new, mostly conservative, media in the White House toss up some softballs? Sure. Are the online thank yous to Leavitt for opening up the room a bit saccharine? Certainly.\n\nBut compared to what? A mainstream media that just nodded along as former White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told us Biden was fit as a fiddle and she was a very important historical figure? Spare me.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that outlets like the Daily Caller or even Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room, are no more biased to the right than NPR, a long-time staple in the Oval Office, is biased to the left, nor are they abnormal. Even super leftwing California Gov. Gavin Newson just had Bannon on his new podcast.\n\nFor four years, we had a White House press corps that, with the exception of Fox News and Real Clear Politics, ran cover for Biden and KJP. Even CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper is now out with a book, basically apologizing for the liberal media\u2019s horrible coverage of Grandpa Joe.\n\nSo if we all admit that the press did a terrible disservice to the American people with its one-sided and farcical coverage of Biden, then how can we complain that both sides of the American political divide are now represented in the room?\n\nSeventy percent of Americans do not trust journalism today, and for extremely good reasons like those outlined above. I'm a journalist, and even I don\u2019t trust journalism. But this fresh approach from the White House could be a step in restoring some level of trust.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nAmericans know when they are only getting one side of the story, we have a basic sense of fairness that rankles when we see the powerful put a thumb on the scale, and by inviting all perspectives in the room, the White House is allowing us to weigh arguments freely and fairly.\n\nI came up in independent conservative media, writing for outlets including The Federalist and The Daily Wire, which have unwavering commitments to honesty. Of course, they belong in the White House, and everyone is better off for their presence there.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo turn an old saying upside down, \"if it's broke, fix it,\" and the news media\u2019s coverage of the White House, for years now, has been badly broken, maybe, just maybe, these new and formerly banished voices in the Oval Office are just what we need to fix it."

            "full_content": "Former GOP Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a political legend whose quick wit bridged partisan gaps in the years before today's political acrimony, has died. He was 93.\n\nSimpson died early Friday after struggling to recover from a broken hip in December, according to a statement from his family and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, a group of museums where he was a board member for 56 years.\n\n\"He was an uncommonly generous man,\" Pete Simpson, his older brother, said in the statement. \"And I mean generous in an absolutely unconditional way. Giving of his time, giving of his energy \u2014 and he did it in politics and he did it in the family, forever.\"\n\nAlong with former Vice President Dick Cheney, Simpson was a towering Republican figure from Wyoming, the nation's least populated state.\n\nSimpson was famous for his humor and often quipped, \"We have two political parties in this country, the Stupid Party and the Evil Party. I belong to the Stupid Party.\"\n\nA political moderate, Simpson's three terms as senator from 1979 to 1997 covered the Republican Party's rejuvenation under President Ronald Reagan. Simpson played a key role rallying GOP senators around the party's legislative agenda as a top Senate leader during that time.\n\nSimpson was better known for holding his own views, though, with sometimes caustic certainty. A deficit hawk with sharp descriptions of people who relied on government assistance, Simpson supported abortion rights.\n\nHis Democratic friends included Robert Reich, who was labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Norman Mineta, the transportation secretary under President George W. Bush.\n\nSimpson and Mineta met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyoming, during World War II.\n\nAfter leaving politics, both promoted awareness of the incarceration of some 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in camps during the war. Mineta, who died in 2022, recalled that Simpson once was asked what was the biggest difference between them as a Republican and a Democrat.\n\n\"Alan thought about it and he said, 'Well, I wear size 15 shoes and he wears a size 8 and a half,'\" Mineta replied, according to the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation.\n\nSimpson was \"gifted in crossing party lines and building bipartisan consensus,\" Colin Simpson, one of his three children and a former Wyoming House speaker, said in the statement.\n\n\"Dad and Pete have anchored the extended Simpson family for decades with the same love, humor, compassion and dedication their parents did before them,\" he said. \"Dad was a mighty force and with Mom's steady hand by his side we are so blessed and proud to have been along for the ride of a lifetime.\"\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama tasked Simpson with co-leading a debt-reduction commission that developed a plan to save $4 trillion through tax hikes and spending cuts. The plan lacked support for serious consideration by Congress.\n\nAt 6-foot-7, Simpson was literally a towering figure \u2014 tallest on record in the Senate until Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who is 6-foot-9, took office in 2017.\n\nBig as Simpson's shoes were, he had huge ones to fill politically.\n\nHis father, Milward Simpson, was a governor, U.S. senator and state legislator. His mother, Lorna Kooi Simpson, was president of the Red Cross in Cody and on the local planning commission.\n\n\"I saw Dad loved politics and the law, and I wanted to do that,\" Simpson once said.\n\nSimpson was born in Denver in 1931. After a childhood of reckless gun-shooting and vandalism in Cody that put him in danger and in trouble with the law, he graduated from Cody High School in 1949 and the University of Wyoming in 1954.\n\nAlso that year he married Ann Schroll, of Greybull, Wyoming, and joined the U.S. Army, where he served in the Fifth Infantry Division and the Second Armored \"Hell on Wheels\" Division in Germany.\n\nAlan and Ann Simpson celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary with a community ice cream social attended by relatives and hundreds of others in a Cody park last summer.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Simpson got a law degree from the University of Wyoming in 1958 and joined his father's law practice, where he worked for the next 19 years. He was elected to the Wyoming House in 1964 and served there until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1976.\n\nA football and basketball athlete at the University of Wyoming, Simpson fondly described politics as a \"contact sport.\"\n\n\"I've been called everything,\" he said in 2003. \"What the hell. If you don't like the combat, get out.\"\n\nSimpson's candor made him popular with voters. He also was known as a well-read, hardworking and sometimes hard-nosed politician involved in immigration, veterans' affairs and environmental issues.\n\nHe served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.\n\nSimpson opposed sentences of life without parole for juveniles and said he supported review of criminal sentences after a period of time.\n\n\"When they get to be 30 or 40 and they been in the clink for 20 years, or 30 or 40, and they have learned how to read and how to do things, why not?\" he told The Associated Press in 2009.\n\nBy 1995, he'd had enough of the Senate and decided not to run again.\n\n\"Part of me said I could do this for another three or four years but not six,\" he said at the time. \"The old fire in the belly is out. The edge is off.\"\n\nOthers of his family in politics and government included his older brother, Pete, a University of Wyoming historian who served in the Wyoming House and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor in 1986. Alan Simpson's son Colin was speaker of the Wyoming House, and his nephew Milward Simpson directed the state parks department.\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he often urged college students to be politically involved.\n\nUS President Joe Biden presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Alan Simpson, former US Senator from Wyoming, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., US, on Thursday, July 7, 2022.

Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters/File\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to invoke a sweeping wartime authority to speed up the president\u2019s mass deportation pledge in the coming days, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe little-known 18th-century law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, gives the president tremendous authority to target and remove undocumented immigrants, though legal experts have argued it would face an uphill battle in court.\n\nCNN previously reported that the authority was being widely discussed at several agencies as administration officials prepared to implement the law. The primary target remains Tren de Aragua (TDA) , a Venezuelan organized crime group that is now operating in the United States and other countries and was recently designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nAt the start of his term, Trump had ordered his administration to designate TDA as a foreign terrorist organization and use the measure to remove those identified as members.\n\nThe announcement, which could come as soon as Friday, has been a moving target as officials finalize the details. The move would likely pave the way for quicker removals of certain immigrants.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nMore about the law: It\u2019s designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so. Legal experts say it would be difficult for Trump to use the act when the US isn\u2019t being attacked by a foreign government, even if the administration does cite threats from gangs or cartels.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has been invoked three times in US history \u2014 all during war \u2014 according to the Brennan Center. During World Wars I and II, it was used to justify detentions and expulsions of German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian and Japanese immigrants. The law played a role in the infamous US policy of Japanese internment during World War II, according to the nonpartisan law and policy institute."

            "full_content": "Former vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., is hosting town halls in Republican-held congressional districts in Iowa and Nebraska, following reports that the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) told Republicans in Congress to stop holding in-person town hall meetings.\n\nThe Republicans in those districts told Fox News Digital that Walz has some questions to answer of his own.\n\nThe Minnesota governor is holding a town hall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday morning \u2013 Republican Rep. Don Bacon\u2019s home congressional district. The event\u2019s digital flier said they will discuss \"Trump and Musk's cuts to critical programs from Medicaid and SNAP to our national parks.\"\n\n\"Don Bacon is not holding an in-person town hall. Nebraska Democrats are stepping up and taking action,\" the flier said. But Bacon fired back in a statement to Fox News Digital, urging Walz to answer for the inconsistencies in his record that plagued his 2024 campaign alongside former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWALZ IS BACK IN MINNESOTA WITH $1M IN THE BANK AND 'WANTS THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT'\n\n\"First, Nebraska Democrats brought in Bernie Sanders, the most liberal Senator, to the district. Now they\u2019re bringing in the most liberal Governor in America. Perhaps at the townhall, Gov. Walz can finally clarify what Army rank he actually retired at and when the supposed combat deployment he used to talk about occurred. If he wants to call into our townhall, he can answer these questions,\" Bacon added.\n\nAOC 'GOING ON THE OFFENSE' TO RALLY RED-DISTRICT VOTERS AGAINST TRUMP: REPORT\n\nOn Friday, Walz is hosting a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, where Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, has represented the state's 3rd Congressional District in the House of Representatives since 2023. The Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s fundraising flier for the event alleges \"Zach Nunn has refused to host a public town hall since he was sworn into office in 2023.\" Nunn took aim at the Democrats, in response to the town hall, for calling \"a fundraiser a forum.\"\n\n\"The American people spoke loud and clear in November\u2014they voted for change. I\u2019m delivering to: secure the border, unleash US energy, and cut taxes for working Americans. If out-of-state Democrats want to call a fundraiser a \u2018forum,\u2019 they should join us at our listening sessions, where Iowans help drive real results. Next week, I begin my Air Force Reserve duty\u2014I hope the Senate avoids a Schumer Shutdown, so our troops continue to get paid,\" Nunn said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\nWalz's office did not reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment on his upcoming town halls.\n\nThe NRCC, the political campaign committee tasked with electing more Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, advised against town halls following a series of disruptions by Democrats' discontent with President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nWalz announced on Wednesday if a Republican representative refused to meet with his constituents, then he would \"lend a megaphone\" to the red state constituents.\n\n\"I\u2019m hitting the road, traveling to red states across the country to lend a megaphone to the people. Your congressman may not want to listen, but they\u2019re going to hear from us anyway,\" Walz said in a post on Wednesday.\n\nThe NRCC said the protests that shut down Republicans' town hall meetings were \"manufactured productions.\" Fox News Digital reported last month about the coordinated effort by progressive groups protesting the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMEET THE FAR-LEFT GROUPS FUNDING ANTI-DOGE PROTESTS AT GOP OFFICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY\n\n\"The Democrat Party has sold themselves out to the far-left crazies and their mega-donors who are funding these clown show protests. This isn\u2019t grassroots \u2014 it\u2019s manufactured productions, orchestrated to distract voters from the Democrats\u2019 failed and out of touch record. Sending out Tampon Tim won\u2019t solve the Democrats\u2019 \u2018massive brand problem,\u2019 despite what they may think,\" Mike Marinella, NRCC National Press Secretary, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\nMoveOn.org, which has accepted millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Policy Center, announced in a press release last month that it was mobilizing resources as part of a \"Congress Works for Us, Not Musk\" initiative \"aimed at pressuring lawmakers to fight back against the Trump-Musk agenda.\"\n\n\"MoveOn members and allies will show up at congressional-led town halls and congressional offices across the country, targeting House Republicans whose votes will be crucial in opposing Trump and Musk\u2019s harmful policies,\" MoveOn.org said in the press release.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., kicked off his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour in Omaha last month. Sanders drew thousands of supporters to his stops in Michigan and Wisconsin this past weekend as the Vermont senator stands out as the leading progressive voice opposing Trump\u2019s second term. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has reportedly started planning her own rallies in Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nWalz teased his red state tour in a post last week, promising to host events in Republican-held congressional districts \"to help local Democrats beat \u2018em.\"\n\n\"If your Republican representative won\u2019t meet with you because their agenda is so unpopular, maybe a Democrat will. Hell, maybe I will. If your congressman refuses to meet, I\u2019ll come host an event in their district to help local Democrats beat \u2018em,\" Walz said in the post.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that town hall protests should be the \"first clue\" that Republicans \"should drop their terrible agenda.\"\n\n\"Americans are organizing in public, and Republicans have seen these frustrations at town halls. That should be the first clue that they should drop their terrible agenda. When a lead Republican in the House tells Republicans, you better cancel your town halls, they're running away from their policies and priorities,\" Schumer said.\n\nNRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told reporters it was a \"shame that the Democrats are threats to democracy by disrupting this dialogue\" at town halls. Hudson also emphasized the expanded reach of tele-town halls, where representatives can meet with thousands of constituents at a time.\n\nDEMOCRATS ARE MAKING EARLY MOVES TO LINE UP 2028 PRESIDENTIAL BIDS\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson told reporters last week that town hall protesters could be paid professionals.\n\n\"George Soros-funded groups and others literally pay protesters,\" Johnson said. \"Democratic activists who don't live in the district very often will show up for these town hall events, and they'll go in an hour early and fill all the seats, and so the constituents and the people from the community that are actually represented don't even get a seat.\"\n\n\"There are people who do this as a profession. They're professional protesters. So why would we give them a forum to do that? Right now, the best thing that our members can do is communicate directly, frequently, consistently with their constituents. There are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side soundbites. I mean, they're doing this for the cameras. We all know it,\" Johnson added.\n\nTrump also dismissed the protesters as \"paid troublemakers\" in a Truth Social post.\n\n\"Paid \u2018troublemakers\u2019 are attending Republican Town Hall Meetings. It is all part of the game for the Democrats, but just like our big LANDSLIDE ELECTION, it\u2019s not going to work for them!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries shut down Trump and Johnson\u2019s claims in a video message posted last week, saying, \"We don't need paid protesters, bro. The American people are with us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm told that Donald Trump, Mike Johnson and the extreme MAGA Republicans are claiming that Democrats are sending paid protesters into their town hall meetings. What's wrong with y'all? What's wrong with y'all? You don't need to send paid protesters into your town hall meetings. The American people are with us all across the country,\" Jeffries said.\n\nFox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s no better example of where the newly applied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel will be felt than craft brewers, an industry that uses both materials in all facets of production and sales.\n\nAnd for Wesley Keegan, owner and founder of Nashville-based TailGate Brewery, the implementation of the tariffs will have swift effects on his business. \u201cEverything costs more,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe get a price increase letter just immediately from every supplier.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump enacted a new round of tariffs on the raw metals. Since much of it comes from abroad, US companies \u2014 small and large \u2014 that rely on steel and aluminum may have to pass on the cost of those tariffs to consumers.\n\nBut specifically how much more Keegan\u2019s customers will pay for a 6-pack of his brewery\u2019s ciders, stouts and lagers isn\u2019t clear just yet. He admits that businesses like TailGate have to be \u201cwilling to take the haircut\u201d in terms of profits.\n\n\u201cThe hard piece is juggling the reality that you can\u2019t be in business if you\u2019re not making money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then you also have to continue to take those price changes on the chin because the consumer is only willing to give you so much.\u201d\n\nKeegan said that TailGate tries to \u201cabsorb\u201d as much as it can, but beyond tariffs \u201cthere is not a single input in our industry that hasn\u2019t increased prices every single year for the last five years.\u201d\n\nMounting issues\n\nIt\u2019s been a difficult several few years for craft brewers.\n\nThe pandemic sapped the lifeblood \u2014 taproom sales \u2014 from many operations, forcing them to lean more heavily on to-go vessels such as cans and bottles. Then, global supply chain challenges caused shortages and drastic price hikes of key inputs, including cans, which already were getting more expensive following the 2018 tariffs.\n\nPlus, the breweries that are still standing were then stung by a shift in consumers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 palates for beverages beyond beer.\n\nAll of those were lessons for how Keegan operates TailGate, a 10-year-old company that has gradually expanded to nine taprooms across Tennessee.\n\nAn exterior view of a TailGate location. Courtesy TailGate Brewery\n\nOne aspect of his business that changed post Covid-19 was the sourcing of aluminum. Before 2020, the primary source was Canada, but he has since diversified to additional places, including China, the US and even Jordan.\n\nAnd now, the aluminum industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation, with some companies shifting to only working with major brewers such as Anheuser-Busch InBev or being bought by other manufacturers, resulting in a decline in smaller brewers to work with third-party companies that hunt and source aluminum on a global scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the functions of the last round of tariffs, plus Covid-19, has been that it\u2019s introduced a third party to the equation where we\u2019re frankly just too small,\u201d Keegan said. \u201cEven though we buy a lot of cans and we\u2019re a pretty sizable brewery, they don\u2019t want to talk to us \u2026 we\u2019re so small, it\u2019s just annoying for them.\u201d\n\nTrouble with tariffs\n\nTaprooms have evolved into a \u201cthird place\u201d for communities, and naturally a place where the day\u2019s topics are discussed \u2014 like tariffs. Operating in Tennessee, which overwhelmingly voted for Trump and his policies, can be difficult for a small business that is constantly battling constantly changing regulations that could hurt places like TailGate, but Keegan keeps politics out of it.\n\n\u201cThis state voted for this administration, and if they see the headlines, and the tariffs and things like that, they still don\u2019t want to feel the effects of something like an aluminum increase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change what they\u2019re rooting for, but it does mean they don\u2019t want to be paying any more either.\u201d\n\nTailGate, as well as 9,000 other small and independent brewers, are part of the Brewers Association, which has been more vocal in its displeasure with tariffs. The group said in a statement to CNN that the tariffs \u201ccould place a significant financial burden on brewers, many of whom rely on imported materials, ingredients, and equipment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese proposed tariffs could have far-reaching implications for brewers, consumers, and local economies, as they\u2019re likely to further increase the cost of craft beer, erode brewer margins, or a combination of both,\u201d a BA spokesperson said."

            "full_content": "FIRST ON FOX \u2013 GOP state attorneys general previewed their upcoming meeting Friday at the Department of Justice, where President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi will discuss collaborating with state top cops to combat crime.\n\nFox News Digital is told much of the conversation is expected to focus on fighting the scourge of fentanyl in communities.\n\nTrump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday previewing his Justice Department speech. He nodded to problems faced in cities, such as subway violence. \"We don't want to have crime in the streets. We don't want to have people pushed into subways and killed,\" Trump said. \"We want to have safety in our cities, as well as in our communities, and we'll be talking about immigration. We'll be talking about a lot of things. The complete gamut.\"\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares championed Bondi's \"proactive\" approach, saying he had received more calls from the DOJ in Trump's first 30 days in office than he did in his prior three years of service under the Biden administration.\n\n\"They keep open lines of communication. Whereas, before, the only time I ever heard from Merrick Garland was if he was trying to sue Virginia for some reason,\" Miyares told Fox News Digital.\n\nMiyares said he viewed the fentanyl epidemic as both a national security and domestic challenge, citing how an average of 105,000 Americans were dying every 12 months of addiction deaths at the peak of the crisis. By contrast, over 50,000 Americans died in the Vietnam War over the course of 15 years. \"It was two Vietnam wars happening every 12 months in this country to absolutely devastating impact. Virginia was not lost on that,\" Miyares said.\n\nFENTANYL'S FINANCIAL GRIP ON US SKYROCKETED TO $2.7T AT HEIGHT OF BIDEN ADMIN: STUDY\n\nVirginia has seen a 40% reduction in addiction deaths since 2021, one of the most significant drops in the country, Miyares said, arguing he and Gov. Glenn Youngkin's three-prong approach of prosecution, prevention and treatment can be applied nationally. He noted that Trump's nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, is currently serving as Virginia\u2019s Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security.\n\n\"He's going to be an exceptional, exceptional head of a DEA,\" Miyares said. \"He knows what we've done in Virginia because he's been part of it. I look forward to seeing him bring that nationwide.\"\n\nMiyares praised Trump's Inauguration Day executive order designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. As for the Biden administration, Miyares said he \"never felt that they took it as seriously.\" He said one federal agent told him the Biden administration discouraged posting about drug busts online, describing the attitude at the top of the bureaucracy as signaling,[ \"We don't want to admit we have a drug problem in this country.\"\n\n\"It was almost like an ostrich with its head in the sand. The other problem was the border. More fentanyl was crossing our southern border in one year to kill every man, woman and child in America three or four times over. It was staggering,\" Miyares said. \"The reality is the Sinaloa Cartel is the single most dangerous criminal enterprise, I would argue, in the history of the world, they have a reach that is staggering.\"\n\n\"It was President Trump who has declared the cartels a foreign terrorist organization. The Biden administration could have done so,\" Miyares said. \"These were criminal enterprises that, in my opinion, were conducting chemical warfare on everyday Americans to levels that we don't see even lost in war or happening to our kids, our friends and our neighbors. They are terrorist organizations.\"\n\nWith Democrats having lost control of both houses of Congress, Democratic attorneys general have led their party's charge against the Trump administration's agenda on a number of issues, including immigration. Miyares urged fellow state top cops across the aisle to \"lock arms and work together\" when it comes to the fentanyl epidemic, because \"it affects every American Republican or Democrat, red state or blue state.\"\n\n\"Make sure you do that partnership so we can save lives, because our real enemy is not the other political party,\" he said. \"Our real enemy are the cartels and these dealers poisoning our kids.\"\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday told Fox News Digital that keeping families together is a crucial component to public safety. He also said that Republicans must have a greater presence in inner cities long controlled by Democrats.\n\n\"The only way that we can maximize outcomes to keep people safe in this country is when we all work together. And having a Justice Department that's aligned with my philosophy of public safety, that without safe communities, nothing else matters, it puts us in a position where we can take that collaboration to the next level,\" Sunday said. \"Citizens have the absolute right to demand that their government works to keep them safe.\"\n\n\"As I go into this meeting tomorrow, I view this through a positive lens. This is an opportunity for us,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This epidemic not only is killing people. It's destroying our economy, and it's tearing families apart. And that's one of the absolute worst parts of this. You know that the family in America is one of the most crucial components to a thriving community and public safety.\"\n\n\"When you have addiction permeating our community, that tears families apart. And it's something that I absolutely do not want to see,\" Sunday said. \"Local law enforcement cannot do the job by themselves.\"\n\nSENATE DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'LL OPPOSE GOP FUNDING BILL AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINE LOOMS\n\nHe said from his experience as a local prosecutor that some of the \"most painful meetings I've ever had are with parents who've lost their children to addiction.\"\n\n\"The thought of having to watch a child slip away into the web of addiction and become someone that's not even, you know, the person that you knew. It's so gut-wrenching,\" he said.\n\nSunday said part of the conservative values important to him is \"keeping families together,\" explaining that he views his role as a father as \"my most important job.\" And fatherhood and family can be applied through a public safety lens. \"There's a lot of kids out there, especially in violent communities, that don't have any mentorship. They don't have anyone that looks after them,\" Sunday said.\n\nSunday praised the Trump administration's prioritization of border security, noting that fentanyl coming across from Mexico \"takes probably less than maybe 24 hours to arrive here in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nAs Pennsylvania experienced the turning of a red tide in the last election, Sunday said his focus as attorney general included inner cities plagued by open-air drug markets and other quality of life concerns. He spoke to Fox News Digital on Thursday from Philadelphia, where he was getting ready to attend the mayor's budget address \"so that people see the Republican attorney general is a part of Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"I'm here, and I'm not going away, and my resources are going to be here, and they're not going away because the citizens in Philadelphia have every right to demand that I work hard for them, just like anyone else,\" Sunday said. \"When you have, you know, one party like the Democrat control over a city like this, without the influence, you know, of, I'll say, a Republican prosecutor, that creates a situation like we've dealt with.\"\n\nSunday said he values both holding people accountable and redemption programs. A former district attorney in York County, Pennsylvania, which sits outside of Baltimore, Maryland, he said he worked every single day with the Black Ministers Association and with Latino organizations \"because they're victims of crime, just like everyone's a victim of crime.\"\n\n\"We live in this world right now where, you know, people make judgments about other people solely based on, you know, their political party,\" Sunday said. \"And there are a lot of citizens here that probably have never dealt with a Republican attorney general, even physically being here . . . I have seen amazing things happen when people talk to each other.\"\n\nAhead of Friday's meeting at the DOJ, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey championed the Trump administration's crackdown on China in fighting the fentanyl crisis.\n\n\"We must address the fentanyl crisis at its source and hold China accountable. They continue to supply Mexican drug cartels and terrorist organizations with the necessary components for fentanyl production, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands and causing untold suffering in our communities,\" Bailey said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Our recent $25 billion judgment against China for unleashing COVID-19 on the world is just one example of how attorneys general across the nation can begin fighting back against foreign actors who threaten our way of life.\"\n\nMississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch also applauded Trump \"for using tariffs as tools to take decisive action against the fentanyl crisis and put Americans\u2019 safety and our national security first.\"\n\n\"In Mississippi, we are primed and ready to partner with him,\" Fitch told Fox News Digital. \"We are raising awareness of the dangers of fentanyl and equipping citizens with the knowledge and tools to stop an overdose with our One Pill Can Kill Campaign. We are creating a network of law enforcement through our Fentanyl Strike Force to get this deadly drug and its dealers off the streets.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement to Fox News Digital that \"fentanyl has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and kills thousands more Tennesseans each year, a death toll that demands an uncompromising response.\" He said he was grateful that Trump and Bondi \"recognize the urgency of this crisis and are acting forcefully to save lives.\""

            "full_content": "Photo: Barry Williams/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nEric Adams is more than happy to be the Justice Department\u2019s yo-yo. Keep me on a string, bounce me back and forth, do what you will, the mayor\u2019s legal position goes, just so long as you dismiss my indictment and don\u2019t bring it back.\n\nThis remains the key point of contention as we play out the endgame of the Adams legal saga. It\u2019s now all but certain the Adams indictment will be dismissed, as both he and the new Justice Department leadership have requested. The only remaining question is whether the Trump administration can keep Adams dangling as its well-placed institutional plaything.\n\nQuick recap: The U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York in September 2024 indicted Adams for bribery, conspiracy, and federal election crimes primarily related to his acceptance of financial benefits from Turkish nationals in return for official favors. The case seemed sound, if not quite overwhelming; a trial jury could have come out either way.\n\nBut when the Trump administration took over in early 2025, acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove \u2014 former SDNY prosecutor and, more recently, Trump\u2019s criminal defense lawyer \u2014 ordered the SDNY to dismiss the indictment. Bove acknowledged that he had reached his conclusion \u201cwithout assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\u201d Rather, the new DOJ honcho explained, the prosecution \u201cunduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019s ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime\u201d in New York City, in furtherance of the president\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nThere\u2019s the crux of the problem: For the first time in modern history \u2014 perhaps ever \u2014 federal prosecutors explicitly gave a criminal defendant a free pass because he promised to support the president\u2019s political agenda. The SDNY\u2019s conservative, Trump-administration-appointed acting U.S. attorney, Danielle Sassoon, sharply rejected Bove\u2019s crooked order and resigned instead. \u201cI cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations,\u201d she wrote. At least a half-dozen other experienced prosecutors at the SDNY and Justice Department headquarters followed Sassoon out the door in protest.\n\nLast month, Judge Dale Ho called the parties into court to discuss the DOJ\u2019s unusual request; the federal rules of criminal procedure provide that a prosecutor must obtain \u201cleave of court\u201d \u2014 the judge\u2019s permission \u2014 to dismiss an indictment. The judge asked probing questions of Bove, who confirmed that the DOJ\u2019s decision was predicated on Adams\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s policy agenda \u2014 yet denied that there had been any quid pro quo between the parties. We are indeed rewarding Adams because of his political support and assistance, Bove explained, but not in (explicit) exchange for it. It\u2019s a mighty-thin tightrope.\n\nAt one ominous moment, Judge Ho asked whether a similar prosecution-for-politics calculation would apply to other cases involving public officials. \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d Bove confirmed. Apparently, this prosecution-for-politics approach will serve as a prototype for the new Trump DOJ. Wonderful news for all public officials: If you get indicted, you can always wriggle out of it by endorsing some unrelated Trump policy initiative.\n\nRecognizing that he had heard only from one side \u2014 Bove, Adams, and the defense team all heartily agreed on a dismissal, but Sassoon and other dissenters had no voice in the courtroom \u2014 Judge Ho took an unusual (but not unprecedented or unwarranted) step. He appointed Paul Clement, a respected conservative who served as U.S. solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, to study and report back on the knotty legal questions around whether and under what circumstances a judge must accept a request by the DOJ to dismiss an indictment.\n\nClement has now filed his report, and it is entirely sensible and well-supported in the law and logic. He concludes that \u201cneither the courts nor the citizenry can compel the executive to initiate a criminal prosecution,\u201d and judges are \u201cconstitutionally powerless to compel the government to proceed\u201d with a case that it wants to dismiss. Clement explains persuasively that, like it or not, it would violate core separation-of-powers principles for a judge to force prosecutors to carry on with a prosecution against the will of the executive branch.\n\nBut, critically, Clement concludes that the law does allow a judge to determine whether the DOJ can dismiss a case without prejudice (meaning the case can be refiled in the future) or with prejudice (meaning the case is dead for all time).\n\nThat\u2019s particularly important here, given that the DOJ insists that the Adams indictment be dismissed without prejudice. The Trump administration\u2019s plain intent is to keep the New York City mayor in line on immigration (and perhaps other) issues with a built-in enforcement mechanism for if he strays. Witness the Fox News cringefest wherein Trump \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan crowed, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come through, I\u2019ll be back in New York City, and we won\u2019t be sittin\u2019 on the couch, I\u2019ll be in his office, up his, up his butt, sayin\u2019, \u2018What the hell, where is the agreement we came to?\u2019\u201d Adams overlaughed nervously as Homan batted around his new plaything on national TV.\n\nClement called out the precise problem posed by the DOJ\u2019s proposal to keep Adams dangling: \u201cA dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution \u2026 could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the accused.\u201d Thus, Clement concluded, the Adams indictment should be dismissed with prejudice, ending the prosecution permanently and preventing the DOJ from resuscitating its case. Perversely (but probably correctly, legally), the law dictates that Adams must receive an even more valuable gift (dismissal with prejudice) than the one Bove initially meant to confer (dismissal without prejudice). It\u2019s good to be the mayor.\n\nWe should hear from the judge any day now, and I expect him to follow Clement\u2019s recommendation and dismiss the indictment with prejudice, effectively cutting the string that the DOJ would\u2019ve used to bounce Adams back and forth. But the whole saga reveals something deeper and more disturbing.\n\nAdams was willing to do absolutely anything necessary to escape the consequences of an indictment, including kissing up to the president, conforming the city\u2019s policies to please him and then offering himself up to the administration as a willing and pliable political operative moving forward. And the Justice Department was not content merely to reward Adams for his sycophancy. Rather, the Trump administration insisted on keeping control of the mayor, even beyond the end of the criminal case, by dangling the threat of a new prosecution.\n\nIf Judge Ho follows Clement\u2019s counsel and ends the case with prejudice, then at least the prospective political damage will be mitigated and Adams \u2014 and, by extension, the city he manages \u2013 won\u2019t remain completely in hock to the Trump administration. In a saga that has torpedoed the integrity of both Adams and the Justice Department, it\u2019s a small but vital consolation.\n\nThis article will also appear in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.

            "full_content": "The Trump administration unveiled new sanctions on Wednesday against an Iranian-linked Swedish gang that coordinated an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm in January 2024, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe sanctions freeze assets for members and those affiliated with the Foxtrot Network, a transnational criminal organization that the Treasury Department said is one of the most \"prominent\" drug trafficking organizations in the region. The sanctions also single out and target the group\u2019s fugitive leader, Rawa Majid.\n\n\"Iran\u2019s brazen use of transnational criminal organizations and narcotics traffickers underscores the regime\u2019s attempts to achieve its aims through any means, with no regard for the cost to communities across Europe,\" Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said in a Wednesday statement. \"Treasury, alongside our U.S. government and international partners, will continue to hold accountable those who seek to further Iran\u2019s thuggish and destabilizing agenda.\"\n\nTRUMP REINSTATES \u2018MAXIMUM PRESSURE\u2019 CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN\n\nIn addition to trafficking drugs, the Foxtrot Network is a criminal organization that conducts violent acts, including shootings, contract killings and assaults, and is responsible for increased violence in Sweden. It is notorious for employing teenagers to conduct these violent acts, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nIran has increasingly utilized criminal networks to conduct attacks targeting the U.S. as well as attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets in Europe, the Treasury Department said.\n\nFor example, the agency accused Iran of colluding with the Foxtrot Network to conduct an attack on the Israeli Embassy in 2024 after Swedish officials identified a \"dangerous object\" believed to be an explosive device at the embassy. While security forces neutralized the device, Sweden\u2019s security police moved to investigate the attack as a \"terrorist crime,\" according to Reuters.\n\nThe Treasury Department also said on Wednesday that Majid has coordinated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, which is already under U.S. sanctions, and faces charges in Sweden pertaining to narcotics and firearms trafficking.\n\nThe White House referred Fox News Digital to the Treasury and State Department's statements on the sanctions.\n\nThe sanctions against Majid and the Foxtrot Network align with President Donald Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign against Iran, which he reinstated in February through a series of sanctions aimed at sinking Iran\u2019s oil exports.\n\nTRUMP SAYS \u2018SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN VERY SOON' WITH IRAN AS HE PUSHES TO NEGOTIATE NUCLEAR DEAL\n\nTrump signaled Friday a nuclear deal with Iran could emerge shortly, and he revealed that he sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to push for Tehran to agree to a nuclear agreement. Otherwise, he said Tehran could count on facing military consequences.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I would rather negotiate a deal,\" Trump told Fox Business in an interview Sunday. \"I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily.\"\n\n\"But the time is happening now, the time is coming up,\" he said. \"Something is going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran, and I've written them a letter saying I hope you're going to negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them.\""

            "full_content": "Photo: Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nThe arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate and permanent legal resident, should horrify anyone who cares about the First Amendment in the United States of America. Khalil has not been accused of breaking any laws: He simply led raucous protests at Columbia against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A federal judge has ordered the government not to remove Khalil from the United States while his case is pending. We will see what happens next.\n\nThe Trump administration has not been subtle about its intentions. A White House official, speaking anonymously to the Free Press, told the right-leaning media organization that Khalil\u2019s arrest would be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for other actions. Khalil is a \u201cthreat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States,\u201d said the official. \u201cThe allegation here is not that he was breaking the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was mobilizing support for Hamas and spreading antisemitism in a way that is contrary to the foreign policy of the U.S.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have largely denounced the arrest, which is gratifying. Republicans have either cheered for Khalil\u2019s deportation or gone silent. A select number of pro-Israel hawks, like former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who is now running for mayor, have said little. A smaller segment of Democrats, fiercely supportive of Israel, have been satisfied to see the government take drastic action against an individual they believe is an antisemite and a menace to other students.\n\nBut even if being pro-Palestine or anti-Israel could be fully equated with antisemitism \u2014 the Jewish people are more than one nation-state in the Middle East \u2014 it would be absurd and dangerous to arrest and try to deport someone over political beliefs they espouse. There\u2019s no evidence Khalil is partnering with Hamas to try to overthrow the United States. If somehow Khalil had a literal link to Hamas, it wouldn\u2019t be much different than the Irish Americans who supported the ferociously violent IRA for decades. Or, more shockingly to most people today, the millions who backed Nelson Mandela, who remained on a U.S. terrorist watch list until 2008.\n\nAs disturbing and authoritarian as Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on nonviolent college protesters remains, it tragically belongs to a rich American tradition. For more than a century, presidents and federal law enforcement have abused their power to menace activists, typically on the left. Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Palmer Raids inaugurated the first Red Scare in the late 1910s, and J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI harassed, spied on, and infiltrated leftist and civil-rights organizations for many decades. The CIA\u2019s Operation CHAOS, less well-known than the FBI\u2019s notorious COINTELPRO, extensively surveilled antiwar, civil-rights, and women\u2019s-liberation organizations, holding files on thousands of American citizens.\n\nDeportation as a political weapon is not new, either. In the early years of the Great Depression, during the presidency of Herbert Hoover, more than a million people of Mexican descent were forcibly sent to Mexico. As many as 60 percent were American citizens, and they were targeted under the nativist assumption that they were responsible for stealing jobs that the stock-market crash had bled away.\n\nAfter 9/11, George W. Bush continued to expel immigrants under the auspices of the War on Terror. A 16-year-old girl who had emigrated from Bangladesh at the age of 5 was deported when the FBI found she was visiting an internet chat room containing sermons from a London imam encouraging suicide bombing. Federal authorities also wielded the threat of deportation to force immigrants to become informants. One 24-year-old Moroccan permanent resident who had immigrated legally was blocked from returning to the U.S. and had his green card suspended; he was threatened with detention if he did not inform against alleged terrorists.\n\nNone of this is to excuse what the Trump administration is seeking to do to Khalil and many other activists who are merely exercising their speech rights. It\u2019s merely to underscore that the American government has walked this dark and potentially bloody road before. On the issue of Israel, what\u2019s become clear is that the traditional \u2014 and more benign \u2014 approach of lusty support and soft propaganda through trips like Birthright (I briefly considered, and then turned down, such a free foray to Israel in college) have given way to furious suppression of any and all dissent. In the long run, much of this will backfire on American Jews who hope to inculcate an affection for the Jewish State in young people.\n\nRather than perceive any hope or glory in Zionism, these young people will associate it with the federal government\u2019s harassment of nonviolent activists. Any students targeted for deportation will be turned into martyrs for their cause. The generation gap around Israel will only swell. While a majority of Americans remain strongly supportive of Israel and Zionism broadly, younger voters are much more sympathetic to the Palestinians than prior generations. Their views are unlikely to shift with age, especially as the religious right continues to exert great sway over Israeli politics and the bipartisan consensus around unconditionally backing Israel breaks down.\n\nIn the short term, pro-Israel hawks will be successful in the United States because they have Trump on their side and colleges are terrified of losing federal funding. They see Trump freezing grants to Columbia and wealthy donors demanding fresh investigations into antisemitism on college campuses that conflate the genuine article with advocacy for dying Gazans. Activists have every reason to worry as college administrators seek to clamp down on political organizing. But what they should also take heart in is the fact that the median American teenager with a social conscience is going to look on at the Khalil arrest with great horror.\n\nFor pro-Israel hawks who dream of converting the young American masses to their cause, who hope to make Palestinian activism anathema to all that is right and true, all of this does the opposite. To any sane American, arresting and deporting Khalil is indefensible. Whatever overreach pro-Palestinian activists can be accused of \u2014 virtually all of it boils down to language and little more \u2014 none of it compares to the boot heel of the federal government crashing down on the people who legally live here. This is what Trumpism looks like."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that she plans to mobilize her massive base of followers to oppose what she described as an \u201cacquiesce\u201d by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept the House GOP funding bill.\n\n\u201cI think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, where House Democrats are huddling for their annual policy retreat. She said she and her fellow Democrats are \u201ctexting, calling, sending carrier pigeons,\u201d to mobilize the Democratic base against Schumer\u2019s plan to allow the GOP funding bill to advance.\n\nAnd she slammed Senate Democrats for their decision to \u201ccompletely roll over and give up on protecting the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Senate Democrats need new leadership, Ocasio-Cortez would say only that she is focused on how to prevent her party from accepting the GOP bill.\n\n\u201cWe have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no. We can correct course, and that is the most important thing in front of us right now,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nThe New York Democrat has been among the most vocal Democratic officials nationwide in the push against the House GOP funding bill. Using her social accounts, Ocasio-Cortez has urged fellow Democrats across the country to exert maximum pressure on their own senators on the funding bill, which is the first major point of leverage in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nPrivately, House Democrats are so infuriated with Schumer\u2019s decision that some have begun encouraging her to run against Schumer in a primary, according to a Democratic member who directly spoke with Ocasio-Cortez about running at the caucus\u2019 policy retreat. Multiple Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and others directly encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run on Thursday night after Schumer\u2019s announcement, this member said.\n\nThe member said that Democrats in Leesburg were \u201cso mad\u201d that even centrist Democrats were \u201cready to write checks for AOC for Senate,\u201d adding that they have \u201cnever seen people so mad.\u201d\n\nAsked by CNN about fellow Democrats encouraging her to challenge Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez declined to answer and said she was focused on keeping Democrats from backing the funding bill: \u201cWe still have an opportunity to correct course here, and that is my number one priority.\u201d\n\nBut speaking to reporters, Ocasio-Cortez did not hold back on her criticism of Senate Democrats for backing out of a vote that all but one battleground House Democrat was willing to take.\n\n\u201cThere are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare,\u201d she said. \u201cJust to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a huge slap in the face. And I think there is a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as currently planned.\u201d"

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday saluted the heroic canines who \"defend our citizens and our homeland.\"\n\nNational K-9 Veterans Day is an annual March 13 celebration of \"canine courage,\" and the bravery of military and police dogs.\n\n\"Serving on the front lines, in combat zones, and at our borders, these fearless four-legged fighters are an invaluable part of protecting America,\" Trump said in a Thursday message to commemorate the day.\n\nIn the military, more than 30,000 \"dedicated working dogs\" \u2014 with 1,600 working dogs actively serving \u2014 have provided frontline support to U.S. service members, according to the White House.\n\nThese warriors are trained in detecting explosives and drugs, and assisting in search and rescue operations.\n\nFamous military working dogs include Army Special Operations Forces dog Conan \u2014 the 50-combat-mission veteran named after late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien \u2014 who helped track Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi when he was killed in October 2019 in Syria. Conan was injured on the mission but made a full recovery.\n\nCONAN, A DOG INJURED IN AL BAGHDADI RAID, HONORED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AT WHITE HOUSE\n\nIn 2019 at the White House, Trump gave a medal and plaque to Conan, who had been assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta. The doggo later was adopted by his former handler and passed away in 2023.\n\n\n\nWhite House protector and most decorated K-9 in U.S. history, Hurricane, died in February after more than a decade in the Secret Service.\n\nThe 16-year-old Belgian Malnois \u2014 whose accolades included a Secret Service Award for Meritorious Service, Distinguished Service Medal and Department of Homeland Security Secretary\u2019s Award for Valor \u2014 made a national name for himself after taking down an intruder who had breached the White House gate in 2014.\n\nMere yards away were former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, watching a movie in the White House theater, according to The New York Times.\n\n\n\nWHITE HOUSE PROTECTOR AND MOST DECORATED K-9 IN US HISTORY DIES: \u2018A VERY GOOD BOY\u2019\n\nIn 2022, Hurricane was one of three dogs to become the first recipients of the Animals in War & Peace Distinguished Service Medal on Capitol Hill \u2014 earning him a spot among the famed Guinness World Records.\n\nHe received the award alongside Yorkshire Terrier and World War II Army Air Corps veteran Smoky, who helped lay communication wires in the Philippines, and Coast Guard explosive detection dog Feco, a Hungarian Vizsla who at the time had conducted more than 365 bomb searches, according to the records book.\n\nTrump also nodded to now-deceased SEAL Team Six operator veteran Cairo, who played a significant role in the raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May 2011, and Marine veteran Rex, who \"saved countless lives by detecting explosives in combat in Iraq.\"\n\nThe German shepherd served alongside Corps Cpl. Megan Leavey, whose heroic service with the dog was depicted in the 2017 film namesake.\n\nDOG THAT SERVED OUR NATION IS REUNITED WITH ITS FORMER AIR FORCE HANDLER: \u2018IT\u2019S BEEN A BLESSING'\n\nTrump said Thursday, \"As we remember the fallen, we thank all of the brave veterans of the K-9 Corps who protect the American people and our way of life, living up to the name of man\u2019s best friend.\"\n\nFox News Digital\u2019s Emma Colton contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Summary Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will vote for Republicans' stopgap spending bill, backing down in Democrats' first big leverage point in President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nThe decision stunned many Democrats, especially House members who opposed the GOP bill.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries defended his caucus's opposition, saying they stood against Trump and 'extreme MAGA Republicans.'\n\nMany Democrats expect the vote Friday to reflect a generational divide in the chamber, with freshmen senators like Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Ruben Gallego of Arizona firmly opposed to the funding bill.\n\nIn order to avert a shutdown, at least eight Senate Democrats need to vote to allow the bill to move forward.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nVeteran Democrats privately believed Chuck Schumer\u2019s decision on the shutdown was inevitable. Others were ready for the top Senate Democrat to lead them into their first big battle against President Donald Trump \u2014 and instead have been left fuming.\n\nSchumer\u2019s declaration Thursday night that he would vote for Republicans\u2019 stopgap spending bill, backing down in the party\u2019s first big leverage point in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term has confirmed a dire political reality for his caucus: Democrats had no good options left to avert a government shutdown with just hours to go until the deadline.\n\n\u201cIf we go into a shutdown, and I told my caucus this, there\u2019s no off-ramp. The total off-ramp of a shutdown, how you stop a shutdown, is totally determined by the Republican House and Senate, and that is totally determined because they\u2019ve shown complete blind obeisance [to] Trump, DOGE, etc. They could keep us in a shutdown for months and months and months,\u201d Schumer told reporters Thursday night.\n\nThe Democratic leader\u2019s decision privately disappointed many in his caucus, and stunned his House colleagues across the US Capitol \u2014 leaving the party deeply divided on the path ahead at a moment when their base is clamoring for a strong response against Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s actions to radically reshape the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe are in a perverse, bizarro land where we\u2019re having to decide between letting Donald Trump wreck the government this way or wreck the government that way,\u201d New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said of Democrats\u2019 predicament.\n\nIt\u2019s a moment that has been months in the making. Still, top Democrats in Congress struggled to find a cohesive message and strategy that would allow them room to fight without the potential risk of what it would mean if thousands of government workers were suddenly thrust into more uncertainty with a shutdown.\n\nPerhaps the clearest sign of the dilemma: Their top two leaders took opposite paths, with Schumer deciding to vote for the GOP plan that top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries has spent a full week bashing.\n\n\u201cDr. King once made the observation that, although everyone may not see it at the moment, the time is always right to do what\u2019s right. This week, House Democrats did what was right. We stood up against Donald Trump. We stood up against Elon Musk. We stood up against the extreme MAGA Republicans,\u201d Jeffries said to applause in Leesburg, Virginia, at a party retreat Thursday night, according to a person in the room. \u201cWe can defend that vote because we stood on the side of the American people.\u201d\n\nWhen the Senate votes Friday, many Democrats expect the vote to reflect the generational divide in the chamber. Freshmen senators, like Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Ruben Gallego of Arizona \u2014 who many believed would vote for the bill because they hold seats in states Trump won in November \u2014 instead remained firmly opposed and signaled they wanted to use the funding bill to fight the president. And the disconnect reflects a simmering tension that runs through the Democratic Party far beyond Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pissed,\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern told CNN shortly after Schumer\u2019s floor speech. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll toughen up for the fight on reconciliation, I don\u2019t know. \u2026 This guy [Trump] is ruining the country. And you know, I just expected more fight.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have been handwringing over how to handle the shutdown for months. The decision between voting for a shutdown and voting for a bill many believe has serious cuts in funding to programs that are important for Democrats has led to marathon party lunches, endless discussion and little clarity on what many Democrats would ultimately do.\n\nIn order to avert a shutdown, at least eight Senate Democrats need to vote to allow the bill to move forward. Four sources familiar with the discussions said Schumer spent Thursday privately asking members whether they planned to advance the House-passed spending bill that would fund the government until the end of September. And after a lengthy lunch Thursday, several senators who spoke on the condition of anonymity to privately discuss internal party deliberations, told CNN they believed the votes would be there on their side to avert a shutdown.\n\n\u201cI believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country to minimize the harms to the American people,\u201d Schumer said on the floor Thursday in a highly anticipated speech that made clear Democrats would lend the votes needed by the GOP to keep the government open.\n\nStill, several Democrats dug in against the bill as the week stretched on. Gallego announced Thursday he\u2019d vote no, as did a half dozen others, citing concerns over cuts to programs and arguments that voting for the stopgap measure would only embolden Trump and Musk to continue reprogramming money that was already part of previous spending bills.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves. This is a bad resolution that gives Elon Musk and his cronies permission to continue cutting veterans\u2019 benefits, slashes resources for Arizona\u2019s water needs and abandons our wildland firefighters. I can\u2019t stand by that, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m voting no,\u201d Gallego said in a statement.\n\nEven retiring senators like Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota announced she was opposed to the bill on both a procedural vote to advance the measure and on the final vote.\n\nAdding to the mounting frustration, Senate Democrats have complained their party leaders have not been more decisive on how to proceed. The day before Schumer told his caucus he would vote to advance the bill, the Democratic leader went to the Senate floor and said his caucus was united against a vote to advance it.\n\n\u201cHow on earth could we find ourselves in this position? We knew this was coming. We have no plan. We are getting blamed. Progressives are really agitated,\u201d one senior Democratic aide told CNN. \u201cWe have a case to make. We just have not had the leadership and guidance on how to prosecute that.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democratic senators who were asked to respond to questions about their party\u2019s strategy and if it had been effective declined to comment.\n\n\u201cLook, my frustration right now is that this bill is not a CR. It is a brand new budget bill and it is going to cut veteran services by $1.2 billion, FEMA by $300 million, cut wildfire firefighters and water in Arizona and the fact that Trump thinks that\u2019s a good thing for this country astounds me and I\u2019ll think about the other question at a later time and date once we get past this,\u201d Gallego told reporters.\n\nThirty miles away, as more than 100 House Democrats gathered for their policy retreat, lawmakers\u2019 mouths were agape at reports that Schumer was planning to vote with Republicans. Privately, they fumed at his reversal \u2014 a direct contraction of their position that nearly their entire caucus took just 48 hours earlier. Some called on him to lose his position as leader.\n\nBut most declined to comment publicly, wary, they said, of deepening the ugly divide within the Democratic Party. One senior aide described the House Democrats\u2019 reaction as \u201ccollectively ripsh*t.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Democrats pointed to several miscalculations made by their party. For one, most Senate Democrats never thought the House could pass a stopgap funding measure with just Republican votes. Then, Speaker Mike Johnson \u2013 with major muscle from Trump \u2013 convinced more than 30 conservatives who just months ago voted against another stopgap spending bill to vote for one.\n\nSome Senate Democrats expressed intense frustration with the attacks they faced from House colleagues, who they believe have painted them into a corner after they had the privilege of voting against a spending bill without directly risking a shutdown. The bill passed out of the House with almost every single Republican voting \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nToo few Democrats voting \u201cyes\u201d in the Senate could trigger a shutdown. Meanwhile, some progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been urging their constituents to flood the phone lines of Democratic senators to lobby them to vote against the bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating to see these tweets,\u201d one Democratic Senate staffer told CNN.\n\nAnother Democratic office told CNN that their phone lines had been so inundated with calls from the base that they\u2019d received more than 4,000 phone calls in a single day.\n\n\u201cI think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters.\n\n\u201cThere are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare. Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a slap in the face.\u201d\n\nAnd House Democrats \u2013 before it was clear that Schumer intended to back down \u2013 defended their decision to amplify pressure on the Senate.\n\n\u201cGod gave the Senate six-year terms for a reason,\u201d centrist Rep. Scott Peters told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m in the fight. We\u2019ve done what we can do. We need them to do what they can do.\u201d\n\nRep. Susie Lee, a Democrat who represents a tough swing seat in Nevada, told CNN she\u2019s personally made the pitch to her state\u2019s two senators.\n\n\u201cThey have the House and the Senate and the presidency. They made a choice to not negotiate with us,\u201d Lee said. The Nevada Democrat acknowledged that Senate Democrats had a \u201cfear\u201d of a shutdown. But she argued that Democrats could easily explain to their voters that it was the Republicans, not their own party, that triggered the funding lapse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard task. It\u2019s their government. They have the majority,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think that they need to own it.\u201d"
