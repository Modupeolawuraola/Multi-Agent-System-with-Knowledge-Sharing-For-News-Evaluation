            "full_content": "Thousands of Afghans approved for travel after helping the U.S. are stuck in limbo\n\nIn August 2021, Tamim Satari raced to the Kabul International Airport to evacuate Afghanistan after working with the American military as an intelligence officer, helping U.S. forces coordinate aerial bomb campaigns against the Taliban. But in the chaos of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.\n\n\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.\n\nHe was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.\n\nThree years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.\n\n\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"\n\nHe says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.\n\nVanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies immigrate to the U.S.\n\nSince 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.\n\nThis includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.\n\n\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.\n\n\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"\n\nAfter trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.\n\nOn Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.\n\nTamim Satari is reunited with his son at Newark Liberty International Airport in January after they were separated in Afghanistan in 2021. CBS News\n\nThe Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.\n\nThree days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"\n\nA federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.\n\nAccording to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.\n\n\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.\n\n\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.\n\nMcCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.\n\n\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.\n\nAfghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. They go through several in-person interviews and their biometrics are checked against government databases, in addition to extensive medical screening.\n\n\"Afghans who come to this country via the CARE program are the most vetted immigrant population in our country's history,\" said a former State Department official.\n\nSatari remains hopeful he will not be one of the last to be reunited with his family. He has settled in New Jersey and is employed in a mechanical job while he studies for his real estate license.\n\n\"I have a lot of hope in the future. I would like to have a great life,\" Satari said. \"I am responsible for taking care of my son, to enroll in school and start lessons over there. I have a big hope.\""

            "full_content": "Summary Indian authorities have arrested Aleksej Besciokov, who was wanted by the US for allegedly running a $96 billion cryptocurrency exchange that facilitated money laundering.\n\nThe arrest follows a US-led manhunt that included seizing the crypto exchange and freezing $26 million in assets.\n\nBesciokov, a Lithuanian man, was apprehended in Kerala, India, and US officials are expected to pursue his extradition.\n\nThe arrest comes less than a week after the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and Aleksandr Mira Serda, a Russian man, for allegedly running Garantex.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIndian authorities have arrested a Lithuanian man wanted by the US for allegedly running a $96 billion cryptocurrency exchange that allowed terrorist organizations, drug traffickers and cybercriminals to launder money.\n\nThe arrest caps an intense US-led manhunt for Aleksej Besciokov, that escalated last week with the seizure of the crypto exchange, the freezing of $26 million in assets and the unsealing of an indictment against Besciokov and an alleged accomplice.\n\nThe US is expected to pursue Besciokov\u2019s extradition to the US Eastern District of Virginia in what would be a big win in the yearslong battle against money laundering services that allegedly fuel global crime and terrorism. The arrest shows that while the Trump administration has eased up pressure on Russia in some areas, such as offensive cyber operations, the Justice Department is still aggressively pursuing accused criminals with a connection to Russia.\n\nBesciokov had been living in Russia, according to the Justice Department. It is unclear why Besciokov traveled to India.\n\nPolice in the southwest Indian state of Kerala arrested Besciokov this week, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that referred to Besciokov as a \u201cfugitive.\u201d\n\nThis screenshot shows the Garantex website which the US Justice Department, in coordination with Germany and Finland, disrupted and took down. The cryptocurrency exchange website allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations \u2014 including terrorist organizations \u2014 and sanctions violations, according to the US Justice Department. From Garantex.org\n\n\u201cI can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States,\u201d US Justice Department spokesperson Nicole Navas Oxman told CNN in an email. She declined to comment further.\n\nCNN has been unable to reach a lawyer representing Besciokov.\n\nThe arrest comes less than a week after the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and Aleksandr Mira Serda, a Russian man, for allegedly running Garantex. Besciokov was in charge of keeping Garantex online and running its infrastructure, while Mira Serda was the exchange\u2019s co-founder and \u201cchief commercial officer,\u201d according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe Besciokov case is an example of how putting accused money launderers in handcuffs is the surest way to disrupt their activity. The US Treasury Department sanctioned Garantex in 2022. In response, Besciokov and others \u201credesigned Garantex\u2019s operations\u201d to evade sanctions and dupe US businesses into working with Garantex, according to the Justice Department. The exchange processed $96 billion in transactions between 2015 and 2019, according to the indictment."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we explore the next steps in the shutdown battle after Senate Democrats said they would block the GOP\u2019s government funding bill. Plus, Andrea Mitchell examines how the U.S. might convince Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nSenate Democrats make their move in the shutdown fight\n\nAs we wrote yesterday, the House\u2019s passage of a Republican stopgap funding bill has put Senate Democrats in a bind: Either back a measure they disapprove of and give up some of the only leverage they will have on major legislation this year, or reject it and allow a government shutdown to occur.\n\nThat bind was on full display today as they debated their next moves with the government set to run out of money in just over 48 hours.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer finally staked out his position, saying Democrats wouldn\u2019t provide the votes to pass the GOP\u2019s six-month continuing resolution. The measure requires 60 votes to advance in the Senate, and Republicans only control 53 seats.\n\n\u201cFunding the government should be a bipartisan effort but Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input \u2014 any input \u2014 from congressional Democrats. Because of that, Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nInstead, he called for a one-month funding bill to provide more time to both sides to negotiate a deal.\n\n\u201cOur caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s remarks on the Senate floor came after a lunch meeting among Democratic senators. Outside the room, reporters could hear senators loudly making their point to their colleagues.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said they want to have the ability to propose changes to the bill.\n\n\u201cThere are not the votes right now to pass it,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cDemocrats had nothing to do with this bill. And we want an opportunity to get an amendment vote or two. And so that\u2019s what we are insisting on.\u201d\n\nStill, some Democrats fear that a shutdown would be worse than accepting the bill.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, both outcomes are bad,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said. \u201cElections have consequences, but this is an extreme bill. If it passes, it will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground. If the government shuts down, that will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground, and so that is the dilemma in which we found ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m weighing the badness of each option,\u201d added Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democratic leaders urged their Senate counterparts to vote down the GOP funding bill as they kicked off a three-day policy retreat.\n\nRead more from Sahil Kapur, Ryan Nobles, Julie Tsirkin and Frank Thorp V \u2192\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWhat comes next in the Russia-Ukraine ceasefire talks\n\nBy Andrea Mitchell\n\nPresident Donald Trump said \u201cit is up to Russia now\u201d to agree to the monthlong ceasefire proposed by the U.S. and accepted by Ukraine.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz has now spoken to his Russian counterpart. White House envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to be flying from Qatar to Moscow to close the deal. There\u2019s talk of a Trump call to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the offing. During the past week, the administration pummeled Ukrainian President Zelenskyy into submission by withholding weapons and intelligence from Ukraine.\n\nWhat leverage does the U.S. have with Putin? Trump said today he could \u201cdo things financially that would be very bad for Russia.\u201d He has mentioned the possibility of sanctions, but with China, North Korea and Iran helping keep Russia afloat, existing sanctions on Russia have been largely ineffective.\n\nAnd in almost all of Trump\u2019s statements and actions since returning to the White House, he is again demonstrating an affinity for the Russian president. When Russia was, by Trump\u2019s own admission, \u201cbombing the hell out of Ukraine\u201d after the U.S. halted military aid, Trump said he still thought Putin wanted peace, saying \u201che\u2019s doing what anybody else would do.\u201d\n\nDespite U.S. assessments that Russian-based hackers are responsible for Salt Typhoon, a massive hacking of U.S. targets, the administration is firing top counterintelligence experts at the CIA and FBI, and welcoming back Russian diplomatic missions previously expelled from the U.S. for espionage activities. The U.S. also sided with Russia, China and Belarus at the United Nations against a resolution supporting Ukraine. And all of this comes amid Trump\u2019s continual searing criticism of NATO and the European Union, stunning America\u2019s traditional Western allies and closest \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence partners.\n\nWith Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying \u201cthe ball is in Russia\u2019s court,\u201d it is likely in Russia\u2019s interest to accept the ceasefire and instead try to defeat Zelenskyy at the negotiating table. Clearly, tortuous negotiations lie ahead over territory, security guarantees, reparations, NATO membership and more in a war that has been a \u201cmeat grinder,\u201d to use Walz\u2019s term.\n\nSo despite White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, \u201cWe are at the 10th-yard line and the president is expecting the Russians to help us run this into the end zone,\u201d it would be wise to avoid declaring \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d\n\nThe Trump effect goes overseas\n\nA party that has sharply criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to take over Greenland secured a surprise election victory Tuesday in the Danish territory, but it may have to govern with a partner with a far warmer view of the U.S. president, Astha Rajvanshi reports.\n\nThe center-right, pro-business Demokraatit party, which favors a gradual move toward independence from Denmark, won 30% of the total vote share, not enough to single-handedly rule the Arctic territory. The party will instead need to partner with opponents to form a coalition.\n\nForemost among those other parties is the second-placed opposition party Naleraq, which won a quarter of the vote share, favors rapid independence and has reserved warm words for the Trump administration.\n\nThe victory of two parties who favor independence \u2014 seceding from Denmark is broadly popular in Greenland \u2014 may be taken as a positive in Washington, where interest in the world\u2019s largest island has sharply jumped since Trump began his second term.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2b05\ufe0f Heading toward the exits: Sen.

            "full_content": "How new tariffs could make beer more expensive\n\nSweeping 25% tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports could cause prices on a range of consumers foods, including cars and washing machines, to rise. Components used in manufacturing and for construction such as nails, could also become more expensive.\n\nAnything that's made with metal, from homes and cars to canned foods and beverages could soon get a new and higher price tag.\n\n\"All manufacturing that uses steel or aluminum, or uses something that uses steel and aluminum will be affected,\" international trade expert Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nDr. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank, called the forthcoming tariff impact \"a barn burner,\" leading to higher prices and an economic slowdown.\n\nHe added that all \"broad-based core commodities\" are vulnerable to price hikes as a result of the levies. In addition to automobiles and electronics, which rely heavily on metals, that includes less obvious goods like canned goods, whose prices could rise if packaging costs jump.\n\n\"We are going to see it in places you don't expect it,\" Winegarden said.\n\nAmerican consumers likely to see higher prices on cars and more\n\nCar, truck, bus and tractor parts were the largest import category by volume last year, that will be covered under the tariffs, according to the United States International Trade Commission.\n\nAmerican Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the new tariffs \"will add significant costs for automakers, suppliers and consumers\" in a statement to CBS News.\n\nInevitably, some of those added costs will be passed along to consumers.\n\n\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices. Makers of vehicles will face higher costs, which will be passed on to consumers,\" Layna Mosley, politics and international affairs professor at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nMetal parts on doors, window frames and other hardware used in the construction of housing will also be subject to the levies, leading to growing costs for homebuilders.\n\nJim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to estimates showing that the metal tariffs could add up to $10,000 to the cost of a home, although he noted it is likely to take months for the impact to become clear. \"Those costs are going to be passed on to the ultimate homeowner or renter,\" he told CBS News.\n\nMachine parts, including steel wires, screws and more are also likely to be hit, raising the price of a broad range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners.\n\n\"Just look around the house. Anything that has steel or aluminum in it will be exposed to tariffs,\" McDaniel said.\n\nGym and sports equipment will also be tariffed, though manufacturers may have stockpiled some materials in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect, enabling them to head off price hikes for a short period, Mosley noted.\n\nHigher price for aluminum cans\n\nIn addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.\n\nCoca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.\n\n\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"\n\n\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"\n\nFor Brooklyn-based brewery Talea, the tariffs on aluminum, which the company uses for its beer cans, could lead to higher operating costs, co-founder LeAnn Darland recently told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady. Darland said she hopes to share any increased costs with suppliers, because she's not sure consumers will be willing to swallow any price hikes.\n\nEven without the tariffs, said Darland, \"Sometimes we get complaints that our beer is too expensive.\"\n\n\u2014CBS News' Natalie Brand contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "The soon-to-be-retired Senate veteran Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Photo: Nathan Posner/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats anxious to deny Donald Trump and his Republican Party a governing trifecta as soon as possible are feeling pretty good about their prospects for flipping the House in 2026, given the GOP\u2019s fragile margin of control and the historical pattern of sizable midterm losses for the president\u2019s party. But the Senate, which has the power to confirm Trump\u2019s executive branch and judicial nominations, is really going to be a reach. Democrats would need to flip four Senate seats to win control of the chamber. And an already difficult landscape is being made even tougher by the retirements of Democratic incumbents Gary Peters of Michigan, Tina Smith of Minnesota, and now Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. All three of these open seats could potentially trigger competitive races in 2026.\n\nOf the three retirees, Shaheen certainly has the best case for having earned the right to call it a day. She\u2019s 78 years old (Peters is 66 and Smith is 67) and is completing her third full Senate term. Before that, she served three two-year terms as governor of New Hampshire. There\u2019s also a robust Democratic bench in her state; both current U.S. House members, Chris Pappas and Maggie Goodlander (along with former congresswoman Annie Kuster), are considering races to succeed Shaheen.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown publicly indicated interest in this seat the minute Shaheen announced her retirement. Brown gained global renown by winning a 2010 special election to fill the Senate seat of the late Ted Kennedy in a huge upset that nearly derailed the passage of the Affordable Care Act. After losing the seat in 2012 to Elizabeth Warren, he moved back to his native New Hampshire and ran against Shaheen in 2014, losing by three points in a very good year for Republicans. He has plenty of name ID but would be less formidable than the GOP\u2019s dream candidate, former governor Chris Sununu, who passed up a Senate race in 2024 but hasn\u2019t ruled out a run for Shaheen\u2019s seat.\n\nLooking at the big picture, as Nathaniel Rakich points out, these retirements are probably better timed for Democrats in 2026 than in an election year when Republicans are more likely to have the wind at their back. But still, given the emergency represented by Trump 2.0, the future is now for Democrats, and having to fight to hang on to three seats they currently hold reduces their already slim odds for regaining the Senate. According to the Cook Political Report\u2019s race ratings, there are only three Republican-held Senate seats up in 2026 that are anything other than a lock for the GOP: those held by Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina (both rated \u201cLean R\u201d) and Jon Husted of Ohio (rated \u201cLikely R\u201d). Meanwhile, four Democratic-held Senate seats are vulnerable: the races to fill the Shaheen and Smith seats are rated \u201cLean D,\u201d while the contest over Peters\u2019s seat and a likely big-time challenge to incumbent Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff are rated as \u201cToss Ups.\u201d Even if 2026 turns out to be a very good year for Democrats, it\u2019s hard to see where that fourth flipped seat would come from and easy to see possibilities for losses."

            "full_content": "FIRST ON FOX: A longtime ally of California Gov. Gavin Newsom repeatedly helped a now-former CCP official while she was serving as the Chinese consul in San Francisco, according to a LinkedIn post unearthed by Fox News Digital.\n\nYing He, who served as the Chinese consul general in San Francisco between 2012 and 2016, lavished praise on Darlene Chiu-Bryant in a 2017 LinkedIn recommendation, calling the former Newsom aide and longtime ally of the governor a \"Super lady.\"\n\n\"Darlene is the right person when you need to develop business (sic) in either California or Beijing,\" said He, who was serving as the division director for the Ministry of Commerce, a CCP government arm, at the time of the 2017 LinkedIn post. \"She is an excellent PR professional and able to fulfill the most challenging tasks. She helped me a lot when I was consul in SF, promoting US-Sino investment and trade. In all, she is a friend in need and a Super Lady indeed.\"\n\nHe\u2019s LinkedIn reveals that she has served in multiple roles at the Ministry of Commerce for over a decade and her profile boasts that she has \"extensive connections with Chinese and U.S. governments\" and \"15+ years with a Chinese central government agency and 4 years as a diplomat in San Francisco.\"\n\nCONGRESS EXPOSES CHINA'S POTENTIAL LOOPHOLE FOR TRUMP TARIFFS: 'DRAWING A LINE IN THE SAND'\n\nAt the time of the LinkedIn post, Bryant was serving as the executive director of ChinaSF, which is facing renewed scrutiny for its ties to the CCP and recruiting over 100 Chinese companies into San Francisco, according to a new book Fox News Digital exclusively reported on Monday. In the book, there is a chapter dedicated to how Newsom helped launch a nonprofit organization almost a decade earlier, in 2008.\n\nOne of the several companies discussed in the book was Suntech, a Chinese solar company developed by the CCP that was personally recruited by Newsom into the U.S., and he publicly praised the company\u2019s CEO, Dr. Zhengrong Shi, multiple times, and made him an advisory board member for ChinaSF.\n\nIn addition to green energy companies that streamed through ChinaSF, real estate companies were also involved, and the book alleges that Newsom received over $23,000 in anonymous contributions from Chinese real estate company Z&L, whose billionaire owner was criminally sentenced for bribing a San Francisco government official. In 2017, ChinaSF posted a photo of Bryant, Newsom and others in front of a wall that said Z&L Properties.\n\n\"ChinaSF was started by our Lt Governor Gavin Newsom when he was Mayor of San Francisco in 2008,\" the photo caption said. \"Proud to work with our partners and companies recruited to the SF Bay Area.\"\n\nAccording to China Daily, a Chinese state media outlet, Newsom launched the group while visiting Shanghai.\n\n\"The two most important things for us are energy independence and establishing a stronger relationship with China,\" Newsom said ahead of the trip.\n\nTHE PLAN TO CONFRONT CHINA AND KICK OUT COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM THE U.S.\n\nBryant, who traveled with Newsom to China in 2005 when she was serving as his deputy communications director and would later be tapped to run ChinaSF, was repeatedly mentioned in a chapter in the new book, \"Fool's Gold: The Radicals, Con Artists, and Traitors Who Killed the California Dream and Now Threaten Us All.\"\n\nIn the book, authors Susan Crabtree and Jedd McFatter make the case that ChinaSF served as a gateway for CCP officials and Chinese criminals to exploit California. In addition to the book exposing how Bryant was referred to locally as \"the Fixer\" for any Chinese businesses \"wanting to make hay in San Francisco,\" her personal Facebook profile and other Facebook pages are littered with photos showing her involvement with ChinaSF. There are also several photos of her and Newsom, in addition to other California politicians.\n\nIn 2019, GlobalSF posted a photo of Newsom and Bryant at an event. The photo caption, which appears to be written by Bryant, called Newsom a \"visionary leader.\"\n\n\"So good to see my ex boss now Governor of our Golden State of [California], [Gavin Newsom],\" the post said. \"As a visionary leader, he started [ChinaSF] in 2008 to be the China Desk for the city and county of [San Francisco] to facilitate inbound investment.\"\n\nAnother photo on Facebook shows Bryant attending Newsom's inauguration in early 2019.\n\nFox News Digital has previously reported on another prominent Chinese consul general, Huang Ping, who oversaw the office in New York City for several years and often promoted CCP propaganda while publicly denying the alleged Uyghur genocide in China.\n\nIn addition to his controversial public statements, Ping would often travel to U.S. universities and other events, meeting with business leaders and elected officials, sparking concerns from some about potential influence peddling for the CCP.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party is playing for keeps at the nuclear level and every layer below that,\" Michael Sobolik, author of \"Countering China\u2019s Great Game: A Strategy for American Dominance,\" told Fox News Digital last year. \"And it's not just the universities. The Chinese Communist Party is looking to infiltrate every aspect of American society.\"\n\n\"If we try to edit undo our way out of this whole list of infiltrations and threats that the CCP sends our direction that's good policy work. We need to insulate ourselves. But good housekeeping is the bare minimum of waging a cold war and winning a cold war,\" Sobolik added.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment and received a response pointing to an article about conspiracy theories with the headline, \"Conspiracy theorists really do see the world differently, new study shows.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Bryant, but did not receive a response by press time."

            "full_content": "Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nNo one is going to rank Mike Johnson among the great arm-twisting Speakers of the House, like Henry Clay, Tom Reed, Sam Rayburn, or even Nancy Pelosi. Indeed, he still resembles Winston Churchill\u2019s description of Clement Atlee as \u201ca modest man with much to be modest about.\u201d\n\nBut nonetheless, in the space of two weeks, Johnson has managed to get two huge and highly controversial measures through the closely divided House: a budget resolution that sets the stage for enactment of Donald Trump\u2019s entire legislative agenda in one bill, then an appropriations bill keeping the federal government operating until the end of September while preserving the highly contested power of Trump and his agents to cut and spend wherever they like.\n\nDespite all the talk of divisions between the hard-core fiscal extremists of the House Freedom Caucus and swing-district \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans, Johnson lost just one member \u2014 the anti-spending fanatic and lone wolf Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 from the ranks of House Republicans on both votes. As a result, he needed not even a whiff of compromise with House Democrats (only one of them, the very Trump-friendly Jared Golden of Maine, voted for one of the measures, the appropriations bill).\n\nNow there are a host of factors that made this impressive achievement possible. The budget-resolution vote was, as Johnson kept pointing out to recalcitrant House Republicans, a blueprint for massive domestic-spending cuts, not the cuts themselves. Its language was general and vague enough to give Republicans plausible deniability. And even more deviously, the appropriations measure was made brief and unspecific in order to give Elon Musk and Russ Vought the maximum leeway to whack spending and personnel to levels far below what the bill provided (J.D. Vance told House Republicans right before the vote that the administration reserved the right to ignore the spending the bill mandated entirely, which pleased the government-hating HFC folk immensely). And most important, on both bills Johnson was able to rely on personal lobbying from key members of the administration, most notably the president himself, who had made it clear any congressional Republican who rebelled might soon be looking down the barrel of a Musk-financed MAGA primary opponent. Without question, much of the credit Johnson is due for pulling off these votes should go to his White House boss, whose wish is his command.\n\nBut the lesson Democrats should take from these events is that they cannot just lie in the weeds and expect the congressional GOP to self-destruct owing to its many divisions and rivalries. In a controversial New York Times op-ed last month, Democratic strategist James Carville argued Democrats should \u201cplay dead\u201d in order to keep a spotlight on Republican responsibility for the chaos in Washington, D.C., which might soon extend to Congress:\n\nLet the Republicans push for their tax cuts, their Medicaid cuts, their food stamp cuts. Give them all the rope they need. Then let dysfunction paralyze their House caucus and rupture their tiny majority. Let them reveal themselves as incapable of governing and, at the right moment, start making a coordinated, consistent argument about the need to protect Medicare, Medicaid, worker benefits and middle-class pocketbooks. Let the Republicans crumble, let the American people see it, and wait until they need us to offer our support.\n\nCongressional GOP dysfunction could yet break out; House and Senate Republicans have struggled constantly to stay on the same page on budget strategy, the depth of domestic-spending cuts, and the extent of tax cuts. But as the two big votes in the House show, their three superpowers are Trump\u2019s death grip on them all, the willingness of Musk and Vought and Trump himself to take the heat for unpopular policies, and a capacity for lying shamelessly about what they are doing and what it will cost. Yes, ultimately, congressional Republicans will face voters in November 2026. But any fear of these elections is mitigated by the realization that thanks to the landscape of midterm races, probably nothing they can do will save control of the House or forfeit control of the Senate. So Republicans have a lot of incentives to follow Trump in a high-speed smash-and-grab operation that devastates the public sector, awards their billionaire friends with tax cuts, and wherever possible salts the earth to make a revival of good government as difficult as possible. Democrats have few ways to stop this nihilistic locomotive. But they may be fooling themselves if they assume it\u2019s going off the rails without their active involvement."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump keeps saying he wants Canada to become the 51st US state. To support his pitch, he keeps making false claims about Canada.\n\nIn 2025 alone, Trump has:\n\nFalsely said the Canadian public likes the idea of becoming the 51st state, which the Canadian public overwhelmingly opposes\n\nFalsely said the US trade deficit with Canada is \u201c$200 billion,\u201d though it is nowhere close\n\nFalsely said Canada is one of the world\u2019s highest-tariff countries, though it is actually low in global rankings\n\nFalsely said Canada hiked its dairy tariffs during the Biden administration, though they haven\u2019t changed since Trump\u2019s first presidency\n\nFalsely said Canada generally doesn\u2019t \u201ctake\u201d US agricultural exports, though Canada is the world\u2019s second-biggest buyer of those exports\n\nFalsely said Canada prohibits US banks, though more than a dozen US banks are operating in Canada today\n\nFalsely said Canada is \u201cconstantly surrounded\u201d by Chinese and Russian ships, though this is fiction\n\nFalsely said outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was using the ongoing tariff battle to run again for prime minister, though Trudeau clearly wasn\u2019t running\n\nFalsely said Canada spends less than 1% of gross domestic product on defense, though NATO figures showed it was an estimated 1.37% last year\n\nHere is a fact check of these false statements.\n\nCanadians\u2019 views on becoming the 51st state: Trump falsely claimed to reporters in January that \u201cthe people of Canada like\u201d his idea of Canada joining the US. In fact, poll after poll has shown the idea is massively unpopular with the people of Canada \u2013 one recent poll had 85% opposed, 9% in favor \u2013 and it has been vehemently rejected by Canadian political leaders from left to right.\n\nThe US trade deficit with Canada: Trump has repeatedly said the US has a \u201c$200 billion\u201d trade deficit with Canada. That\u2019s not even close to true. Official US statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion. Even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the deficit was $70.6 billion.\n\nCanada\u2019s tariffs: Trump falsely claimed in a social media post Tuesday that Canada is \u201cONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.\u201d In fact, Canada has long had relatively low tariffs, though it has this month announced a series of new retaliatory tariffs on the US in direct response to Trump\u2019s own new tariffs on Canada. Canada was just 102nd-highest on a World Bank list of 137 countries\u2019 trade-weighted average tariff rates in 2022 \u2013 and had a lower average (1.37%) than the United States (1.49%) that year, the most recent for which the data is available.\n\nCanada\u2019s dairy tariffs: Trump falsely claimed to reporters Friday that he had Canada\u2019s dairy-tariff situation \u201cwell taken care of\u201d at the time he left office the first time, \u201cbut under Biden, they just kept raising it.\u201d In fact, Canada did not raise its dairy tariffs during the Biden administration. The tariffs Trump is denouncing were left in place by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement he signed in 2018, though that agreement did secure greater US access to the Canadian dairy market.\n\nTrump has also persistently failed to mention that Canada\u2019s high dairy tariffs only kick in after the US has hit a certain Trump-negotiated quantity of tariff-free dairy sales to Canada each year \u2013 and as the US dairy industry acknowledges, the US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum in any category of dairy product, so the tariffs aren\u2019t being applied.\n\nCanada\u2019s imports of US agricultural products: Trump, speaking of Canada, claimed to reporters in February that \u201cthey don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part\u201d; he mentioned dairy, then said, \u201cA little bit they do, but not much.\u201d This is false even with Trump\u2019s qualifiers. Canada was the world\u2019s second-largest buyer of US agricultural exports in 2024, according to the US Department of Agriculture, purchasing about $28.4 billion worth.\n\nWhile Canada does limit foreign access to its dairy, egg and poultry markets in particular, these are exceptions rather than the rule. The US Department of Agriculture notes on its website that \u201calmost all\u201d US agricultural exports to Canada face zero tariffs or quotas, and that \u201cCanada consistently ranks among our top markets for agricultural product exports, representing one of our most significant and reliable trading partners.\u201d\n\nCanada and US banks: Trump falsely claimed in both February and March that Canada prohibits US banks. While Canada\u2019s tight regulations have discouraged many foreign banks from opening retail branches there, Canada does not forbid these banks; in fact, US banks have been operating in Canada for well over a century. The Canadian Bankers Association industry group said in a February statement that \u201cthere are 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches with around C$113 billion in assets currently operating in Canada\u201d and that \u201cU.S. banks now make up approximately half of all foreign bank assets in Canada.\u201d\n\nCanada, Russia and China: Trump falsely claimed in a January social media post that Canada joining the US would secure Canada \u201cfrom the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them.\u201d Canada has never been surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships, let alone been \u201cconstantly\u201d surrounded. In fact, a smattering of Russian and Chinese military ships and jets, as well as Chinese research vessels viewed with suspicion by Canada and the US, have been occasionally spotted in recent years in the vicinity of the US state of Alaska \u2013 and have been monitored or intercepted by the Canadian and US militaries.\n\nThe Canadian government did warn in December that among the \u201cpotential threats\u201d in its Arctic region were \u201cincreased Russian activity in Canadian air approaches\u201d and \u201cChina\u2019s regular deployment of dual-use \u2013 having both research and military application \u2013 research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data.\u201d But that\u2019s not the same as being \u201csurrounded.\u201d\n\nTrudeau and the trade war: Trump said in a social media post Thursday: \u201cI think that Justin Trudeau is using the Tariff problem, which he has largely caused, in order to run again for Prime Minister.\u201d Trump framed this as his own thought, but it was clearly false nonetheless. Trudeau\u2019s successor as Liberal Party leader and prime minister was set to be chosen in a party vote three days following this Trump post; Trudeau did not compete in the leadership race after announcing in January that he would step down after the new leader was chosen.\n\nCanada\u2019s defense spending: Trump falsely claimed in January that Canada spends \u201cless than 1%\u201d of GDP on defense. Official NATO figures show Canada spent an estimated 1.37% of GDP on defense in 2024, up from an estimated 1.31% in 2023 and from 1.2% in 2022. That\u2019s all short of NATO\u2019s 2% target, which incoming prime minister Mark Carney has vowed to meet by 2030, but not as low as Trump claimed."

It\u2019s as simple as that. This is not about free speech,\" Rubio said. \"This is about people who do not have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a greed card by the way.\"\n\n\"So when you apply for a student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason, but I think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down, being complicit in what are clearly crimes, vandalization, complicit in shutting down institutions,\" Rubio added. \"There are kids at these schools that can\u2019t go to class. You pay all this money to these high-priced schools that are supposed to be of great esteem, and you can\u2019t even go to class.

He has since obtained a green card and is married to an American citizen who is reportedly eight months pregnant.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York on Monday temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation as the case plays out.

            "full_content": "Dramatic and unexpected election results in Greenland saw long-governing legacy parties kicked out of power and more right-wing, pro-American politicians set to dominate parliament for the first time.\n\nThe provisional results for the Greenlandic elections held on Tuesday show a historic result not forecast by pollsters, with the longstanding political establishment parties punished and relegated to third and fourth positions, respectively.\n\nThe election comes amid intense discussion of Greenland\u2019s potential independence domestically and global attention over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated overtures to the country to become part of the United States. As things stand, Greenland is now a region of its former colonial master Denmark, and as well as being divided between left and right, its politics are also split into pro- and anti-independence camps.\n\nThe present Greenland government is a coalition of the largest party, the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit, and the second-largest, the centre-left Siumut. Both parties are pro-independence but not especially friendly to America and certainly not to Donald Trump. Voters punished both parties, which have dominated Greenland politics since the 1970s, yesterday, falling from 12 seats to five and from ten to four, respectively.\n\nShould they leave power now, which seems all but certain, it would be the first time in Greenland\u2019s modern history that it hasn\u2019t been governed by either Inuit Ataqatigiit or Siumut.\n\nNow, the largest party is the centre-right Democrats, with a vote share surging 21 points and seats increasing from three to ten. In second place are the centrist Naleraq, up 12.5 points and seats doubled from four to eight.\n\nBetween them, these two parties \u2014 also pro-independence \u2014 have enough to form a government and coalition negotiations will likely follow.\n\nImportantly, Naleraq has positioned itself as the most pro-American party in Greenlandic politics. While there is no such thing as a pro-Donald Trump party, as such, Naleraq has made clear if it came to power, it would work closely with the United States as an independent, sovereign nation.\n\nFor President Trump, this election produces a Greenland government which will at least work constructively with him, rather than reject American overtures with contempt.\n\nIndeed, Naleraq party leader Pele Broberg wrote an opinion piece in English for USNEWS the day before the vote, laying out in very clear terms what he foresees such a relationship would look like. While Broberg would likely end up a junior coalition partner and not Prime Minister in the coming Greenlandic government, under European political systems, junior coalition partners can enjoy outsized influence on government policy.\n\nBroberg wrote on Monday that his party is the most enthusiastically pro-independence of all the factions in Greenland, having campaigned for a snap referendum to be called quickly, and that he believed his country could develop faster and to greater benefit of its own citizens without control from Europe.\n\nOf President Trump, Broberg acknowledged the U.S. President\u2019s interest in \u201cmineral resources and possible oil and gas reserves\u201d on the Arctic island of fewer than 60,000 people and said that Trump had been friendlier to the Greenlandic people than the Danish government or the European Union.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u2026The U.S. president has offered us security guarantees, financial support and, if desired, U.S. citizenship should we choose to sever ties with Denmark\u2026 No other leader in Denmark or the EU has expressed such strong support for Greenlandic independence.\n\nNevertheless, he said recent research in Greenland showed citizens didn\u2019t want to achieve independence only to be swallowed into another country, and the path he foresaw was one of a close alliance with America. This could be a \u201cfree association status\u201d with Washington like that of \u201cby the Pacific island states of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe would get U.S. support and protection in return for military rights, without becoming a U.S. territory\u201d, Broberg proposed."

            "full_content": "Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHouse Republicans passed a bill on Tuesday night to keep the federal government funded beyond March 14 only after Vice-President J.D. Vance promised that the Trump administration would ignore the bill and make its own unilateral funding decisions. Yes, you read that right.\n\nThanks to grumbling among the fiscal nihilists of the House Freedom Caucus, there were fears that enough Republicans would join Democrats to vote down the so-called \u201cclean CR\u201d (short for continuing resolution, or just an extension of current spending levels). Earlier, House Speaker Mike Johnson appealed to these extremists by making the \u201cclean\u201d bill pretty dirty, adding major new spending for defense and mass deportations while cutting $13 billion in domestic spending. But that wasn\u2019t enough, so Vance came to the rescue, as Politico reported:\n\nVance told House Republicans they need to vote for the GOP funding bill to clear the runway for the massive domestic policy bill Republicans are now in the process of assembling, the people added. By failing to pass the stopgap, Vance added, Republicans will lose momentum on securing the border and lose credibility with voters.\n\nHe also assured Republican members that Trump would continue cutting federal funding with his Department of Government Efficiency initiative and pursue impoundment \u2014 that is, holding back money appropriated by Congress.\n\nIn other words, the veep was telling Republicans they were approving a spending measure written in disappearing ink because Elon Musk at DOGE and Russ Vought at OMB would continue to cancel spending as they wished without any input from or concurrence by Congress. As Edith Olmstead of The New Republic rightly observed, it was an act of institutional suicide by the party controlling the legislative branch:\n\nIf it seems a little outrageous that even with control of the House, Senate, and White House, the Republicans must openly admit that they are working to pass laws they have no intention of actually enforcing, that\u2019s because it is. Rather than forge actual party unity behind his agenda, Trump wants the power to act unilaterally \u2014 leaving Vance to bully party members into saying \u201cyes\u201d to Trump doing whatever he wants when it comes to federal funding.\n\nThe only catch is that pulling off this abandonment of the constitutionally assigned congressional \u201cpower of the purse\u201d will require at least some complicity from the minority party. After House Democrats demanded (and Republicans quickly rejected) language ensuring that the appropriations were binding on the Trump administration, only one of their members voted for this shady CR, Maine\u2019s egregiously Trump-friendly Jared Golden.\n\nNow that the CR has passed, it goes to the Senate, where 40 of the 47 Democrats (along with Republican Rand Paul, who wants deeper spending cuts guaranteed) can stop it with a filibuster. Multiple Democrats, however, reportedly fear that if they actively fight this bill, they \u2014 rather than the Republicans who totally control the executive, the legislative, and much of the judicial branch of the federal government \u2014 will be blamed for a destructive government shutdown. To put added pressure on them, House Speaker Mike Johnson quickly adjourned the House after the passage of the CR so as to \u201cjam\u201d the Senate with a bill that cannot be amended. So Democrats have the terrible choice of enabling a Republican-engineered government shutdown or enacting a bill that preserves the DOGE-OMB option of gutting rather than shutting the government.\n\nIf Senate Democrats (or at least enough of them) do choose the easy way out by refusing to stand in the way of the CR locomotive, they must live with the realization that they\u2019ve given up the one bit of leverage they had this year. From here on out, Republicans intend to enact Trump\u2019s legislative agenda via a giant budget reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered and which will exclude Democrats from having any say over the size, shape, and purpose of the federal government. As DOGE continues to abolish and slash programs and fire federal workers, and as OMB picks and chooses which appropriations it will actually make available, Democrats can only hope the federal courts intervene or Republicans somehow fall into disarray."

            "full_content": "As universities around the country race to assess new federal policies geared toward ending programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, one college administrator is in a potentially tricky position.\n\nLakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College. She is also Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine, served on the university's biological sciences diversity committee, and has written proudly of her school's commitment to diversity.\n\nThe university features its diversity efforts prominently on its website and a letter from Chilukuri to incoming students emphasizes the school's \"steadfast adherence to principles that drive equity, inclusion, and an embrace of diversity.\"\n\nUndated: Lakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College and Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. screen grab, University of California San Diego video\n\n\"As we come into the new academic year with the pandemic not quite yet in the rearview mirror, with issues of equity and systemic racism, anti-Blackness and anti-Asian racism yet unresolved, we have before us both opportunity and responsibility,\" Chilukuri wrote in the undated letter. The Internet Archive shows the letter was first posted in late 2021, with minor edits made over the next year. It has since remained as the main body of text on the Sixth College's \"About\" page.\n\nA crackdown on what President Trump and Vance call \"wokeness\" has been a hallmark of their administration's first weeks. Widespread scalebacks of DEI programs in academia, government and across corporations have marked some of the administration's earliest marquee victories.\n\nVance said in a statement, \"I don't like DEI, and I'm proud of what our administration has done on that front.\"\n\n\"But I love my mother-in-law. If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance said. \"I'll choose instead to focus on her kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\"\n\nVance added, \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" Chilukuri did not reply to emailed questions. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding. A Feb. 14 \"Dear Colleague\" letter from the Department of Education to schools across the country warned that they risked federal funding if they continued to take race into account when making scholarship or hiring decisions, or include race as a policy factor in any \"other aspects of student, academic and campus life.\"\n\nThe administration's anti-DEI campaign led a U.S. attorney to warn the Georgetown Law School that its students wouldn't be considered for jobs at his office unless the school renounced its DEI programs. Mr. Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has removed from its websites most references to diversity and inclusion, and on March 7, the University of Virginia's governing board voted to dissolve its office of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nMany corporations have followed suit, including CBS News' parent company Paramount, which in late February ceased using hiring goals related to race, ethnicity, sex or gender, among other policy changes related to DEI.\n\nVance has been vocal about combatting DEI, speaking about it frequently since his earliest days in politics. In a 2021 speech, Vance, quoting Richard Nixon, said professors are \"the enemy,\" and called on Americans to \"aggressively attack the universities in this country,\" saying \"they care more about diversity, equity and inclusion than they do their own society.\" That view is shared by the president, and the White House has backed it up, issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold federal funding from institutions operating what it calls \"illegal\" DEI programs. It has not clarified exactly what that means.\n\nThe president also ordered federal agencies to identify colleges with endowments over $1 billion that might be susceptible to investigation or lawsuits due to their DEI policies. UCSD's endowment is more than $1.4 billion, according to the UC San Diego Foundation's website. Last fiscal year, UCSD received more than $500 million in federal funds for research.\n\nVance married Chilukuri's daughter Usha in 2014, and the couple have three young children. Vance said in a 2020 podcast interview that Chilukuri took a yearlong sabbatical from her work as a professor to help care for one of her grandchildren. He described Chilukuri and her husband \u2014 also a professor \u2014 as classic, doting grandparents.\n\n\"You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them, like they spoil him and sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren,\" Vance said. \"But it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents, and the evidence on this, by the way, is like super clear.\"\n\nChilukuri has worked at UCSD for decades, rising through the ranks to become provost in 2018.\n\n\"Professor Chilukuri has a demonstrated record of commitment to undergraduate education, equity, and diversity,\" wrote the university's chancellor and executive vice chancellor in an announcement of her promotion to provost. They called Chilukuri \"a creative and dynamic educator.\"\n\nThe popular professor, who also goes by \"Provost Chill\" and \"Dr. C,\" championed DEI initiatives at the school. A 2019 article on the UCSD website examined BILD 60, a class that the school's 2024-2025 catalog lists as satisfying students' DEI course requirement.\n\nThe course, called \"Exploring Issues of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Relation to Human Biology,\" was developed because members of the school's Division of Biological Sciences' Diversity Committee, including Chilukuri, \"recognized the need for a course that looked at DEI issues through a scientific lens,\" according to the article.\n\nHer commitment to inclusiveness was apparent long before she was a provost. Former student Kjeld Aamodt recalled fondly taking a freshman year lecture taught by Chilukuri nearly two decades ago.\n\n\"It was a huge class. It was probably 500 people in that class, but I remember feeling like she recognized me and made me feel special, and had a genuine interest in me,\" Aamodt said in an interview with CBS News.\n\nAamodt, now an orthodontist, said Chilukuri was one of just a few professors to leave a lasting impact on him \u2014 repeating, \"verbatim\" he said, some of her teachings to his own children.\n\n\"I remember her being fairly consistent about [diversity and inclusion], even then we were a very diverse student population, a lot of different ethnicities, and all under one roof and one big auditorium, you know, 500 strong,\" Aamodt said. \"And I remember feeling welcomed and observing her being able to connect with people from very different backgrounds, and I got that feeling that she was practicing what she preached.\"\n\nThat commitment to diversity is clear in Chilukuri's letter to incoming students. She wrote of the \"opportunity and responsibility\" to address systemic racism:\n\n\"How we embrace both will greatly influence who we are as a college and a community. Whether through our African Black Diaspora Living Learning Community, our Multi-Cultural Living Learning Community, programming through our Student Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Advising, Student Council, Student Organizations, or our Culture Art and Technology core academic program, I invite each of you to be part of the conversation and part of the solution.\""

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nOver 500 days have passed since Hamas\u2019 brutal October 7th attack\u2014the deadliest assault on Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nMore than 500 days of platitudes from certain politicians. More than 500 days of empty words. And yet, hatred against Jews isn\u2019t declining\u2014it\u2019s exploding. In New York, home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, Jewish students aren\u2019t just unwelcome, they\u2019re unsafe.\n\nJewish students across New York are under siege. The numbers don\u2019t lie:\n\n72% of Jewish students feel unwelcome on campus.\n\n52% have personally experienced antisemitism at their school.\n\n67% say their university did nothing to protect them after October 7th.\n\n43% actively hide their Jewish identity out of fear.\n\nThis crisis is real, and it\u2019s getting worse. Reports place New York in the \"Hall of Shame\" for campus antisemitism. Institutions like Cornell, Columbia, The New School and NYU have received failing grades for their handling of attacks on Jews. City University of New York (CUNY) and State University of New York (SUNY) schools have also been plagued by repeated incidents of antisemitic harassment. It\u2019s beyond unacceptable\u2014it\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nTRUMP ADMIN WON\u2019T TOLERATE ANTISEMITISM IN SCHOOLS, SAYS LEO TERRELL AS NYC SCHOOLS UNDER MICROSCOPE\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: free speech does not mean free rein to terrorize Jewish students. At Barnard College, we\u2019ve witnessed pro-Palestinian classroom disruptions, protesters storming the campus, injuring a school employee and escalating tensions beyond control. These individuals weren\u2019t expressing an opinion. They were making it impossible for Jewish students to safely learn.\n\nStudents have the right to protest. They do not have the right to commandeer property, intimidate their classmates or spread violent hate. If you cross the line from protest to persecution, the appropriate response isn\u2019t a warning. It\u2019s expulsion. While states like Florida and Texas are taking bold action, New York\u2019s leadership remains asleep at the wheel. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams deliver the same tired speeches, condemn hatred in press releases and then do nothing. Jewish students are still being harassed, assaulted and silenced. New York\u2019s Democratic leaders take the Jewish vote for granted\u2014but they shouldn\u2019t. They have allowed this crisis to fester under their watch.\n\nAs a proud Jewish-American legislator and a member of the Jewish Legislators Caucus in the New York State Assembly, I refuse to stand by while our students are forced to live in fear. Fighting antisemitism isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about moral clarity. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m taking action.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nI introduced the United Against Hate Act, a bold, common-sense plan to combat antisemitism through education, awareness, and action. My bill includes:\n\nA \"New York Stands with Israel\" License Plate \u2013 allowing New Yorkers to proudly display their support while funding hostage rescue efforts. A Statewide High School Art Competition \u2013 teaching students about the dangers of antisemitism and the reality of October 7th through creative expression.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about policy\u2014it\u2019s about making sure the next generation understands that Jew hatred is not an abstract concept. It\u2019s a real and present danger.\n\nWhile New York\u2019s Democratic leaders offer lip service, President Donald Trump has been the strongest defender of Jewish students in America. His administration took real action against campus antisemitism when others only offered empty words. President Trump\u2019s executive order on Combatting Antisemitism empowered the Department of Education to hold universities accountable under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Because of this order, the federal government has launched investigations into five universities where antisemitic harassment has run rampant. That\u2019s what real leadership looks like. And that\u2019s the standard we should demand.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHistory will judge us by what we do at this moment. Will we stand by while hatred against Jews spreads unchecked, or will we take bold action to stop it?\n\nJewish students should not have to hide their identity to feel safe at school. They shouldn\u2019t have to wonder whether their professors, classmates or administrators will defend their rights. And they certainly shouldn\u2019t be left to fend for themselves while politicians offer nothing but hollow statements. If schools and universities refuse to act, then we must hold them accountable. If they tolerate antisemitism, they should be defunded\u2014plain and simple.\n\nThis is a test of moral clarity. I know where I stand. Where do New York\u2019s leaders stand?"

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump added Tuesday to his rapidly growing list of false claims about Canada, wrongly asserting on social media that Canada is \u201cONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.\u201d\n\nCanada is a low-tariff country compared to most others. In fact, figures published by the World Bank show Canada had a lower average tariff rate (1.37%) than the US (1.49%) in 2022, the most recent year for which the data is available, weighted for how much of various products each country imported. Of 137 countries for which the World Bank published these trade-weighted 2022 tariff averages, Canada was 102nd from the top.\n\nBermuda topped the list at 29.52%. Seventeen additional countries, a dozen of them in Africa, were above 12%. To cite an assortment of other countries with tariffs higher than Canada: India was at 11.46%; South Korea was at 8.63%; Brazil was at 7.44%; Mexico was at 4.75%; China was at 3.09%; the United Kingdom was at 3.07%; and Japan was at 1.64%.\n\nThere are various ways to assess a country\u2019s overall tariff picture, but Canada is also nowhere near the top when you use other standard calculation methods. Canada also had a lower 2022 tariff rate (1.83%) than the US (2.72%) in a simple-average comparison that doesn\u2019t factor in trade volumes, the World Bank data show.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim about Canada is \u201cnonsense,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, who discussed the World Bank figures in a February article.\n\nCanada did this month impose new tariffs on imports from the US in response to Trump\u2019s own new tariffs on imports from Canada. Two days after Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, he suspended them, until April 2, on Canadian imports covered by his US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nCanada\u2019s dairy tariffs are an exception, not the norm \u2014 and not actually hitting any US products\n\nAs he has before, Trump pointed in the Tuesday social media post to one set of notably high Canadian tariffs \u2014 dairy duties exceeding 250% on some products \u2014 as a prime example of Canada\u2019s supposedly unfair trade practices. But he again failed to mention that these Canadian dairy tariffs only kick in after the US has hit a certain, Trump-negotiated quantity of zero-tariff sales to Canada. The US is not currently filling its zero-tariff sales quota in any category of dairy product, so the tariffs aren\u2019t being applied.\n\nTrump also did not acknowledge that Canada\u2019s \u201csupply management\u201d protectionism over its dairy and poultry industries is the exception, not the norm. \u201cThe overwhelming proportion\u201d of US trade with Canada has for decades been tariff-free for both countries, noted Dartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin; \u201cCanada does not apply tariffs on most US goods.\u201d The US Department of Agriculture itself points out that \u201calmost all\u201d US agricultural exports to Canada faced zero tariffs or quotas under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that took effect in 1994 and continue to face zero tariffs or quotas under the USMCA that modified NAFTA in 2020.\n\nDaniel Schwanen, senior vice president at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Canada, said Trump\u2019s claim about Canada being a high-tariff country has \u201ca grain or an element of truth\u201d given Canada\u2019s hefty dairy and poultry tariffs on imports above the tariff-free quota thresholds \u2014 but Schwanen said Trump\u2019s claim is still \u201cwrong as a general statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be really unfortunate if people got the impression that Canada is in general a high-tariff country, especially vis-\u00e0-vis American products. That\u2019s not the case. It is the case with respect to, really, a sliver of trade,\u201d Schwanen said in a Tuesday interview.\n\nTrump made the false claim in a social media post in which he said he was doubling, to 50%, his tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in response to the Canadian province of Ontario announcing a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states (which Ontario\u2019s premier said later Tuesday he was suspending, prompting Trump to abandon his own retaliation plan).\n\nTrump also threatened in the post to impose car tariffs \u201cwhich will, essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada\u201d if Canada doesn\u2019t remove \u201cegregious, long time Tariffs.\u201d And he repeated his call for Canada to become the 51st US state, a notion overwhelmingly rejected by Canadians."

            "full_content": "Photo: Susan Walsh/Getty Images\n\nLife can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forward, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard once asserted. And so it goes with public policy. It\u2019s easy, in retrospect, to criticize any particular decision and express exasperation with the experts who handed down their decrees. A full five years has come and gone since the coronavirus began infecting and killing Americans. It was exactly this week, in 2020, when COVID officially entered the mass consciousness: The NBA suddenly canceled its season, Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive for the new virus, and Donald Trump delivered a disorienting Oval Office address.\n\nAs much as we would like to pretend otherwise, we all carry COVID scars. More than 1 million Americans are dead. We\u2019ve either lost loved ones or know those who have suffered mightily. We\u2019ve all, inevitably, had COVID ourselves, and some iterations of the virus were far from mild. Children, teenagers, and young adults lost some of their most formative years to Zoom screens. Remote work hollowed out the downtowns of many cities. The inflation that the pandemic at least partially triggered lingers to this day. In 2019, few were talking about a nationwide housing crunch or the hefty cost of groceries. Life today is far better than it was during the depths of the pandemic: Tourism roared back, restaurants filled again, and the economy is far stronger than it was in the spring of 2020, when many feared a second Great Depression was upon us. But we can\u2019t undo the loss of life nor the loss of time.\n\nWhat could have been done differently? With five years of hindsight, what sort of decisions should politicians and public-health officials have made? What were the worst avoidable mistakes? There are no easy answers. But given that we now live in a period of surging anti-vaxx sentiment and distrust of the public-health Establishment, it can be reasonably argued that several messaging and policy failures helped power the return of Trump and the installation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to establish what the public-health Establishment \u2014 and liberals, broadly \u2014 got right about COVID. The coordinated citywide and regional lockdowns in the early weeks of the pandemic were successful at averting mass death. In King County, home to Seattle, and the Bay Area of California, local leaders worked closely with governors to communicate effectively with the public and rapidly close down any venues where mass gatherings might occur. The coronavirus arrived earliest there and it was little-heralded leaders like Jay Inslee, then the governor of Washington, who took the pandemic seriously and helped to keep his state\u2019s death rate among the very lowest in America over the next several years. When vaccines were unavailable, early action was pivotal. California, too, would suffer through subsequent COVID waves, driving its death rate up, but it still lost fewer lives, relative to its population, than other states that were ravaged at a comparable time.\n\nAs governor, Andrew Cuomo was initially celebrated for his pandemic leadership, delivering press briefings that were watched by millions. Several scandals would subsequently dent that popularity, including his alleged manipulation of the death-toll data in nursing homes and his decision to accept more than $5 million to write a pandemic memoir, but it\u2019s been mostly forgotten that Cuomo, in the earliest weeks of COVID\u2019s appearance in the U.S., was likening the virus to the common flu and downplaying its potential devastation. Cuomo, who is now running for mayor, actually dithered over locking down New York City, blocking his political rival, Mayor Bill de Blasio, from initially issuing a shutdown order. Public-health researchers found this delay might have led to many thousands of deaths as COVID tore through the region.\n\nIn hindsight, though, certain kinds of lockdowns lasted too long. It was sensible to close schools in March 2020 and let children learn remotely for the rest of the school year. But the decision, in certain big city and suburban school districts, to institute remote learning for the entirety of 2020 and 2021 proved disastrous. Children themselves, and young people broadly, were far less likely to die of COVID and could have, in most instances, safely gone to school to learn and socialize. Teachers were more vulnerable, but relatively few of them belonged to the most threatened cohort of Americans: the elderly and the immunocompromised. There\u2019s mounting evidence to suggest that school closures contributed to devastating learning loss and stunted social development. Some students dropped out and never returned.\n\nPublic-health officials and politicians greatly erred, too, in shuttering parks, playgrounds, beaches, and other outdoor spaces where people could have clustered more safely. The padlocking of playgrounds was as absurd as shaming Floridians for heading to the beach. The public-health Establishment should have been honest with Americans: The pandemic was going to be a multiyear endeavor, and this meant that it was unsustainable to curtail human interaction indefinitely. Go outside and wear a mask was simple enough messaging. Absolutism did not work, and only provoked backlash. There was a fantasy, in the first months of COVID, that millions of people, acting together, could collectively will the pandemic away. No country could do this \u2014 not even those, like China and New Zealand, that implemented extraordinarily aggressive lockdown measures.\n\nNeither political party knew how to talk about the COVID vaccine sensibly. After taking credit for Operation Warp Speed, which quickly funded the development of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, Trump pivoted to strenuous vaccine skepticism because that\u2019s where Republicans had migrated during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Conservatives pitched ineffective alternative cures and cooked up lies about the vaccine, blaming it for every sudden death or claiming it could alter a person\u2019s DNA. In poorer, rural states, which are now disproportionately Republican, the decision of some conservatives with comorbidities to refuse vaccination probably contributed to the mass deaths there. The states with the highest COVID death rates \u2014 including Kentucky, West Virginia, and Mississippi \u2014 overwhelmingly backed Trump.\n\nBut Democrats \u2014 and the left-leaning public-health officials they staunchly supported \u2014 peddled what would be, in retrospect, their own misinformation. In early 2021, the COVID vaccines were sold as a miracle cure that could stamp out the pandemic for good. Public-health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci promised that vaccinated individuals would be much less likely to spread the virus. The idea was wrongheaded, if straightforward enough: Get a COVID vaccine and you\u2019d no longer be a vector for the coronavirus. This would prove wildly untrue as 2021 dragged on and new variants of COVID, like Delta and Omicron, appeared. Should public-health officials be blamed for not foreseeing any kind of COVID mutation? Probably. Or, if they\u2019re spared, they can certainly be accused of failing to adjust their messaging once it became obvious the vaccinated and unvaccinated could equally infect others.\n\nPerhaps no policy did greater damage to the cause of vaccination in America than the vaccine mandates that mostly Democratic mayors and governors imposed in 2021 and 2022. If they did spur an uptake in vaccination rates, they also alienated millions of Americans, many of them working class, who could not understand why the status of their employment was now bound to their personal medical decisions. Teachers, sanitation workers, and military personnel were all fired for refusing the vaccine, and the unvaccinated were barred in certain Democrat-run states and cities from a wide range of jobs and greater public life. The political fallout, for the left, was severe: formerly liberal individuals driven rightward, the deep reddening of Florida, and the rise of RFK Jr., who rode decades of anti-vaccine activism to Washington, D.C.\n\nA more effective and humane approach would have been to heavily market the COVID vaccine to the elderly and the immunocompromised. Vulnerable populations needed protection. Forcing the vaccine on children and teens made less sense, however, and bred long-lasting suspicion of public-health authorities. Entirely downplaying the reality of vaccine injuries \u2014 a small percentage of the population experienced adverse side effects, like myocarditis \u2014 only further fanned the flames of conspiracy. And not every vaccine manufacturer produced a sterling product: Both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were eventually pulled from the market altogether, with the former causing rare, fatal blood clots. If vaccine injuries, like the possibility of COVID\u2019s origin in a Wuhan lab, were discussed and debated more honestly from the beginning, enormous gaps would not have opened up for misinformation and conspiracy to take root.\n\nWhat the federal government should be doing now \u2014 and tragically will be doing little of, thanks to Trump \u2014 is investing significantly in vaccine research, especially as bird flu becomes a greater threat and makes the leap to infecting humans. Luckily, bird flu is far less contagious among humans than the coronavirus. In the future, though, new pandemics might arise, those that combine the transmissibility of COVID with a virus that has a higher fatality rate. The federal government should invest in new hospital capacity or at least have a working plan to immediately assist states with providing excess beds in the event hospitals rapidly fill up. Decades of consolidations and closures have left cities and rural areas alike bereft of functioning hospitals. In New York City, hospitals were immediately overwhelmed, and lives might have been saved if some of the old hospitals in the outer-boroughs that were shuttered decades ago were still able to receive COVID patients.\n\nIn the interim, public-health authorities should reckon with where their messaging went awry \u2014 and the policies they championed that proved counterproductive. Americans craved honesty and consistency in a terrifying time; they didn\u2019t often get it. It\u2019s hard to know how the nation would react if another pandemic appeared tomorrow. We can only hope it never does."

            "full_content": "Summary House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Barry Loudermilk disagree on the scope the investigation relitigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nJohnson wants a narrower focus, according to three sources, while Loudermilk prefers a broader mandate.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes disagreement has in part prevented the select subcommittee announced by Johnson in January from starting its work.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Johnson before taking office that the investigation should be a priority.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRepublicans are at a standstill over their investigation relitigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, with House Speaker Mike Johnson and the Republican leading the effort disagreeing on how to move forward.\n\nJohnson wants Republicans to stop investigating the former January 6 committee, including former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, and narrow its focus, according to three sources familiar with the negotiations. But GOP Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who has been tapped to helm the probe, would prefer a broader mandate, a position backed by some officials at the White House. President Donald Trump told Johnson before he took office that he wanted this investigation to be a priority, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe tapered scope would also prohibit the investigation from looking at security preparedness leading up to the attack and how to improve security at the US Capitol going forward, the sources added.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes disagreement that has deadlocked negotiations is in part why Loudermilk\u2019s new select subcommittee, which Johnson announced in January, has not yet started its work, the sources said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoudermilk told CNN in a statement Thursday: \u201cWhen former Speaker Kevin McCarthy tapped me to lead House Republican\u2019s investigation into the security failures at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Pelosi\u2019s Select Committee, I told him I would accept the challenge under these two conditions: I would have the autonomy and resources needed to effectively pursue the facts without political bias or outside influence, and I would have the authority to report whatever we find to the American people. I still believe this is what is needed to effectively pursue the truth.\u201d\n\nIn the last Congress, Loudermilk zeroed in on the former January 6 committee and its work product. The House GOP report culminated by recommending Cheney be investigated by the FBI for her role in probing the Capitol attack.\n\nBut if Johnson has his way, Loudermilk would not be able to pick up his work where he left off. Housing Loudermilk\u2019s new probe under the House Judiciary committee, as Johnson would prefer, would limit the topics the subcommittee could investigate. Its focus would shift to subjects like the former federal investigations under the Department of Justice into January 6; trying to identify the person who placed two viable pipe bombs near the Republican and Democratic National Committee headquarters; and the confidential human sources \u2014 paid FBI informants \u2014 who were in Washington DC on January 6. Both areas are already being looked at by Trump allies at DOJ, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel.\n\nThe dispute over how to handle the probe speaks to broader divisions that persist in the Republican party over how to handle the topic of January 6. Many Republican lawmakers would like to move on, but can\u2019t because Trump himself isn\u2019t done with the past and continues to make former January 6 committee members a top target.\n\nGOP Rep. Mike Collins of Georgia, who has referred to rioters who stormed the Capitol as \u201cpeaceful grandmothers,\u201d said of Loudermilk\u2019s investigation: \u201cI hope it\u2019s not stalled.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, who represents a swing district, told CNN he wasn\u2019t aware that his colleagues were continuing to investigate January 6, indicating that this is not a top priority across the conference.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was an effort to keep this going to be honest with you,\u201d Ciscomani said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only way that Johnson is stalling when it comes to how he handles January 6.\n\nJohnson still has not hung a plaque to honor the Capitol Police officers who responded to the attack on January 6, even though former President Joe Biden signed a law that Congress passed back in 2022 mandating such a plaque be displayed on the front of the Capitol.\n\nGiven the chaotic first two months of the Trump presidency, the impasse over how to move forward with Loudermilk\u2019s investigation has largely stayed under the radar.\n\nBut it won\u2019t go unnoticed forever.\n\nGOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who has supported the effort to declare that Trump did not engage in an insurrection, told CNN that Republicans still need to investigate the former January 6 committee, security lapses and claims about the FBI.\n\n\u201cWe need to absolutely look into that,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with comment from Rep. Barry Loudermilk."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAmericans are not impressed with President Donald Trump\u2019s stewardship of the economy, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, putting him underwater on the nation\u2019s top issue even as he sees ratings among the best of his presidential career on other key priorities.\n\nAs markets slide and investors worry in response to Trump\u2019s trade policies, a 56% majority of the public disapproves of his handling of the economy, worse than at any point during his first term in office. By contrast, the 51% who now say they approve of his work on immigration \u2013 headlined by stricter enforcement efforts \u2013 is 7 points higher than at any point during his first term.\n\nAmericans are closely divided over Trump\u2019s performance so far in handling the federal budget and managing the federal government \u2013 48% approve on each, with about half disapproving \u2013 while giving him lower ratings for his work on health care policy (43%), foreign affairs (42%) and tariffs (39%).\n\nTrump\u2019s overall job approval rating currently stands at 45%, with 54% disapproving, in line with the numbers he saw in March 2017 and matching his highest ratings for his first term in office. Overall, 35% of Americans say things in the country are going well, a rise from 29% in January, reflecting a surge in positive sentiment within the GOP. His ratings remain highly polarized, with Republicans roughly 10 times as likely as Democrats to approve of his job performance.\n\nThere\u2019s overwhelming agreement across party lines that Trump\u2019s use of presidential power reflects a break from historical precedent. An 86% majority of Americans, including more than three-quarters of adults in each party, say that Trump is taking a completely different approach to presidential power in comparison to past presidents, with 49% calling this a bad thing and 37% saying it\u2019s a good thing. Just 14% say his approach to his second term has been generally in line with past presidents\u2019.\n\nEconomic concerns continue to dominate, the poll finds, with 42% of Americans choosing the economy as their top issue from a list of seven \u2013 more than doubling the share who picked any other issue, including the state of US democracy (19%), the way the federal government works (14%), immigration (12%), health care (6%), foreign policy (3%) or climate change (2%).\n\nThe economy is also the issue with the most resonance across party lines, narrowly landing behind concerns about democracy among Democratic adults (36% choose the state of US democracy, 33% the economy), and dominating the issue landscape among Republicans and independents (45% in each group choose the economy).\n\nPerceptions of Trump as able to bring the change the country needs (50%) and manage the government effectively (49%) are significantly higher than they were during the latter half of Trump\u2019s first term (43% and 42%, respectively, in November 2019). Roughly half of Americans currently say that Trump has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively (51%), with fewer calling him an effective world leader (46%) or saying he respects the rule of law (38%).\n\nWorries about Musk\u2019s role, government cuts\n\nTrump has spent his first months back in office seeking to sharply cut spending and reduce the federal workforce. The public\u2019s views of that effort and Elon Musk, to whom Trump has given a prominent role, are largely negative.\n\nJust 35% of Americans express a positive view of Musk, with 53% rating him negatively and 11% offering no opinion \u2013 making him both better known and more substantially unpopular than Vice President JD Vance (whom 33% of Americans rate favorably and 44% unfavorably, with 23% having no opinion.) Roughly 6 in 10 Americans say that Musk has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make changes to the way the government works. There is uneasiness about Musk even among some of the president\u2019s supporters: 28% of those who see Trump\u2019s changes to the government as necessary doubt the tech billionaire has the judgment to carry them out.\n\nA 55% majority of Americans say that the Trump administration\u2019s changes to the federal government are being made largely to advance his agenda, with 45% calling the changes necessary to ensure the government functions properly.\n\nAsked to weigh whether they\u2019re more concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the federal government going too far or not far enough, 62% of Americans say they\u2019re more worried about the former and fear important programs being shut down. The other 37% say they\u2019re more worried about the cuts not going far enough in eliminating fraud and waste in the federal government. Nine in 10 Democrats and 69% of independents say they\u2019re more concerned about losing important federal programs, while 73% of Republicans say they\u2019re more concerned that fraud and waste will remain an issue in the government.\n\nLingering doubts since first term\n\nSome opinions of Trump\u2019s second presidency echo dynamics seen throughout his political career. The shares who describe Trump as caring about people like them (40%) or being able to unite the country (34%) remain about as negative as they were in 2019. During his first term, the share who strongly disapproved of his performance as president consistently outstripped the share who strongly approved; in the latest survey, those numbers stand at 41% and 26%, respectively.\n\nHe has never been seen by a majority of Americans as having the right presidential priorities, and in the latest survey, 57% say he hasn\u2019t paid attention to the country\u2019s most important problems. The 59% of US adults who currently call Trump\u2019s views and policies too extreme marks a modest uptick from the 54% majority of registered voters who said the same last September, shortly before he was reelected to the White House.\n\nSignificant shares of the public express some degree of mixed views about Trump\u2019s policies or his qualities as a leader: 12%, for instance, say they approve of his handling of immigration but disapprove of his work on the economy; 15% say both that Trump does not respect the rule of law and that he can bring the kind of change the country needs.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from March 6-9 among a random national sample of 1,206 US adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among all adults have a margin of sampling error of \u00b13.3 percentage points.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta and Edward Wu contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Bernie Sanders in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Photo: Jim Vondruska/Reuters\n\nLast month, as Elon Musk\u2019s malevolent influence on Donald Trump\u2019s second term was coming into focus, a friend DM\u2019ed me a clip of Chuck Schumer leading a protest against Musk\u2019s efforts to access sensitive Treasury Department data. \u201cWe will win! We will win!\u201d croaked the Senate minority leader, the crowd clearly reluctant to join this confused approximation of what impassioned resistance might look like. My friend wrote, \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna die.\u201d\n\nBeing uninspired by the Democratic Party is a national pastime, but 2025 has ushered in new levels of loathing, with the party\u2019s approval rating sinking to record lows. Schumer\u2019s efforts have been so limp that a group of liberal governors in January begged him to grow a spine in opposing Trump\u2019s agenda and cabinet nominees. Schumer\u2019s counterpart in the House, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, has fared no better, alternating between sphinxlike nonresponses to revelations that Trump had essentially bought New York City mayor Eric Adams in a quid-pro-quo deal with the Justice Department and bizarrely menacing anti-GOP diatribes performed in sweats in empty rooms. Congressional Democrats were widely mocked for the little protest paddles they held up during Trump\u2019s State of the Union, while Representative Al Green was kicked out for a disruption that was derided as pathetic and unconvincing.\n\nMeanwhile, California governor Gavin Newsom has started a podcast to interview conservative influencers and throw trans athletes under the bus, Representative Elissa Slotkin\u2019s official rebuttal to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address was a paean to Ronald Reagan, and Connecticut senator Chris Murphy has appeared on any news outlet that will have him speaking in a very loud voice about how mad he is. It can often seem that, when it comes to opposing Trump, Democrats have no idea what to say or how to say it.\n\nThis has not been the case, however, with the two most prominent leftists in the broader Democratic tent. Bernie Sanders has spent the first month and a half of Trump\u2019s second presidency doing what you\u2019d expect Bernie Sanders to do: raging against the corrosive influence of billionaires on politics. \u201cI fear very much that under President Trump, we are not seeing a \u2018government of the people, by the people, for the people,\u2019 but rather a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, and for the billionaire class,\u201d the 83-year-old warned his Senate colleagues last month. He has sounded the same alarm during his \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, which has drawn thousands of attendees across the Midwest in recent weeks, including 2,600 people at a rally on Saturday in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of only 10,000.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been even more combative toward the administration, boycotting Trump\u2019s swearing-in ceremony and State of the Union address while feuding with everyone from border czar Tom Homan to White House adviser and virulent xenophobe Katie Miller. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s critiques, in which she has called Musk \u201ca leech on the public\u201d for threatening to overhaul Social Security and immediately condemned the detention of pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil, feel both precise and cathartic and regularly go viral. Ocasio-Cortez will join Sanders on the road soon while launching her own solo appearances in Republican-held districts.\n\nThere is solace to be found in these familiar spectacles, reassurance that, even with the government and civil society exploding around us, some Democrats can be counted on to fight back and fight back well. But it also raises a question that will define the next four years in American politics: Why are Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez so much better at this than their colleagues?\n\nOne answer is that they have credibility and devoted followings built over the years they\u2019ve spent at odds with not only Republicans but more moderate factions within their own caucus. They are as disappointed with the Democrats as seemingly the rest of America is. Sanders is a grizzled relic of the kind of class politics that was swept aside by genteel liberals like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and his diagnosis that the party was undone in 2024 because it abandoned the working class lines up with analyses that have been offered up by gloating MAGA Republicans and disillusioned anti-woke liberals alike. Ocasio-Cortez, for her part, has proven deft at integrating herself with the Establishment but remains a go-to scapegoat for the party whenever something goes wrong. When the centrist think tank Third Way urged Democrats to move \u201caway from the dominance of small-dollar donors\u201d in its post-2024 autopsy, it was hard not to interpret it as a shot at Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBroadly speaking, each has a track record of standing by principles and beliefs that make their protests against Trumpism both coherent and believable. This is one of the advantages of belonging to one wing of the party, as opposed to bearing responsibility for the coalition as a whole \u2014 the purview of congressional leaders like Schumer and Jeffries and potential presidential aspirants like Murphy and Newsom. But it does put a glaring spotlight on the fact that mainstream Democrats have been so consumed by a desire to triangulate that they seem to have no idea what they believe in.\n\nNo wonder thousands of people in Republican districts are lining up to see Sanders while so many Democrats are begging his colleagues in their own districts to do something. Which has some intriguing implications for who will lead the Democrats going forward, since it is the moderates who own the conventional wisdom on what\u2019s best for the party but the leftists who have the energy. The liberal pundit Matt Yglesias interpreted the \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour as a ploy by Sanders to get the last laugh in the ongoing, never-ending fallout from the 2016 primary. \u201cIs Bernie running in 2028?\u201d Yglesias tweeted over the weekend. \u201cIs he going to endorse someone?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez retorted, \u201cBelieve it or not, some people\u2019s everyday actions aren\u2019t motivated by some long-term career ambition, but out of a genuine love for people and a desire to do right by them.\u201d\n\nWhile that may be true, Yglesias was right to identify a proxy battle for the party\u2019s future. Mainstream Democrats intent on sidelining leftist insurgents seem to have not so much surrendered as fallen into self-defeating inertia, treating Trump\u2019s popularity as such an article of faith that they have willingly sacrificed both their own popularity and the health of our society to avoid alienating his voters. It\u2019s becoming harder, as Trump continues his rampage, to imagine spending the next four years taking cues from leaders whose principles are this difficult to ascertain."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAn elected leader once dubbed \u201cThe Punisher\u201d was handed to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs, in a breathtaking reversal of fortune for a politician who once openly boasted about killing people and placing opponents on hit lists.\n\nRodrigo Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which he oversaw a brutal crackdown on drugs, openly threatened critics with death and tongue-lashed a host of global leaders from the Pope to former US President Barack Obama.\n\nOn Wednesday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands confirmed the former Philippines leader was now in its custody.\n\nA former prosecutor, congressman and mayor, Duterte built his no-holds-barred reputation in the southern Philippine city of Davao. He swept to the presidency in 2016 on a populist \u2013 and popular \u2013 promise to replicate the hardline tactics of his hometown and wage war against drugs and drug pushers across the Southeast Asian nation.\n\n\u201cAll of you who are into drugs, you sons of b**ches, I will really kill you,\u201d he told a huge crowd in one of his many characteristically profane-laced 2016 campaign speeches. \u201cI have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.\u201d\n\nOnce in power he unleashed what rights groups called \u201cdeath squads\u201d to eradicate drug pushers \u2013 many of the victims young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen as part of a campaign to target dealers.\n\nPolice data said 6,000 people were killed. Some rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000 with innocents and bystanders often caught in the crossfire.\n\nDuterte\u2019s blood-soaked presidency ended in 2022. Three years later, only 8 policemen had been convicted for 5 of the victims killed in the war on drugs, according to court documents.\n\nThe ICC launched an investigation into allegations of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d committed by Duterte during both his time as national leader and mayor of Davao.\n\nDuterte has long denied the accusations of human rights abuses and contends the drug issue is one for domestic law enforcement. He has repeatedly said he will not kowtow to foreign jurisdiction and taunted the ICC, urging prosecutors to \u201churry up\u201d and move on him.\n\nTwo days before his arrest, he slammed the ICC in a typically fiery speech to supporters in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cFrom my own news, I have a warrant\u2026from the ICC or something\u2026 these motherf***ers have been chasing me for a long time. What did I do wrong ?\u201d he said.\n\nPolice gather outside Villamor Air Base, where former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was held after his arrest in Manila on March 11, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA sudden arrest\n\nBut the tide had suddenly turned. Authorities were waiting for Duterte to return from Hong Kong, and arrested him at the main airport in Manila, sparking chaotic scenes.\n\nAs the news filtered out, many were left in shock.\n\nSome flocked to churches in the majority Catholic country to attend impromptu mass to commemorate the thousands of victims of his drug war, seeing the move as a first step towards overdue justice.\n\nAnd just before midnight, Duterte was back on a plane \u2013 this time bound for the Netherlands in what appeared to be a stunning end to a stormy and violent stint at the top of Philippine politics.\n\nIn a Wednesday statement, the ICC said Duterte was \u201csurrendered\u201d to its custody, and a hearing would be scheduled in \u201cdue course.\u201d It is unclear when he will make his first court appearance.\n\nShortly before landing in Rotterdam, Duterte released a defiant video message on his Facebook page. \u201cI was saying to the police and military that you do your job and I will take responsibility, so it has come to this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis will be a long legal proceedings, but I say to you, I will continue to serve my country. And so be it, if that is my destiny,\u201d he added.\n\nSupporters of former President Rodrigo Duterte gather outside the gate of Villamor Airbase, where Duterte was taken following his arrest on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant, on March 11, 2025 in Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images\n\nWhy now?\n\nThe arrest likely owes more to Duterte being on the wrong side of a feud between two of the Philippine\u2019s most high-profile families than the might of the ICC, which cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants\n\nDuterte\u2019s clan was previously in an alliance with the famed Marcos political dynasty, with his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio serving as deputy to current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nAn emotional mass was held in memory of the drug war victims at a church in Manila on March 11, 2025 following news of Duterte's arrest. Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut in recent months the alliance collapsed, descending into public tirades and name-calling.\n\nIn October, Duterte-Carpio aired a litany of grievances against the president in a two-hour livestreamed press conference, saying she \u201cwanted to chop his head off.\u201d\n\nThen she said in an online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and House Speak Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn\u2019t a joke.\n\nMarcos had said the Philippines will \u201cdisengage\u201d from any contact with the ICC, as Manila does not recognize its authority over matters of national sovereignty.\n\nThat\u2019s because Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.\n\nBut under the ICC\u2019s withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state.\n\nPresident Marcos said he was obliged to follow Interpol\u2019s request to arrest Duterte.\n\n\u201cInterpol asked for help, and we obliged because we have commitments to the Interpol, which we have to fulfil. If we don\u2019t do that, they will not, they will no longer help us with other cases involving Filipino fugitives abroad,\u201d Marcos said in a late-night presser after the plane carrying Duterte took off.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nCarlos Conde, a Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW) Conde said Duterte\u2019s swift arrest and removal was a \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d that caught also a lot of people off guard.\n\n\u201cThe victims of the drug war \u2013 thousands of victims \u2013 have pretty much lost faith in the domestic accountability mechanisms in the Philippines. So, they were pinning their hopes on the ICC,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nNobel laureate Maria Ressa told CNN Duterte\u2019s arrest marks a major moment for the country and signals that years of impunity can be ended.\n\nCatholic priest Flavie Villanueva comforts a woman while watching the exhumation of her father's remains at Navotas Cemetery in the Philippines on July 8, 2021. Eloisa Lopez/Reuters\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s historic for the Philippines, it\u2019s the first time a Philippine president has been arrested for crimes against humanity. That an Interpol-led arrest actually ended this impunity under president Duterte that now has him going to The Hague,\u201d said Ressa, former CNN Manila bureau chief and CEO and founder of news site Rappler.\n\nHuman rights campaigner Aurora Parong told CNN many advocates and drug war victims\u2019 family members were elated with a momentary sense of relief after hearing Duterte had indeed been arrested.\n\n\u201cBut there is this mixed feeling of joy and hope and anxiety because we do not exactly know where this will end up to what will be the outcome. Will there really be accountability?\u201d said Parong, who is also co-chair of the Philippine Coalition for the ICC (PCICC).\n\nBut she cautioned it would be an excruciatingly long road to justice.\n\n\u201cIt is time consuming. It will take years before there will be a conviction at the International Criminal Court. The waiting is really difficult for the victims and the families of the victims of the bloody war on drugs.\u201d\n\nWhat is the ICC?\n\nLocated in The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression against the territory of its member states, of which there are 125.\n\nDuterte\u2019s arrest and transfer is a significant victory for the body. The court cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants \u2013 which often rests on domestic politics and political will on whether to follow through.\n\nMany of those on its wanted list remain at large, unruffled by the serious charges laid against them.\n\nThe court has been rounded on by the United States for seeking the arrests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023, attack.\n\nThe ICC simultaneously sought the arrests of top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed.\n\nNeither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC.\n\nThe court has also issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, although it is unlikely the warrant will be served any time soon. Putin travelled to ICC member Mongolia last year, but was not arrested."

            "full_content": "BlackRock founder Larry Fink is warning President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA policies might cause some inflation before emerging technology allows American citizens to earn higher wages without inflation.\n\nThe mega-investor on Wall Street told a March 10 conference hosted by S&P Global:\n\nWhen I go to Washington, when they talk about these [MAGA] policies, I ask \u201cAt what cost are you willing to tolerate [wage-driven inflation]? Yes, we may have opportunities to create better and more robust jobs, but then the offside of that will be, it will probably create a little more elevated inflation in the short run.\n\nThe \u201clittle more\u201d inflation from rising wages can be reversed by productivity gains from emerging technology, Fink said. The \u201cbig deflation because of the advancement of AI and robots \u2026 is going to reshape the economy,\u201d Fink said.\n\nForeign companies are already deploying the new technology that also shrinks inflation, he said:\n\nI was with an Asian CEO that builds phones and they\u2019re now applying AI robots \u2014 robots that have much more tensile dexterity, that they believe over the course of the next two years, their workforce will be down 30 percent with the advent of more technology and more robotics. If you translate that across all the economies, we\u2019re going to have shortage of [workers for] some things, like I said, in construction and electricians, and we\u2019re going to have job [reductions] in many other industries that robots through AI are going to [cause].\n\nChina has invested heavily in robots and automation and leads the world in manufacturing output and in manufacturing technology.\n\nFink described the balancing act that faces Trump and his deputies:\n\nWith the whole idea that we\u2019re going to have to use private capital to build up this economy, are we going to have enough workers? I\u2019ve even told members of the Trump team that we\u2019re going to run out of electricians as we build out AI data centers.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of low migration and Fink\u2019s worries about shortages of agriculture workers, construction crews, and electricians are good news for Trump\u2019s blue-collar voters and their teenage children. That is because labor shortages ensure U.S. workers and their families gain higher wages \u2014 and also ensure companies will buy high-tech machinery to help them get more work and wages each day.\n\nThat result would be good news for GOP politicians because wage gains will likely prompt happy citizens to vote for Trump and GOP politicians in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nRising wages \u201care good for national politics if you\u2019re a politician, for sure,\u201d then-U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue told Breitbart News in 2020. \u201cIf you look the other side of your question: \u2018Are decreasing wages good for national politics?\u2019 Hell, no.\u201d\n\nMany of these wage and productivity gains will be delivered by the foreign companies that are moving investment into the United States under Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs.\n\nBut those wage and productivity gains, however, will be sunk if Trump and GOP legislators agree to import more migrants or H-1B visa workers because of loud demands from employers, investors, donors, ethnic politicians, Democrats, and their chorus of pro-migrant establishment journalists.\n\nFink manages $10 trillion of investments in many companies. His job requires him to balance his investors\u2019 demands for maximum short-term profits and stock-price gains against other demands for the research and investment that create long-term innovation, productivity, and general prosperity.\n\nIn April 2024, Fink suggested American politicians should grow wealth via investment instead of via President Joe Biden\u2019s policy of extracting migrant consumers, renters, and wage-cutting workers from poor countries.\n\n\u201cI can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,\u201d Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued:\n\nThat\u2019s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don\u2019t allow anybody to come in \u2014 [so they have] shrinking demographics \u2014 these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology \u2026 If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations.\n\nBut on Monday\u2019s event in Houston, Fink focused on the near-term inflation expected as Trump rolls back Biden\u2019s mass legal and illegal migration. Fink argued:\n\nI do believe deportations \u2014 and the speed at which it is happening \u2014 is going to have a severe impact on the agricultural sector [and] the construction sector. I\u2019ve talked to CEOs in the ag sector, and they remind me that 70 percent of the men and women who work in agriculture were not born in the United States. Many are U.S. citizens. Now many of them have work permits and many of them don\u2019t. Now 40 percent of the construction workers were not born in the United States. You add that up and what\u2019s going on? I think \u2026 are we going to have enough workers to harvest the crops?\n\nBiden\u2019s high-migration economy reduced wage-driven inflation by importing several million migrant workers. For example, wages rose by less than 1 percent from January 2024 to January 2025 under Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s deputies forgot that migrants need housing, food, and autos \u2014 and those prices zoomed upwards as roughly 12 million migrants crowded into the United States. The resulting consumer-caused inflation caused massive political problems for Biden and his Democrats.\n\nTrump has ended Biden\u2019s migration policy, so he faces no additional consumer-caused inflation. But he and his deputies are zig-zagging forward, by welcoming modest wage gains for Americans while hoping those wage gains do not drive up prices and inflation.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s deputies are deporting perhaps 2 million foreign criminals and migrants already ordered home by judges. Many other migrants are in hiding, some are being caught during workplace visits, and some are voluntarily going home \u2014 but there is no sign that Trump\u2019s deputies are already targeting agriculture workers or construction crews.\n\nThere are millions of unemployed American men and women who might replace deported migrants.\n\nAt least 5 million demoralized or alienated men have fallen out of the labor force since 2000 and are not officially counted as unemployed. Many can be cajoled, shamed, enticed, or pushed back into the workforce once companies run out of cheap workers. The return of the sidelined workers will reduce pressure for further wage gains, and so reduce inflation.\n\nU.S. companies will also likely increase efforts to raise productivity via high-tech automation, just as they did in Trump\u2019s first term."

            "full_content": "Ukraine on Tuesday agreed to a preliminary proposal put forward by the Trump administration that called for a 30-day ceasefire contingent on Russia's acceptance of the terms in a major step toward ending the brutal war.\n\nBut even if the Trump administration is able to get Moscow to the negotiating table and end the three-year war under a new treaty, which several security experts say Russian President Vladimir Putin is under no real pressure to do, can the Kremlin chief be trusted?\n\nRussia under Putin has repeatedly violated formal international agreements intended to protect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, chiefly from its former Soviet overlord.\n\nUKRAINE ACCEPTS DEAL, SAYS RUBIO: 'WE'LL TAKE THIS TO THE RUSSIANS'\n\nThese agreements include the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear arsenal in exchange for assurances over its territorial integrity after its 1991 withdrawal from the Soviet Union, as well as the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership by which Moscow and Kyiv agreed to respect one another\u2019s existing borders. Both deals were first violated in 2014 when Putin seized Crimea and backed Russian separatist forces in the Donbas region.\n\nThe 2014-2015 Minsk Agreements, though criticized as \"weak,\" attempted to end Russia\u2019s aggression in eastern Ukraine, an agreement that was never fully achieved and was again violated by Putin's 2022 invasion.\n\nSome world leaders and security officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have cautioned that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely to be achieved in the near term and against Putin\u2019s reliability in adhering to any international agreement without serious security commitments from the West.\n\n\"The problem here is that the Russians only understand win-lose outcomes, which means that to prevent them from ever attacking Ukraine again, they must see themselves to be the losers in the war just as they did at the end of the Cold War,\" Michael Ryan, former deputy assistant secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy and former acting assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, told Fox News Digital.\n\nSecurity officials interviewed by Fox News Digital argued that securing Ukraine\u2019s future is not about \"trusting\" Putin. It\u2019s about actually putting Russia in a position where any future violations would hinder Moscow more than it could be enticed by unchecked opportunity.\n\nTRUMP THREATENS SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, DEMANDS PEACE AFTER MAJOR HITS IN UKRAINE\n\n\"Even if a deal is concluded, Russia will continue clandestine operations across the world to expand its footprint in terms of geopolitical influence,\" Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital, noting the former KGB operative can be counted on to \"continue election interference campaigns, cyber warfare, espionage and destabilization operations across the globe.\n\n\"There\u2019s no such thing as peace in Russia\u2019s strategic military thinking. You are in a constant confrontation.\"\n\nRyan argued a Trump-brokered peace deal needs to reflect on the lessons learned from previously failed agreements, like the post-WWI Treaty of Versailles, which arguably led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.\n\n\"How to solve this conundrum? Just as we did after World War II \u2026 reconstruction of Ukraine must include economic reconciliation with Russia,\" Ryan said. \"The Russians saw how we rebuilt the losing side in World War II Germany and Japan. They expected us to do the same for Russia after the Cold War, but we did not.\n\n\"We can't make that same mistake if we want lasting peace for Ukraine and if we want to split Russia from China,\" he added, noting other adversaries are watching how the West handles this geopolitical hurdle.\n\nThere are numerous obstacles when it comes to the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to negotiate with Putin, including arguments over occupied territory, international recognition of occupied lands, international aid and support for Ukraine, international confiscation of frozen Russian assets, Zelenskyy\u2019s standing at home, the return of prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children, according to Peter Rough, senior fellow and director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the Hudson Institute.\n\n\"Putin has officially annexed four Ukrainian oblasts as well as Crimea. But Moscow has yet to conquer any of the four entirely,\" Rough told Fox News Digital while traveling to Ukraine. \"I can\u2019t imagine that Ukraine will withdraw from the areas they control, having fought tooth and nail to defend those regions.\n\n\"I also doubt that the West will offer de jure recognition to the areas Moscow controls,\" he added. \"So, Putin would have to swallow all of that in a peace deal.\"\n\nEach issue alone is a massive undertaking to negotiate, and while Ukraine this week may be outlining concessions it could make to secure a deal coordinated by the U.S., Putin is unlikely to do the same, according to Koffler, who briefed NATO years ahead of the 2022 invasion on Putin\u2019s plans.\n\nRUBIO SAYS MINERAL DEAL \u2018NOT MAIN TOPIC ON AGENDA\u2019 IN UKRAINE MEETING\n\n\"Putin is unlikely to make any concessions as he believes he is in a strong position,\" Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"The disparity in combat potential dramatically favors Russia over Ukraine, which is out-manned and outgunned because Putin transitioned the Russian military and economy on a wartime footing seven years prior to the invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Putin believes he has prepared Russia to fight till the last Ukrainian and till the last missile in NATO\u2019s arsenal,\" she added, echoing a January warning issued by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who said Russia\u2019s defense industry output over a three-month period equates to what all of NATO produces an entire year.\n\n\"Putin is highly unlikely to agree to a ceasefire because he doesn\u2019t want to give a strategic pause to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO to re-arm,\" Koffler said. \"He doesn\u2019t trust Washington. He doesn\u2019t trust President Trump any more than we trust Putin.\n\n\"He trusts Trump even less than Biden because he could read Biden and predict his behavior. He cannot read Trump because Trump is unpredictable.\"\n\nThe experts argued there are too many variables that could play out during negotiations that will determine whether Putin can be adequately held accountable or \"trusted\" regarding future agreements.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUltimately, Koffler said, Putin will not leave eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine has always been a red line for Putin, in terms of who has geopolitical control of it, Russia or the West. And he will continue to enforce this red line,\" she said. \"The only way to ensure that Putin doesn\u2019t invade another country is to make NATO strong again, beef up force posture, increase defense spending, secure its command-and-control networks and develop actual deterrence and counter-strategy that addresses every prong of Putin\u2019s strategy.\""

He also criticized Trump for cutting off military aid to Ukraine after that Oval Office slugfest which Volodymyr Zelenskyy botched, trying to talk over Trump as he was scolded, and ended up being evicted from the White House.\n\nWe all know that Musk is a business genius and an impulsive guy.

Musk has engaged in bitter exchanges with Marco Rubio (though they\u2019re playing nice now) and with Steve Bannon. But Elon has become a lightning rod, especially since his DOGE team has made a series of high-profile mistakes, firing and rehiring crucial experts.\n\nTrump decided to stand by his man, and posted this:\n\n\"To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is \u2018putting it on the line\u2019 in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!

That\u2019s the big one to eliminate.\"\n\nPerhaps Musk should concentrate on the plunging stock market, caused primarily by uncertainty over Trump\u2019s tariff wars but also by worries about the impact of DOGE\u2019s mass firings.\n\nPeople pay into Social Security over a lifetime with the expectation it will be there when they retire.

            "full_content": "James Carville\u2019s political instincts remain sharp, though he is not as in tune with the current political moment as he was 33 years ago. Still, you could do worse as a political maxim than \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe economy has long been a top issue, though far from the only issue, for Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s business acumen, entrenched in the voters\u2019 minds through a decades-long public relations blitz culminating in a star reality TV turn, was a major reason the electorate was willing to entrust the presidency to a political neophyte.\n\nIf the economy of Trump\u2019s first term, with low unemployment, low inflation, and solid GDP growth, had continued through election day, in retrospect it is clear that he would have been reelected. Not by a landslide, but probably by a margin similar to what he achieved last November. Alas, the pandemic\u2014and Anthony Fauci\u2014intervened and aborted the Trump boom.\n\nBut as the Joe Biden interregnum wore on, voters developed a nostalgia for the economy of circa 2019. Inflation began spiking, soon reaching 9.1 percent, a 41-year high. The economy still grew most quarters and unemployment remained low by historical standards, even if the jobs market was often less rosy than it initially appeared as the numbers were revised downward. But the high cost of living eroded whatever advantages accrued from other, more positive economic metrics.\n\nAt least some voters came to understand that the economic downturn of 2020 was caused mainly by the lockdowns, of which Trump was at best a reluctant adopter. They wanted their pre-pandemic economy back. Polls consistently showed Trump was trusted to do a better job handling the economy than Biden or Kamala Harris.\n\nThat sentiment prevailed on election day, according to the exit polls, with Trump winning 81 percent of voters who listed the economy as their top issue, 70 percent among those who rated the economy as poor or not so good, and 88 percent of voters who said it was just poor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has always had other issues besides the economy, such as immigration, anti-wokeness, and general resistance to the left on the culture war. On those, he still retains an upper hand. But for the first time since the height of the pandemic, people are feeling anxious about a Trump-led economy. The stock market and other indexes of economic confidence are down.\n\nThe tariffs are less targeted than during the first term, and their status is changing frequently. This time the tariffs, rather than tax cuts (which Congress still needs to extend) or deregulation, is dominating the coverage of the Trump agenda. And Elon Musk actually wants to cut spending.\n\nWhile Trump wants to be associated with general prosperity, a \u201cgolden age\u201d even, his ambitions were always greater than restoring the economy of 2019. He wants to reindustrialize vast swathes of the country and reshore American jobs. Many, perhaps most, economists believe that Trump has bitten off more than he can chew.\n\nThat was said of Ronald Reagan, too. Passing a big tax cut in a period of inflation worse than under Biden was viewed as pouring gasoline on an already roaring fire. Most economists believed there was an inherent tradeoff between cutting inflation and unemployment, which Reagan rejected. And there was an attempt to cut federal spending and personnel, beginning with the firing of striking air traffic controllers.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve tightened the money supply to put the screws to inflation, largely with Reagan\u2019s support despite the chairman having been appointed by Jimmy Carter, the economy did initially get worse. There was a recession in 1982, during which unemployment reached 10.8 percent, the highest since the Great Depression. Republicans lost seats in the midterm elections that year.\n\nBut after that, the economy began to recover and then boom. Inflation and unemployment both fell. By 1984, the annual growth rate was the highest in 34 years. Between 1983 and 1989, the U.S. added the equivalent of Japan\u2019s whole economy to its GDP. Reagan was reelected in a 49-state landslide. He was fewer than one vote per precinct in Minnesota, his Democratic challenger\u2019s home state, away from sweeping all 50.\n\nThe Reagan economic legacy, and especially its relevance to public policy in subsequent times, remains hotly debated today. But the bottom line is that a lot of dire predictions either failed to come to fruition or were short-lived and stagflation ended.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, that is not the only possible historical analogy. There is a more recent one. Biden was warned that continuing to increase federal spending, especially as the pandemic was ending and people were already returning to work, would pour gasoline on a then just smoldering inflationary fire. That is exactly what happened, and the problem was far from \u201ctransitory.\u201d His presidency was basically ruined in its first months, and Trump was later returned to office.\n\nOf course, it is possible that none of the historical analogies favored by those of us who write about politics for a living will describe what happens under Trump. But he surely prefers the story of the man whose picture he hung in the Oval Office to that of the man he ousted from the premises.\n\nThat\u2019s the story Carville would rather tell about his candidate, anyway."

            "full_content": "A House hearing ended abruptly Tuesday after an exchange between a Republican and a Democratic committee member over the GOP chair\u2019s misgendering Rep. Sarah McBride.\n\nAt the hearing hosted by the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, recognized McBride, D-Del., to speak and misgendered her in the process. McBride is the first openly trans member of Congress.\n\n\u201cI now recognize the representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride.\u201d\n\nWithout missing a beat, McBride responded by thanking Self and referring to him as \u201cmadam chair.\u201d\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe subcommittee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, then interjected and asked Self to repeat his remarks. After Self doubled down and called McBride \u201cmister,\u201d he said, \u201cWe have set the standard on the House floor.\u201d\n\nKeating turned to Self and said those remarks were \u201cnot decent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, you are out of order,\u201d Keating said. \u201cMr. Chairman, have you no decency? I mean, I have come to know you a little bit, but this is not decent.\u201d\n\nSelf tried to continue the hearing, but Keating stopped him, saying, \u201cYou will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way.\u201d\n\nIn response, Self struck down his gavel and declared the hearing adjourned. As people shuffled out of the room, Keating patted McBride on the shoulder.\n\nThe hearing was billed as a discussion of the State Department and policies on arms control, international security and U.S. assistance to Europe.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed that the Chair decided to end a committee hearing early,\" McBride said in a statement Tuesday night. \"I was prepared to move forward with my questions for the Subcommittee on nuclear nonproliferation and US support for Democratic allies in Europe.\"\n\nWhen reached by NBC News, a spokesperson for Keating said the congressman \"doesn't think there is a need for additional comment as the video speaks for itself.\"\n\nSelf's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRep. Keith Self, R-Texas; Rep. Bill Keating, D-Mass.; Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. Getty Images\n\nSelf responded to a clip of the confrontation on X, writing, \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump used that language in a Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the federal government will only recognize two, unchangeable sexes.\n\nRep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., on Feb. 6 referred to McBride as \u201cthe gentleman from Delaware\u201d during remarks on the House floor. Miller criticized the Congressional Record for initially revising her words to say \u201cMs. McBride,\u201d in a post on X.\n\nThe Congressional Record from that day now refers to McBride as said by Miller: \u201cThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. MILLER of Illinois). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. MCBRIDE, for 5 minutes.\u201d\n\nIn November, McBride made history by becoming the first out transgender person elected to Congress.\n\nBefore she was sworn in, McBride quickly became a target for some Republican lawmakers. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced a resolution weeks after McBride was elected banning transgender women from using female bathrooms in the Capitol.\n\nThe next day, Mace said her resolution was \u201cabsolutely\u201d aimed at McBride.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., informally enacted the bathroom policy in November and renewed it at the start of this year as one of the policies for the 119th Congress.\n\nMcBride told NBC News in January that she was not taking the \u201cbait\u201d over the bathroom policy, adding that it was meant to \u201cdiminish my capacity to be an effective member of Congress\u201d and that people who secured historic \u201cfirsts\u201d like her must \u201cpick their battles.\u201d"
