            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, Shannon Pettypiece breaks down another roller-coaster day for President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans. Plus, Jonathan Allen explains that speed has proven to be Trump\u2019s ally in his efforts to slash the government.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nTrump's on-again, off-again tariffs are partly off again\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday issued exemptions on tariffs for some goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, two days after putting in place sweeping 25% tariffs that rattled stock markets, as businesses warned the move would increase prices for consumers, NBC News\u2019 Shannon Pettypiece reports.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in less than two months that Trump has announced and then backtracked on tariffs on the United States\u2019 neighbors. But the exemption comes with an expiration date, just like Wednesday\u2019s exemption for automakers, continuing to rattle the stock market and a wide range of industries.\n\n\u201cThe can keeps getting pushed, kicked down the road, and we don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d said Chuck Dardas, president of AlphaUSA, an auto parts manufacturer in Livonia, Michigan.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News\u2019 Christine Romans, he later added: \u201cTo make investments and to do things we need to do, we need some certainty. Not that we can have perfect certainty \u2014 but not be on a constant diet of, well, we\u2019ll wait till next month to see if the ax is going to fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing, I guess, to be certain is that we\u2019ve got 30 more days to worry about it,\u201d Dardas said.\n\nThe new exemption Trump signed on Thursday would apply to goods compliant with the North American free trade agreement reached during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and will last until April 2, when Trump plans another round of retaliatory tariffs on goods from a range of countries.\n\nAbout half of goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico would fall under the exemption, and around 38% of goods from Canada would qualify, said a senior administration official. That includes potash, which is used in fertilizers.\n\nBut some Canadian energy products won\u2019t qualify and will be subject to a 10% tariff. And all other goods, including computers from Mexico, will be subject to the 25% tariff, the senior administration official said.\n\nRead more: Stocks fall as markets grapple with Trump\u2019s rapid shifts in tariff policy, by Rob Wile\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump\u2019s biggest advantage in his bid to slash the government: Speed\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nSpeed kills. Especially when it comes to slashing government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has run into a few snags in his rush to slay the bureaucracy, including having to reverse some of his own decisions to summarily fire federal workers and watching courts intervene.\n\nBut Trump learned a valuable strategic lesson from his first term: The executive can move faster than the other branches of government. In less than seven weeks, Congress has become a bystander branch as Trump hacks up departments, agencies, programs and workforces that lawmakers created and funded.\n\nFederal judges have noted that the Trump administration is ignoring orders to stop various aspects of its downsizing campaign. It remains to be seen whether he will listen to the Supreme Court. Some of his supporters are arguing that he should tell the justices to pound sand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why President Trump can\u2019t defy the Supreme Court & refuse to send the money,\u201d Amy Kremer, an activist who helped organize Trump\u2019s Jan. 6, 2021, rally, wrote on X Wednesday after the high court ruled against the president\u2019s freeze of $2 billion in foreign aid. \u201cHe is doing the work of the American people & trying to save our tax dollars from being abused & wasted. He has presidential immunity.\u201d\n\nBut for the intended recipients, the money dried up weeks ago. It\u2019s hard to imagine that even if the spigot is turned back on, there will have been no harm to the beneficiaries. Likewise, whether Trump can legally fire hundreds of thousands of federal workers \u2014 as he has done \u2014 there is zero chance that any court order will restore them all. The same goes for domestic-program grants halted by the Trump White House.\n\nJudges and lawmakers spend a lot of their time theorizing about the balance of power. Trump is wasting no time in turning it toward him.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udde3 Address aftermath: The Republican-controlled House voted to censure Rep.

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nAbout a year ago, the whole political world was focused on polls to determine whether Joe Biden\u2019s feisty March 7 State of the Union Address would improve his fragile public standing. As it turns out, it didn\u2019t, since he got virtually no \u201cbounce\u201d in the polls despite a performance that got rave reviews from Democrats and grudging appreciation from others.\n\nNow, to be clear, Donald Trump isn\u2019t in the same position today, since he has (unless there is a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat) run his last race. But given the recklessness of his early second-term steps and the less-than-secure hold his party has on the U.S. House of Representatives, public support for his agenda still matters. (It seems to even matter to Trump himself, given how often he cites made-up or outlier polling data in his speeches.) So how is the public reacting to his big speech to Congress Tuesday night?\n\nWe don\u2019t have much post-speech polling to look at just yet, but what we do have doesn\u2019t indicate much of an impact. The one post-speech approval-rating poll, from Rasmussen Reports, showed his ratio moving from 50 percent positive and 48 percent negative on March 4 to 51-49 percent on March 5, but then back down to 50-48 percent on March 6 for no net gain.\n\nTrump fans were very enthused by two \u201csnap\u201d polls conducted immediately after the speech showing 69 percent (CNN) and 76 percent (CBS) of those who watched the address approving as opposed to 31 percent (CNN) and 23 percent (CBS) disapproving. But the usual \u201cskew\u201d of presidential speech viewers toward the chief executive\u2019s fans was pretty extreme in this case: 44 percent of CNN\u2019s poll respondents were Republicans and only 21 percent were Democrats, and 51 percent of CBS\u2019 speech-watchers were Republicans as opposed to 20 percent who were Democrats. It\u2019s very likely that the self-identified independents responding to these polls were heavily Republican-leaning.\n\nIn other words, and unsurprisingly, the polarization of presidential speech-watchers has intensified this year, with Democrats largely tuning out and Trump mostly preaching to the choir. Since Trump pretty much recapitulated the tone and substance of his 2024 campaign speeches, and offered almost nothing in the way of new policy proposals, it stands to reason that the event won\u2019t change much of anything politically. Nor will anyone long remember the scattered Democratic protests on which Republicans shed so many crocodile tears in the immediate wake of the speech, as though Trump himself exhibited \u201cdecorum\u201d and \u201ccivility\u201d which protesters spoiled. That joint session of Congress he addressed is probably best understood as the last MAGA rally of the 2024 campaign cycle, unless he chooses to keep holding them until the day he leaves office, which is entirely possible."

            "full_content": "Photo: The Tucker Carlson Show\n\nIn the days following FTX\u2019s dramatic exposure as a billion-dollar fraud in 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, considered a pivot away from the Democratic Party, to which he gave so much money. During his trial, prosecutors revealed a note in which Bankman-Fried reminded himself to \u201cgo on Tucker Carlsen [sic], come out as a republican.\u201d\n\nIn his PR disaster for the ages, the linkup with Tucker Carlson never happened. But more than two years later, sitting in the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the convicted fraudster serving 25 years finally had the time to give that interview \u2014 in which the ex\u2013Fox News host mostly wanted to gossip about the more famous detainee on Bankman-Fried\u2019s unit.\n\n\u201cAre you hanging with Diddy? I think he\u2019s in there with you,\u201d Carlson asked of the rapper charged with sex trafficking. \u201cHe\u2019s been kind to me,\u201d Bankman-Fried said of his new friend.\n\n\u201cIf someone told me three years ago that, Oh, you\u2019d be hanging out with Diddy every day, I\u2019d be like, That\u2019s interesting; I wonder how that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Bankman-Fried mused. \u201cI guess he gets into crypto or something.\u201d\n\nJUST IN: Sam Bankman-Fried says he shares a prison unit with Diddy.\n\n\n\n\"He's been kind to me.\" pic.twitter.com/OxiLZRriqn \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 6, 2025\n\nCarlson, who hasn\u2019t always been so nice to Bankman-Fried, then asked why none of the Democrats who received FTX donations came to his aid during his legal ordeal. Bankman-Fried said that around the time his company was exposed, he was starting to flirt more with the Republican Party \u2014 which he asserted \u201cprobably played a role\u201d in the government\u2019s prosecution of him.\n\nPerhaps Bankman-Fried had forgotten how he was convicted for a smorgasbord of fraud, including using customer deposits to cover his massive trading losses at his investment firm. But his comments suggest he is bummed to be locked up during a golden age of regulators not giving a hoot about crypto anymore. He criticized former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, calling him a \u201cpolitically ambitious\u201d partisan who \u201cwanted his agency to get more power even if he didn\u2019t want to do anything with it except block industries.\u201d With Gensler out at the SEC and regulators dropping high-profile cases against Bankman-Fried\u2019s un-incarcerated peers, he said that \u201cthere are a lot of good things\u201d that President Donald Trump is doing to end the government\u2019s \u201cobstructive role for a decade\u201d on crypto. Alas, he is missing out on the unregulated fun.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that we may be hearing more from Bankeman-Fried. The New York Times reports that his parents \u2014 who once called themselves his \u201cpartner in crime of the non-criminal sort\u201d \u2014 are leading a push to get Trump to pardon their son. His parents, who made millions off FTX, have reached out to a lawyer on Trump\u2019s 2016 and 2020 campaigns and have placed opinion pieces in the Washington Post suggesting Trump\u2019s ideas aren\u2019t all that bad. So far though, the plan has resulted in restrictions on his freedom. The Bureau of Prisons has clear rules about how prisoners can communicate with the outside world \u2014 rules that do not include going on video podcasts with influential hosts. After the interview with Carlson went online, Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement."

            "full_content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 When Andrew and Tristan Tate touched down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last week, the two social media figures \u2014 who had been charged with human trafficking in Romania \u2014 found some support in right-wing circles for their return home.\n\nBut one of their most prominent critics has been a conservative: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who immediately said the brothers were not welcome in the state. State Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is the governor\u2019s former chief of staff and close political adviser, said the state would open a criminal investigation into the men, although he did not outline specific allegations.\n\nAndrew Tate announced Thursday that he was leaving Florida \u2014 saying he\u2019d be back \u201cin a few years\u201d \u2014 which likely ends any potential investigation. (His brother also posted a picture from a plane.) But the political impact on DeSantis\u2019 future might last longer.\n\nDeSantis\u2019 decision to antagonize some on the right by going hard after the Tate brothers puts him at odds with elements of the MAGA movement \u2014 including some allies of the president \u2014 who are still upset with him for challenging Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nDeSantis said he didn't want the Tate brothers in Florida. Rebecca Blackwell / AP file\n\nTrump himself has avoided talking about the return of the Tate brothers or the Florida investigation into them, but the issue has put DeSantis and Uthmeier at the center of a fight on the political right over whether the men, who hold dual U.S.-British citizenship, were being unfairly targeted since there have not been any criminal allegations against them in Florida, or if the Florida effort was squarely in line with conservative values to investigate two men accused of abusing women and girls.\n\nThe White House did not return a request seeking comment, but a Trump adviser brushed off the Tate issue, suggesting the investigation was just DeSantis\u2019 attempt to remain politically \u201crelevant\u201d after his failed presidential run against Trump.\n\nThe Trump orbit in the past has expressed support for the Tate brothers.\n\nAndrew Tate and Donald Trump Jr. appeared in a discussion on X last summer focused on Hunter Biden\u2019s legal problems.\n\nTrump Jr. called Tate \u201cbuddy,\u201d and Tate called him \u201cfriend.\u201d During the event, Trump Jr. said that Tate was being unfairly attacked.\n\n\u201cYou have people attacking you as far as I\u2019m concerned. \u2026 They just want to silence you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have entered the arena by speaking out.\u201d\n\nAlina Habba, a counselor to the president, said in January during an interview with Andrew Tate that she was a \u201cbig fan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think your anger is the same that President Trump has for our country. And the time is now for us to stop being wimps,\u201d she said to Tate. \u201cI also have to say that I sympathize with you because I think you go through a lot of the same \u2018show me the person, I\u2019ll find the crime\u2019 that President Trump has gone through.\u201d\n\nBeyond the legal fight, the issue brought on renewed layers of political intrigue since the Tates arrived in Florida.\n\nRic Grenell, the Trump administration\u2019s presidential envoy for special missions, reposted an X post from Andrew Tate that accused DeSantis of attacking him because he \u201cwas worried\u201d that Tate would support Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., in the Florida 2026 gubernatorial race. DeSantis has a notoriously icy relationship with Donalds, who has been endorsed by Trump, while his wife, Casey DeSantis, is considering her own run for governor against Donalds.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, I had no interest in Florida politics until I learnt how communist the DeSantis admin is,\u201d Tate said in the post elevated by Grenell. \u201cThe game is on.\u201d\n\nOver the past week, DeSantis supporters have pressured Donalds to comment on the Tate issue. On Wednesday, he did, siding with DeSantis\u2019 position and against the Tates.\n\n\u201cI think those allegations have to be fully investigated, and that we go from there,\u201d Donalds told CBC News. \u201cThe key thing is, we don\u2019t tolerate the trafficking of women, or frankly, the abuse of women.

Frank is widely believed to have been falsely accused and unjustly convicted. His case led to the formation of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nLeo Frank raped & murdered a 13-year-old girl.\n\n\n\nHe also tried to frame a black man for his crime.\n\n\n\nThe ADL is despicable. https://t.co/BGfjjxxAUh \u2014 Kingsley Wilson (@KingsleyCortes) March 11, 2023\n\n\u201cWhite supremacists and other antisemites have long used conspiracy theories about the Leo Frank case to cast doubt on the circumstances of the antisemitic lynching of Leo Frank,\u201d the ADL wrote in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply disturbed that any public official would parrot these hateful and false conspiracy theories, and we hope Kingsley Wilson will immediately retract her remarks.\u201d\n\nWilson also has expressed opposition to U.S. military intervention abroad, posting days after the war in Gaza started, \u201cMy future children will not die in foreign ethnic conflicts a world away.\u201d In July, she called NATO \u201cnothing more than an international HR department.\u201d\n\nShe specifically opposed American military support for Israel. At the end of 2024, Wilson wrote, \"Why is the U.S. military defending Israel & Ukraine\u2019s border but not our own?\", and in 2023, replied to an X post by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett: \u201cFight your own wars. America First.\u201d\n\nWilson and the Defense Department did not immediately reply to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment on Wilson\u2019s past posts, or whether they represent the views of the Pentagon.\n\nWilson has also railed against U.S. funding for Ukraine, describing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an \u201centitled midget,\u201d and asking, \u201cWhy should American taxpayers help defend Ukraine?\u201d She has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling his \u201cencyclopedic knowledge of his people\u2019s history beyond impressive.\u201d\n\nOn her X account, Wilson has shown support for Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, mentioning it multiple times along with a German phrase that translates to \u201cforeigners out.\u201d\n\nShe has previously declared \u201cMake Kosovo Serbia again,\u201d despite Kosovo being officially recognized as an independent state by the U.S. in the years after the two Balkan countries fought a war in the 1990s.

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump has for years wildly exaggerated the size of US trade deficits with various other countries. Now, as Trump cites those trade deficits as a key justification for his tariff policies, newly released federal statistics show just how wrong Trump\u2019s numbers are.\n\nPreviously released federal figures for 2023 and part of 2024 had already shown that Trump\u2019s claims about the US deficits with Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union were way off. Now, the Department of Commerce has published full-year 2024 figures that allow us to say precisely how far off.\n\nThe figures were released Thursday, hours before Trump announced a pause, until April 2, on his tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement he signed in his first term.\n\nBefore we get into the data, a quick reminder: Having a trade deficit with another country means the US imports more goods and services from the country than the US exports. Though Trump often describes trade deficits as subsidies or losses, having a deficit does not mean the US is giving away money for nothing.\n\nFor example, the US trade deficit with Canada exists largely because the US imports a large quantity of cheap Canadian heavy crude oil that helps keep gas prices down for American drivers.\n\nCanada\n\nTrump, who on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on almost all imports from Canada (10% on energy), has repeatedly said this year that the US has a \u201c$200 billion\u201d trade deficit with Canada \u2013 sometimes making the claim explicitly and sometimes using vaguer language about a supposed $200 billion subsidy or loss to Canada.\n\nTrump\u2019s number is not even close to correct. The new federal statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion, down from $40.6 billion in 2023.\n\nEven if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the 2024 deficit with Canada was $70.6 billion. It was $72.3 billion in 2023.\n\nMexico\n\nTrump also imposed 25% tariffs on products imported from Mexico. He said in a Fox News interview in February, \u201cWe have a deficit with Mexico of $350 billion.\u201d\n\nAgain, that\u2019s distant from reality. The new federal figures show the 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods and services trade was $179 billion, up from $162.1 billion in 2023.\n\nThe 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods trade alone was $181.5 billion, up from $161.4 billion in 2023.\n\nChina\n\nTrump, who has imposed a series of tariffs in his first and second presidential terms on products imported from China, said in a Fox News Radio interview in February that \u201cwe have a deficit with China of over $1 trillion.\u201d He repeated the \u201c$1 trillion\u201d number in a February speech.\n\nThat, too, is a massive exaggeration. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was $263.3 billion. That\u2019s up from $252.1 billion in 2023 \u2013 but lower than in every year of Trump\u2019s first presidency.\n\nTrade deficits rise and fall for numerous reasons other than presidential policy. We mention the fact that Biden-era deficits were lower than Trump-era deficits, though, because Trump has claimed that Biden let the deficit with China \u201cget out of hand.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 deficit with China in goods trade alone was $295.2 billion, up from $278.7 billion in 2023.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nTrump has regularly, and incorrectly, castigated the European Union over its trade practices. He told reporters in February that \u201cwith the European Union, it\u2019s, you know, $350 billion deficit.\u201d He said at a subsequent February event that it\u2019s \u201cabout a $300 billion deficit with the European Union.\u201d\n\nWrong once more. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods and services trade was $161.1 billion, up from $125.1 billion in 2023.\n\nThe 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods trade alone was $236.7 billion, up from $201.6 billion in 2023. So, counting only goods trade, Trump\u2019s claims about the deficit with the European Union are a bit closer to the truth than his claims about the deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China \u2013 but they\u2019re still not actually close to the truth.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nWhen the Department of Government Efficiency swings an axe, it\u2019s bound to hit a veteran who voted for President Donald Trump.\n\nVeterans make up thirty percent of the federal workforce and more than sixty percent of veterans said Trump was their candidate, according to a Pew Research survey conducted two months before the 2024 election.\n\nOne veteran in Kansas who voted for Trump describes terminations that have upended the lives of many employees in his agency as a sudden military drawdown, poorly executed:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to put it like this: it was like the pull out of Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want me to identify him by name. He\u2019s concerned it will negatively impact him.\n\nHe still supports Trump and shrinking the federal government, but not how the administration is going about it.\n\n\u201cThey got in there, they thought \u2018we need to shake things up.\u2019 The system is rigged,\u201d he insisted, \u201cbut with that being said, nobody stopped to take a minute, sit back. It was a rash decision.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has based firings mostly on whether an employee is probationary, a status conferred on new federal employees but also on some who have been recently promoted or those who have moved between jobs even within the same agency.\n\nThere has been little accounting for military service and, in at least one case, whether they\u2019re actively deployed as a member of the National Guard or Reserve.\n\nAt one agency - not the Department of Defense, to be clear - I learned officials fired a probationary employee on leave from his civilian federal job for a military deployment, according to a source familiar with the circumstances of the employee.\n\nAgency officials took the action despite a longstanding federal law that specifically prohibits employers from terminating members of the Guard and Reserve from their civilian day jobs while their units are activated.\n\n\u2018At this position \u2026 I have found my peace\u2019\n\nThe Kansas veteran, like so many other vets, was sold on working for the federal government by none other than the federal government.\n\nAdministration after administration - including Trump in his first term - have championed veteran hiring, not just at the Pentagon, but at agencies across the government, in positions around the country, doing work that affects Americans in flyover states.\n\n\u201cI realize a lot of people from the east coast and Washington DC and from the west coast don\u2019t get out here much,\u201d the veteran says, \u201cbut when you\u2019re driving through Missouri, Kansas \u2026 Illinois, sometimes Kentucky, Tennessee, you see fields on both sides of the road and there\u2019s terraces out there, there\u2019s waterways out there: those are infrastructure to help keep eroding soils from turning into essentially dirt farms \u2026 that blow \u2026 whatever direction the wind is blowing.\u201d\n\nHe found a job - a job he loved - at the Natural Resources Conservation Services, an agency within the Department of Agriculture that was created as a direct result of the Dust Bowl in 1935, back when it was known as the Soil Conservation Service.\n\nThe agency protects farmlands and grasslands, manages watersheds, smaller dams and assists areas recovering from natural disasters.\n\nAfter fighting in the war in Afghanistan, helping rural communities, farmers and ranchers allowed the Kansas veteran to serve in a different way.\n\nIt also provided him something unexpected and priceless: a way to process his experience in the military. (a way to calm what his military service had stirred up - a way to quiet what his military service had made so loud).\n\n\u201cAt this position for the NRCS I have found my peace,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou go from one extreme to another. You go from war and terror to barbecuing with your family in the backyard. It\u2019s hard to do that,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThis job was a way\u2026\u201d\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cYou know, in the military, being combat arms, you see death, destruction and dismay. This was life, rejuvenation and construction. It was the complete opposite of what us combat arms guys come from.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that has the power to review and reverse federal employee firings, ordered the nearly 6,000 probationary workers fired by USDA reinstated for 45 days pending an investigation of the legality of their firings.\n\nPresumably the order covers this veteran, but as of the publishing of this story he hadn\u2019t heard from his former employer that he had his job back.\n\nAnd the move provides little certainty to these workers. The standing of the chair of the Merit Board, Cathy Harris, is tenuous. Trump recently fired her. A judge quickly stayed her firing, but the administration is expected to appeal the decision all the way to the Supreme Court, which has favored expanding presidential power.\n\n\u2018We love our veterans\u2019\n\nLast Friday in the Oval Office, a pool reporter asked Trump if he was tracking how many veterans have been fired so far.\n\n\u201cYes we are, and we take good care of our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re watching that very carefully. And we hope it\u2019s going to be as small a number as possible. But we are having great success in slimming down our government \u2026 We love our veterans. We\u2019re going to take good care of them.\u201d\n\nIf the Trump administration is tracking the number of veterans it has fired, they have not disclosed it, and a number of sources familiar with the information used in the initial firings say veteran status was not considered.\n\nVeterans have been left to plead their cases on an ad hoc basis, without much success.\n\nThe Kansas veteran called the state offices of his member of congress.\n\nHe also called the office of Jerry Moran, Kansas\u2019s senior senator, a Republican who has served almost three decades in congress and chairs the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\n\u201cThey were like \u2018we\u2019ll let him know and if he gets back to you he gets back to you. We\u2019re sorry, he\u2019s a busy man,\u2019\u201d the veteran recalled a young staff member telling him.\n\nThe Kansas veteran was hoping for a chance to ask his congressman for help in person, but recent confrontations at town halls have gone viral on social media, prompting many GOP lawmakers to abandon talking to their constituents in person.\n\n\u201cThese skype calls: there\u2019s a lot of these senators and congressmen holding these town halls through conference calls,\u201d lamented the veteran. \u201cYou have constituents who voted for you, and you can\u2019t look them in the eye? Why not?\u201d\n\nDemocrats have loudly criticized the administration for firing veterans, introduced a bill to reinstate their jobs and invited axed vets as guests at Trump\u2019s address to the joint session of congress.\n\nBut they\u2019re in the minority. They don\u2019t have the votes to pass legislation and they don\u2019t have the ear of the president.\n\nWhile some Republican lawmakers hide from the problems the government overhaul is causing the military and veteran communities, others are working to quietly address the issues.\n\nIn February, several successfully lobbied the White House behind the scenes to carve out an exemption for military spouses in Trump\u2019s executive order requiring all federal employees to return to work in person, though agencies are still not uniformly honoring those exemptions.\n\nSome GOP lawmakers have quietly lobbied the administration to rehire sacked veterans on a case-by-case basis, but many veterans worry about raising their hands to make their identity known.\n\n\u2018These firings - that\u2019s the erosion\u2019\n\nIn ranching, there are consequences if you let cattle graze a pasture all the way down to the roots, or \u201cgrease it down to dirt,\u201d as the veteran explained it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common rule for grass,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Take half, leave half.\u2019 If you take more than half of that grass off that pasture \u2026 that kills the grass. If you don\u2019t have those root fibers in that soil to hold that soil together, you\u2019re going to start eroding.\u201d\n\nAnd in farming, there\u2019s also a right way and a wrong way to avoid erosion. Drop the tine of the plow too deep, past the fertile topsoil, past the subsoil beneath that, into the compacted hardpan earth below, and you can turn a field into moondust that washes away with the rain or blows away with the wind.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever taken a blow-dryer to baby powder on the counter, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s doing,\u201d the veteran said. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of erosion that we\u2019re trying to prevent.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s talking about sustainable farming practices but it\u2019s also his metaphor for what\u2019s happening to jobs like his.\n\n\u201cThese firings - that\u2019s the erosion,\u201d he said, describing the job cuts in terms of soil conservation.\n\n\u201cThey built this big trench and there\u2019s nothing to slow down the water, to slow down their reactions to what they\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no infrastructure there \u2026 to hold that water back, to hold it down to a trickle and not a flood.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas veteran doesn\u2019t regret voting for Trump, but he is unhappy with the people Trump has chosen to execute his vision for a smaller government.\n\nHe thinks they\u2019re disconnected from how their decisions are affecting veterans and people in rural communities like his, taking jobs from veterans and the services they provide farmers and ranchers as well as freezing USDA funding for much needed and already approved projects, including those that address active soil erosion.\n\n\u201cMy message to the president is I\u2019ve got faith in you and I understand what you\u2019re doing but I need you to step back from the situation for a minute and look at the \u2026repercussions,\u201d the veteran says.\n\n\u201cYou can have all these yes men around you but you also need some nos.\u201d"

But it seems Elon Musk did not know there was a way to cut current-year spending without unleashing kiddie coders to commandeer federal-agency data and boss around (or fire) personnel, as Axios reports after Musk\u2019s March 5 meeting with congressional Republicans:\n\nElon Musk and Republican senators are eyeing a package to claw back tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending after meeting in a closed-door lunch on Wednesday. \u2026\n\nMusk has been leading the charge on spending cuts from the White House. Some lawmakers want to make his actions more permanent by making them law.\n\nNo decisions have been made, but there was some early, general support for the idea being pushed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) after the lunch. An infamous deficit hawk, Paul pitched Elon Musk on a massive rescission package during a lunch on Wednesday, he told reporters. Such a package would undo federal funding already approved by Congress.\n\nThe bill would also only require 51 votes to pass the Senate \u2014 no Democrats needed. Paul said specific numbers weren\u2019t discussed, but he\u2019d like to see $500 billion. \u2026\n\nMusk \u201cwas elated\u201d at the idea, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told reporters. \u201cI think he didn\u2019t realize it could be done at 51.\u201d\n\nWhat they were talking about is an arcane procedure, called rescissions, established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 wherein the president can propose clawbacks of unspent current-year appropriations and Congress can approve them on a fast-track vote that cannot be filibustered. It\u2019s a counterpart to the future-year cuts obtainable through budget-reconciliation bills, which the Republican-controlled Congress is slowly moving toward enacting later this year. Rescissions should be familiar to Team Trump, since the 45th president proposed a $15 billion package of such cuts in 2018; they passed the House but were rejected by the Senate, as it happens.\n\nThis time around, rescissions could be immense, as Rand Paul\u2019s half-trillion-dollar suggestion indicates. But the real idea is to reassert some sort of congressional involvement in spending decisions currently being made in the executive branch by Musk\u2019s DOGE, Russ Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, and in some cases by agency leaders following directions from Musk and Vought. Congressional authorization of current-year cuts might also help insulate them from judicial cancellation on grounds that Trump\u2019s agents are usurping powers constitutionally assigned to the legislative branch, as CNN explains:\n\n\u201cWhat we got to do as Republicans is capture their work product, put it in a bill and vote on it,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and chair of the Senate Budget Committee, said, describing how Congress can play a bigger role in implementing DOGE cuts. \u201cWe need to capture this in the legislative process to make it real.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s as far as it goes, that might indeed \u201celate\u201d Musk, since it means Congress rubber-stamping his work and reducing the amount of time his minions spend being deposed for lawsuits over the legality of DOGE\u2019s raids on \u201cthe deep state.\u201d Presumably, congressional Republicans might want some input into the previously chaotic DOGE processes and the chaos and fear they have engendered, not just with respect to federal employees and contractors but among the constituents who depend on the services they provide. But on the other hand, by pursuing rescissions Trump\u2019s faithful congressional allies will own DOGE\u2019s chainsaw approach to federal spending. An additional problem is the risk of losing a rescission vote, as happened to Republicans in 2018 when two GOP senators voted with Democrats to kill the action. Mike Johnson\u2019s entire strategy for surviving 2025 without losing his gavel is to minimize the number of major House floor votes that stress-test his fragile majority. A big rescission package could produce another dangerous moment for House Republicans.\n\nPresumably, Russ Vought and the White House will make the real decision about the advisability of a rescissions package. It\u2019s possible that they are so very deeply invested in consolidating a vast expansion of executive power that they don\u2019t actually want even a rubber-stamp from Congress. But there are some advantages this approach will give them: Once rescissions are proposed, affected spending items are frozen for 45 days until Congress acts upon them, buying time and preventing judicial interventions.\n\nGoing forward, shifting power from DOGE to agency leadership on the one hand and Congress on the other would free up Elon Musk for whatever task he chooses next. It\u2019s sobering to realize that the whole immensely consequential DOGE project was apparently dreamed up by Musk after the November elections and probably took powerful Republicans at both ends of Pennsylvania \u2014 very much including the president of the United States \u2014 by surprise. A lot may depend on whether the financial savior of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign keeps at his current self-appointed task or moves on to something equally destructive."

            "full_content": "Photo: Lev Radin/Sipa USA/AP Photo\n\nThough Mayor Eric Adams might soon be clear of his pending legal case, his bid for reelection is still likely to face some challenges.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday found that only 20 percent of New York City voters approve of Adams\u2019s handling of his job, with 67 percent saying they disapprove. According to Quinnipiac, this is the lowest mayoral approval rating since the university began polling city voters close to 30 years ago. The poll surveyed 1,260 New York City self-identified registered voters from February 27 to March 3.\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there. On the subject of Adams\u2019s corruption case, 40 percent of voters said they believed the mayor did something illegal, while 31 percent said they thought Adams did something unethical but not illegal. Only 13 percent of voters said they think the mayor did nothing wrong. And 56 percent of respondents said they believed Adams should resign from office entirely, while only 35 percent said that he shouldn\u2019t. When it came to whether Adams\u2019s case should be dismissed as the Justice Department has argued, 63 percent of respondents said the charges shouldn\u2019t be dropped, while 25 percent disagreed.\n\nThe new polling comes as another prominent politician has decided to toss her hat into the ring. Politico reports that City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is joining the mayoral race with plans to officially debut her campaign at a rally in Queens, her home district. \u201cI never planned to run for mayor, but I\u2019m not giving up on New York City,\u201d she said in a statement to the outlet. \u201cOur city deserves a leader that serves its people first and always, not someone focused on themselves and their own political interests.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker and the mayor, who aren\u2019t related, both entered their positions of leadership together in 2022, highlighting a long-standing relationship that goes back to their high-school days. But that dynamic has strained in recent years as the two Adamses have clashed as City Hall and the City Council have found themselves increasingly at odds.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll shows neither Adams at the head of the crowded field at this juncture. When asked who they would support if the Democratic primary was held today, 31 percent of voters said they would back former governor Andrew Cuomo, followed by Mayor Adams with 11 percent, Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani with 8 percent, former comptroller Scott Stringer with 6 percent, and current comptroller Brad Lander with 5 percent.\n\nQueens state senator Jessica Ramos and Speaker Adams both received 4 percent, while Brooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie, former hedge-fund manager Whitney Tilson, and former Bronx assemblymember Michael Black were tied with one percent. The survey also included public advocate Jumaane Williams, who is not currently running but would succeed Mayor Adams in the event of a resignation, and he received 7 percent."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nGovernment by chaos is back.\n\nOne day, President Donald Trump imposed a punishing tariff regime against Canada and Mexico. The next, he froze auto duties for a month after suddenly realizing that \u2013 as everyone had predicted \u2013 they could wreck a quintessential American industry.\n\nLast week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to the Oval Office to sign a rare-earth minerals deal that Trump billed as a triumph for the US. But Zelensky was provoked by Vice President JD Vance and kicked out of the White House. European leaders have spent days trying to fix the debacle.\n\nElon Musk, meanwhile, is taking his chainsaw to the bureaucracy, indiscriminately firing workers and feeding agencies into the wood chipper \u2013 pitching citizens and industries who rely on government payments into uncertainty just as the economy softens and is more vulnerable to such shocks.\n\nAt first, Trump\u2019s early-term energy on multiple fronts was a bolt of energy as he scratched his Sharpie across executive orders and chased away the lethargy that marked President Joe Biden\u2019s waning months in office.\n\nSix weeks in, however, as Trump makes gut-check calls to dismantle post-Cold War national security arrangements, the global free trade system, and the federal machine \u2013 all of which helped make the US a superpower \u2013 a new realization is dawning.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s haphazard efforts to make peace in Ukraine, revive Rust Belt-heavy industry with 19th century-style tariffs and slash government are as improvisational as the \u201cweave\u201d \u2013 his name for his stream-of-consciousness campaign screeds.\n\nAnd the world is once again left hanging on the \u201cAmerica first\u201d president\u2019s whims and obsessions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much unpredictability and chaos coming out of the White House right now,\u201d Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said Wednesday, describing US trade policy as a \u201cpsychodrama\u201d her country can\u2019t go through every 30 days.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, February 28, 2025. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump\u2019s gut-check leadership can get results, but just as often backfires\n\nAmerica\u2019s friends are often left to puzzle over what exactly Trump is trying to do.\n\nThe president, for instance, said Wednesday that Canada hadn\u2019t done enough to stem the flow of fentanyl over the border \u2013 but only minuscule amounts of the drug are involved. Sometimes the White House complains about the flow south of undocumented migrants \u2013 but these numbers are also small. Trump also wants manufacturing to leave Canada and move south. No wonder some officials in Ottawa have concluded he\u2019s trying to weaken their country to make it easier to annex.\n\nStill, the president can point to some successes with his threat-based foreign policy. For instance, his fury that a Hong Kong-based firm owned two ports at either end of the Panama Canal is precipitating a purchase by US investment giant BlackRock. The president had falsely claimed these ports meant China controlled the vital waterway built by the US, but the change of ownership may still improve the US strategic position.\n\nAnd Trump might be downgrading the transatlantic alliance that has kept world peace for 80 years \u2013 but he\u2019s set off an unprecedented rearmament program among NATO allies that other presidents have demanded for years.\n\nBut just as often, it\u2019s as if Trump is more interested in brute force personal power than working off any long-term playbook.\n\nMichael Froman, a former US trade representative who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations, told Jim Sciutto on CNN International Wednesday that while the cost of imposing tariffs often outweighs the benefits, they can be a tool that gets other nations to the negotiating table. This is true in the case of Mexico with which the US has far wider border issues than Canada. But, Froman added, \u201cyou have to know what it is you want them to do for that leverage to be useful.\u201d\n\nThe essence of Trumpism\n\nTo some extent, the chaos is the point. And the theatrics of a president addicted to stunt politics are key to his political appeal.\n\nBut allied governments have their own politics to worry about \u2013 a factor the Trump administration often seems to ignore.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \u2013 who is, like Trump, new in office and keen to make a mark \u2013 said Wednesday that her country could consider alternative trade partners to the United States \u201cif necessary.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointedly paid tribute in the House of Commons to British soldiers who were killed fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. This followed a comment by Vance on Fox News that Ukraine needed better security guarantees than undertakings from \u201csome random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d The vice president\u2019s remark caused great offensive in Britain. He said on X that claims he\u2019d been talking about Britain and France were \u201cabsurdly dishonest,\u201d but those are the only allies who have so far publicly volunteered to take part in a post-peace deal reassurance force in Ukraine.\n\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron warned his compatriots Wednesday evening the world had changed utterly since Trump returned to the White House, adding that he was considering extending the protection of France\u2019s nuclear arsenal to European allies.\n\nFor some MAGA supporters, Trump\u2019s genius for enraging Democrats, the media and foreign governments is an end in itself. And for ideologues on the populist nationalist right, sparking pandemonium in Washington and destroying governing agencies is a way of deconstructing the administrative state.\n\nTrump\u2019s method was honed in his office high up in the skyscraper that bears his name in Manhattan.\n\nThe future president learned through his real estate career how to push opponents off balance with outlandish demands, verbal confrontations and sudden switches of position. In government, he does the same thing to disorientate adversaries and seeks to impose power amid the mayhem.\n\nBut while unpredictability is a real estate superpower, it\u2019s a liability when running a country, an economy and a planet \u2013 where continuity and predictability are preferred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just constant, and it\u2019s exhausting,\u201d said Julian Vikan Karaguesian, a former Canadian Ministry of Finance official, referring to Trump\u2019s scorched-earth tariff offensive. \u201cIt\u2019s almost surreal. Is it real? Is it going to be real this time?\u201d Karaguesian, who now lectures at McGill University in Montreal, added: \u201cMaybe the modus operandi here is uncertainty. It\u2019s not tariffs, it\u2019s not anything else, but intentionally creating a sense of chaos and a sense of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nA drone view of Stellantis's Chrysler Windsor Assembly facility in Windsor, Ontario, on February 4, 2025. Carlos Osorio/Reuters\n\nThe auto tariffs that the president froze for a month on Wednesday, a day after imposing blanket 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, shows how he sometimes has second thoughts about his own aggression.\n\nPerhaps his favorite barometer, the stock market, forced his hand. His concession reversed two days of steep losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a handy near-500-point rebound.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that Trump relented after conversations with the CEOs of the Big Three automakers. And his press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he was open to \u201chearing about additional exemptions.\u201d\n\nThe idea that well-placed CEOs can use their access to the powerful to acquire exemptions and special favors not available to ordinary Americans is the antithesis of an equitable economy. But then Trump has shown little respect for rules-based systems that eliminate the kind of patronage and potential for corruption that thrives in autocratic societies.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach may also mean he likes threatening tariffs more than imposing them. But by constantly threatening tariffs and then creating doubt about whether or when they will be maintained, the president is causing huge uncertainty for businesses that need to establish certainty of costs and supply and consumers who could damage an already-softening economy if they rein in spending.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty about what the administration is doing that the mere prospect of tariffs is creating a big anchor on the economy,\u201d Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, told reporters on a conference call Monday. \u201cThe prospect of significant tariffs on our allies has resulted in withholding investments and preemptive price increases that are going to be borne by small businesses and, ultimately, by consumers.\u201d\n\nHow Trump\u2019s unpredictability could backfire\n\nTrump\u2019s relentless bullying of America\u2019s friends \u2013 while seemingly doing everything he can to advance its traditional adversary Russia in Ukraine \u2013 may also drain US power in the long run.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen this week is that the dollar has suffered a very sharp decline,\u201d Ruchir Sharma, founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, told Richard Quest on CNN International. \u201cIt\u2019s revealing that the rest of the world is getting its act together \u2026 and I think investors are beginning to notice there are other countries worth investing in, given all this policy volatility that is emerging in the US,\u201d he said.\n\nThe danger for the US therefore is that four more years of Trump\u2019s antics could reshape the globe \u2013 in a way that does not comply with his vision of US dominance but leaves Americans looking in from the outside. Mexico and Canada, for instance, can\u2019t change the geography that makes it a no-brainer to trade with the mighty US. But both also may see advantages in expanding trade and investment with America\u2019s rising rival China. And the European Union, which is expecting its own barrage of Trump tariffs soon, may examine similar horizons.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Western allies have too much invested in generations with ties with Washington to want it to fail. But they have their own national interests too. Canada can\u2019t win a trade war against its more powerful neighbor. But its patience is thin over Trump\u2019s brinkmanship and bullying.\n\nDoug Ford, the premier of Ontario, home to Canada\u2019s largest provincial economy, says the only way forward is for Trump to eradicate all tariffs rather than an a la carte easing of duties industry by industry, as with autos.\n\n\u201cAll this gives us is uncertainty again,\u201d Ford told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly on Wednesday. \u201cThere is one person that\u2019s causing that problem today: that\u2019s President Trump.\u201d"

It takes one agent to arrest the bad guy in the county jail. It takes a whole team to find somebody that doesn't want to be found in the neighborhoods, but we're going to keep doing this.\"\n\nThat effort is being boosted by Trump\u2019s GOP allies in Congress, who on Wednesday sought to highlight the dangers posed by sanctuary policies.\n\n\"Every crime committed by someone in the United States illegally is a crime that would not have been committed. Laken Riley, Ruby Garcia, Rachel Morin, Jocelyn Nungaray, the woman set on fire in the New York subway, these are all assaults, rapes, murders and other crimes that would not have taken the lives of these people if those people were not here illegally,\" Rep.

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nLiberals and government employees aren\u2019t the only people angry with Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s plunging share price means many investors are angry, too.\n\nShares of Tesla shot up 91% after election day, peaking just before Christmas, as investors anticipated Musk and his car company would be big winners as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s second term as president. Musk was Trump\u2019s largest financial supporter during the campaign, and has since become the highest-profile member of his administration, by far. In his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE), he has been trying to impose deep cuts in spending that had been previously approved by Congress, laying off thousands of federal workers.\n\nBut shares tumbled 5.6% in trading Thursday and are now down 45% from their December peak, giving up 96% of that post-election bump. Just since Trump took office and Musk began wielding power they have lost 38% of their overall value.\n\nThe drop in share price probably reflects the concern that Musk has been much a more visible \u2013 and polarizing \u2013 figure in the Trump administration than he was expected to be immediately after the election. Many investors likely figured Musk would be a more traditional \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d kind of adviser, not necessarily taking an active role in enacting controversial policies. Musk had enough other business interests, running companies ranging from Tesla to SpaceX to Neuralink to X, to keep him occupied.\n\nBut the drop in Tesla\u2019s value is also a sign of the headwinds the company is facing, in addition to increased competition from other automakers, especially those from China, who have made significant gains in their home market and in Europe as well.\n\nWhether it\u2019s one problem or a myriad of problems causing the slump, however, it is clear now that Tesla\u2019s sales woes are dragging the stock price down, too. And it\u2019s not clear what, if anything, could lift Tesla sales going forward.\n\nGlobal sales are \u2018imploding\u2019\n\nWhile electric vehicle sales in Europe shot up 34% overall in January, sales of Teslas plummeted 50%. Tesla\u2019s sales fell 29% in China, the company\u2019s second largest market after the United States, over the course of the first two months of the year, according to Reuters.\n\nAnd Tesla\u2019s US sales suffered a 16% drop in US sales between December and January, according to an estimate from Cox Automotive. It\u2019s difficult to directly attribute the drops to any one cause, however, as a drop in that period is typical for the company, which usually makes a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales.\n\nTesla cars at a charging station in Germany. Federico Gambarini/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\n\u201cGlobally his sales are imploding,\u201d said Gordon Johnson, an analyst who is mostly critical of Tesla and its shares. \u201cThe sales drop in China is about competition but in western nations, people are pissed at him. Whether that\u2019s driving down the sales in western countries, or it\u2019s competition doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s little he can do reverse it. And we know he\u2019s not going to have full self-driving. I think this could be the year the Tesla\u2019s shares finally collapse.\u201d\n\nEven even some bullish investors already think Musk is going to wildly miss the mark when it comes to Tesla\u2019s growth this year.\n\n\u201cI think investors are coming to a new expectation around what deliveries are going to look like for the year,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cThree or four months ago, Musk guided to 20% to 30% delivery growth in 2025. And then a month ago he didn\u2019t make any mention of the previous target, which analysts and investors correctly assumed that that meant that target is no longer on the table.\u201d\n\nA polarizing figure\n\nThe question is how much of the plunge is a reaction to Musk\u2019s political profile. Munster, who still considers himself a Tesla bull, said he believes about three-quarters is blowback.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the election, it was unclear how visible Musk would be (in the Trump administration),\u201d Munster said. \u201cSome believed the whole DOGE thing wouldn\u2019t get off the ground. At this point Tesla investors are seeing Musk as having more authority than Trump. There\u2019s some brand damage that comes from that.\u201d\n\nThere were protests outside Tesla stores throughout the country Saturday, with scattered reports of vandalized Teslas. One person was arrested in Loveland, Colorado and faces federal criminal charges after prior acts of vandalism against a Tesla store, and possession of \u201cincendiary devices.\u201d\n\nPeople participate in a \"TeslaTakedown\" protest against Elon Musk outside of a Tesla dealership in New York, March 1, 2025. Leonardo Munoz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps the biggest sign of shift in how badly people want to own a Telsa comes from S&P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data down into \u201cblue states,\u201d meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and \u201cred states,\u201d where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the loyalty rate, meaning the percentage of households that have bought more than one Tesla.\n\nIn the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% during the last three months of last year.\n\nThe drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about a percentage point of market share in those states, which includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest car markets, such as California.\n\nA poll last month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers \u201cwould not consider\u201d buying a Tesla. That\u2019s up from 27% in a Morning Consult survey a year ago, and only 17% when it asked the question in in February 2021.\n\nBy comparison, only 16% of potential buyers were almost certain or very likely to look at a Tesla before buying in the most recent survey, a figure that hasn\u2019t changed much over the last four years.\n\nThere\u2019s also been anecdotal backlash against Musk on social media, including videos of people booing Cybertrucks which then needed a police escort out during the Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, as well as people voicing approval for acts of vandalism against Teslas and accidents involving Tesla stores or vehicles.\n\nOther problems from Musk\u2019s DOGE role\n\nBeyond any concerns about liberals who might now avoid buying Teslas in reaction to Musk\u2019s politics, Munster said there\u2019s a concern that Musk is distracted from running Tesla, the company on which the majority of his fortune is based on.\n\n\u201cMusk really rewrote the book in terms of leaders\u2019 capacity to do different things. That used to be frowned upon,\u201d Munster said, referring to Musk\u2019s job not only as CEO of Tesla but also SpaceX, the primary owner of social media platform X, as well as the founder of artificial intelligence company xAI and Neuralink, which aims to implant computer chips into people\u2019s brain to control computers. \u201cI think there are natural limitations to what he can do. He has a lot going on.\u201d\n\nElon Musk leaves after meeting with Senate Republicans, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Ben Curtis/AP\n\nIn addition there could be growing concerns that as trade tensions rise between China and the United States that the Chinese could target Tesla for action because of his role in the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cBeijing grants favors and withholds favors,\u201d according to Isaac Stone Fish, the CEO of Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm. \u201cThey have many levers over Elon Musk and Tesla.\u201d\n\nTesla bulls still pleased with Trump alliance\n\nBut Tesla bulls say there is still an argument for how Musk\u2019s ties to the Trump administration could benefit the automaker, such as easier approval for its plans for self-driving \u201crobotaxis.\u201d\n\nWhile many Teslas now have a \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d feature that can handle some driving maneuvers, drivers are required to be behind the steering wheel ready to take control of the car. And there are still accidents involving FSD, prompting a number of investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nBut Musk has promised that by June he\u2019ll have vehicles ready to provide autonomous operations without drivers transporting passengers in a ride hailing service in Austin, Texas, Tesla\u2019s home base, although Uber and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo unit have already beaten Tesla with a driverless service in that city. And he expects that service to spread quickly and for a Cybercab vehicle to be on the roads by next year without steering wheels, brake or accelerator pedals.\n\nThose promises have bulls still excited about Tesla\u2019s prospects, no matter the current sales problems. They believe the current decline in share price is a buying opportunity for those who believe in that future.\n\n\u201cThe real unlock of Tesla value is on autonomy,\u201d said Munster. \u201cTrump loves Musk, and Musk is going to get some of the things he wants, and the big thing is more opportunity to prove the safety of robotaxis. I think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nOthers have severe doubts about that.\n\nJohnson, the Tesla bear analyst, says that Musk has been promising that truly autonomous vehicles have been just a year or so way for the last decade, and that any problems living up to his latest promises will cause a sharp drop in the stock price, as will the first quarter sales figures due out in early April.\n\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu contributed to this report\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story understated the gain in Tesla shares after the election through a December peak. The story has been updated to reflect the correct gain and the decline since that peak through Thursday\u2019s close."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump walks from Marine One with Col. Angela Ochoa, commander of the 89th Airlift Wing, to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025. Trump was traveling to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. Photo: Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn filmmaker Paul Verhoeven\u2019s adaptation of Starship Troopers, military service guarantees citizenship in a futuristic \u2014 and fascist \u2014 regime. The policy is simple: Join the war on the alien bugs or suffer a second-class life. Verhoeven\u2019s satire worked in part because it echoed real-world politics. Although the American government is a mite less radical than the fanatical world government of Verhoeven\u2019s film, our politicians have long promised a form of enhanced citizenship to those who fight. The military welfare state supports active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, and once a person separates, they\u2019re eligible for benefits that aren\u2019t available to anyone else. They can receive affordable health care through the VA or go to college on the GI Bill or apply for a reasonable home loan. If they\u2019re able to work, they might look to the federal government, which offers preferential hiring to veterans.\n\nVeterans\u2019 benefits once seemed like the third rail of American politics, but perhaps no longer. As Elon Musk and his DOGE goons slash away at federal jobs, they\u2019ve laid off thousands of veterans with few repercussions to date. Alina Habba, Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney and a White House adviser, told reporters on Tuesday that the veterans they\u2019ve fired might not be \u201cfit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd we can\u2019t, you know, I wouldn\u2019t take money from you and pay somebody and say, \u2018Sorry, you know, they\u2019re not going to come to work.\u2019 It\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d A day later, the Associated Press reported that the VA plans to fire about 80,000 workers, a clear threat to veterans\u2019 care. The news hit home: My husband, a Marine veteran, relies on the VA for his health care.\n\nTrump\u2019s patriotism has always been bluster, a way to mobilize his base without much of a material commitment to veterans or servicemembers. That\u2019s not so unusual for an American politician, even if most are not as blunt as Trump\u2019s adviser, Habba. Anyone can campaign on so-called veterans\u2019 issues; it\u2019s much more difficult to reckon with the human cost of our bloody foreign policies. In the absence of moral accountability, the American government offers its youth a fragile bargain instead: Kill the bugs, and we\u2019ll take care of you later.\n\nBut there\u2019s no way to trust a promise that recognizes the humanity of some while denying it to others. What we do on the battlefield and in prisons like Guant\u00e1namo Bay reflects the domestic values and priorities of the American government. We have always reserved humane treatment for a select few while we force everyone else to struggle for scraps, though we insist the system is based on merit. Dignity is a luxury, meted out on the basis of race and gender and disability status. In such a country, the benefits we offer veterans rest on a shaky foundation. If health care and housing and education are unique privileges, not universal rights, the government can easily go back on its word. Veterans are only special as long as they\u2019re convenient.\n\nIn betraying veterans now, the Trump administration merely hastens the inevitable. It has been popular to think of veterans as an exception to centuries of rhetoric and policy that cast people in need as takers and moochers; the uniform has, in theory, distinguished those who bore it from those who belong to a parasitical class. We see now that the uniform never meant all that much and that what\u2019s given can be taken away in a flash. But policy does not exist in a void. In this case it depends on a Praetorian culture that achieved new strength in the post-9/11 era. We honor the troops with parades and flags and discounts at Applebee\u2019s, as if no form of citizenship is entirely separate from consumer identity. Members of both parties brandish the uniform to win office and curry favor not just with veterans themselves but with moderate and conservative voters who say they respect the military.\n\nBy definition, American Praetorianism singles out military service for special treatment, almost sanctification. That can be powerful, but for whom? Although millions of people have achieved middle class stability thanks to the military welfare state and veterans\u2019 benefits, their rise always depended on the whims of the government. An administration that is poised to damage Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid is an administration that can strip veterans of everything we said they had earned. Habba\u2019s comments are remarkable because she is telling us the truth about the order of things. Veterans remain subject to political forces that prioritize profit margins over human life and dignity. With each week that passes, it becomes harder to deny that Elon Musk\u2019s billions carry more weight than the uniform ever could. It is similarly no coincidence that the administration is purging veterans from the federal workforce while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks of lethality and warfighting. This is a cruel ideology, which treats humanity as a trait it can bestow or rescind. No one is safe, not even the troops."

            "full_content": "Shortly after the video of George Floyd\u2019s death went viral in May 2020, a popular conservative pundit released an online video in which he decried Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for kneeling on Floyd for \u201cfour straight minutes,\u201d even though Floyd, bystanders and even other police officers told Chauvin that Floyd couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nThis pundit pointed to video of the incident to dismiss the argument that Floyd was resisting arrest. It\u2019s \u201creally ugly and really bad,\u201d he said, adding that Chauvin should be prosecuted \u201cto the fullest extent of the law\u201d and should \u201cgo to jail\u201d and that \u201ceveryone should be on the same side of this.\u201d Several days later, the same pundit wrote in his syndicated column that Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of Chauvin and other Minneapolis police officers should inspire Americans to \u201crally\u201d against such \u201cobvious evil.\u201d\n\nThat pundit was the Daily Wire\u2019s Ben Shapiro. This week, Shapiro called on Donald Trump to pardon Chauvin on the federal charges he faced for causing Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nEven as he condemned Chauvin\u2019s brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters.\n\nAs you might have guessed, I\u2019ve left out some important context to Shapiro\u2019s 2020 condemnation of Chauvin\u2019s brutality. The problem is that the context doesn\u2019t help \u2014 it makes it all a lot worse. Even as he condemned Chauvin\u2019s brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters for claiming that what Chauvin did was commonplace or racially motivated. He chastised critics who argued that police brutality is systemic. George Floyd\u2019s killer would be prosecuted, Shapiro promised, and that would prove the system works.\n\nShapiro seemed particularly offended at the very idea that other police officers or conservatives like him would defend Chauvin. Everyone condemned Chauvin\u2019s actions, he assured us \u2014 from him to police groups around the country to President Donald Trump. The mere fact that so many people on the right had condemned a white cop for killing a Black man was, he argued, in and of itself proof that systemic racism is a myth.\n\nWhat a difference five years makes. Now Shapiro claims that Chauvin\u2019s trial was a farce and that his \u201cconviction represents the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics. The country cannot turn the page on that dark, divisive, and racist era without righting this terrible wrong.\u201d Other conservative commentators and politicians have also come to Chauvin\u2019s defense, but Shapiro\u2019s plea achieved particular significance after it was amplified by Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s unofficial co-president and his largest campaign donor.\n\nThat conservative pundits like Shapiro now defend Chauvin isn\u2019t surprising. It follows a familiar pattern after high-profile incidents of police brutality spark large protests. Those protests are rarely only about the precipitating incident itself. They tend to happen in places with long-established police abuse and racism. And as the 2023 Justice Department report documented, there was plenty of both at the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nThe campaign to retroactively exonerate Chauvin and reverse the progress made by George Floyd protests began with a video produced and co-written by a former TV host who is married to the former head of the Minneapolis police union. It was then distributed by a far-right advocacy group that poses as a news organization. Among other risible claims, the documentary accuses the FBI of pressuring Minneapolis officials to manufacture evidence to implicate Chauvin. You know the FBI. Always looking for reasons to smear cops.\n\nNevertheless, the documentary slowly gained purchase in online right-wing culture, first with MAGA influencers on social media, then with far-right personalities like Megan Kelly and Tucker Carlson and finally with more mainstream, \u201cheterodox\u201d and right-of-center podcasts and publications.\n\nAs with most lies perpetuated by the far right, the truth is there for those who want it. In a long three-part series, I documented in detail how its producers duped gullible pundits and columnists into amplifying claims that were false, misleading or wholly made-up. But as is also the case with far-right mythology, the true believers aren\u2019t interested in reality. They want validation. So the \u201cdocumentary\u201d is now MAGA canon.\n\nShapiro\u2019s demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It\u2019s purely symbolic.\n\nThe video depicting George Floyd\u2019s murder hasn\u2019t changed in five years. It\u2019s as harrowing as ever. Bystanders, other police officers and Floyd himself plead with Chauvin. They tell him Floyd isn\u2019t breathing. They cry out to Chauvin that Floyd doesn\u2019t have a pulse. Chauvin callously ignores them. And George Floyd dies.\n\nWhat has changed is the right\u2019s posture toward racism and political violence. The gutter politics of people like Laura Loomer, Marjorie Taylor-Greene and Nick Fuentes is now part of the Republican Party\u2019s core. People who were too racist for the first Trump administration have been rehired or promoted in the second. It\u2019s now acceptable to tell vicious lies about immigrant groups like the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, to Venezuelans in Aurora, Colorado. Pizzagate propagator Jack Posobiec now advises Trump Cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and accompanies them on official trips. The sitting vice president wrote the foreword to Posobiec\u2019s book \u2014 a book in which, right in the title, Posobiec declares his political enemies to be \u201cunhuman.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has always valorized political violence. He has spent the last decade dehumanizing immigrants, defending police brutality, celebrating the violent suppression of dissent and boasting about the bikers, soldiers and cops waiting to spill blood on his behalf should he ever need them (as they already have).\n\nThe political right has now fully embraced that ethos. When Kyle Rittenhouse lugged his guns into a volatile protest zone and killed two people, those deaths were treated not as tragic but as legally justified. They were celebrated. A year after Daniel Perry was convicted of murdering a Black Lives Matter protester, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pardoned him at the urging of right-wing voices like Tucker Carlson. And when, in one of Trump\u2019s first acts after his inauguration, he granted clemency to the Jan. 6 rioters, including those who violently attacked Capitol Police officers, those on the right praised the pardons and commutations.\n\nShapiro himself acknowledges that Trump can pardon Chauvin only on the federal charges of violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights. The more serious charges came in state court, where Trump has no clemency power.\n\nThis means Shapiro\u2019s demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It\u2019s purely symbolic: Shapiro wants validation for his argument that Chauvin was wrongly convicted. He wants the president to refute the notion that Shapiro himself advanced in 2020: that Chauvin\u2019s treatment of George Floyd was \u201creally ugly and really bad\u201d and \u201cobviously evil.\u201d\n\nWhen we contrast the two Ben Shapiros, five years apart, the right\u2019s grim trajectory over that time comes into focus. The 2020 Ben Shapiro argued that the right\u2019s near-universal condemnation of Chauvin was proof that his side takes police brutality seriously, that its support for the prosecution of a white cop for killing an unarmed Black man was proof that it isn\u2019t racist and that Chauvin\u2019s inevitable prosecution was proof of its belief that the criminal justice system is fair and just. The 2025 Ben Shapiro \u2014 along with much of the right \u2014 now says that Chauvin\u2019s killing of Floyd was justified, that his prosecution should never have happened and that his conviction was political and vindictive.\n\nHowever flawed his arguments, the 2020 Ben Shapiro was at least eager to defend the right from claims that it is racist, oblivious to injustice or eager to embrace violence. The 2025 Ben Shapiro seems hell-bent on proving him wrong."

            "full_content": "Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nLast week, the White House invited a handful of giddy conservative influencers to \u201cpolicy briefings\u201d with top administration officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel. The influencers, who included OANN anchor and Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, Rogan O\u2019Handley (a.k.a. DC Draino), and Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, happily walked away with binders adorned with the Justice Department seal and branded \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase 1.\u201d\n\nIt turns out there wasn\u2019t any new grist in them for the conspiracy-theory mill. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting for juicy stuff, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s in this binder at all,\u201d podcaster Liz Wheeler wrote on X. \u201cWhat we were looking for was hidden from us.\u201d Still, the Roosevelt Room gathering was indicative of the Trump administration\u2019s evolving relationship with the press. \u201cThese folks have larger followings than most mainstream-media \u2018reporters,\u2019\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X. \u201cThe media landscape has changed, and we are fully embracing it here at the Trump White House!\u201d\n\nThe influencer briefing came in the midst of one of the most tumultuous periods in recent memory for the Washington press corps, which is not only coping with a nonstop news cycle but battling a White House that has blocked mainstream outlets like the Associated Press from events and, for the first time in a century, said it would determine which news outlets are part of the press pool, long the purview of the independent White House Correspondents\u2019 Association. And while Trump has always made life difficult for journalists, this time they find themselves divided, squabbling, and unsure whether they even want to present a united front. Said Peter Baker, the New York Times reporter who has been covering the White House for three decades, \u201cIt\u2019s as volatile a moment for the White House press corps as I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe troubles began on February 11, when the White House blocked the Associated Press from an event in the Oval Office; on February 14, the White House made the ban official, saying the AP would be barred from entering the Oval Office and traveling on Air Force One over the news outlet\u2019s decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico for the body of water Trump had recently renamed the Gulf of America. Other news outlets signaled their support for the AP, with dozens, from CNN to the Washington Post to Fox News, signing a letter urging the White House to reverse its decision. But notably, they continued to show up to press events even as their colleagues at the AP could not. After all, they still had a job to do.\n\nA few days later, the AP sued Trump officials over the ban, a move that greatly pissed off the White House because it had let an AP photographer (but not a reporter) into an event earlier that week as an olive branch. A few days after that, the White House announced it would also determine the participants in the daily presidential press pool, the small group of reporters allowed to observe the president\u2019s actions and record his remarks in small spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, then communicate their reporting to the rest of the corps. The makeup of the pool \u2014 a rotating cast of print and/or online reporters, TV cameramen, and photographers \u2014 has long been decided by the WHCA, which represents hundreds of correspondents, in part to ensure that friendly outlets are not the only ones to get access to the president. The move was intended to allow \u201cnew media\u201d outlets \u201cto share in this awesome responsibility,\u201d said Leavitt, who introduced a \u201cnew media\u201d seat in the briefing room during her first presser that so far has been occupied by various journalists, including Axios\u2019 Mike Allen, Breitbart\u2019s Matt Boyle, and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski.\n\nThe two actions by the White House made it clear that if journalists do anything Trump doesn\u2019t like, they could be kicked out. The implications for the fate of the free press were also clear. \u201cThere will be a chilling effect. People will be much more careful about what questions they shout,\u201d one political reporter said. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a big deal because they don\u2019t understand how Washington works, and they think we\u2019re privileged anyways. And White House reporters are annoying, but it matters who is, on a day-to-day basis, around Trump to ask questions that the administration hasn\u2019t screened or planted.\u201d Especially, they noted, because Trump, unlike many other politicians, will actually give you an answer: \u201cHis advisers will spin you or ignore your calls, but he\u2019ll just say it.\u201d\n\nYet even while reporters agree the White House is way out of line, they don\u2019t agree on how to respond. Initially, WHCA president Eugene Daniels said the association would no longer be facilitating the pool now that it is under White House control and that it would be up to each news organization to decide whether it wanted to participate. Daniels explained that, with the White House controlling the process, the WHCA couldn\u2019t ensure the veracity of the pool reports.\n\nThat decision frustrated some reporters, who felt the WHCA was just picking up its ball and going home. What was the association for \u2014 other than the big fundraising party it throws in April \u2014 if not for a moment like this? \u201cI don\u2019t think the solution is to have the White House control complete access, but the WHCA has shit the bed on this,\u201d one White House reporter said. \u201cWe got an email from Eugene basically being like, \u2018You\u2019re on your own, here\u2019s the questions you should ask the White House,\u2019 and a lot of reporters were like, \u2018You\u2019re the one who is supposed to be asking these questions.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the same time, many also recognize that the association was in a difficult spot, torn between asserting its independence and keeping some semblance of control over the pool. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tough moment, and there are no easy answers for the WHCA and its leaders,\u201d another White House reporter said, while acknowledging that \u201ca lot of us wanted a more vocal, robust response to meet the moment.\u201d Daniels personally is a vulnerable target for right-wing figures in and around the White House as an openly gay Black correspondent for Politico (and soon MSNBC) who was seen as the Kamala Harris whisperer during her presidential run \u2014 the embodiment, in other words, of a woke press corps the White House is keen to push around.\n\nThis week, Daniels seemed to revise his initial guidance and announced a new system would be put in place. Basically, the pool reports will resume (though they won\u2019t be called pool reports) as long as the White House continues to use poolers who are part of the WHCA. But it remains to be seen what the WHCA will do if the White House picks, say, Posobiec to write the pool report. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the WH intends to operate, but on the day that they select someone who is not a part of our rotations, we will need to lean on another constituency such as radio, wires, or TV to assist getting that information out,\u201d Daniels wrote.\n\nSo far, the White House has largely kept things running as it did under the WHCA. But it has added some more friendly faces: right-wing broadcaster Brian Glenn, who dates Marjorie Taylor Greene, was picked to be in the Oval Office during Trump\u2019s disastrous meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Glenn asked the Ukrainian president why he wasn\u2019t wearing a suit. And the other day, the administration kicked a HuffPost reporter out of the pool. The White House then asked The Wall Street Journal if it wanted to take HuffPost\u2019s spot and it said no; later, the White House called Axios, which jumped at the opportunity. \u201cIt really just feels like they\u2019re trying to pit organizations against each other and make people pick sides, and they know that,\u201d one White House reporter said.\n\nThese are among the calculations news outlets are being forced to make internally: Do they take another outlet\u2019s spot if the White House offers it? What happens if they are the ones who get kicked out? Conversations ultimately come back to the bigger question for the press with this administration: How far will they go to preserve their independence? \u201cThat is our larger debate \u2014 do we continue to participate in this pool or not?\u201d said Baker, noting that in doing so, they\u2019re \u201cseemingly giving credibility to a government-run press pool, which is an anathema to us.\u201d He added, however, \u201cIf you back out, it means the only questions being asked of the president end up being of the \u2018Why are you so great?\u2019 variety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the line, and who do you trust? You can be a conservative or liberal organization and still be a trustworthy pooler and journalist,\u201d Baker said. But increasingly, he noted, \u201cyou\u2019re seeing basically inherently political organizations masquerading as news organizations, calling themselves news organizations, and injecting themselves into our pool. And for the viewer at home watching this, it\u2019s confusing. They don\u2019t know the difference between Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s boyfriend and the Washington Post.\u201d Earlier this week, Jessica Reed Kraus, one of the influencers invited to the \u201cEpstein Files\u201d briefing, celebrated her \u201cofficial induction into the White House press pool\u201d as she joined CBS and Bloomberg to observe Melania Trump at the Capitol.\n\nLike members of other groups, journalists are facing a problem of collective action. \u201cIf not all of us do it collectively, does it have an impact? The truth is, getting all the White House reporters to agree is like herding cats,\u201d said Baker. \u201cWe\u2019re competitive; each has our own interests, our own judgments.\u201d And a boycott would just give the White House what it wants.\n\nFor now, reporters appear to be keeping their heads down and hoping the situation won\u2019t get worse. \u201cWe still have access,\u201d one White House reporter said. \u201cIf it turns to a point where the White House is saying CNN can\u2019t come in because they didn\u2019t like what it said, that\u2019s an issue, and the problem is it could turn into that. I don\u2019t know if it has.\u201d After thinking about it for a moment, the reporter added, \u201cWith the exception, obviously, of the AP.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The popular musical Hamilton will be canceling its show at the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center following the Trump administration\u2019s shakeup of the current staff.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last month, President Trump was made chairman of the center following the firing of President Deborah Rutter. In turn, Trump aide and former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell was named interim president while Trump replaced outgoing chair David Rubenstein. As a result of the shakeup, several stars, including superstar soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming, announced they would be cutting ties with the Kennedy Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve treasured the bipartisan support for this institution as a beacon of America at our best,\u201d Fleming said in a statement at the time. \u201cI hope the Kennedy Center continues to flourish and serve the passionate and diverse audience in our nation\u2019s capital and across the country.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, a proponent of left-wing causes, and lead producer Jeffrey Seller said in a joint interview with the New York Times that they believe the Trump administration has moved the Kennedy Center away from its bipartisan routes. The musical had been scheduled to take part in the Kennedy Center\u2019s celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\u201cThis latest action by Trump means it\u2019s not the Kennedy Center as we knew it,\u201d Lin-Manuel Miranda said. \u201cThe Kennedy Center was not created in this spirit, and we\u2019re not going to be a part of it while it is the Trump Kennedy Center. We\u2019re just not going to be part of it.\u201d\n\nSeller added that the creative team behind Hamilton felt that Trump \u201ctook away our national arts center for all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt became untenable for us to participate in an organization that had become so deeply politicized,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kennedy Center is for all of us, and it pains me deeply that they took it over and changed that. They said it\u2019s not for all of us. It\u2019s just for Donald Trump and his crowd. So we made a decision we can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that the Hamilton show on Broadway previously engaged in divisive politics by having its cast members lecture former Vice President Mike Pence when he attended in 2016 after he and Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College.\n\n\u201cWe, sir \u2014 we \u2014 are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\u201d actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who played Aaron Burr, said from the stage at the time. \u201cWe truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf all of us.\u201d\n\nIn response to the cancelation, interim Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell accused Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jeffrey Seller of engaging in a \u201cpublicity stunt that will backfire,\u201d adding that they simply \u201ccan\u2019t be in the same room with Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear on the facts. Seller and [Lin-Manuel] first went to the New York Times before they came to the Kennedy Center with their announcement that they can\u2019t be in the same room with Republicans. This is a publicity stunt that will backfire. The Arts are for everyone \u2013 not just for the people who Lin likes and agrees with. The American people need to know that [Miranda] is intolerant of people who don\u2019t agree with him politically. It\u2019s clear he and Sellers don\u2019t want Republicans going to their shows. Americans see you, Lin,\u201d said Grenell.\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. \u201cBetter than Killers of the Flower Moon,\u201d wrote Mark Judge. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen a story like this before,\u201d wrote Christian Toto.

            "full_content": "A federal appeals court Wednesday said President Donald Trump can fire a top government watchdog in the latest round of a legal fight over the authority to dismiss federal officials.\n\nThe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., put on hold on a lower court\u2019s ruling that found Hampton Dellinger\u2019s termination at the Office of Special Counsel was \u201cunlawful.\u201d The court said it would expedite its review of the ruling, but in the meantime Dellinger can be removed from his post.\n\nThe White House and Dellinger did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.\n\nThe ruling is a temporary win for Trump as his administration seeks to carry out mass firings of federal workers, including nearly two dozen government watchdog officials.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nDellinger, who was special counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, filed a lawsuit against several Trump administration officials last month challenging his dismissal. He argued it violated a federal law that says the president can remove special counsels only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d\n\nThe email outlining his termination did not cite any of the those as the reason for his firing, Dellinger said in his lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThat email made no attempt to comply with the Special Counsel\u2019s for-cause removal protection,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cIt stated simply: \u2018On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately.\u2019\u201d\n\nDellinger began his post in March 2024 after he was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term.\n\nHampton Dellinger, special counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. U.S. Office of Special Counsel via Reuters\n\nAs head of the Office of Special Counsel, Dellinger was tasked with shielding federal employees from prohibited personnel practices, including retaliation for whistleblowing. His office\u2019s work was unrelated to the investigations into Trump led by Jack Smith, whom then-Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed as a special counsel in 2022.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson halted Trump's effort to remove Dellinger and ordered that he be allowed to serve until the end of his term barring inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. She had allowed Dellinger to remain in his post while the case moved through the courts.\n\nJackson appeared to agree with Dellinger's argument that allowing his termination without cause would have a chilling effect among federal workers seeking to lodge complaints through the Office of Special Counsel.\n\n\u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\u201d Jackson wrote in her ruling Saturday. \u201cIt would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department had petitioned the Supreme Court to affirm what it called Trump's right to fire Dellinger, arguing that anything less would infringe on the president's power to manage the executive branch \"in the earliest days of his Administration.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nChaos within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has come to light in a recent court filing showing emails and documents from employees inside the agency amid efforts to dismantle it, illustrating a team scrambling to make do with recent firings and confusion on what work is allowed to be completed.\n\nEmployees were left puzzled following instructions from Russell Vought, the acting director of CFPB, last month explicitly ordering them to stop working altogether and saying that \u201cany urgent matters\u201d would require approval in writing from the bureau\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\nThose instructions kickstarted a flurry of uncertainty and hesitancy behind the scenes that has picked up this week. Mark Paoletta, CFPB chief legal officer, said in an email on Sunday that it had come to his attention that some employees had not been performing statutorily required work.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: Employees should be performing work that is required by law and do not need to seek prior approval to do so,\u201d Paoletta wrote, according to the court filing.\n\nCFPB\u2019s mission is to protect consumers from financial abuses and to serve as the central independent agency for consumer financial protection authorities. President Donald Trump fired the previous director of the CFPB, Rohit Chopra, last month before the agency\u2019s work had been halted. The effort to gut the agency was made apparent with an Elon Musk tweet last month that read: \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d with a tombstone emoji.\n\nAn ensuing court battle has produced the filing with revealing internal emails showing how the agency isn\u2019t meeting its obligations. A federal judge has put in place an order that blocks the agency from making any substantial changes, especially to its data, personnel and funding reserves, but even that is a challenge to comply with, the agency emails reveal.\n\nIn further emails, Cassandra Huggins, CFPB\u2019s principal deputy assistant director of supervision policy and operations, addressed there being \u201cquite a bit of confusion surrounding the message,\u201d while offering her own take on Paoletta\u2019s Sunday email.\n\n\u201cWe have requested and received clarification that their message was not intended to authorize the reinstatement of supervision/examination activity, even though the Bureau is required by law to carry out these activities,\u201d Huggins sent in an email.\n\nHuggins wrote that it was communicated to her that \u201csupervision staff should continue to operate on administrative leave as directed by the Acting Director unless you have received express permission to work on a task.\u201d\n\nHer email contradicted Paoletta\u2019s email request for employees to complete work required by law, leading to more confusion from staff.\n\nIn one instance, John Schroeder, regional director of the Midwest region, apologized for the mixed messaging. \u201cI apologize for the continued confusion being caused by multiple misleading and inconsistent email,\u201d he wrote in an email to staff on Monday.\n\nSince Vought took over as acting director last month, several changes have taken place at the agency, including Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency being granted administrative access to CFPB systems, the agency terminating contracts with multiple expert witnesses it had hired in cases against companies accused of hurting consumers and DOGE deleting the watchdog\u2019s X account.\n\nCNN has reached out to CFPB and DOGE for comment.\n\nA flurry of challenges\n\nThe recent filing showcases the problems CFPB employees have endured as the Trump administration has attempted to wind the agency down, including the inability to do certain basic tasks because of the number of employees that have been fired.\n\nJason Brown, an assistant research director, highlighted in a Monday email \u201ca few challenges\u201d they were facing while resuming their work, including a loss of personnel from firings that \u201cimpacts our ability to complete assignments as planned\u201d and a loss of research tools, such as their qualitative researcher contract and lab contracts.\n\nBrown also highlighted a loss of data, as several of their contracts were cancelled and questions surrounded the location of some data, as well as a loss of IT resources.\n\n\u201cSeveral contracts that have supported our work have been cancelled. We have seen some impairment in our ability to do our work, and in some cases we can\u2019t tell if the struggles we\u2019re facing are because of cancelled contracts or glitches, and the people who would ordinarily help us out have themselves been terminated,\u201d he wrote in the email.\n\nOne employee requested to fix the CFPB homepage, which had been showing a \u201c404: Page not found\u201d error. The CFPB employee claimed the error message had been showing since February 7.\n\n\u201cI believe this negatively impacts our statutorily mandated reporting requirements (eg for research) and subverts the statutorily mandated initiatives developed for consumer education and engagement,\u201d the employee wrote.\n\nChief Information Officer Christopher Chilbert acknowledged the issue wasn\u2019t authorized to be restored at the time, saying in an email response, \u201cI believe it is important to restore the homepage as soon as possible, but that is not currently authorized.\u201d\n\nIn another instance, Chilbert claimed the agency would \u201close all historical data on our Google Analytics platform if we don\u2019t pay the bill.\u201d This was typically done with a government card, but new restrictions had been placed on using it.\n\nAsked what needed to be done to pay the bill, Chief Financial Officer Jafnar Gueye said using the card would require an approved exception and sent a list of questions to justify the purchase.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report."
