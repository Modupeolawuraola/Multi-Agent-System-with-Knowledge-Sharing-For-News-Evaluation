I was gonna go to Boston and bring hell with me,\u201d Homan responded.\n\n\u201cI meant it. I said it,\u201d he continued, noting that everyone should agree with that statement because he made it \u201cright after I talked about nine child sex predators that ICE took off the streets of Massachusetts in a short timeframe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo when I say I\u2019m coming to Boston, bringing hell with me, yeah, I\u2019m bringing hell to illegal aliens that raped children,\u201d Homan said. \u201cSo I stand by what I said, I meant what I said, and I\u2019m gonna do it.\u201d\n\nThe mayor, he continued, has \u201cobviously lost her mind\u201d and \u201cshould agree, there\u2019s no sanctuary for child rapists.\u201d\n\nHe asked why a child rapist should be released, noting they were not able to contact the child rapist for almost two years and that their detainer was ignored.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find this guy. How many little kids did he sexually assault in those two years they released him? So you\u2019re damn right. I\u2019m upset,\u201d Homan said.\n\n\u201cSomeone who sexually assaulted a child is the worst of the worst of the worst. So yeah, I\u2019m going to Boston. I\u2019m bringing hell with me,\u201d Homan said, adding that it is not just Boston, either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing hell to every illegal alien who commits a serious offense in this country, especially those who attack our most innocent, our children,\u201d Homan added.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nWhen asked why Democrat mayors are so against these common sense positions, Homan said they put politics before reason.\n\n\u201cEvery elected mayor, every elected governor, every elected city council person, what\u2019s your number one job? What\u2019s your number one responsibility? Protection of their communities. So why would you not help us remove public safety threats to neighborhoods?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s your number one moral responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, but I just think they\u2019ve lost their mind, I think politics over public safety is politics over common sense. I can\u2019t think of any other reason,\u201d he added.\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern."

            "full_content": "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a number of new initiatives to bolster defence in a speech in Warsaw, as European powers appear set to comply with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands that the continent pay for its own protection rather than relying on America.\n\nSpeaking before the Sjem parliament, Prime Minister Tusk declared Friday: \u201cHope is no substitute for strategy. Hope is a beautiful feeling, but in politics, it is often adjacent to naivety or illusion\u2026 Today, Europe is beginning to understand that since the United States expects much greater outlays, determination and courage from us, it must be met.\u201d\n\nDespite already being one of the top spenders in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on NATO defence at around 4 per cent, Poland should increase its spending to at least five per cent of GDP, Tusk said, according to the Gazeta Wyborcza.\n\nThis goal puts Poland in line with Estonia and Lithuania as the first countries in Europe to agree to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for NATO allies to increase their defence spending to at least five per cent of GDP compared to the current baseline of two per cent, which is still unmet by many within the alliance.\n\nAdditionally, Prime Minister Tusk called for Poland to build an army of at least half a million people, including reservists, up from around 200,000 today. To help accomplish this aim, the Polish leader called for the return of military training for all adult men in the country.\n\nTusk denied that this would represent a form of universal military service, saying that it would function more like the Swiss reservist model, in which every man is required to either serve in the military or join another civil service.\n\nFinally, the prime minister also said that Warsaw may consider withdrawing from international treaties such as the Ottawa Treaty and Dublin Convention, which prohibit the use of land mines and cluster bombs.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a profound correction of American geopolitics. We cannot be offended by reality. Every country, especially a power such as the United States, has the right and obligation to shape its foreign policy and strategy,\u201d Tusk told the Polish parliament.\n\n\u201cPoland is not changing its opinion on maintaining the closest possible bond with the United States and the North Atlantic Pact, and at the same time we need to know what is happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis correction primarily concerns the [US]\u2019s change of attitude towards the two warring parties in Ukraine. To Ukraine and Russia. It is not our job to review for the sake of satisfaction and rhetoric the policies of our greatest ally. Our task is to draw conclusions for our safety from these moves and from this change.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of Poland doubling down on its defence comes amid a broader movement across Europe to increase military spending following the re-election of President Donald Trump in the United States.\n\nTrump has long been critical of European nations, preeminent economic powers such as Germany, failing to meet their minimum NATO spending requirements while funding lavish welfare programmes and sending money to Moscow for natural gas.\n\nWhile German politicians previously mocked Trump for warning against overreliance on Russian energy, his warnings were later vindicated following the invasion of Ukraine, after which the Kremlin took retaliatory action against EU sanctions by cutting off natural gas flows to Germany.\n\nBerlin also appears set to invest heavily in its own defence. The likely next coalition government agreed earlier this week to change rules on debt spending to fund a trillion euro ($1.08 trillion) investment in German defence and infrastructure. The European Union is also preparing measures to help member states finance fresh defence spending."

            "full_content": "Big business! Photo: AFP via Getty Images\n\nCryptocurrency investors spent the week waiting for the high-profile \u201csummit\u201d between President Donald Trump and the top suits in decentralized finance. The meeting was supposed to provide some clarity on how the administration would make America more crypto-friendly \u2014 rather than just another proclamation from the new president that everything in token world would be made great again in his second term.\n\nInstead, Trump began yesterday\u2019s meeting, formally known as the White House Digital Assets Summit, by bringing out a soccer trophy.\n\nDoes the WH Crypto Summit get any more unserious?\n\n\n\nAfter disappointing the crypto bros with a nothingburger EO on Bitcoin yesterday, he opens up the Crypto Summit with Gianni Infantino, the President of FIFA, showing off a new trophy.\n\n\n\nOther than FIFA is one of the few\u2026 pic.twitter.com/cOMtWjPbPr \u2014 Novacula Occami (@OccamiCrypto) March 7, 2025\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump had hosted the soccer association\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, to create a task force to organize the 2026 World Cup hosted around the unhappy throuple of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. So he must have felt inspired to bring the soccer guy to the crypto guy conference. Infantino then pitched the crypto billionaires in the room on a coin for FIFA to \u201cconquer the 5 billion soccer fans in the world.\u201d The crowd, with crypto CEOs ranging from Michael Saylor to the Winklevii, did not seem interested in the investment opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt could be quite a coin actually,\u201d Trump said, in one of his few ad-libs of the afternoon. The president is clearly not comfortable riffing on the importance of cryptocurrency beyond just providing value to some of the richest donors to his inaugural fund. Instead, he preferred to stick to the script, telling the multi-millionaire and billionaire men around him that they\u2019ve been \u201cworking very hard and very successfully\u201d and describing how his bitcoin strategic reserve announced last night would become a \u201cvirtual Fort Knox for digital gold.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the summit was devoted to thanking Trump for his interest in cryptocurrency and for putting the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s many crypto investigations on pause.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be more proud of you,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\n\u201cAs a crypto founder, I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be part of your administration,\u201d said Small Business Administration administrator Kelly Loeffler. \u201cYou\u2019re moving at the speed of tech for sure,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cGod bless you for doing this,\u201d said House majority whip Tom Emmer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because of your love of innovators,\u201d said White House crypto adviser David Sacks, who added that the crypto industry was the victim of \u201clawfare\u201d under Biden, just as Trump was. Sacks then kicked a question to one of the Winklevoss twins (Sacks forgot which one) who told him that a year ago he thought he\u2019d \u201cbe more likely to end up in jail than in the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d get attacked the way we did,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss. He was referring to he and his brother\u2019s crypto exchange Gemini, which was charged by the SEC for the sale of unregistered securities under Biden. Now freer to operate with far less regulatory oversight, the Winklevii seemed happy to be there and happy with the summit: \u201cThe U.S. won the internet and the U.S. should win crypto.\u201d\n\nWhat do you notice first about the folks at Donald Trump's first White House Crypto Summit? pic.twitter.com/fkzwQ0aOQX \u2014 Art Candee \ud83c\udf7f\ud83e\udd64 (@ArtCandee) March 7, 2025\n\nWith all this gladhanding, one would expect that the price of major cryptocurrencies would be way up. But bitcoin is down about 4% over the last day. (This is mostly because Trump\u2019s announcement of a bitcoin strategic reserve did not include an order for the government to buy any new coins, only to hold onto the crypto assets that the feds have already seized). While attendees left happy, in terms of actual movement it was another bust in Trump\u2019s strange week toying with crypto. After about 20 minutes, reporters were kicked out of the room and the investors at hand began the work on Trump\u2019s next symbolic announcement that will surely be the one to change cryptocurrency forever."

            "full_content": "Jessica Tisch with senior officials at the 11 p.m. roll call of the 103rd Precinct in Queens. Photo: Natalie Keyssar for New York Magazine\n\nEarly every morning, Jessica Tisch starts getting a series of emails she says she \u201clives or dies\u201d by. They detail for the police commissioner how many murders and rapes, robberies and felony assaults, were recorded over the past day \u2014 how many shooters, how many guns, how many victims, and where it all took place. The slashing on the F train, the Wingstop robbed on Edson Avenue, the elderly man from Williamsburg gone missing, the body found floating near Pier 1 in Brooklyn Heights. In the reports are the running tallies of protests around the city, the street encampments cleared, the unlicensed scooters seized, the cops who were recently disciplined. These are the figures and facts by which she and the more than 50,000 employees of the world\u2019s largest police department will be judged. And if that were all the role entailed, it would be the sort of big-as-the-city challenge she has always chased.\n\nBut doing it all under Eric Adams as his administration cracks beneath scandal has made her whole job particularly complicated. One morning a few weeks ago, his lawyers filed a motion to have his federal bribery indictment tossed; those same lawyers had promised the Justice Department that Adams would use his \u201cpolitical muscle\u201d to make Tisch\u2019s department comply with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda once the case is dismissed. Minutes later, she went to midtown to announce new recruiting initiatives to replace the thousands of cops who left under the previous three police chiefs, two of whom are under federal investigation. It\u2019s diabolically difficult to balance her duties to the NYPD with a need to keep close to the mayor. He shares her views on public safety but also considers the NYPD his \u201cbaby\u201d and himself its \u201coverbearing dad.\u201d\n\nTisch does not need any of these headaches. Her extended family is worth billions. She earned three degrees from Harvard. She has already proved her ability to run big organizations, winning positions at three of the city\u2019s agencies \u2014 information technology, sanitation, and police \u2014 all by age 43. Still, she has pursued these jobs with the sort of fervor that can drive some of her less intense co-workers crazy; one former colleague spoke of 2 a.m. emails that would be followed by another at 4 a.m. if Tisch hadn\u2019t received a reply. During a previous stint at the NYPD, she helped deploy the citywide expansion of the department\u2019s surveillance and data networks and was responsible for introducing the body cameras cops now wear and the specialized phones they carry. If you got a COVID-vaccination appointment at the height of the pandemic, that was thanks to the system the city\u2019s chief information officer built with her team. And if you\u2019ve noticed that mountains of trash bags are now only foothills, you\u2019re seeing her handiwork, too. Largely from behind the scenes, she has been at the center of many of the city\u2019s most important moments over the past two decades, amassing influence and emerging as one of this town\u2019s most consequential figures. Perhaps it\u2019s a bit of false modesty, but even the ultra-ambitious Tisch expresses a bit of surprise at this. \u201cWhen I started at the police department, I didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be here too long,\u201d she tells me when I visit her on the 14th floor of One Police Plaza, the NYPD\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIf back in the day you told me I was going to be the CIO of the city, I would never believe you. Or Sanitation commissioner \u2014 never. And police commissioner \u2014 also never. Like, all of these things were highly improbable to me.\u201d\n\nMayoral candidate Brad Lander on the left is publicly courting her to stay on if Adams leaves, as is the New York Post on the right, which has even been trying to draft her to run for mayor, putting her on the front page over and over. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s mayoral campaign isn\u2019t ruling out another term for her at the NYPD. (Members of the two families have been allies for more than a decade.) \u201cI think she has the ability to be the first female mayor in New York City,\u201d says Bill Bratton, her mentor and a former police commissioner. But after spending time with her and talking to dozens of her friends, colleagues, and adversaries, it\u2019s a little hard for me to see. She can sometimes be awkward in crowds, even crowds of cops, and doesn\u2019t have a politician\u2019s hunger to be on-camera. When I press her about the chatter, her expression goes from uncomfortable to deeply uncomfortable. \u201cI am the police commissioner. I have no ambition to run for office,\u201d she says. I point out that\u2019s not a definitive \u201cno.\u201d And it certainly doesn\u2019t rule out a future run. She just repeats the same two sentences in reverse.\n\nWhat\u2019s undeniable is that Tisch, candidate or not, has been dragged into the city\u2019s politics. At a time when so many of New York\u2019s wannabe leaders seem to be corrupt, lacking substantial experience, only kinda-sorta concerned with public safety, or some combination of all three, Tisch has become a figure for people looking to be led again by a Bloomberg-style technocrat. In a speech in late January, she lashed out at district attorneys who let repeat criminals back on the streets, promised to expand the city\u2019s surveillance systems, and pledged to tackle \u201caggressive panhandling, unruly street vending, public urination\u201d with the rigor once reserved for violent felonies. The quality-of-life push is data-driven, but in this case, it\u2019s about vibes as much as numbers. New York, as measured by major-crime statistics, may be one of the safest major cities in the country, she tells me, \u201cbut without that sense of order in the streets, in the neighborhoods, people don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\n\nClockwise from top left: With Georgina and Emma Bloomberg at the Young Lions Party at the New York Public Library in 2010; in front of a snow plow as Sanitation commissioner in 2023; working as NYPD information-technology deputy in Brooklyn in 2015.

They wore matching blue blazers, and she had a Magen David on her neck. More than a dozen relatives, buddies from Harvard, a group of moms from her kids\u2019 Manhattan prep school, and the mayor were all standing for her. She was about to be sworn in as New York\u2019s 48th police commissioner.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d she said, recalling her first day at the NYPD in 2008: She was a counterterrorism analyst, fresh out of Harvard with a joint law and business degree. \u201cI was in a dark conference room. Well, actually, conference room is quite generous. It was really an oversize closet with a giant refrigerator,\u201d she said, laughing. It was the candidate-processing unit of the personnel bureau. \u201cThe name says it all. I really felt like I was being processed. Streams of outrageously repetitive paperwork, so many rules.\u201d\n\nMany ambitious, civic-minded Ivy League lawyers were joining the NYPD then, in the middle of the \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d They knew it might be different, but this was \u201ca bit like Mars,\u201d recalls Rebecca Weiner, the current intel chief, who came straight from Harvard too. The paramilitary, outer-borough energy of the department was running particularly high when Ray Kelly, a former Marine and beat cop, was in charge.\n\nTisch adapted much more quickly than most. That first day, she began a lifelong professional partnership with another civilian analyst, Ryan Merola; he\u2019s now her chief of staff. She also started bonding with some of the uniformed officers \u2014 the tendency for cops to be the children of cops appealed to someone who came from a tight-knit family. She loved their sense of mission. The rules became a comfort (some of them, anyway). The power to make things happen in a hurry in a top-down organization was thrilling in its own way. \u201cRay Kelly definitely taught me the value of command and control,\u201d Tisch tells me.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Tisch, 27, was tasked with figuring out what to do with more than $100 million in unspent grant money from the federal Department of Homeland Security, which had just built a surveillance network to prevent another terror attack downtown. What if, she asked, the Domain Awareness System went citywide? And what if, instead of trying to stop a suicide bomber, the system tried to spot all kinds of crooks? What if it included the NYPD\u2019s trove of arrest reports and criminal histories? When Tisch sent the privacy guidelines for the system to the lawyers at the New York Civil Liberties Union, they retched. \u201cShe was devastated,\u201d says one colleague from that time. The bosses had the opposite reaction: \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019ve made it. Congratulations,\u2019\u201d the former colleague recalls them saying. Civil libertarians continue to view it \u2014 and her \u2014 with suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s really alarming to see a commissioner who built her career on the infrastructure of mass surveillance,\u201d says Albert Fox Cahn of the NYU Information Law Institute.\n\nIn 2014, when Kelly was replaced by his old rival Bratton, who preferred a team-sport approach to management, Tisch figured she would be fired any day and boxed up her office. Instead, she was given a promotion. She became the NYPD\u2019s first-ever deputy commissioner for information technology, responsible for putting access to the Domain Awareness System into the hands of cops with phones, some of whom still relied on radios and typewriters. Tisch initially contracted to get 36,000 Windows-based smartphones from AT&T, but two years later, Microsoft discontinued its mobile operating system. The Post beat up on Tisch for allegedly wasting $160 million. (AT&T changed out the devices for iPhones for free, so no money was wasted.) It stung. Tisch was (and is) a daily Post reader. \u201cYou believe everything else there,\u201d one former colleague teased her. \u201cBut when the Post is wrong about you, it\u2019s a one-off.\u201d\n\nEight years later, Tisch is still annoyed by the negative coverage. It implies she was sloppy with the small stuff, when she\u2019s absolutely obsessive about it. \u201cShe cared about details down to where the buttons were located \u2014 even the colors of the icons,\u201d says a former colleague who worked on the phone project. He meant it as a compliment. Others differ. \u201cThe most difficult person I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d says another former colleague. A third, who says \u201cit was a good day\u201d if he didn\u2019t cross her path, admitted Tisch was effective. \u201cShe was a positive force, and I had every reason to think that she wasn\u2019t,\u201d this person says. \u201cThe department was better off for her, for her time there.\u201d\n\nBy the time she finished at the NYPD in December 2019, she had learned up close from Bratton and Kelly what it takes to do the job of police commissioner. \u201cNo schooling could ever compare to the opportunity to learn directly from these extraordinary men,\u201d she would later say.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio put her in charge of her own agency and named her the city\u2019s chief information officer \u2014 a promotion, for sure, but one that might have seemed a little sleepier than the previous gig. Until COVID hit. Then the entire city government went virtual. Procuring nearly 100,000 iPads in a single week for public-school kids shifting to remote learning. Helping put together a contact-tracing system for hundreds of thousands of people in less than six weeks. Taking over and replacing the city\u2019s online portal for vaccine shots after the initial one crapped out. Suddenly, the police job was the one that looked easygoing.\n\nAt one point, de Blasio asked what she wanted to do next. Tisch had an answer ready that confused everyone. Munib Islam, a close friend and Upper East Side neighbor, tells me, \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone. My dream job is to be sanitation chief.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe name Tisch was not previously associated with trash collection. At New York University alone, there\u2019s a school for the arts, a center of hospitality, and an entire hospital all named for various Tisches. Then there are the galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the children\u2019s section of the Central Park Zoo, the 92nd Street Y \u2014 you get the idea. Forbes estimates the family\u2019s net worth at north of $10 billion, a financial empire that started with hotels and has grown to include natural-gas pipelines, pharmaceutical packaging, insurance, entertainment, and the New York Giants.\n\nShe grew up on the Upper East Side, went to the Dalton School and then Harvard (with Jared Kushner and Natalie Portman, both of whom remain friends), and eventually returned to the neighborhood, paying $8 million for a duplex there. But Tisch is unusual for women \u201cin our setting,\u201d says her friend Islam. For example, he adds, she has a full-time job; many others don\u2019t. When she goes to see the Rangers with her sons, they get normie seats, not a luxury skybox. When her family and Islam\u2019s went out to eat, he jokes, \u201cthey\u2019d offer a kids\u2019 menu for the two young ones and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Also get a third one for Jessica.\u2019 Her eating habits are like a 10-year-old\u2019s\u201d \u2014 more chicken strips, less omakase. At her wedding to hedge-funder Daniel Levine, she had one request: a Carvel ice-cream cake, just like every middle-class New Yorker had for a fifth-grade birthday. Her mom ordered 500 custom-made individual Fudgie the Whales, one for every guest.\n\nShe and her family are close, but it\u2019s her mother\u2019s side \u2014 which included a rabbi and a Jewish community-center principal from the immigrant, working-class heimische era of the Lower East Side \u2014 where Jessica had her strongest bond. She was her maternal grandmother Sylvia Hiat\u2019s favorite and vice versa. \u201cI think perhaps a lot of my strength comes from having someone who was just so unconditionally focused on me,\u201d she says. When she decided to go into policing, Sylvia was the most supportive. When Jessica later became Sanitation commissioner, responsible for cleaning up the city after a snowstorm, Sylvia \u201cwould wake up every morning, four in the morning \u2014 she was in her 90s at this point \u2014 and pray to Hashem that it wouldn\u2019t snow. Every day, 365 days a year, even in the summer,\u201d Tisch says.\n\nSylvia\u2019s daughter Merryl married James Tisch in 1975 (her sister married his brother). Over time, Merryl became a player in New York\u2019s political, philanthropic, and policy circles. During Cuomo\u2019s time as governor, she was named chancellor of the Board of Regents, the state\u2019s top education position, then chair of the board of the State University of New York. She became known for her work ethic and her enthusiastic deployment of money and power. \u201cWhen my refrigerator is broken, I don\u2019t call the service department,\u201d she was once quoted as saying. \u201cI call the head of G.E.\u201d The mother and daughter still talk all the time, and Merryl is, shall we say, generous with her opinions on \u201ceverything from trash policy, hairstyle, criminal-justice reform,\u201d Tisch says. \u201cShe has a lot of feedback.\u201d\n\nTisch\u2019s mother told the Times that while she loved being a Tisch, she also made sure to cultivate \u201cthe Merryl part of my name.\u201d Multiple people who know the Tisches well say this is a key to the clan\u2019s dynamics. The family name may come from the men. The men may make the money. (Jessica\u2019s younger brothers, Ben and Sam, are in the family business and in finance, respectively.) But the women \u2014 her aunt Laurie, a former Whitney Museum board chair; Sylvia; and Merryl \u2014 have the power to make an impact on civic life. And they have a notion, according to one relative, that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get anything unless you ask for it. But also, you have standing to ask for it.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m not surprised when a former colleague tells me Tisch \u201csaid to me once that one of her biggest personal regrets is that she didn\u2019t take her husband\u2019s name. She\u2019s like, \u2018It would have saved me a lot of drama if I was just Jessica Levine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople ask me why I\u2019m so \u2018driven,\u2019\u201d Tisch says, making air quotes with her fingers. \u201cMy mother is definitely my role model.\u201d Merryl was on her left side when she was sworn in as police commissioner. Her hand was on her grandmother\u2019s Bible.\n\nYou could see this as the culmination of a long family arc \u2014 or another sign of the alliance between the city\u2019s privileged and its police. Jessica\u2019s uncle Andrew served as chairman of the New York City Police Foundation, which funds all sorts of initiatives for the NYPD, and she used a foundation event in January to outline her vision for the force. Some of her predecessors got themselves into trouble by using the foundation for their own purposes. It did pay for an early pilot test of the body cameras Tisch would later deploy, but \u201cevery time Bratton or somebody wanted to do a foundation-related project, I remember her being like, \u2018Can someone else do this? Because I don\u2019t want to do this, given family,\u2019\u201d one colleague tells me. \u201cShe likes to keep up the wall.\u201d\n\nThat seems typical of how Tisch operates: Her single run-in with the city\u2019s conflict-of-interest board in almost 17 years came when she helped pay off a onetime colleague\u2019s student loan; she was fined $2,000. When she was running Sanitation, she and her staff had to work at Times Square through New Year\u2019s Eve to clean up after the open-air party. Business groups would rent out locations like the Hard Rock Cafe, and Sanitation executives would get invited. Tisch told them not to go \u2014 it would violate the gift ban. A former colleague recalls, \u201cNone of us had ever even thought about it.\u201d\n\nHer directive is a little ironic in retrospect. Tisch\u2019s boss is not exactly famous for turning down perks.\n\nAdams and Tisch didn\u2019t know each other well before he became mayor. She spoke to a number of candidates during the election, including his rival Andrew Yang, but she soon saw in the former police captain a \u201ckindred spirit\u201d who shared a back-the-blue worldview and a disdain of the activist left. He gave Tisch her dream job: responsibility for the cleanup of 45 million pounds of garbage every day.\n\nHow was this, of all things, her dream? Was it really her dream? I admit I was skeptical. Tisch, I\u2019ve come to learn, is someone who gets a kick out of making order out of messes \u2014 she completes puzzles for fun. And she likes to measure her successes; she still gets a daily email from Sanitation about the number of rat sightings in the city. (It\u2019s about 2,500 this year, down 25 percent from this time in 2024.)\n\nTisch introduced to Sanitation a bunch of changes: specialized trucks that allowed composting to go citywide, surveillance cameras to catch illegal dumping. Perhaps more important was a shift in attitude. Case in point: An obscure interagency memo resulted in a number of city-owned properties not being cleaned. For 37 years. \u201cOne day, she was like, \u2018Well, how many of these spots are there?\u2019\u201d a high-level Sanitation Department employee says. They counted more than 1,700. \u201cAnd then she was like, \u2018And what would it cost to clean?\u2019 We did the math. We came up with $14 million a year. She went to the mayor and made the case, and we\u2019ve been cleaning them ever since.\u201d\n\nAnd all the while, there was that unrelenting Tisch approach. Kenneth Corey, then the NYPD\u2019s top uniformed officer, remembers getting a call at 8 a.m. one Sunday. \u201cHey, I just sent pictures to your email about this encampment on 14th Street,\u201d Corey remembers her telling him. \u201cHow quickly can you get some people, with my people, to go out and clean this up?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdams was loving all of this. He had been elected to restore a sense of law and order to the city after COVID, and Tisch\u2019s so-called trash revolution became a rare win. \u201cJessica Tisch has risen to every challenge our administration has set before her, proving time and again her commitment to being a part of the team,\u201d he tells me in a statement. She admired him, too. \u201cHe had an 8 a.m. call every morning with a bunch of commissioners and a bunch of deputy mayors,\u201d Tisch tells me. \u201cAnd I would hear him talk about sanitation stuff or policing stuff, and I was like, Oh my God, I can complete this guy\u2019s sentences. This is incredible.\u201d\n\nAt the same time as he set up Tisch at Sanitation, Adams named the highly regarded Keechant Sewell the NYPD\u2019s first female commissioner \u2014 then quickly undercut her. He gave his ex-cop buddies jobs in the administration with authority over the department. Take Tim Pearson, a former detective who put associates in key positions throughout One Police Plaza, naming one head of internal affairs and installing another as Sewell\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cThere were all these ways that people could circumvent the chain of command,\u201d Corey tells me. Corey was replaced with another longtime friend of Adams, Jeff Maddrey, whom Sewell had tried to discipline when Maddrey dropped the case against a gun-waving ex-cop who had menaced a group of children. Adams stepped in to protect him.\n\nSewell quit in June 2023, and Tisch put out the word \u2014 quietly \u2014 that she was interested in the job, according to one former colleague, so Adams didn\u2019t feel boxed in. She thought it was a long shot because even if she was deeply immersed in cop culture, she still wasn\u2019t a cop. \u201cShe would kind of whisper, \u2018I\u2019d love to be police chief, but it\u2019ll never happen,\u2019\u201d Islam says.\n\nEdward Caban, who had joined senior leadership just a year earlier, became commissioner. Kaz Daughtry, Maddrey\u2019s former driver, was promoted six levels to assistant commissioner despite 51 misconduct allegations having been filed against him. John Chell \u2014 who a civil jury found had intentionally shot a man in the back, killing him \u2014 was named chief of patrol. With the mayor\u2019s blessing, they pushed the image of a chest-pounding, deeply political NYPD. Daughtry was sued after a viral video appeared to show him slamming a protester\u2019s head to the ground. Chell savaged reporters, left-wing politicians, and even a judge on social media. Together, they championed an aggressive vehicle-pursuit policy that resulted in the deaths of 13 people. Police morale, already in the toilet, dropped into the sewer. Retirements and resignations remained nearly double from the pre-pandemic levels. Hundreds of officers were transferred without paperwork to desk jobs or to pad out the chiefs\u2019 entourages. Meanwhile, more cops were pulling extra shifts, and overtime spiked to $1.1 billion. Lawsuits piled up against the top brass, too. In April 2024, a reform advocate who worked closely with the police sued Maddrey, Chell, and Daughtry for organizing a smear campaign \u2014 by leaking details of her rape.\n\nIf any of this changed Tisch\u2019s mind about the mayor, she and her circle kept those opinions to themselves. In their view, Adams had always done right by them. And if lots of people around the mayor were getting sued or investigated or both, they reasoned, that wasn\u2019t exactly uncommon in City Hall. Adams \u201csupported me when I wanted to ask every New Yorker to change the way they do something three to five times a week, taking out the trash,\u201d Tisch says. That\u2019s something \u201cno other mayor in 50 years would take on.\u201d\n\nBut by September, the scandal and dysfunction were impossible to ignore. Things hit a comically awful nadir on Labor Day when a gunman killed one person and shot four more at the West Indian Day Parade \u2014 Adams cheered \u201chats off\u201d to the NYPD for the people who didn\u2019t get shot. A little more than three weeks later, the mayor was indicted. (Damian Williams, another Harvard classmate of Tisch\u2019s, filed the charges.) Caban resigned after federal investigators seized his phone as part of an investigation into him and his brother over an alleged protection racket involving the police and nightclub enforcement. His interim successor was promptly raided by the Feds in another matter, and Pearson was also pushed aside. By this point, the administration had been decimated by scandal.\n\nIt was then that Tisch started angling a little less quietly for the commissioner\u2019s chair. She talked to some of the deputy mayors and finally to Adams himself. Given all the allegations of City Hall\u2019s meddling in One Police Plaza\u2019s business, you might expect Adams offered the job with caveats. Or that Tisch took the gig only with promises she would be given independence. Yet some people in her orbit swear there were no terms and conditions from either of them. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t do well with people giving him ultimatums,\u201d says a source close to the administration. \u201c\u2018Come in and save my ass\u2019 doesn\u2019t work because there\u2019s no way to guarantee it saves his ass. And if it\u2019s a \u2018Come in and leave my friends alone,\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nMaybe that sounds like na\u00efvet\u00e9, believing in a guy who has trouble answering honestly whether he\u2019s vegan or not. But in Tisch\u2019s case, trust had been built up over time in her relationship with the mayor and, more important, in herself. \u201cShe has that unbridled faith in her ability to do these things and manage it and get the principal\u201d \u2014 Adams \u2014 \u201cto where the principal needs to go,\u201d Merola says. \u201cShe damn well knows she can accomplish things most can\u2019t.\u201d For a few weeks, there was silence from City Hall. Then Tisch got the word: Her whispered hope was coming true. Now she just had to hope the mayor would actually let go.\n\nLess than three weeks later, she found herself leading a manhunt that had become a global fixation. An unidentified person had assassinated a health-insurance executive in midtown. Five days into the investigation, in a conference room on the 14th floor of One Police Plaza, the department\u2019s chiefs were briefing Tisch on what they had so far on the guy. They had pulled DNA from what they thought were the suspected shooter\u2019s Kind bar and water bottle, but there were no matches. The surveillance-camera network Tisch had helped build wasn\u2019t of much use. Detectives had to go building by building collecting footage, which produced only a handful of partial photos of the shooter, none of them complete enough for a successful facial-recognition match. Adams might have promised over the weekend that the \u201cnet is tightening,\u201d but it was bullshit. Despondent, Tisch slumped in her high-backed leather chair at the head of the table. Kenny, the chief of detectives, started mapping out the next steps in the investigation as the trail cooled. \u201cOh, that sounds like it could take a long time,\u201d she told him, and Kenny agreed. \u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is we could get this guy six months from now.\u201d\n\nSince receiving a text about the shooting while making breakfast for her kids, Tisch had authorized the department to throw everything at finding the shooter: drones, canines, scuba divers, hundreds of detectives and beat cops. She restrained herself from micromanaging the investigation, even though she was dying to call Kenny every 15 minutes for an update. The only break she took was to bring detectives corned beef and pastrami from her grandmother\u2019s favorite, the 2nd Ave Deli.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, she took ten analysts from the NYPD\u2019s intelligence division to help with the case. They scoured social-media profiles of hundreds of young men who both looked like the shooter and had posted about their rage at the health-insurance industry. Tisch debated with Weiner whether potential matches were hot enough to be the guy in the surveillance footage. \u201cI looked at so many photos of people with brown hair, the same complexion. I\u2019d be like, \u2018No, that jawline is not chiseled enough. Those eyebrows are not wild enough,\u2019\u201d Tisch tells me.\n\nShe found herself staring at the possibility of a catastrophic setback \u2014 for the department and for her personally. The killer was already emerging as a folk hero. Who knows how long she would have the job if he wasn\u2019t caught. \u201cI was anxious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m always anxious.\u201d Kenny tried to reassure the room that the global interest in the case could well result in the right person at the right time seeing the photo. Once that happened, Kenny said, the whole thing could be done in as little as five minutes.\n\nFive minutes passed. A call came in to the 14th floor. Someone in Altoona, Pennsylvania, had seen the photo. Tisch started pelting Kenny with questions: \u201cChief, is this right? Do they have him? And who the heck is he?\u201d Then she asked what all the New Yorkers in the room were thinking: \u201cWhere the hell is Altoona?\u201d Tisch hugged everyone when confirmation came back that they had the suspect. Then she told Daughtry to book it to Pennsylvania \u2014 the NYPD had to beat the Feds. She owed it to her detectives, and she knew that was what the mayor would want.\n\nWhen pictures of the alleged shooter, Luigi Mangione, started coming out, he was even better looking than his surveillance shots had suggested. \u201cOh God, this is gonna be a problem,\u201d Tisch said, according to a police colleague. His online fan base was already massive, much to her disgust, and she wanted to bring him back to New York quietly to avoid publicity. But City Hall apparently craved that attention. You\u2019ve seen the pictures: in the foreground, Mangione in an orange jumpsuit; trailing him, a crowd of cops in riot gear \u2014 and Adams.\n\nNotably absent from the photo op was Tisch. Six weeks later, I\u2019m in that conference room and I ask her why. She looks at me like I\u2019ve grown a second head. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to be at a perp walk,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a police commissioner.\u201d Then I press her on what Adams was doing there. It\u2019s the only time in our conversation she can\u2019t quite stay perfectly attached to her boss. \u201cI\u2019m sure he had his own reasons for it. I don\u2019t, don\u2019t \u2014 you can ask him.\u201d\n\nTwo days after Mangione\u2019s arrest, an aide to Maddrey told the Post that the $204,000 in overtime she made was actually a payoff for enduring the senior cop\u2019s sexual abuse. Tisch hadn\u2019t planned on a wholesale housecleaning at headquarters, at least not right away; to her, integrity issues were important but not the most urgent. Then Maddrey forced her hand. She was \u201cbeyond pissed\u201d when she found out, according to one police colleague, and less than three hours later, Maddrey was gone. The next day, she sacked the head of internal affairs, another Pearson ally. The department advocate, in charge of the discipline system, was changed out. Days after that, internal-affairs officers joined the FBI in raiding Maddrey\u2019s home. Adams called the allegations \u201ctroubling,\u201d but according to people in Tisch\u2019s orbit, this time he made no attempt to protect his old friend. Tisch gave Adams a heads-up before major moves, and the unspoken agreement between them held.\n\nThe cleanup is incomplete by design. Tisch gave two of Adams\u2019s people another shot. Chell was promoted to Maddrey\u2019s job, and Daughtry, a self-described student of the \u201cUniversity of Maddrey,\u201d stayed on as deputy commissioner for operations. They appeared to be loyal to Tisch, and they hustled. \u201cYou know who else got promoted seven ranks in two years?\u201d she asks, pointing her thumbs at herself. \u201cPeople rise to meet challenges. That guy\u2019s a crime fighter. So is John Chell,\u201d she adds, citing declining felony statistics.\n\nAnd while Chell toned down his broadsides against progressive judges and district attorneys, Tisch ramped up hers, accusing the authors of Cuomo-era reform bills of turning New York\u2019s criminal-justice system into \u201ca revolving door where there are no consequences\u201d for \u201crepeated violent crime. It is out of all control \u2014 and something has to give.\u201d\n\nThe changes at the top have given senior leaders I spoke with a renewed sense of purpose and energy. How much of that has trickled down to the average cop? I asked around and got a lot of eye rolls: Police commissioners come and go; getting more officers through the door, and more money for the cops who are here, matters more than whoever\u2019s at the top.\n\nWith Mayor Adams at the Luigi Mangione press conference in lower Manhattan in December. Photo: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTisch is trying to undo some of the worst parts of the Adams administration\u2019s legacy at the NYPD, such as the deadly vehicle-pursuit policy, without getting on the wrong side of Adams himself. She\u2019s trying to keep the department out of his machinations with the Trump administration without showing him up and without bringing the cops into direct conflict with the Feds. Meanwhile, she\u2019s got an agenda to push for however long she\u2019s in the commissioner\u2019s chair.\n\nAt the top of her list is doubling down on data-driven policing and surveillance. The city\u2019s camera network showed its limits during the Mangione case; Tisch wants to expand it to include more privately owned cameras so the next manhunt won\u2019t be so labor intensive. Alerts from the ShotSpotter gunshot-detection system may result in confirmed shootings only less than 15 percent of the time, according to the comptroller\u2019s office, but Tisch extended ShotSpotter\u2019s contract, arguing that something is better than nothing. She\u2019s looking to use the data that\u2019s now collected in the Domain Awareness System and measured by CompStat to surge police resources down to a single block. Perhaps the biggest change is that she wants to use those same systems and processes to fight \u201cchaos,\u201d not just crime. Major felonies may be down, especially under Tisch, but complaints about crime reached a ten-year high last year. There\u2019s still a widespread sense of unease, a feeling that the next jump scare is just out of frame. Combating that could be seen as deeply necessary \u2014 and as opening the door to something dystopian: Giuliani-style crackdowns, only with better gear.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many questions about how all that technology is used. These are systems, originally designed for counterterrorism, that Tisch helped expand to general policing. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine their being repurposed again to target immigrants.\n\nThe NYPD already shares information with any number of federal agencies \u2014 and functionally has zero control over what happens next. Tisch says, carefully, that \u201cour policy is very clear that we will not participate in civil immigration enforcement.\u201d As in, the police won\u2019t arrest you if your visa runs out. Of course, the NYPD will work with Homeland Security on criminal cases, but state law forbids anything more. Cops technically aren\u2019t supposed to cooperate on workplace immigration raids or let U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement into schools without a warrant. \u201cWe have policies and procedures in place for this,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is nothing new to this department.\u201d\n\nIt was a by-the-book answer from someone who operates by the book, reassuring in its certainty \u2014 as long as the laws are respected and the entire justice system isn\u2019t suddenly turned upside down. Days after we spoke, the mayor made a joint appearance with \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan on Fox & Friends, floating (and then quickly walking back) the idea of breaking local law to help with Trump\u2019s deportation agenda. Homan promised he would be in the mayor\u2019s office and \u201cup his butt\u201d if Adams didn\u2019t deliver.\n\nTisch didn\u2019t meet with Homan when he was here, and less than four hours after Fox & Friends hit, the NYPD\u2019s official account tweeted that the department will not participate in civil immigration enforcement, \u201cperiod.\u201d Some informed observers saw this as Tisch drawing a line against mayoral pressure \u2014 and as another shrewd political move by someone who seemed to be making a lot of them recently. Others took it as a subtle indicator that Adams was doing Tisch (and his beloved department) a solid, routing the most uncomfortable elements of the ICE relationship through City Hall under Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker and thereby keeping the NYPD out of it. \u201cChauncey is handling all of that,\u201d one police colleague tells me the day after a meeting between Parker, Adams, and Homan.\n\nLess than 72 hours later, Parker and three other deputy mayors announced they would be resigning. Parker was replaced by Daughtry, one of Adams\u2019s most eager, most willing prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n\nThroughout the past few tumultuous weeks, Tisch and Adams have kept up their normal conversations about the department as if there weren\u2019t a shitstorm raining down. \u201cI talk to him often, not as much as I talk to my mother,\u201d she says. The NYPD has been doing its best to show Washington that it cares about catching immigrants accused of felonies. The department added a couple dozen people to the various federal-local task forces. It was being as cooperative as it could on criminal matters, but when ICE calls and says it\u2019s doing a purely immigration-related raid or when new DHS boss Kristi Noem pulls some migrant-bashing publicity stunt, \u201cwe stay the fuck away,\u201d a source close to the Adams administration says of the NYPD. The question is how long they can keep it up.\n\nTisch has spent her entire career putting her faith in the chain of command. What happens now, when the person up the chain is compromised? Throughout her career, she has followed the rules, stuck to the letter of the law. \u201cHer opinion about the law is clear, right? If the law changes, that\u2019s a question for another day,\u201d says a former colleague. She became a star in local government for solving seemingly intractable problems. What if her solutions are reprogrammed for cruelty? What happens when the rules are rewritten? We\u2019re in the Trump years. Norms and traditions and common sense and legal niceties keep getting smashed against the wall."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe dean of Georgetown University Law Center on Thursday rebuked a threat from the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, that he would not hire the law school\u2019s students if it does not remove diversity, equity and inclusion from its curriculum.\n\nDean William Treanor accused Ed Martin, a Trump ally, of trying to interfere with the curriculum of the law school, which is private and therefore not regulated by the federal government.\n\n\u201cYour letter informs me that your office will deny our students and graduates government employment opportunities until you, as Interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, approve of our curriculum,\u201d Treanor wrote to Martin in a letter dated Thursday. \u201cGiven the First Amendment\u2019s protection of a university\u2019s freedom to determine its own curriculum and how to deliver it, the constitutional violation behind this threat is clear, as is the attack on the University\u2019s mission as a Jesuit and Catholic institution.\u201d\n\nMartin, in a letter emailed to the dean on Monday, said he had been notified that the law school \u201ccontinues to promote and teach DEI,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d he said, warning Treanor that Georgetown law students will not be selected for an internship, fellowship or employment at the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Washington until his \u201cletter of inquiry\u201d is sorted out.\n\nMartin\u2019s letter comes as the Trump administration has moved to curb DEI practices. In one of President Donald Trump\u2019s first moves after returning to office, the White House ordered federal employees in any DEI and accessibility offices to be placed on paid administrative leave. Federal agencies were then directed to terminate the offices themselves.\n\nD3FEHX Georgetown University Law Center building - Washington, DC USA B Christopher/ Alamy Stock Photo/File\n\nCNN has reached out to Martin\u2019s office for comment on Treanor\u2019s response.\n\nTreanor added in the letter Friday that the university \u201cwas founded on the principle that serious and sustained discourse among people of different faiths, cultures, and beliefs promotes intellectual, ethical, and spiritual understanding.\n\n\u201cFor us at Georgetown, this principle is a moral and educational imperative,\u201d the dean continued.\n\nMartin, a right-wing activist and staunch Trump ally, has used his office to aggressively push Trump\u2019s retribution agenda. Within hours of becoming interim US attorney for DC on Inauguration Day, Martin swiftly used his powers to dismiss pending January 6-related cases. He then fired prosecutors who were involved, and launched an internal review to hunt for possible misconduct. Last week, Martin demoted at least eight senior federal prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases.\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Evan Perez, Jamie Gangel, Casey Gannon and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report."
