            "full_content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Distilleries in the heart of America's bourbon industry are finding themselves in the crosshairs of a brewing trade war between the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAlcohol made in the U.S. is being removed from store shelves in Canada in retaliation for tariffs placed on its products by the Trump administration.\n\nU.S.-made liquor has been removed from store shelves throughout Canada. Graham Hughes / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIt's also leading to canceled shipment orders and stalled liquor agreements with potential trading partners, some Kentucky bourbon businesses say.\n\nThe family-owned Michter\u2019s Distillery in Louisville has already lost $115,000 in canceled bourbon shipment orders to Canada, its largest foreign market as liquor stores in most Canadian provinces have been asked to remove products from their shelves.\n\nAndrea Wilson, chief operating officer at Michter\u2019s Distillery in Louisville, Ky. Kailani Koenig / NBC News\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reality of it,\u201d said Andrea Wilson, chief operating officer of Michter\u2019s. \u201cWe would prefer to see less tariffs than more.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico \u2014 two of the country\u2019s largest trade partners \u2014 before postponing it amid trepidation of a broader trade war.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump amplified his tough tariff talk, saying he would double the tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum imported from Canada.\n\nThe threat came one day after Ontario\u2019s premier, the leader of Canada\u2019s most populous province, announced it would charge 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million Americans.\n\nKentucky\u2019s bourbon industry pours about $9 billion into the local economy annually, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association.\n\nMichter\u2019s bourbon barrels. Kailani Koenig / NBC News\n\nThe state produces about 95% of the bourbon sold in the world, the association estimates.\n\nWhile data on the tariffs\u2019 effects is unavailable, U.S. consumers likely won't see a price increase on bourbon for at least a few months, said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR.\n\nBut Kentucky distilleries could feel an immediate pinch if some of their shipments to Canada are being cancelled, he said.\n\nWilson said she fears her business could face further losses if the tariff war continues.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not selling to our largest export market, that\u2019s a significant impact to our business, and it\u2019s very sad for us, because we have friends, we\u2019ve built relationships in that country for a long time,\u201d she said.\n\nBlack-owned Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville is having its own set of problems caused by the tariff war.\n\nVictor Yarbrough, CEO of Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville. Kailani Koenig / NBC News\n\nThe company was in the midst of negotiating to sell its products in Canada for the first time, but discussions abruptly ended when the trade war started.\n\nThe deal fell through \u201cas soon as the tariffs were announced,\u201d CEO Victor Yarbrough said.\n\n\u201cLiterally, we\u2019re in the middle of expansion. Everything\u2019s been suspended, they don\u2019t have the ability to purchase,\u201d Yarbrough said, adding his plans for 2025 were to also ship alcohol to France and the United Kingdom.\n\nNow he\u2019s considering sending his products to South Africa or Brazil, but Canada would have been the bigger market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just like, how can we help get back to square one? How can we facilitate good, neighborly, you know, relationships that we\u2019ve been having?\u201d he asked.\n\nFawn Weaver, founder of Black-owned Tennessee whiskey brand Uncle Nearest, had her alcohol products pulled off the shelves in Canada, but said she was already bracing for the fallout.\n\nWeaver, who contends a tariff war could be predicted during the presidential campaign, said the tariffs mean her business can\u2019t be as aggressive in the global market for now.\n\n\u201cAs an independent brand, I can\u2019t afford those tariffs. I can\u2019t afford to absorb it, and I can\u2019t pass it on to the consumers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be argued that this is exactly what the current administration wants \u2014 for all of us to bring in our business in the U.S.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe already knew coming into this, Trump was very clear in what he was going to do, even though we didn\u2019t know where the tariffs would hit.\u201d\n\nKailani Koenig and Maggie Vespa reported from Louisville, Deon J. Hampton from Denver and Bracey Harris from Mississippi."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we dive into the next steps on Capitol Hill after the House passed a short-term funding bill with a government funding deadline fast approaching. Plus, Steve Kornacki looks into voter trends that are shaping Wisconsin\u2019s upcoming Supreme Court election, the first major battleground state race of 2025.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f We want to hear from you!\n\nHave a question for the NBC News Politics Desk on the flurry of Trump administration moves, Elon Musk and DOGE\u2019s activity, or what comes next on Capitol Hill?\n\nSend your questions to politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com and we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter.\n\nThe pressure is on Senate Democrats after the House passes a funding bill to avert a shutdown\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson passed another major test today in the narrowly divided House, muscling through a stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown.\n\nIt puts Senate Democrats in a politically precarious position, with government money sent to run dry Friday night.\n\nThe six-month funding bill passed 217-213, Scott Wong, Kyle Stewart, Sahil Kapur and Rebecca Kaplan report from Capitol Hill. Just one House Republican, the conservative Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, voted against it. And just one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, who represents a district President Donald Trump carried in Maine, voted for it.\n\nThe outcome is a victory for GOP leaders and the White House, who do not want to see a shutdown in the first two months of the new administration and are eager to move on to advancing Trump\u2019s agenda on the border, taxes and other policy areas.\n\nOver the past several days, Trump and his top aides called undecided Republicans to urge them to back the funding bill, multiple sources familiar with the calls told NBC News. And ahead of the vote Tuesday morning, Vice President JD Vance huddled with House Republicans at the Capitol to rally support.\n\nRep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., one of the Republicans who were on the fence, voted for the bill after she said she visited the White House earlier in the day.\n\nBut the drama is far from over. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has made clear he\u2019s firmly against the funding bill. That means at least eight Democratic senators would have to support it to cross the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold and send it to Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders were staunchly against the bill. They blasted Republicans for drafting the bill on a partisan basis and argued they gave the Trump administration too much discretion in how to spend certain pots of money.\n\nSenate Democratic leaders, however, have stayed mum. After an unusually long Senate Democratic lunch meeting on Tuesday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to state his position on the bill, a sign that his members lack consensus on the path forward.\n\nPublicly, many Senate Democrats said they wanted to see how the House voted first before weighing in. But Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said he would vote for the bill.\n\n\u201cI refuse to burn the village down and to claim to save it,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t agree with many facets of that CR, but when the choice is about shutting the government down, I don\u2019t want to be involved with that.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMassie fallout: Trump\u2019s patience appears to be running thin with Massie, who also voted against the House GOP\u2019s budget resolution last month. Trump said on Truth Social he would \u201clead the charge\u201d to find a primary opponent to challenge him next year.\n\nBut as Melanie Zanona reports, that didn\u2019t sit well with Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas. During a closed-door House GOP caucus Tuesday morning, Roy said he didn\u2019t appreciate Trump\u2019s threat, according to two sources in the room. Roy also called on Republican leadership to stand up for Massie, which Johnson later did at a news conference.

Prominent Republican donors and activists are squarely behind conservative Brad Schimel, while Democrats are with liberal Susan Crawford.\n\nTurnout will be far lower than in November, and the electorate figures to be skewed toward voters who are more politically engaged and partisan, making this an imperfect test. But the outcome will at least offer clues about how the political winds might be shifting in what is arguably America\u2019s premier swing state.\n\nThere are a few key patterns and trends that enabled President Donald Trump to flip the state in November that will be under the microscope next month.\n\nWhere Republicans made gains\n\nEight of the 10 counties where Trump improved his performance the most from the 2020 elections are in the southwestern part of the state, in what is called the \u201cDriftless Area\u201d (a nod to the unique topography that resulted from the lack of glacial coverage more than 10,000 years ago).\n\nPolitically, it represents a significant growth opportunity for the GOP, having remained loyal to Democrats until more recently than other small towns and rural parts of the state. It was Trump\u2019s emergence in 2016 that triggered the area\u2019s movement toward the GOP.\n\nDoes this represent a partisan realignment that is ongoing and that will allow Republicans to build an even bigger advantage here going forward? Or is it more tentative and Trump-specific, offering Democrats a chance to stabilize and improve their performance without Trump on the ballot? Notably, the area did return to its Democratic roots in recent state Supreme Court races.\n\nWhere Democrats are in growth mode\n\nThe \u201cWOW\u201d counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha outside of Milwaukee have historically been the biggest vote bank in the state for Republican candidates, and all favored Trump by double digits last year. But the GOP\u2019s advantage has been receding.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s declines here match the national trend of the last generation or so of highly educated, professional-class, white suburbanites shedding their previous Republican allegiance \u2014 which accelerated drastically with Trump\u2019s emergence.\n\nEven while losing ground statewide, Democrats modestly improved their performance in the WOW counties last November. In Ozaukee and Waukesha, Harris won a higher share of the vote than any Democratic presidential nominee there since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.\n\nThat the Democratic gains have been particularly stark in Ozaukee is no surprise. Outside of Dane County (home of the University of Wisconsin-Madison), it has the highest concentration of white, college-educated voters in the state.\n\nLast November, Democrats were banking on even bigger gains in the WOW counties, which could have pushed Harris over the top statewide. Still, Democrats see an opportunity to make further strides here and to cement them, with Republicans hoping to arrest their slide without Trump at the top of their ticket.\n\nRead more from Steve \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udcc9 Taking stock: Trump has previously pointed to the stock market as a key indicator of his administration\u2019s economic success.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA Republican Maine state representative has filed a lawsuit alleging the state\u2019s House speaker and other Democrats violated her First Amendment rights and disenfranchised her constituents by censuring her last month and barring from speaking or voting on the House floor.\n\nState Rep. Laurel Libby has been an outspoken critic of Maine\u2019s state policy allowing transgender girls to compete in girls\u2019 sports.\n\nLibby recently posted on social media to draw attention to the Maine high school girls\u2019 indoor track and field state championship, where a student who competed as a boy last year but now identifies as transgender took first place in girls\u2019 pole vault. That first-place finish propelled the student\u2019s team to win the championship by a single point.\n\nLibby\u2019s post included the student\u2019s name and photographs. While Libby was criticized for naming the student, her lawsuit notes, \u201cThe Championship was a public event, was streamed online, and the names, schools and photographs of the winners were posted publicly.\u201d\n\nThe post received national attention and prompted a heated exchange between Democratic Maine Gov. Jill Mills and President Donald Trump over transgender athletes. Mills told the president \u201cSee you in court\u201d after he said he would deny federal funding to the state if it refused to comply with his executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThree federal agencies have also launched investigations into the Maine Department of Education and its compliance with Title IX.\n\n\u201cI had no idea my post would go viral like it did, but it did because it so inherently unfair to see a young man on a podium that a Maine girl deserved to be standing on,\u201d Libby told CNN in an interview.\n\nAfter Libby\u2019s post, the Democratic-controlled Maine House voted along party lines 75-70 to censure Libby, declaring her post \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cincompatible with her duty and responsibilities as a member of the House.\u201d\n\nThe censure required her to apologize, but she refused, so the House prohibited her from speaking or voting on the House floor for the rest of her term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious my censure is retaliation because they do not want to have a debate about the real issue, which is biological males participating in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d Libby said.\n\nLibby, who represents 9,000 constituents, alleges that the censure violates her First Amendment rights as well as the Equal Protection, Due Process, and Guarantee Clauses of the US Constitution. She is asking the court for injunctive relief that would allow her to continue her duties.\n\nA spokeswoman for Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nJudges recuse from case\n\nOn Wednesday, every federal judge in Maine recused themselves from the lawsuit.\n\nThe Chief Judge of Maine said in a court filing that these recusals constitute an \u201cemergency\u201d under federal law and the case will now be moved to Rhode Island. The judges did not provide a reasons for their recusals from the case.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nOne of the trends that Donald Trump and his supporters wanted to reverse with his big speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 was a steady erosion of his job-approval ratings in the polls from the mildly positive \u201choneymoon\u201d levels he registered just after returning to the White House.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. And there\u2019s increasing evidence concerns about the economy and reaction to Elon Musk\u2019s assault on federal services and employees are beginning to take a toll on the new administration\u2019s base of support. On Thursday, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, having lost more than 10 percent of its value in three weeks.\n\nSilver Bulletin\u2019s comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of the polls show Trump\u2019s approval-rating averages now clearly underwater at 47.3 percent positive and 49.0 percent negative. RealClearPolitics, which produces simple arithmetical averages from a database that includes several dubious pro-Trump pollsters, shows his net job-approval averages dropping from 1.2 percent on March 4 to minus-0.7 percent on March 13.\n\nBeyond the overall numbers, the most recent polls show that worries about the economy continue to hound the 47th president. Here\u2019s how Emerson College explained the trends:\n\nAs President Trump reaches his first 50 days in office, his approval rating has declined from 49%-41% to 47%-45%, reflecting a nation deeply divided \u2026 Voters are most supportive of Trump\u2019s immigration policy, but they disapprove of his handling of the economy, believe tariffs will hurt economic growth, and are skeptical of his cryptocurrency policy.\n\nA number of polls before the speech suggested that even Trump supporters thought he was inadequately focused on inflation and prices, which could mean deeper trouble for him if his current wave of tariffs and trade-war threats produce higher retail prices, as most economists expect. The most recent plunge in stock prices may produce additional jitters as predictions of a possible recession return to news reports.\n\nA March 13 Quinnipiac survey shows that concerns over the economy are actually more intense than they were at the end of the Biden administration. The percentage of voters describing the economy as either \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d has increased from 64 percent in December to 76 percent now.\n\nWhere is Trump losing ground among the electorate? Polls differ, but the latest, the above-mentioned Emerson poll, showed Latinos disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance by a 51.6 to 35.2 percent margin. Another post-speech poll from TIPP Insights shows self-identified moderates disapproving of the job Trump\u2019s doing by a 54 to 33 percent margin. It appears that the less MAGA-oriented elements of the electorate where Trump made important gains last November may be proving soft spots in his coalition, which isn\u2019t surprising since he\u2019s now responsible for a status quo with which a lot of Americans are chronically unhappy. The chaos in his administration probably isn\u2019t helping. As Axios reports, the occasional pollsters who ask about Elon Musk and DOGE are sensing some negative vibes:\n\nIn a Feb. 13-18 Washington Post-Ipsos poll, a net 34% of respondents said they approved of how Musk was handling his job, compared to 49% disapproving and 14% not sure.\n\nThe poll displayed a stark divide based on party ID, with just 6% of Democrats approving of how Musk has handled his job compared to 70% of Republicans. But when asked if they approved of Musk shutting down federal government programs he deemed unnecessary, a smaller slice of Republicans (56%) gave their blessing, while 25% said they weren\u2019t sure and 18% disapproved \u2026\n\nOver half of respondents (55%) in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted Feb. 13 to 17 said Musk has too much power in making decisions affecting the U.S., while 36% think he has about the right amount of power.\n\nA Pew survey of U.S. adults taken Jan. 27 to Feb. 2 showed that Americans had more negative (54%) than positive (42%) views of Musk (DOGE\u2019s dissection of the federal government has dramatically escalated since the poll was conducted).\n\nThe more recent Quinnipiac poll shows self-identified independents disapproving of Musk and DOGE by a 68 to 28 percent margin.\n\nIf alarm over arbitrary federal budget cuts and employee layoffs coincides with troublesome economic news, Trump may soon find himself back in the more decisively negative public-opinion territory he has inhabited for much of his political career."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 A pair of federal judges warned Tuesday of continued threats against members of the judiciary amid criticism leveled by Elon Musk and threats of impeachment by Republicans in Congress. They warned such attacks strike at judicial independence.\n\nJudges Jeffrey Sutton and Richard Sullivan, who sit on the federal appeals courts, raised concerns about the increase in threats against judges in a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal judiciary.\n\nSullivan, who chairs the committee on judicial security, said the protection of judges and federal courthouses around the country is a top priority for the judiciary and recent cuts to the U.S. Marshals Service's budget is a concern. The agency provides security for federal courts and judges.\n\n\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" he said. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"\n\nSutton, meanwhile, said that while the types of threats against judges have evolved over time, they arise directly from the fact that they're doing their jobs.\n\n\"We're supposed to say what the law means, and there's 1,000 federal judges out there, we each take that responsibility seriously,\" he said, adding that judges take an oath to interpret the law neutrally and dispassionately. \"It's a shame to see people attacking judges simply for doing their level best to do their job.\"\n\nSutton and Sullivan both noted that the justice system allows the losing party to appeal an adverse decision from the trial court to an appeals court and then the Supreme Court.\n\n\"We allocate disappointment to half the people that come before us,\" Sutton said. \"Criticism is no surprise. It's part of the job. But I do think when it gets to the level of a threat, it really is about attacking judicial independence, and that's just not good for the system or the country.\"\n\nSutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.\n\nThe concerns from the two GOP-appointed judges come as Musk and allies of Mr. Trump have attacked judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration. Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"\n\nIn a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"\n\nRepublicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.\n\nThe impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.\n\n\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" Sutton said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"\n\nSullivan said that amid the evolving threat landscape, and as there are more threats to judges, public officials must be responsible in their comments about the system of justice.\n\n\"The reality is that there are a lot of folks who will respond and react perhaps inappropriately based on something they heard or read, and so, I just think it's important for everyone to be responsible in what they say about our process,\" he said.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts separately spoke of the importance of preserving judicial independence in his year-end report closing out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting judges from threats, the federal judiciary's Vulnerability Management Program provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members last year, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report, released Tuesday.\n\nThe program was established after Congress passed legislation responding to the 2020 killing of the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. The gunman found the judge's address, pictures of her house and vehicle information online.\n\nThe measure, signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022, aims to make it more difficult to find judges' personal information on the internet."

            "full_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nUS Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has begun the process of eliminating a US Food and Drug Administration program called GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe,\u201d that critics say has been abused by the food industry for decades.\n\nNearly 99% of new chemicals used in food or food packaging since 2000 were green-lit for use not by the FDA but by the food and chemical industry, according to a 2022 analysis.\n\nDuring that period, food manufacturers asked the FDA\u2019s permission to introduce a new substance only 10 times, according to the analysis conducted by the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an environmental and health advocacy organization based in Washington.\n\n\u201cFor far too long, ingredient manufacturers and sponsors have exploited a loophole that has allowed new ingredients and chemicals, often with unknown safety data, to be introduced into the U.S. food supply without notification to the FDA or the public,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cEliminating this loophole will provide transparency to consumers,\u201d he said, and \u201chelp get our nation\u2019s food supply back on track by ensuring that ingredients being introduced into foods are safe.\u201d\n\nMany challenges ahead\n\nExperts applauded the move, calling it long overdue, but questioned how realistic any change will be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for dealing with the GRAS loophole. It\u2019s way past time for the FDA to close it,\u201d said Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard Professor Emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, in an email.\n\n\u201cFood companies should not decide for themselves whether their additives are safe,\u201d said Nestle, who has written books on the politics of the food industry.\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that this administration will give the FDA the resources it needs \u2014 and this means well-paid experts in food toxicology \u2014 to take on additive assessments, especially while agency personnel are being fired right and left,\u201d she added.\n\nFormer FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf, who resigned from his position on January 20, added that any reform would have to make it past the powerful food industry lobby, which has traditionally fought change.\n\n\u201cIf it were to happen, it would be a real reversal of years of lobbying and politicians who mostly were blocking the efforts to make this happen,\u201d Califf said. \u201cThe industry has resisted it; the Republican Congress has blocked it. Now, if they\u2019re in favor, let\u2019s take advantage of it and get this done. I\u2019d be all for it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kennedy announced that he had met with the chief executive officers of Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Tyson Foods, Kellogg\u2019s, Smuckers and Pepsi to discuss a solution.\n\n\u201cYou should be able to exercise informed choice. You should know what that product is, what\u2019s in your food and what the health impacts are, and that\u2019s all we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview aired Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to incentivize people, to incentivize companies to be transparent, and we\u2019re going to inform Americans about what\u2019s making them sick,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cNobody wants to be sick.\u201d\n\nMelissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, which represents the food industry, told CNN in an email that the meeting was \u201cconstructive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continued engagement with the secretary and the qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\u201d Hockstad said.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., center left, posted a photo on social media of himself with, from left, Kraft Heinz Co. CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Consumer Brands Association CEO Melissa Hockstad, PepsiCo North America CEO Steven Williams, General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening, Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King, Kelloggs, US CEO Gary Pilnick and Smuckers CEO Mark Smucker. From Secretary Kennedy\n\nWhat is the problem with GRAS?\n\nCreated by a 1958 amendment to the 1938 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, GRAS was intended to be narrowly applied to safe, commonly used ingredients such as garlic, oil, vinegar and baking soda. In 1997, however, an overwhelmed and underfunded FDA made the program voluntary, allowing industry to say a substance was GRAS without first providing safety data to the agency.\n\nSince then, critics say, food manufacturers have introduced numerous untested additives into the food supply, many of which have later been identified as harmful.\n\nOne of these, brominated vegetable oil or BVO \u2014 a vegetable oil used in citrus sodas and sports drinks \u2014 was declared no longer GRAS in 1970. But the FDA did not officially ban the additive from use in the US food supply until July 2024.\n\n\u201cThe FDA knew for decades that brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, would be harmful, but it was allowed to remain in use at the request of food manufacturers,\u201d Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias said at a September news briefing. Giannoulias was a coauthor of the Illinois Food Safety Act, which passed the Illinois Senate and is currently before the House of Representatives.\n\nTired of waiting for the FDA, other states have also acted. In October 2023, California banned four substances \u2014 BVO, potassium bromate, propylparaben and red dye No. 3 \u2014 due to links with serious health concerns as cancer, endocrine and reproductive issues, and heart and liver problems.\n\nThe FDA banned red dye No. 3 in January, more than 30 years after scientists discovered links to cancer in animals. A synthetic color additive made from petroleum and chemically known as erythrosine, red dye No. 3 was used to give foods, candy and beverages a bright cherry-red color.\n\nAdditional chemicals being targeted by legislative bills in 31 states include red dye No. 40; blue dye No. 1 and No. 2; green dye No. 3; yellow dye No. 5 and No. 6; titanium dioxide; and azodicarbonamide, a dough conditioner that is also used in yoga mats, according to the Environmental Working Group.\n\nHurdles to overcome\n\nEliminating the GRAS loophole would require companies to \u201cpublicly notify the FDA of their intended use of [new] ingredients, along with underlying safety data, before they are introduced in the food supply,\u201d HHS said in the statement.\n\nHowever, representatives for food companies say the GRAS process plays an important role in enabling companies to \u201cinnovate to meet consumer demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the administration looks to revise GRAS, we stand ready to work with agency experts on continued analysis of safe ingredients and increase consumer transparency,\u201d said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy and federal affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, in an email.\n\nEliminating GRAS isn\u2019t as simple as removing the regulations, said Jensen Jose, regulatory officer for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit food safety organization.\n\n\u201cThere are many secret GRAS chemicals that are already in our food supply,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cMaking these chemicals immediately illegal until obtaining FDA approval may cause disruptions in the food supply. Ensuring that existing GRAS chemicals are safe to remain in our foods should be a systematic process.\u201d\n\nIn addition, not everything GRAS should be eliminated during reform, said Jennifer Pomeranz, an associate professor of public health policy and management at New York University\u2019s School of Global and Public Health in New York City.\n\n\u201cThey should grandfather ingredients that were GRAS in 1958 when Congress created the food amendment, like garlic, salt and pepper, that we have eaten for decades without harm,\u201d she said. \u201cPast that, have everything go through a food additive petition to assure its safety.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that while changing the GRAS process, the food industry could pass along the cost to consumers in the form of higher prices, Califf said.\n\n\u201cTo do this research costs money. That\u2019s a lot different than just declaring our stuff is safe, versus actually doing the work rigorously and having an independent government evaluation,\u201d he said.\n\nTeasing out the health impact of food additives over long periods of time is also difficult and time-consuming, Califf said: \u201cThese are not issues of people developing cancer in one week. It\u2019s increased risk of cancer 20 years later.\n\n\u201cIt takes large-scale epidemiology, a lot of expertise and teams of people, including people who know about the chemistry and biology and the epidemiology and human disease, and it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me that beefing up the FDA budget, this would be a good deal for the American people.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US Education Department announced Tuesday that it is cutting nearly 50% of its workforce, as President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating the agency altogether.\n\nHundreds will be laid off starting Tuesday evening, in addition to those who took voluntary \u201cbuyouts.\u201d Those actions will cut the department\u2019s workforce of about 4,100 at the start of the Trump administration in half.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s reduction in force reflects the Department of Education\u2019s commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. \u201cI appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department.\n\nMcMahon said later Tuesday that the reductions are the first course of action in shutting down the agency, which Trump has vowed to do, although she acknowledged that fully eliminating the department would require Congress to act. CNN reported last week that White House officials have prepared an executive order directing McMahon to begin the process of dismantling the department.\n\nAsked on Fox News whether the layoffs were \u201cthe first step to a total shutdown,\u201d McMahon said, \u201cYes, actually it is, because that was the president\u2019s mandate as directed to me clearly is to shut down the Department of Education.\u201d She went on to describe the layoffs as \u201celiminating what I think is bureaucratic bloat.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 1,300 employees notified of their layoff will be terminated in 90 days, according to senior agency officials. Those fired will begin teleworking starting Wednesday and go on paid administrative leave starting March 21, the officials said, adding that the employees will receive severance pay based on the length of their service.\n\nThe cuts are in addition to the 63 probationary employees who were fired as part of a White House directive last month, the officials added. More than 300 employees also took voluntary separation incentives worth up to $25,000 while about 260 accepted a deferred resignation package.\n\nTuesday\u2019s cuts follow similar layoffs at other federal agencies as part of Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s continued efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.\n\n\u2018Significant changes to the way that we work\u2019\n\nThe senior officials told reporters that the cuts will not impact federal student aid \u201cin any way, shape or form,\u201d as experts raise alarm about whether the agency can carry out its usual duties with such a massive reduction.\n\nThe officials added that an earlier memo sent to employees announcing that the agency\u2019s offices will be temporarily closed for unspecified \u201csecurity reasons\u201d was due to the layoffs.

The agency plans to eventually consolidate into one office in Washington, DC, where it currently has three.\n\nMinutes before employees were required to vacate the building, security guards were seen locking the doors of the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DC. Offices are expected to reopen Thursday.\n\nLongtime department staffers told CNN they can\u2019t remember a time that all offices were closed, even when significant VIPs have been on site.\n\nSeveral Department of Education employees earlier told CNN they were nervous about impending mass layoffs and the looming executive order from Trump.\n\nIn an email sent to employees not impacted by the cuts and obtained by CNN, the agency said, \u201cThere will need to be significant changes to the way that we work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile your position was not directly affected, I understand that seeing valued colleagues and friends depart is never easy,\u201d the agency\u2019s chief human capital officer said in the email, adding, \u201cWhat we choose to prioritize, and in turn, not prioritize, will be critical in this transition.\u201d\n\nUnions stress impact of cuts on students\n\nUnions representing Department of Education workers and teachers quickly responded to the cuts on Tuesday, expressing concern for the workforce and the impacts on tens of millions of students served by the agency.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear from the past weeks of mass firings, chaos, and unchecked unprofessionalism is that this regime has no respect for the thousands of workers who have dedicated their careers to serve their fellow Americans,\u201d Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, said in a statement. \u201cIt is also clear that there is a rampant disinformation campaign to mislead Americans about the actual services, resources, grants, and programs that the U.S. Department of Education provides to all Americans.\u201d\n\nAnother major teachers\u2019 union slammed Trump and Elon Musk for their reshaping of the federal government that led to Tuesday\u2019s cuts. \u201cThe real victims will be our most vulnerable students,\u201d Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said in a statement.\n\nSuch sweeping reduction \u201cis a reason to be concerned,\u201d one expert previously told CNN.\n\n\u201cIf [Trump] says, \u2018We\u2019re going to have a 50% reduction in staff,\u2019 there is reason to be concerned about how the system will work: Is that enough people?\u201d said Neal McCluskey, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute. \u201cWe\u2019re going to learn whether or not they can do the job with fewer of them.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Michael Williams contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Yikes! Photo: Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nFor many decades, true-blue anti-government conservatives and libertarians have secretly or semi-secretly longed to take a chain saw to Social Security, the crown jewel of the New Deal and of America\u2019s sorta-kinda welfare state. But with a few exceptions (e.g., Barry Goldwater in his disastrous 1964 presidential campaign and George W. Bush in a 2005 partial-privatization initiative that went nowhere), Republican politicians have understood that Social Security is indeed the third rail of American politics: Touch it and you\u2019ll die. And Donald Trump has been especially keen to disclaim any interest in messing with the retirement benefits that so many of his voters rely upon and that most feel they\u2019ve richly earned.\n\nUnfortunately, that sense of basic political reality is not shared by the extremist businessman whom Trump has given unprecedented power to identify and eliminate federal programs and personnel he deems wasteful. Elon Musk has repeatedly called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,\u201d a point of view that will especially infuriate current beneficiaries whom he is implicitly accusing of profiteering. The Social Security Administration was one of DOGE\u2019s earliest targets; it\u2019s where DOGE has demanded and obtained big reductions in customer-service offices that might affect the smooth payment of \u2014 and adjustments in \u2014 benefits. At DOGE\u2019s insistence, Social Security has also announced plans to lay off at least 12 percent of its employees.\n\nAs Musk himself made clear in a March 10 interview with Fox Business personality and MAGA insider Larry Kudlow, he wants to go after benefits in the worst way. After assuring Kudlow that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere despite highly dubious media claims that Trump has \u201creined in\u201d the DOGE edgelord, he put a bull\u2019s-eye on entitlement programs like Social Security. Musk said:\n\nWe\u2019re just getting things done, as opposed to writing a report. Like I say, reports don\u2019t mean anything. You\u2019ve got to actually take action.\n\nSo, I mean, the waste report in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements. So that\u2019s, like, the big one to eliminate. That\u2019s the sort of half-trillion, maybe 600, 700 billion a year.\n\nThese numbers are either being pulled out of the air or perhaps reflect a wild distortion of estimates of invalid claims in Social Security and other retirement programs, as the Associated Press suggests:\n\nMusk\u2019s estimate for the level of fraud in entitlements far outpaces figures from watchdogs like Social Security\u2019s inspector general, who previously said there was $71.8 billion in improper payments from fiscal years 2015 through 2022. That\u2019s less than 1% of benefits paid out during that time period.\n\nNumbers aside, Musk made it clear to Kudlow that he believes almost any myth ever heard about Social Security fraud. Both he and his boss in the White House have been ventilating about dead people being in the Social Security database:\n\nThere have been many good audits, like I said, done by inspector generals and by Government Accountability Office. And they just haven\u2019t been implemented. Nothing\u2019s been done. I think the GAO identified that there were 17 million dead people in the Social Security database several years ago. It\u2019s now 20 million.\n\nUnfortunately for this lurid claim, having a Social Security number is not the same as receiving Social Security benefits, and there\u2019s no evidence that significant numbers of ineligible people are actually receiving checks. In fact, as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities recently explained, Social Security just isn\u2019t a program with a serious fraud problem:\n\nSocial Security has a payment accuracy rate of over 99 percent. Only 0.3 percent of Social Security benefits are improper payments, which are typically caused by mistakes or delays.\n\nBut Musk, who before his DOGE self-assignment probably knew as much about Social Security as a hog knows about the Spanish Inquisition, revealed to Kudlow that he has bought into the deeply racist Great Replacement Theory for why the welfare state was invented and persists:\n\n[Entitlement spending] is also a mechanism by which the Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants by essentially paying them to come here and then turning them into voters. So this is why the Democrats are so upset about the situation, because they\u2019re losing, you know \u2014 if we turn off this gigantic money magnet for illegal immigrants, then they will leave.\n\nThis claim represents a tight bundle of multiple lies. Other than court-ordered educational benefits and emergency health care, undocumented immigrants do not qualify for any federal benefits, and there\u2019s no evidence of widespread fraudulent access to such benefits. There\u2019s even less evidence of the noncitizen voting that Trump and other Republicans have recently used to challenge any elections they happen to lose.\n\nOne of the problems with giving a completely unaccountable figure like Musk the kind of unlimited access he now has to the innards of the federal government is that nobody voted for him, and nobody can rebuke him for holding ignorant and conspiracy-laden views of a public sector he clearly despises and would like to dismantle. Indeed, he offers cover to Trump and Republican politicians who can depict him as a disinterested technician instead of a knuckle-dragging ideologue who couldn\u2019t be elected dogcatcher."

            "full_content": "An illegal alien who worked as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-NY) deputy communications director says he has self-deported to Colombia.\n\nDiego de la Vega was born in Quito, Ecuador, and was seven years old when he entered the United States and then overstayed a visitor\u2019s visa for 23 years living in New York City, which is a sanctuary city.\n\nIn an interview with Migrant Insider, de la Vega says that while growing up, \u201cWe lived in fear because we were not of the right status, but I had a pretty good childhood in New York. We worked hard, starting out in a basement apartment. But we went to school and got jobs.\u201d\n\nThe former illegal alien says his political activism began with the Dream Act in 2010. After it failed to pass into law (thank heaven), \u201cHe started organizing for immigrant rights, first as a communications worker in the New York State Assembly, then for Make the Road NY, an immigrant rights organization.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s two jobs he stole from legal citizens.\n\nThen it all came together:\n\nHis work did not go unnoticed. Within a year, he was hired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reelection campaign, where he eventually became her deputy communications director. \u201cAlexandria comes from an organizing background herself, so she likes to hire people who share that experience,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s an excellent communicator, and the team she built is top-notch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiego is amazing,\u201d AOC told Migrant Insider. \u201cWe love him.\u201d\n\nDe la Vega wanted to work on Capitol Hill. Thankfully, only legal citizens are allowed to work in national politics, which seems like a pretty smart law to me, because here is the bottom line about this DACA enrollee\u2026 See if you can spot the problem with Mr. Amazing Diego\u2026\n\n\u201cIn my late 20s, I began to seriously consider how precarious my future in the U.S. was,\u201d de la Vega said. \u201cI thought about what would happen if I just left, if I went to Latin America, if I embraced my identity as a Latino instead of trying to fit the image of a picture-perfect immigrant.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNot being able to leave the U.S. or visit my country was hard.\u201d\n\nAnd there you go\u2026\n\nDe la Vega had no desire to become an American. Oh, he wanted citizenship, but that\u2019s something very different from wanting to become an American. He lives here 23 of his 31 years and still refers to Colombia as \u201cmy country,\u201d still wants to embrace his \u201cidentity as a Latino instead of trying to fit the image of a picture-perfect immigrant.\u201d\n\nNo normal person wants immigrants like this guy living in our country: people who demean America while flying the flag of a foreign country. When my wife and her family came here (legally) from Mexico, they desperately wanted to become Americans \u2014 to learn the language, embrace our ideals and customs, and appreciate the prosperity. My wife is proud of her Mexican heritage, and in our beautiful melting pot she has held on to the traditions she loves. But if you ask what her country is, she will proudly say \u201cAmerica.\u201d\n\nAnyway, it appears as though things worked for everyone. For those of us who believe in the rule of law, an illegal alien has self-deported. As far as that illegal alien, he appears much happier where he belongs \u2014 in his own country: \u201cDiego de la Vega has a new life in Colombia\u2014one without fear, with freedom of mobility, and with the agency he never had during his 23 years in New York City.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cAfter some time, it\u2019s been a real pleasure to be here\u2026 It feels fulfilling to be home.\u201d\n\nDiego is fulfilled instead of stealing a legal citizen\u2019s job.\n\nI believe that\u2019s whachoocall a win-win, baby.\n\nOne down, about 29 million to go.\n\nJohn Nolte\u2019s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump waited to appear in public on Tuesday until the final hour of trading on Wall Street, when he stepped out of the Oval Office to forcefully defend his whipsaw tariff decisions that have roiled the financial markets.\n\n\u201cWe had the greatest economy in history,\u201d Trump said, recalling his first administration. \u201cThis economy, in my opinion, is going to blow it away.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he believes the United States is heading toward a recession, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see it at all.\u201d\n\nHis comments did little to calm markets. Stocks again swooned; the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been paring earlier losses, dropped 350 points in the final hour of trading to end the day down 1.14%.\n\n\u201cMarkets are going to go up and they\u2019re going to go down, but you know what?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to rebuild our country.\u201d\n\nLong before the president emerged on the South Lawn, his words had already spooked investors. After threatening a new round of tariffs in a social media post earlier Tuesday, markets sank again.\n\nAs he pursues a hardline trade agenda and announces plans for new tariffs on a near-daily basis, Trump is sending jitters through the economy and drawing blowback even from some of his allies, who see their political or financial fortunes in the balance.\n\nIn a speech to some of America\u2019s top business leaders Tuesday night, Trump dismissed any concern from the roiled financial markets.\n\nReporters were escorted out of the Business Roundtable event after a single question, but two attendees said the president\u2019s remarks shed no new light on his tariff plans.\n\n\u201cThere was no new clarity or certainty,\u201d one business leader told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the White House.\n\nThe president insisted he was not backing away from his April reciprocal tariff plan, another person who attended the meeting said, describing the question-and-answer session as familiar ground Trump has covered before.\n\nEarlier in the day, the White House touted fresh job-creating investments and blamed policies of the Biden administration, which press secretary Karoline Leavitt called an \u201ceconomic nightmare.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans, along with business executives and economists, have warned that Trump\u2019s harsh approach toward the United States\u2019 largest trading partners could risk major damage to what had been an improving economy.\n\n\u201cThis market is just blatantly sick and tired of the back-and-forth on trade policy. It feels as though the administration continues to move the goal posts,\u201d Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview earlier Tuesday. \u201cWith that much uncertainty, it\u2019s impossible for investors to have any confidence.\u201d\n\nThe president did, however, seek to offer reassurance to one American company whose stocks fell 15% on Monday, raising losses since the beginning of the year to 45%, before rebounding some on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,\u201d Trump posted on social media.\n\nLater that afternoon, he stepped out of the Oval Office into the bright sunshine to size up several Tesla models \u2013 red, silver and blue \u2013 that were parked in the south driveway of the White House. As Musk watched, the president took a close look at the electric vehicles in a moment that unfolded like a Tesla promotion.\n\n\u201cWe have to celebrate someone who has the courage to do this,\u201d Trump said, showering praise upon Musk. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be penalized because he\u2019s a patriot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how carefully Trump\u2019s combative approach to tariffs has been planned out. His Tuesday threat to ramp up duties on steel and aluminum on Canada, which were set to go into effect Wednesday, was not drawn up into formal paperwork ahead of time, officials said.\n\nAnd during the appearance with Musk, Trump veered again, saying he would \u201cprobably\u201d reverse course on higher tariffs. The White House later confirmed that the planned tariff was back to 25%, with Ontario agreeing to suspend its 25% surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.\n\nSince Trump entered office 50 days ago, there have been few weekday afternoons when he hasn\u2019t invited reporters into the West Wing to hold forth on camera. Monday was one of them. As stock markets tumbled, Trump remained behind closed doors, hosting tech executives and swearing in his new Secret Service chief all without cameras rolling. It was Trump\u2019s own comments a day earlier, refusing to rule out a recession, that caused markets to sink, rendering his silence Monday even more notable.\n\nFor a president who boasts of one record-setting moment after another, he has taken an unusually equivocal tone on the slowing economy. Shortly after taking office, he talked about \u201cshort-term pain.\u201d In his speech to Congress last week, he acknowledged the prospect of \u201ca little disturbance\u201d in the economy, adding: \u201cIt won\u2019t be much.\u201d\n\nBut Trump has yet to seize the bully pulpit in the way he has on other issues, fueling uncertainty that markets have rejected day after day.\n\nTrump\u2019s aides have been quick to downplay recession fears, suggesting instead that the new tariffs will cause momentary \u201cdisruption\u201d as global trade is realigned toward the United States.\n\n\u201cSince President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump\u2019s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs,\u201d Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement after markets closed Monday. \u201cPresident Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.\u201d\n\nBut for a businessman who has long seen a rising stock market as a critical metric of economic success, the steep declines on Wall Street have cast doubt on Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that he isn\u2019t paying attention.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market,\u201d Trump told Fox Business in an interview that aired over the weekend in which his comments declining to rule out a recession touched off a fresh wave of anxiety and led to the biggest market decline of the year.\n\nThat admonition from Trump, which even many of his allies and advisers privately concede they don\u2019t fully believe, is at odds with what he said throughout the campaign and during his transition back to power.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say this, it\u2019s too braggadocios, but we\u2019ll say it anyway \u2014 the Trump effect,\u201d he told a crowded rally on the eve of his inauguration, basking in applause from his supporters. \u201cSince the election, the stock market has surged.\u201d\n\nToday, the Trump effect is seen in a far different light. The New York Post, one of his favorite old tabloids that he reads religiously, blared a warning on Tuesday\u2019s edition: \u201cBuckle Up! Markets plunge as Trump takes the economy on a wild ride.\u201d\n\nAs Trump remained uncharacteristically out of public view on Monday, a question began emerging among some Republican donors, investors and business leaders who scrambled to explain the sudden economic whiplash: Is Trump working to engineer a recession \u2014 or not actively building a narrative against it \u2014 to force the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates?\n\nIn his second presidency, Trump has far fewer dissenting voices in his administration, particularly those who may offer a different economic view on tariffs.\n\n\u201cTariffs are going to be the greatest thing we\u2019ve ever done as a country,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make our country rich again.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s view, the disruption caused by his tariffs is a necessary step toward correcting decades of bad decisions on trade that hollowed out American manufacturing and led to core US industries being moved overseas.\n\nHis whipsaw tariffs have thrown foreign governments off balance, prompting their leaders to scramble to get Trump on the phone to plead for a reprieve.\n\nThe tariffs are also a necessary revenue driver that, in Trump\u2019s plan, will be used to pay for new tax cuts he promised as a candidate, and an extension of the tax cuts he hopes to approve later this year.\n\nTrump arrived in office having inherited strong a economy, with rising wages and consumer spending, low unemployment and inflation \u2014 albeit higher than consumers or the Federal Reserve would like \u2014 appearing to slow.\n\nAll presidents, at points in their terms, find themselves frustrated by the relative difficulty of directly improving the economy from the Oval Office. While they catch blame from the public, many of the factors that influence the economy Americans feel are out of their control.\n\nFor Trump, however, many of the most pressing economic concerns can be directly linked to his policies.\n\nNew tariffs have the potential to aggravate already high prices that Trump himself credited with helping him win. Mass government layoffs could push up unemployment, while also causing workers uncertain about their future to pull back on spending. And large-scale deportations could cause rising costs in industries dependent on migrant labor, including construction and health care.\n\nAll of the uncertainty could cause businesses to hold off on hiring and investing, helping push down growth forecasts.\n\nFor Trump, however, uncertainty appears part of the plan.\n\n\u201cThey always say that. \u2018We want clarity,\u2019\u201d he said in his Fox Business interview. \u201cThey have plenty of clarity.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

Ali, a Biden appointee, has served on the court for less than four months and is among the 25 newest federal judges confirmed by the Senate to serve on a federal district court.\n\nDespite his short tenure, Ali, a U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C., is already at the center of some of the most high-profile court cases to date, presiding most recently over the lawsuit seeking billions in unpaid invoices for USAID-funded projects.\n\nThe case is the first significant case of President Donald Trump's term to be heard by the Supreme Court \u2013 and Amir's handling of it has brought renewed scrutiny from conservatives over his previous work as a litigator, including for progressive legal groups.\n\nSCOTUS RULES ON NEARLY $2 BILLION IN FROZEN USAID PAYMENTS\n\nFar from being a wallflower, Ali has had a prolific and high-profile career as both a professor and litigator, including arguing civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, and serving as the director of Harvard Law's Criminal Justice Appellate Clinic. His work has earned awards or recognition from groups such as the NAACP, the American Constitution Society \u2013 where he was a finalist for the David Carliner Public Interest Award \u2013 and Bloomberg, among others.\n\nMuch of Ali's work prior to his confirmation to the bench focused closely on police and prosecutorial misconduct and civil rights protections, some of which made headlines during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year.\n\nIn 2017, Ali helped open the Washington, D.C., branch of the MacArthur Justice Center, where he represented dozens of plaintiffs, including before the Supreme Court, where he argued and won two separate civil rights cases. The MacArthur Justice Center was formed in 1985 to challenge the death penalty in Illinois, and it has since expanded to support reductions in over-incarceration and the elimination of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, among other reforms, with offices in four states and Washington, D.C.\n\nAli's first case, Garza v. Idaho, expanded the constitutional right to counsel for defendants under the Sixth Amendment. His second, Thompson v. Clark, made it slightly easier for individuals who claim they were wrongfully arrested to sue police for malicious prosecution. (Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, authored the 6-3 majority opinion.)\n\nHe was later appointed executive director of the Washington, D.C., branch, a role he held through 2024, when he was appointed to the federal bench.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing last February, Ali was grilled by Republicans over remarks made by his MacArthur Justice Center colleague, Cliff Johnson \u2013 who suggested during a podcast interview in 2020 that defunding the police is the first step in a \"movement toward making police departments obsolete.\"\n\nAli stressed in response that he did not share those views, and that the views were not endorsed by the MacArthur Justice Center.\n\n\"Let me be very clear about this,\" Ali said. \"I have never advocated for taking away police funding. I would not take that position, and the MacArthur Justice Center has not taken that position.\"\n\nUS JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMIN TO PAY PORTION OF $2B IN FOREIGN AID BY MONDAY\n\nNow, as a judge, Ali has been tasked with presiding over some of the most consequential cases to come up during Trump's second term.\n\nLast month, he sided with foreign aid groups and contractors who sued the Trump administration for roughly $1.9 billion owed for previously completed projects that were funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\nAli gave the Trump administration just two weeks to pay the outstanding funds, prompting Justice Department lawyers to file an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately rejected the Trump administration's request to extend the freeze in 5-4 vote, remanding it back to D.C. federal court, and Ali, to hash out the specifics of what must be paid, and when \u2013 a role Ali stressed that he takes \"very seriously.\"\n\nPlaintiffs sued over the Trump administration's executive action earlier this year that froze nearly all foreign aid spending, changes made in the name of government \"efficiency\" and eliminating waste, according to administration officials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stated plans to cut some 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts and to slash an additional $60 billion in foreign aid spending and at issue in the case is how quickly the Trump administration must pay the outstanding invoices from completed projects.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Monday that roughly 83% of USAID programs are slated to be canceled following a six-week review process led by DOGE.\n\nThe canceled contracts, Rubio wrote, amount to \"tens of billions of dollars\" that were being spent in ways he alleged \"did not serve\" U.S. national interests. He added that the rest of the USAID programs and contracts will be transferred to the State Department to be managed.\n\nLAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS\n\nMost recently, Ali ordered the Trump administration Monday evening to pay by March 14 all owed funds to USAID contractors and other international groups for previously completed projects. Ali said the Trump administration's withholding of the funds, which had already been appropriated by Congress, was likely \"unlawful\" and a violation of the separation of powers doctrine under the Constitution.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Trump administration will move to challenge that ruling in court.\n\nLast week, Ali moved expeditiously on the Supreme Court directive, ordering both parties back to court last week for an hours-long hearing to weigh plausible repayment options. He heard from both plaintiffs in the case, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, who argued that the Trump administration \"never took steps towards compliance\" with Ali's order requiring the administration to unfreeze the federal funds to pay the $1.9 billion in owed project payments.\n\nDuring the hearing, which stretched on for nearly five hours, Ali also focused heavily on other issues, including the government's role in reviewing all foreign aid contracts and grants.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration told Ali they had already completed and made final decisions for these contracts. Stephen Wirth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, objected to the administration's \"breakneck\" review of the contracts and grants, arguing that they \"had one objective \u2013 to terminate as many contracts as possible.\"\n\nLawyers were also pressed by Ali over whether the Trump administration can legally move to terminate projects whose funds are allocated and appropriated by Congress. This could eventually kick the issue back up to the Supreme Court.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Ali ordered the government to pay at least a portion of the owed funds by Monday at 6 p.m. \u2013 taking what he described as a \"concrete step\" forward in resolving some of the confusion surrounding the Trump administration's freeze on most foreign spending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think it\u2019s reasonable to get the plaintiffs' invoices paid by 6 p.m. on Monday,\" Ali said.\n\nIt is unclear what payments the government has made since last week."

            "full_content": "Photo: Justin Merriman/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDespite suggesting on Truth Social this past weekend that he\u2019d like Americans to \u201cshut up\u201d about the price of eggs, Donald Trump is actually very concerned about Americans\u2019 economic problems \u2014 or at least, the plight of one specific South African\u2013born Canadian American businessman.\n\nThe U.S. stock market cratered on Monday amid concerns about both the impact of Trump\u2019s chaotic trade war and the president refusing to rule out a recession this year. Trump has yet to say anything to ally these concerns (in fact, he announced additional tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum on Tuesday). But the president did offer his support to Elon Musk after shares in Tesla, his electric-car company, dropped more than 15 percent on Monday.\n\nTesla shares have plunged more than 50 percent from a mid-December peak as the DOGE chief\u2019s political antics impacted the brand. Tesla sales have been falling in the U.S. and Europe, including a 76 percent decline in Tesla sales in Germany where Musk has endorsed a far-right political party. In recent weeks acts of vandalism have been reported against Tesla vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations, and there have been protests against Musk\u2019s drastic cuts to the federal government at Tesla dealerships across the U.S.\n\nSo early on Tuesday morning, Trump tried to do his part by claiming, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nTrump promoted the company outside the White House on Tuesday afternoon, posing with Musk, his son, and a line of Tesla vehicles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy because number one, it\u2019s a great product. As good as it gets. Number two, because this man [Elon Musk] has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, and I think he has been treated unfairly,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nHours before Trump posted his initial Tesla endorsement, Sean Hannity announced (while chatting with Lara Trump, First Daughter\u2013in\u2013Law/Fox News anchor) that he, too, will buy a Tesla to help out poor Elon. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a gesture on my part, and I like new technology, but it\u2019s just a way of saying, \u2018Look what they\u2019re doing to this guy,\u2019\u201d the Fox host explained.\n\nTo be clear, Musk is not literally poor in any way. He remains the world\u2019s richest man, though his net worth has dropped by $132 billion in 2025, or more than 30 percent as of March 10, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBut Americans should still take heed of Trump\u2019s Truth Social post, if not for their concerns for Musk\u2019s billions, then for the president\u2019s complaint that the \u201cRadical Left Lunatics\u201d are \u201ctrying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla.\u201d Declining to buy a Tesla isn\u2019t currently against the law, but you might want to adjust your finances just in case that changes. A new Cybertruck costs around $80,000, so between that, skyrocketing egg prices, and the potential recession, you\u2019d better start saving.\n\nThis post was updated after Trump\u2019s Tuesday afternoon photo op."

(AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- U.S. officials have not determined who was behind an apparent cyber attack on the social media site X that limited access to the platform for thousands of users, according to a Trump administration official familiar with the ongoing investigation into the matter.\n\nMonday's outage was described as a cyber attack by the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The official added that the Republican administration takes all cyber attacks against American companies seriously but underscored that the U.S. government had not gleaned any specific intelligence about who might have been behind the attack.\n\nThe comments came after Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X and a top adviser to President Donald Trump, claimed in an appearance on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cKudlow\u201d show that the cyber attackers had \u201cIP addresses originating in the Ukraine area\u201d without going into detail on what that might mean.\n\nCybersecurity experts quickly pointed out, however, that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the attack originated in Ukraine.\n\nMusk bought what was then Twitter in 2022 and serves as the CEO of Tesla, all while effectively running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nHis electric vehicle company has faced some headwinds as he's become the face of Trump's effort to dramatically shrink the size of the government through DOGE. Its stock plunged 15% on Monday, its biggest one-day loss since September 2020.\n\nAnalysts have said Musk\u2019s shift to right-wing politics doesn\u2019t appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy, environmentally conscious liberals who have turned to electric vehicles in an attempt to reduce fossil fuel emissions.\n\nTesla has also been a target of protests and vandalism in the U.S. and elsewhere over Musk's push for large-scale federal government layoffs, contract cancellations and other budget slashing moves.\n\nTrump said on his social media platform that he\u2019ll buy a Tesla on Tuesday to demonstrate \"confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???\u201d Trump said."

Al Green, D-Texas.\n\nGreen notably heckled President Donald Trump multiple times during his first address of his second term to Congress last week until House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ordered the Sergeant at Arms to escort Green from the chamber.\n\nHoulahan submitted a resolution Monday calling to censure Boebert \"for her recent disparaging and derogatory comments\" about Green.\n\nREP. AL GREEN BLAMES 'INVIDIOUS DISCRIMINATION' FOR BEING CENSURED AFTER DISRUPTING TRUMP'S SPEECH\n\nDuring a March 7 interview with Real America\u2019s Voice News, Boebert said \"Al Green was given multiple opportunities to stand down, to sit down, to behave, to show decorum.\"\n\n\"For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,\" Boebert added.\n\nThe resolution said those words uttered by Boebert \"are disparaging, derogatory, and racist toward another colleague, and are a breach of proper conduct and decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.\"\n\nIt calls for Boebert to be censured, \"forthwith present herself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure,\" and that Boebert \"be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.\"\n\nIn a statement, Houlahan said, \"After my discussion on the House floor last week when Speaker Johnson told me he\u2019d have to censure half the members if he actually enforced the rules of the Congress, I decided to help, and tonight introduced a resolution to censure Representative Boebert for her racist and derogatory statements about Representative Al Green (D-TX).\"\n\nAt the start of Trump's address before Congress, Green stood up when the president described his electoral victory as a \"mandate\" from the American people.\n\n\"You have no mandate! You have no mandate to cut Medicaid!\" Green shouted, waving his cane at Trump.\n\nThe lower chamber of Congress voted to censure Green the next day, and Johnson condemned how the Democrat \"chose to deliberately violate House rules in a manner that we think is probably unprecedented in history.\"\n\nHoulahan initially voted to table the motion, but she was among the 10 Democrats who ultimately joined with Republicans to censure Green.\n\nEstablishment Democrats and progressives promptly turned on each other over their party's disrupting behavior during Trump's address, complaining how they've failed to have a unifying message against Republicans.\n\nTRUMP BLASTS REP AL GREEN AS 'AN EMBARRASSMENT' TO DEMOCRATS, SAYS HE 'SHOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE AN IQ TEST\n\nHoulahan acknowledged in an X post on Thursday that \"today's vote to censure my fellow representative was not easy and has angered many of you.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Philadelphia Inquirer afterward, she defended her decision but also criticized past behavior from Republicans in the chamber that she argued also warranted censure.\n\n\"I voted to table that because I think we have much, much better things to do with our time than to continue to do this tit-for-tat nonsense with one another,\" Houlahan told the newspaper. \"That being said, the motion to table failed, so we don\u2019t have the opportunity to not vote on this. And I believe we need to recognize that we have rules in the House of Representatives and we have standards of decorum that we all presumably agree to, and we all need to agree to those standards so we can get the work for the people done and so we can not be a banana republic.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Houlahan told the Inquirer she pulled Johnson \"to the side and had a very\u201a very strong conversation with him where I explained I voted in favor but I am not OK with arbitrary and capricious applications of the same rule.\"\n\nShe said she complained about how there was no censure or sanction against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Johnson replied, \"Well, she just wore a hat.\"\n\nBut Houlahan argued Greene \"also yelled at the President of the United States,\" referring to her treatment of former President Joe Biden last year, \"and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s OK that she did not have same treatment.\"\n\n\"And I think it\u2019s absolute hypocrisy that people after the vote were standing there yelling at Mr. Green when their own colleagues have done very, very similar things, not wearing masks when it was mandated, wearing MAGA hats when there are literally no hats allowed on the floor,\" Houlahan said. \"We had to make a special exception for wearing hijabs. It\u2019s insane\u2026 We need to behave like grown-ups and stop the madness.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHoulahan said it was a \"really, really, really hard vote for me,\" but ultimately she did her duty. \"And it\u2019s frustrating because Al Green\u2019s statement was true,\" Houlahan said. \"It wasn\u2019t provocative or offensive. It was the truth. But I think each one of us had to make decisions about how we were going to comport ourselves and what was appropriate, and I know each colleague on both sides made those choices, and each one of us knows there are consequences to those choices.\""

            "full_content": "Talks to determine whether Ukraine is ready to engage with President Donald Trump\u2019s peace process and consequently regain access to U.S. military aid and intelligence started on Tuesday morning.\n\nUkraine hailed talks with America as having started \u201cconstructively\u201d, Kyiv state media reported on Tuesday morning. Delegations from the United States and Ukraine met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the first in-person discussions between the two countries since Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s disastrous attempt at strong-arm diplomacy at the Oval Office in February.\n\nRepresenting the United States are U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, both of whom also sat around the table at the earlier Saudi talks with Russia. For Ukraine, the delegation includes Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha, Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s trusted aide and Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, and Minister of Defence Rustem Umerov.\n\nPresident Zelensky himself was in Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with the Crown Prince but left the country before today\u2019s talks began. Today\u2019s talks are being mediated by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, and their National Security Advisor Mosaad bin Mohammad al-Aiban.\n\nYermak, a former film producer who has been close to Zelensky since his pre-politics days as a Ukrainian comedian and actor, said of talks as they kicked off: \u201cThe meeting with the U.S. team started very constructively; we are working towards a just and lasting peace\u201d.\n\nBoth sides evidently hope for a resetting of relations between the nations following sarcastic retorts by President Zelensky in the Oval Office last month which led to an angry response on respect from Vice President J.D. Vance and Zelensky being asked to leave the White House with nothing. Speaking before today\u2019s talks, Yermak stated Ukraine is ready for \u201ca just and lasting peace in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nWhile this may be a positive development and a step towards a resumption of U.S. aid to Kyiv, similar remarks were made before the White House meeting, with Ukraine\u2019s conception of a \u201clasting peace\u201d meaning robust security guarantees the U.S. appears to believe will be incompatible with a negotiated peace. President Trump has emphasised the importance of even being able to get Russia to the negotiating table at all, and finding a peace agreement to end what the President has called the \u201ckilling fields\u201d of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on his plane to Saudi Arabia overnight Rubio also telegraphed his hopes for talks, saying for the United States the key ambition for Tuesday is to discover whether Ukraine really is ready for peace or not, reported The Guardian. He said: \u201cThe most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things, to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nBoth sides need to come to the realisation there will never be a military victory for one or other of them in the conflict, Rubio said. His stating Ukraine won\u2019t be able to fight its way back to its 2014 borders has been interpreted as meaning a likely outcome of the eventual peace talks will be Ukraine ceding at least some territory as a price for an end to the killing.\n\nBoth Rubio and his colleague the United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have previously made clear the U.S. suspension of aid to Ukraine is a negotiating tactic of Washington to encourage Kyiv to take peace talks seriously, and that it would be reversed when Ukraine came to the table.\n\nRussia is not present at today\u2019s talks but nevertheless made its view on proceedings clear, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claiming Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory \u2014 pointing to a drone attack against Moscow overnight \u2014 as evidence that Kyiv will try to \u201cspoil\u201d talks in favour of keeping the war going."

            "full_content": "House Democrats have launched an effort to bar President Donald Trump from unilaterally moving to \"invade or seize territory\" from Greenland, Canada and Panama.\n\nThe measure, known as the No Invading Allies Act and spearheaded by Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., bars funding from going toward the armed forces to engage in operations seeking to take over Greenland, Canada and Panama.\n\nMagaziner said Trump\u2019s \"reckless\" rhetoric about obtaining territory from the three countries makes the president untrustworthy with the war powers granted to him.\n\n\"Americans do not support sending troops unnecessary wars, especially with allies of the United States who pose no threat to our country,\" Magaziner said in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital. \"Unfortunately, President Trump has recklessly refused to rule out taking the territory of other nations by force. Under the Constitution it is Congress, not the President, who has the power to declare war. It is time for Congress to reclaim that constitutional power and ensure that the President adheres to the will of the American people.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital about Magaziner's measure.\n\nAnd while Trump has discussed acquiring territory from these countries, he has not suggested using military force to seize them or conduct an invasion.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nWhile the U.S. Constitution dictates that Congress has the authority to approve declaring an act of war, Congress last formally declared war in 1942, and modern presidents have entered conflicts without securing explicit or formal congressional approval, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nFurthermore, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the executive branch to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action and bars troops from remaining engaged for more than 60 days without congressional approval. However, the legislation does not define \"hostilities,\" and previous administrations have asserted their actions engaging military forces did not qualify as hostilities and, therefore, congressional approval was not required, according to the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers who have co-sponsored the measure include Reps. Eric Swallwell of California and Pramila Jayapal of Washington. The legislation has been referred to both the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees.\n\nTrump has discussed acquiring Greenland, Canada and Panama for months \u2014 and has regularly referred to Canada as the 51st state in the U.S. Additionally, Trump asserted in a joint address to Congress March 4 that the U.S. would reclaim the Panama Canal for security reasons and acquire Greenland.\n\n\"And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland,\" Trump said. \"We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nTrump has discussed the possibility of expanding American territory for months and said in a post in December 2024 on Truth Social that \"the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"\n\nGREENLAND, PANAMA FIERCELY REJECT TRUMP'S AMBITIONS IN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nMeanwhile, leaders from Greenland, which is a territory of Denmark, and Panama pushed back on Trump\u2019s comments to Congress.\n\n\"We do not want to be Americans, nor Danes, we are Kalaallit (Greenlanders),\" Greenland Prime Minister M\u00fate Egede said in a post on Facebook translated by Reuters. \"The Americans and their leader must understand that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,\" Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a Wednesday post on X.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have cast doubt on whether Trump would actually launch a military conflict against countries like Greenland. For example, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said in an interview with NBC in January that the U.S. would not \"invade another country.\"\n\n\"Quite frankly, the president\u2019s been very clear,\" Lankford said. \"He is the president that kept American troops out of war. He is not looking to be able to go start a war, to go expand American troops, but he does want to be able to protect America\u2019s national security, and part of that is our economic security and our future.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Caitlin McFall and Alex Nitzberg contributed to this report."

The four-part series airs on Sundays at 10pm ET/PT from March 9th - 30th.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk spent the weekend with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, getting a round-trip ride on Air Force One. While Musk has spent an increasing amount of time with Trump, three of his companies are having a rough go.\n\nHis X social media platform was down for much of the day Monday; Tesla shares plunged 15% and erased the last of their post-Election Day gains; and SpaceX continued to struggle with the aftermath of yet another rocket explosion.\n\nThat\u2019s taking a toll on Musk\u2019s fortune: He lost $29 billion in net worth on Monday alone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nMusk has ramped up his visibility in politics and government, leading the new Department of Government Efficiency in what fans call efforts to curtail government fraud and critics call an unelected takeover and slash-and-burn. Meanwhile, his companies have struggled.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Monday, Musk acknowledged that he runs his companies \u201cwith great difficulty\u201d while also working for the Trump administration.\n\nFor a proponent of \u201chardcore\u201d work up to 16 hours a day, the slump in his business interests points to a fundamental truth: No matter how in political favor their leadership, companies still need to be run \u2013 and preferably run well.\n\nThis a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d for Musk as Tesla\u2019s stock price tumbles, wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to clients Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMusk needs to step up as Tesla CEO at this critical juncture,\u201d Ives wrote. \u201cIn a nutshell the word \u201cbalance\u201d has been missing with Elon Musk and his ability to run Tesla as CEO\u2026.while instead focusing all of his energy and time driving his DOGE initiative within the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nTesla slumps\n\nThe market broadly slumped on Monday \u2013 but shares of Tesla fell even more sharply. The 15% drop in Tesla shares wiped out the last of any remaining gains since Election Day.\n\nIn a show of support, Trump said early Tuesday morning he would buy a Tesla.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is\u2019 \u2018putting it on the line\u2019 in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\u201d\n\nMusk thanked Trump in a post on X.\n\nWhen Trump won the US presidential election in November, many shareholders thought Musk\u2019s proximity to Trump would help the company by leading to looser regulations, currying favor with the White House and removing subsidies that had helped Tesla competitors.\n\nThe reality has been somewhat different.\n\nSales are dropping, especially in Europe, which some analysts say is a direct result of both competition in the marketplace and Musk\u2019s wading into politics both in the US and abroad.\n\nTesla vehicles and showrooms have also been the targets of protestors and, in some cases, violence. Earlier this month a Tesla charging station in Boston was set on fire, and someone shot at a Tesla dealership in Oregon. Individual Tesla owners are claiming on social media their cars have been targeted as well.\n\nMusk has responded by reposting supportive comments about Tesla and its cars and thanking people for their support. He\u2019s blamed liberal activists including mega donor George Soros for the attacks.\n\nTrump, in his Truth Social post Tuesday, claimed radical leftists were working to \u201cillegally and collusively boycott Tesla\u201d so they can \u201cattack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???\u201d Trump added.\n\nResponding to an X user posting about Tesla stock, Musk wrote: \u201cIt will be fine long-term.\u201d\n\nX goes down\n\nOn Monday, X was hit with a barrage of outages. Website DownDetector registered tens of thousands of reports that X was down.\n\nMusk claimed the outage was due to a cyberattack.\n\n\u201cThere was (still is) a massive cyberattack against X,\u201d he wrote on Monday afternoon. \u201cWe get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.\u201d\n\nHe later agreed with an X user who posted: \u201cthey want to silence you and this platform.\u201d\n\nEric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, told CNN that it\u2019s likely too early to tell if an attack caused the issues.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that should always be taken with a grain of salt is any statements made in the short period of time, immediately after, or even in this case during an attack,\u201d Noonan said.\n\nMusk spent $44 billion to take X, then known as Twitter, private in October 2022. Fidelity estimated last October that Musk had erased about 80% of the site\u2019s value since his purchase.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s exploding rockets\n\nThe first two launches of SpaceX\u2019s giant Starship rocket have blown up \u2013 most recently on Thursday. The debris from the explosions could be viewed for miles and even caused some flight disruptions.\n\nThe first explosion in January left debris scattered over Turks and Caicos.\n\nMusk brushed off the rocket mishaps, replying to a photo of himself looking at debris from one of SpaceX\u2019s multiple early rocket failures.\n\n\u201cToday was a minor setback,\u201d he wrote last week. \u201cProgress is measured by time. The next ship will be ready in 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Authority is still investigating the rockets\u2019 failures."

            "full_content": "Photo: Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThere is only one great question hanging over this deeply unlikely Democratic primary for mayor of New York City: Can Andrew Cuomo run out the clock?\n\nThe former governor, bursting into a union hall a little over a week ago, put to rest many months of speculation and upended a race that already hinged on the unpredictability of Eric Adams, the once-indicted and historically unpopular incumbent. Almost no one in New York politics believes Adams, who now carries a catastrophic approval rating of 20 percent, can win again. He is set to become the city\u2019s first one-term mayor in 30 years. More than a few politicos are settling into the reality that Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace a little over three years ago, might just overpower the field with his universal name recognition and deep executive experience \u2014 the sort that the electorate might be pining for after the chaos of the Adams years. Cuomo is expected to play it relatively safe, mostly avoiding a relentless and adversarial city press corps and letting his well-funded super-PAC bludgeon his rivals into submission.\n\nIt\u2019s still a long way between now and June 24. Every Democrat running in the race, Adams included, will have one sole focus: dragging Cuomo\u2019s poll numbers down. The various Cuomo antagonists \u2014 the operatives working on a significant anti-Cuomo PAC and the candidates themselves \u2014 believe there are vulnerabilities that can be exploited. There are the sexual-harassment scandals and the fact that Cuomo so aggressively battled back against the young women who accused him, dragging them through court. There\u2019s his fraught decadelong tenure as governor, which had both undeniable successes (the rehab of La Guardia Airport) and ugly failures (the Buffalo billion corruption). His stewardship of the pandemic, beginning with how his administration tabulated deaths at nursing homes and his decision to accept more than $5 million in 2020 to write a memoir, will come in for far greater scrutiny.\n\nWho can beat Cuomo is the easy enough rejoinder to anyone who points out his myriad flaws or the softness of his polling lead. No one, for now, comes very close. Brad Lander, the progressive city comptroller, is aiming to be the primary alternative to Cuomo and could find a way there with strong fundraising and a growing list of endorsers. His major challenge will be winning over voters beyond his affluent Brooklyn base, just as Scott Stringer, his predecessor, must try to corral support beyond the West Side of Manhattan, where he\u2019s still well known. Zellnor Myrie, a young Afro-Latino state senator from Brooklyn, might have a higher ceiling than either man (or socialist assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who came in a distant third to Cuomo in a recent Quinnipiac poll), but he\u2019s yet to break out from the pack. All four of these Democrats have qualified for millions in public matching funds, so they must be regarded as the serious contenders in what will be an expensive, nasty race.\n\nThe panic over the possible inability of Lander-Stringer-Myrie-Mamdani to stop Cuomo has prompted Adrienne Adams, the City Council Speaker, to enter the fray. A soft-spoken and well-regarded legislative leader (who is not related to the mayor), she has a base of middle-class Black supporters in southeast Queens who are reliable primary voters. Urged to run by attorney general Letitia James, who would have been a formidable candidate herself if she chose to run, Adrienne Adams could steadily rise if large labor unions coalesce around her and she\u2019s successful at netting media attention.\n\nHer major challenge is fundraising. She has a little more than $200,000 in her war chest and will have to play catch-up with the Democrats who\u2019ve already banked multiple millions and will be ready, before her, to build out large field operations and run television ads. Adrienne Adams probably should have been a candidate three or four months ago. Had she launched in the fall, she would have qualified for public matching funds by now and been on an inside track to win over a wide array of elected officials and unions. Instead, she\u2019ll be fighting for oxygen, and she\u2019ll need a clear message to distinguish herself from a large field training their fire on Cuomo. If she wins, she\u2019d be New York\u2019s first female mayor, and perhaps that history-making potential will excite some of the electorate.\n\nNo one quite knows how ranked-choice voting will impact the race, and it will be only the second mayoral primary with RCV. In 2021, Kathryn Garcia finished third among first-place votes and then, once all the choices were tabulated \u2014 New York Democrats can rank up to five candidates \u2014 Garcia surged, coming within 10,000 votes of defeating Eric Adams. The lesson was twofold: It still pays to finish first, since Adams did win, but it\u2019s very possible to rise if you\u2019re appealing to a broad range of people. There are several RCV Cuomo theories. One school of thought is that his superior name recognition will carry the day and he\u2019ll show up on many ballots in many different neighborhoods, whether it\u2019s in the Latino areas of the Bronx or the Black enclaves of Queens or Orthodox Jewish Brooklyn. There\u2019s a multiracial coalition for Cuomo to build that could be larger than the one Adams assembled in 2021.\n\nBut RCV can also punish polarizing candidates. Andrew Yang, the front-runner four years ago, was dropped from a lot of ballots. Progressives are floating a new slogan, DREAM (Don\u2019t Rank Eric or Andrew for Mayor), and it\u2019s easy enough to see such a movement take off in large swaths of left-leaning Brooklyn and Queens. If the Working Families Party wants to get serious about growing their influence in municipal politics again, they can fund a multimillion-dollar initiative focusing only on convincing voters to leave Cuomo off their ballots. As Election Day draws closer, the various non-Cuomo candidates could form alliances and cross-endorse. There\u2019s evidence that a last-minute Garcia-Yang cross-endorsement four years ago netted Garcia votes from Yang supporters and drew her closer to victory.\n\nWhat\u2019s been most intimidating is Cuomo\u2019s polling. His actual campaign rollout has been a bit pedestrian \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to tell, for now, what that truly means. His launch video was an unwieldy 17 minutes and was ruthlessly mocked online. His endorsement roster is still shallow for a vaunted front-runner, featuring only a handful of sitting elected officials and labor unions not known for swaying citywide primaries. It is possible that his roster could grow quickly if no one else seems to be gaining traction. Major unions like 32BJ SEIU, the building-workers union, and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council might close ranks around Cuomo, prompting other institutional forces to join him. He could very well be an unstoppable political battleship. We\u2019ll know in the spring whether he\u2019ll take on any water."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe California governor\u2019s race isn\u2019t waiting for former Vice President Kamala Harris to make up her mind whether she\u2019s going to run. Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who represented Orange County in the US House for three terms, announced Tuesday she\u2019s entering the race to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited from running again.\n\nPorter enters a field that already includes Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Senate Leader Toni Atkins and former state Controller Betty Yee. Last year, Porter finished a distant third in the state\u2019s top primary for an open US Senate seat that was ultimately won by Adam Schiff.\n\nPorter, a former law student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, often went viral for using calculations on a white board in congressional committee hearings\u2014and she has a white board as part of the background of her video announcement.\n\nThe thrust of Porter\u2019s announcement video is focused on national politics, featuring shots of President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson and former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Both her script and the imagery behind it reference a more open approach to immigration while fighting corruption, climate change and high costs.\n\n\u201cWhat California needs now is a little bit of hope and a whole lot of grit,\u201d Porter says. \u201cAs governor, I won\u2019t ever back down when Trump\u2019s hurting Californians.\u201d\n\nWith the long recovery and rebuilding ahead after the Los Angeles wildfires, Porter makes a specific reference to pushing for increased firefighter pay while in Congress. In a mark of a race that will likely be decided by which Democrat gets the most support, she also says she\u2019s committed to \u201cabortion rights, LGBTQ rights and immigrant rights,\u201d while saying she\u2019s against \u201cBig Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.\u201d\n\nNone of that may matter, though, if Harris decides to run \u2013 which people close to her have said would need to happen by the summer, so she could have time to make a full-fledged case for why she might want the job and not be seen as just going for a consolation prize after her presidential loss last year. Advisers and friends remain divided over whether they want her to try for the job in Sacramento next year or attempt another presidential run in 2028.\n\nPorter said in December that Harris entering would likely have a \u201cfield-clearing effect,\u201d and she is sticking by that even as she launches her run, which is why the former vice president and California senator isn\u2019t included in the numbers that her campaign is trying to tout. And though says she has a poll that has her in the best shape of \u201clikely\u201d Democratic candidates \u2013 her campaign\u2019s count of likely candidates notably doesn\u2019t include Harris.\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t run against Kamala,\u201d a Porter adviser told CNN, \u201cand likely none of the others will either.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Gerrit Cole has reason to be a little despondent. Photo: Brandon Sloter/Getty Images\n\nBecause the Yankees made it to the World Series last October, it\u2019s easy to forget that the team\u2019s fans were close to a full revolt before the 2024 season began. Sure, they had just acquired Juan Soto\u2019s services for a year. But in 2023, the Yankees had just gone 82-80, their worst record since 1992, and had missed the playoffs entirely. Manager Aaron Boone was heading into the final year of his contract; general manager Brian Cashman, who has astonishingly been with the team since 1986 (George Steinbrenner hired him as an intern after running into Cashman\u2019s dad at a horse-racing track), had more than worn out his welcome; the Yankees hadn\u2019t been to the World Series since their current starting shortstop was 8 years old. The natives were restless, and the villagers had their torches and pitchforks at the ready. Pick your metaphor: Fans were on the verge of hysteria.\n\nThen the Yankees went out and reached the World Series thanks largely to an all-world season from Aaron Judge, an almost-as-good year from Soto, and a surprisingly healthy rotation led by Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rod\u00f3n, and Rookie of the Year Luis Gil. Even with everything going just about perfectly, the team won only 94 games \u2014 that\u2019s as many as they won the year they (essentially) fired Joe Torre. They were fortunate to run into two middling American League Central teams in the postseason, but they did make it to the World Series. Yes, they lost to the Dodgers in not-all-that-competitive fashion, but this was still an achievement. Yankees fans did not descend on the Bronx with those pitchforks.\n\nNow, though, they just might.\n\nThe Yankees are still two weeks away from their first game of the 2025 season on Thursday, March 27. And while it\u2019s obviously very early, thus far they are experiencing exactly the opposite dynamic as last year: Everything is going wrong. Gil, the vaunted rookie breakthrough, will miss three months with a lat strain. Slugger Giancarlo Stanton, who was the ALCS MVP last season, has not swung a bat in more than a month because of elbow pain and may still need surgery at some point. Infielder DJ LeMahieu is hurt for the fifth straight year. And last weekend brought the nightmare of all nightmares: Ace Gerrit Cole, the Cy Young winner, the man making more money per season to pitch than anyone ever, reported elbow pain after a subpar Thursday-night spring-training start, receiving a worrying MRI, and is now having Tommy John surgery, which will force him to miss the rest of this season and probably most of the next. Other than Judge, there is no more important player to the Yankees than Cole, and now he\u2019s gone. As is Soto. As is Gil. As is Stanton. As is LeMahieu. Suddenly, the Yankees\u2019 World Series run last year looks less like a return to glory for the empire and more like a dead-cat bounce before the collapse really begins.\n\nThis injury explosion may not be Boone\u2019s or Cashman\u2019s fault directly, though you could make an argument that they seeded this turn of events by retaining so many players in their 30s. It\u2019s telling that after losing Soto, the Yankees spent some of the money they had earmarked for him on the sort of aging former stars who have perpetually gotten the team in trouble. Cody Bellinger (whom they received in a trade with the Cubs) and Paul Goldschmidt are former MVPs, but they are both many years removed from their prime; they don\u2019t add up to half of what the Yankees lost in Soto. The Yankees brought in left-handed starter Max Fried but for an exorbitant price: $218 million for eight years of another guy in his 30s who has thrown more than 175 innings in his career exactly once. (And missed most of 2023 with injury problems and hit the injured list last year as well.) Their only other reliable starter is Rod\u00f3n, notorious for being one of the most regularly injured pitchers in baseball. His track record is so spotty that his relative health in 2024 almost makes you more nervous for him in 2025, not less. The Yankees rotation, which was supposed to be a strength, is in tatters already. One more injury would be catastrophic.\n\nBut the Yankees lineup may be in even worse shape. It was already overly reliant on Judge last year, but with Soto (and Stanton and LeMahieu) gone, he\u2019s now essentially the entire offense. (The fifth-place hitter on this team is \u2026 Jazz Chisholm Jr.?) For all the fanfare about Bellinger and Goldschmidt, they were merely league-average hitters last year; now they\u2019re the only lineup protection Judge has. And here is the third rail of all Yankees talk: There is no assurance that Judge will stay as healthy as he has been the past few seasons. He played 157 games in 2022 and 158 in 2023, his two MVP seasons, but otherwise his career has been littered with injuries \u2014 112 games in 2018, 102 games in 2019, and 106 games in 2023, the last time the Yankees were as reliant on him as they are right now and, not coincidentally, the season in which they won only 82 games. Judge is a massive human being and will turn 33 next month, only two years younger than Stanton (his only real comparison by size), who has long since broken down. The Yankees have danced between the raindrops by avoiding Judge injuries the past few years. They are unlikely to remain so fortunate; it\u2019s only a matter of time. If Judge gets hurt? Forget returning to the World Series. The Yankees would be lucky to avoid last place, a fate they have endured only twice in the past 100 years.\n\nAll of this was avoidable. The Yankees have organizational problems that go beyond their penchant for signing aging stars: Their farm system is eroding, owner Hal Steinbrenner is seemingly more concerned with getting under MLB\u2019s luxury-tax line than winning that elusive 28th championship, and there\u2019s just a certain inertia that comes with a general manager being in the job as long as Cashman has. When the Mets and Steve Cohen outbid them for Soto this offseason \u2014 someone outbidding the Yankees! For one of their own guys! What is the world coming to? \u2014 it was about more than just taking away one of their best players. It was about smelling blood in the water, seeing a once-proud dynasty teetering on the edge of a cliff. The Yankees look as vulnerable right now as they have since \u2026 well, last March. And it sure seems as if Cashman and Boone \u2014 and, potentially, Steinbrenner himself \u2014 won\u2019t have a World Series appearance to bail them out this time. Any more bad news and this could get ugly fast, if it isn\u2019t already. Isn\u2019t spring training supposed to be the most hopeful time of the year?"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration is waging a war against the legal community in the United States with a target list growing by the day.\n\nThus far, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders that have targeted two law firms representing his perceived enemies, and his administration has attacked firms and law schools it says may be violating presidential initiatives against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nThe executive order Trump signed restricting Perkins Coie\u2019s access to classified information and federal buildings and thus hurting its ability to work for some clients is sending shockwaves through the legal establishment nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a president put out a specific order about a law firm,\u201d Ellen Podgor, a Stetson University law professor and legal ethicist, told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking away the ability of an attorney to act in their role as a lawyer,\u201d Podgor added. \u201cThe order to me is \u2026 depriving our whole right to counsel. This is a major amendment to our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s retaliation has been boldly a political response aimed at a group of lawyers and businesses that are known very little in public life outside of Washington. But the implications may be profound, with Trump\u2019s administration positioning itself in direct opposition to major institutions, using its power to quell the work of experienced and influential attorneys.\n\nThe moves also encroach on what the legal community views as a fundamental right for people needing lawyers to have the freedom to choose who represents them \u2014 an ability even Trump had as a criminal defendant being prosecuted by the Justice Department.\n\nThe executive order about Perkins Coie suspends the national security clearances of attorneys at the firm, because it was part of the effort to commission the now-infamous Russia dossier about Trump and his advisers during the 2016 election. The White House says it also may limit the firm\u2019s lawyers from visiting federal buildings and instructed agencies not to hire into government jobs employees from the firm.\n\nPerkins Coie sued on Tuesday, asking the federal court in Washington for emergency help to block Trump\u2019s order against it, and has enlisted another large private law firm to represent it.\n\nA White House aide said Thursday the administration plans to review other law firms\u2019 practices, saying there may be more retribution to come. Trump\u2019s order on Perkins Coie included a call for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review other \u201clarge, influential, or industry leading law firms\u201d in case they offer preferential hiring based on applicants\u2019 races.\n\nIn all, the steps the administration has taken have sent a \u201cchilling\u201d tone across the legal industry, said Cari Brunelle, the founder of a legal advisory firm that works with several large American law firms.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented in our country. \u2026 The message is: Watch where you step,\u201d she said.\n\nIn recent history, the closest comparison to the Trump White House blacklisting some in the legal industry is the approach then-President Richard Nixon took when he made an \u201cenemies list,\u201d Brunelle added.\n\nLaw firms in fear\n\nSo far, law firms have reacted out of fear, Brunelle said. Many want to avoid becoming a target, while others are looking at and rewriting what their websites say, especially regarding their diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which the administration says it is taking into consideration as it considers restricting more firms.\n\nOther lawyers\u2019 security clearances were stripped too in recent weeks by White House order, including those at Washington\u2019s largest private law firm, Covington & Burling, who have been involved in representing former special counsel Jack Smith, now a private citizen.\n\n\u201cAmerican law firms have always represented interests adverse to the US government, without worrying if there would be retribution or sanctions until now,\u201d Brunelle said. \u201cIt\u2019s created just an incredible amount of fear.\u201d (Brunelle\u2019s company doesn\u2019t have Perkins Coie or Covington & Burling as its clients.)\n\nBrunelle said there could be safety in numbers, if many large law firm leaders, law schools and others in the legal industry publicly criticized Trump\u2019s approach. But so far, the response has been muted from law firms themselves.\n\nMarc Elias, a lawyer to the Democrats who until 2021 was Perkins Coie\u2019s primary political law attorney, critiqued the lack of large law firms rallying behind those who lost security clearances in an email newsletter Monday. \u201cThat has not happened,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLaw schools and independent groups that represent the legal community have been bolder in pushing back.\n\nGeorgetown University Law Center responded, for instance, to a letter from the interim US attorney for Washington, DC, threatening not to hire its students if the school\u2019s curriculum wasn\u2019t in line with Trump\u2019s DEI policies.\n\nGraduates attend the Georgetown University Law Center commencement ceremony in Washington, DC, on May 19, 2024. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment, however, guarantees that the government cannot direct what Georgetown and its faculty teach and how to teach it,\u201d Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor wrote last week to Ed Martin.\n\nSeveral prominent national groups have called the Trump administration\u2019s actions hurtful to the rule of law in the US.\n\nThe American College of Trial Lawyers condemned recent statements from Trump\u2019s close adviser Elon Musk that called for the impeachment of some judges.\n\n\u201cWe call upon our Fellows and all lawyers, judges, legislators, executive officials, historians, political scientists, and citizens who value our democracy to speak out and condemn threats to impeach judges because of disagreement with the judge\u2019s lawful orders,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe elite, invitation-only group also responded to the executive orders retaliating against Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling by calling them \u201cescalating\u201d threats and an undermining of the justice system.\n\n\u201cLawyers throughout the country should unite in condemning these actions in the strongest possible terms,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe American Bar Association, a voluntary organization with a large number of America\u2019s lawyers as members, also has been deeply critical of the Trump administration\u2019s actions in recent weeks, with its president, William Bay, saying the approaches are an attack on the rule of law.\n\nThe group has been in the crosshairs of conservatives for years. The Federal Trade Commission last month banned its political appointees from taking leadership positions in the ABA or participating in its events, Bay pointed out. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, in a letter to staff in mid-February, called the group \u201cbeholden to the interests of Big Tech\u201d and a \u201cradical left-wing\u201d organization \u201cguided by the principles of the Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nIn a move with similar results, more than two dozen Justice Department employees who were set to speak at the ABA\u2019s White Collar conference in Miami canceled their plans to attend, the group\u2019s organizer, Raymond Banoun, told CNN.\n\nWhen the ethics panel spoke at the conference Friday, about some of the most political moves by the administration, there were essentially no Justice Department staffers there to hear them.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nAt two points in his autobiography, \"My Early Life,\" Winston Churchill pauses to reflect on political parties:\n\n\"It is not the slightest use defending government or parties unless you defend the very worst thing about which they are attacked.\"\n\nMuch later in his account of his first 25 years, after he had been elected to Parliament and a group of like-minded young MPs got opposite of a senior figure on his Party\u2019s Front Bench, Joe Chamberlain, they invited Chamberlain to dine. He accepted.\n\nTRUMP TEASES TARIFFS AGAINST MEXICO, CANADA MAY GO HIGHER IN THE FUTURE\n\n\"I am dining in very bad company,\" Chamberlain remarked as he entered. When the young MPs challenged him on what they thought to be a rotten policy, Chamberlain responded, \"What is the use of supporting your own government only when it is right? It is just when it is in this sort of pickle that you ought to have come to our aid.\"\n\nAfter a fine dinner, as Chamberlain took his leave, he paused at the door, \"You young gentlemen have entertained me royally, and in return I will give you a priceless secret. Tariffs! There are the politics of the future, and of the near future. Study them closely and make yourself a masters of them and you will not regret your hospitality to me.\"\n\nChurchill would bolt the Conservatives for the Liberals over protectionism in 1904. He would return to the Tories in 1924. \"Anyone can rat, but it takes a certain amount of ingenuity to re-rat,\" he would declare.\n\nChurchill \"ratted\" over his belief in free trade. He re-ratted because of national security. Let\u2019s skip the drama over tariffs and stay focused on defending the country and the Constitution. Give Trump the time (and the votes in Congress when he needs them) to enact what he ran on. Give the Party and its president a chance. Most Republicans from the Reagan-era have been \"Free Traders,\" just as most of the Lincoln-to-McKinley era Republicans were supporters of tariffs. Many have now settled on the \"tariffs-as-part-of-national-security-good, tariffs as revenue producers bad.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe president of Hillsdale College, Dr. Larry Arnn, likes to say \"The Natural Law does not speak to me on tariffs,\" and in that quip is great wisdom. I leave the field to others, save for full-throated backing of tariffs on the critical goods necessary to the country\u2019s security and health which should be made here in whole or large part, but the supply chains for which are in the People\u2019s Republic of China in shop or critical part. To depend upon the only other superpower for our national security is nuts. President Trump wants to lay on 20% of such goods coming to the U.S. from China? Fine by me, and yes, I know some Americans will pay a price such ad many farmers who sell their products to the vast China market.\n\nI don\u2019t get tariffs on Canada. I do on Mexico. Fentanyl is flowing into the U.S. because of the cartels. The drugs kills tens of thousands of Americans every year. Mexico doesn\u2019t want us striking at cartel operations? Fine. Crush them yourselves, but crush them.\n\nWhich brings us round-a-bout to the big \"Continuing Resolution\" Speaker Johnson unveiled and President Trump endorsed this past weekend.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBravo. I don\u2019t know what is in the 99-page bill save for the beginning of a defense build-up, but it will allow the government to stay open while Trump and the GOP figure out the budget and reconciliation package(s) \u2014there can be one or two. I am in favor of whatever the GOP passes just as I will support the president\u2019s approaches on trade and peace negotiations at least for year one.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a party man. Always have been. Always will be. Parties are the only way to advance political agendas and, in this era, the Republican Party is the only way to protect the Constitution as the Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court and crush the rule of law in the process of doing so. So, yes, join the GOP if you like a free and prospering USA. Don\u2019t like tariffs, or CRs, or pressure on Ukraine? That\u2019s not the point. Trump won, leads the GOP and he is doing exactly what he promised to do.\n\nHugh Hewitt is host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

            "full_content": "Greenlanders will head to the polls to vote in their country\u2019s parliamentary election on Tuesday, in what will likely prove to be a historic vote not because of any seismic shifts within the nation but because of the geopolitical message it will send.\n\nIndependence from Denmark is not on the ballot itself, but who is elected to Greenland\u2019s parliament will signal how the country could move forward in not only divorcing itself from Copenhagen, but in handling what some critics have perceived as threats issued by President Donald Trump.\n\nParliamentary elections on the world\u2019s largest island, a nation of less than 60,000 people, have previously picked up scant coverage due to their relatively low impact on world affairs.\n\nTRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nBut all that changed in January when, ahead of his inauguration, Trump refused to rule out the possibility of \"acquiring\" Greenland through economic or military means and has since repeated his interest in the strategically important island.\n\nWhile the majority of Greenlanders support independence from Denmark, they also align in their opposition to Trump\u2019s ambitions for the island nation.\n\nThere is not a single lawmaker in Greenland that ran for election in this cycle on becoming a part of the U.S., but the leading opposition party known as Naleraq, which currently holds just five of the 31 seats in Greenland\u2019s parliament, may have a solution to achieve independence while also appealing to Trump\u2019s interests.\n\nQupanuk Olsen, a 39-year-old running under the Naleraq party who has garnered a massive social media presence with over a million followers spread over Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, shared a video in January where she addressed questions regarding her opinion on the matter.\n\nWithout directly noting her position on Trump\u2019s ambitions, as she said she wants to keep her social media presence as \"A-political as possible,\" she emphasized her support for expanding Greenland\u2019s partnerships.\n\n\"I strongly believe in Greenland\u2019s independence,\" she went on to say, \"To achieve this we must expand our collaborations and establish business relationships with countries beyond Denmark.\n\n\"We Greenlanders, Kalaallit, deserve to be independent,\" she continued in reference to the Greenlandic Inuit ethnic group. \"And I hope we will strengthen our connections with our fellow Inuit in Canada and Alaska significantly more in the near future.\"\n\nGREENLAND, PANAMA FIERCELY REJECT TRUMP'S AMBITIONS IN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nThough Greenland won self-rule in 1979, with Denmark continuing to oversee issues relating to defense and foreign policy, the Naleraq party has pushed for a swift transition to complete independence.\n\nThe leading opposition party has argued this could be achieved by bolstering existing business opportunities like its fishing industry, as well as by establishing defensive agreements with nations like the U.S., in which it would allow Washington to continue to operate its military interests from the island in exchange for security assurances without becoming a U.S. territory.\n\nThough it remains unclear if such a deal would win over Trump, who could be viewing the Artic nation as an untapped opportunity for its rare earth minerals and oil and gas reserves \u2013 which Greenland has blocked even the EU from accessing.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions over whether expanding ties with Greenland would appease Trump\u2019s ambitions, though on Sunday Trump reiterated his position on the island nation.\n\n\"As I made clear during my Joint Address to Congress, the United States strongly supports the people of Greenland\u2019s right to determine their own future,\" he said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"We will continue to keep you safe, as we have since World War II.\"\n\nTHE HISTORIC IMPORTANCE OF GREENLAND FOR US NATIONAL SECURITY AS DEBATE OVER ISLAND'S FUTURE ROARS ON\n\n\"We are ready to invest billions of dollars to create new jobs and make you rich \u2013 And, if you so choose, we welcome you to be a part of the Greatest Nation anywhere in the World, the United States of America,\" he added.\n\nTrump drew rebuke in some quarters following his address to Congress, where his tone on Greenland was softer than previous remarks, but he concluded by saying, \"One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"\n\nAccording to a January poll, some 85% of Greenlanders oppose Trump\u2019s push to make Greenland a part of the U.S., including Prime Minister Mute Egede, who has been not only a huge proponent of independence from Denmark, but who has also been staunchly opposed to Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland.\n\nEgede\u2019s Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which currently holds 11 seats, is expected to pick up an even greater majority following the Tuesday election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEgede, who has repeatedly told the U.S. president that Greenland is \"not for sale,\" on Monday said Trump\u2019s unpredictability was sowing international chaos.\n\n\"The things that are happening in the world right now worry me quite a lot,\" Egede told Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR). \"There is a world order that is faltering on many fronts, and perhaps a president in the United States who is very unpredictable in a way that makes people feel insecure.\""

            "full_content": "Most people think of government workers as part of a faceless bureaucracy with cushy and clearly useless jobs.\n\nNow it\u2019s true that the federal workforce is bloated and needs to be trimmed. But the politics of Elon Musk\u2019s mass firings are shifting, prompting President Trump to soften his approach to the DOGE campaign.\n\nA major factor in this evolution is the negative media coverage, which Trump follows with great interest. It\u2019s no accident that he said the other day the budget cutbacks should be done with a \"scalpel\" and not a \"sledgehammer.\" He\u2019s acutely attuned to the growing backlash against the massive layoffs\u2013which include 80,000 at Veterans Affairs.\n\nMany of the stories, on television and in print, follow a formula: Lead off with one person who has been booted or negatively impacted by the Musk bros. That puts a face to the story, an actual saddened person whose life has been upended.\n\nConsider this New York Times piece:\n\n\"At the Veterans Affairs hospital in Pittsburgh, researchers spent months preparing for a clinical trial of a new drug to treat advanced cancers of the mouth, throat and voice box.\n\nLATEST TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL SHIFT POWER OVER MANAGING NATURAL DISASTERS OUT OF DC\n\n\"They were ready last month to start enrolling patients \u2014 veterans whose cancer had spread to other tissue and who had run out of treatment options.\n\nThen a problem arose.\n\n\"The hospital was unable to renew the job of a key staff member involved in running the study, a typically routine process thwarted by a hiring freeze imposed under the government-cutting project led by President Trump and Elon Musk. Suddenly, the clinical trial was on hold.\n\n\"\u2018They were ready to enroll,\u2019 said Alanna Caffas, the chief executive of the Veterans Health Foundation, which administers the trials. \u2018They had the lab kits on site. They had the drug to dispense. But they couldn\u2019t get the clinical research coordinator renewed.\u2019\"\n\nHere\u2019s a Washington Post report from Texas:\n\n\"Jaylee Williams needed to find somewhere to deliver her son.\n\nThe 19-year-old knew more about barrel racing on her horse Bet-n-pep than the complicated metrics of who takes what health insurance. But relief for Williams and her boyfriend, Xander Lopez, came when they realized Medina Regional Hospital \u2014 just 15 minutes from their home \u2014 accepted Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers medical costs for lower-income Americans. \"Provider groups an hour away in San Antonio had refused to take the insurance, she recalled while cradling little Ryker. \u2018You never know when something could happen,\u2019 Williams said, with Lopez adding, \u2018I have no idea where we would have gone\u2019 without Medina Regional Hospital.\n\nBut the lifeline that the 25-bed critical-access hospital offered to Williams and Lopez could disappear in Hondo and other communities like it.\"\n\nThat\u2019s because rural hospitals are fearing \"massive Medicaid cuts,\" since they\u2019re so dependent on the federal-state program. Trump says he will not allow cuts to Medicaid, as well as Medicare and Social Security, but that would be the only way Republicans could save a promised $80 billion. Some 72 million people are on Medicaid.\n\nIn the Atlantic, Jonathan Lemire says Trump\u2019s shift on DOGE began on Feb. 19.\n\n\"Jesse Watters, a co-host of the Fox News hit show \u2018The Five\u2019...told a surprisingly emotional story about a friend working at the Pentagon who was poised to lose his job as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. \u2018I finally found one person I knew who got DOGE\u2019d, and it hit me in the heart,\u2019 said Watters, who urged his Fox colleagues to \u2018be a little bit less callous.\u2019...\n\n\"Trump watched the clip and asked advisers if it was resonating with his base of supporters, according to one of three White House officials I spoke with for this story.\"\n\nLemire adds that \"over the ensuing weeks, the president grew unhappy with the television coverage of cuts affecting his voters, according to two of those officials, while the White House fielded calls from Cabinet members and Republican lawmakers frustrated by Elon Musk.\"\n\nMUSK VOWS TO TRACE HACKERS BEHIND 'MASSIVE CYBERATTACK' CRIPPLING X SOCIAL MEDIA SITE\n\nTrump decreed that agency heads should make the layoffs and cutbacks, and Musk should step in only if they fail to take action. The move also may be aimed at the various lawsuits against Trump, since Musk is only supposed to be an adviser and not a government employee.\n\nTensions have been rising behind the scenes (as well as publicly at town hall meetings, to the point that the GOP urged its members to stop holding the events). As the Times reports:\n\n\"Marco Rubio was incensed. Here he was in the Cabinet Room of the White House, the Secretary of State, seated beside the president and listening to a litany of attacks from the richest man in the world.\n\nSeated diagonally opposite, across the elliptical mahogany table, Elon Musk was letting Mr. Rubio have it, accusing him of failing to slash his staff.\n\nYou have fired \u2018nobody,\u2019 Mr. Musk told Mr. Rubio, then scornfully added that perhaps the only person he had fired was a staff member from Mr. Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubio\u2019s control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting on Thursday in front of President Trump and around 20 others \u2014 details of which have not been reported before \u2014 Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest.\n\nMr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement in buyouts? Didn\u2019t they count as layoffs? He asked, sarcastically, whether Mr. Musk wanted him to rehire all those people just so he could make a show of firing them again. Then he laid out his detailed plans for reorganizing the State Department.\n\n\"Mr. Musk was unimpressed. He told Mr. Rubio he was \u2018good on TV,\u2019 with the clear subtext being that he was not good for much else.\"\n\nThe president, who eventually defended Musk, has denied that such a confrontation took place. \"ELON AND MARCO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. ANY STATEMENT OTHER THAN THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!!\" he posted.\n\nAnother source of conflict involves Steve Bannon, the former campaign chief and White House official whose \"War Room\" podcast is hugely influential with the MAGA crowd.\n\n\"In mid-February,\" says a story co-authored by Maggie Haberman, \"the president told Mr. Bannon that he wanted him to lay off the attacks on Mr. Musk and for the two men to sit down privately, according to two people familiar with the comments.\"\n\nBannon has, among other things, called Musk a \"parasitic illegal immigrant\" and \"truly evil person.\" Bannon said last month that he and Musk \"have a chasm that is probably insurmountable.\"\n\nMusk has fired back on the X platform he has transformed: \"Bannon is a great talker, but not a great doer. What did he get done this week? Nothing.\"\n\nAOC VOWS TO TURN UP THE HEAT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH RALLIES ON HIS HOME TURF\n\nThe proposed meeting hasn\u2019t taken place, and may never happen.\n\nMore important than the backstage sniping is Trump\u2019s softening on the DOGE crusade as the human toll becomes clear.\n\nOne thing Trump hasn\u2019t talked about, and this is directly related to his tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, is the stock market, with the Dow plunging thousands of points in recent days.\n\nThe president told Fox\u2019s Maria Bartiromo that you can\u2019t look at the stock market, though he loves to boast about it when it\u2019s going up.\n\nOn her Sunday show, Bartiromo asked Trump if he expected a recession this year.\n\n\"I hate to predict things like that,\" he said. \"There is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big.\"\n\nIn journalese, this became TRUMP REFUSES TO RULE OUT RECESSION, though all he did was dodge the question. (But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on \"Meet the Press\" that \"there\u2019s going to be no recession in America.\")\n\nThe DOGE reputation has also been tarnished by an appalling series of mistakes. Musk has acknowledged firing the Ebola prevention team and having to hire them back. He also ousted bird flu experts and those responsible for maintenance of nuclear weapons, and had to hire them back.\n\nAnd the Musk gang has been caught claiming savings by ending contracts that actually expired years ago.\n\nWould this track record be deemed acceptable in the private sector?\n\nTesla stock, meanwhile, has been plummeting for days, along with the market, including a 16 percent drop yesterday. Musk\u2019s net worth has sunk by $121 billion since mid-December, according to Forbes. But fear not, he\u2019s still the world\u2019s richest man.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen X suffered a global outage for hours yesterday, it seemed like a metaphor for Elon Musk\u2019s woes. He later said the site once called Twitter had been hit by a \"massive cyberattack.\"\n\nSlashing government jobs, with identifiable victims, just isn\u2019t the same as laying off software engineers, and the backlash was inevitable. That\u2019s why Donald Trump is tapping the brakes on the entire effort."

(AP Photo/Dylan Lovan)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- With a new distillery set to open soon, the makers of Brough Brothers bourbon in Kentucky were ready to put their business plan into action. They were looking to ramp up whiskey production to break into lucrative new markets in Canada and Europe.\n\nNow the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs has disrupted those plans.\n\nEfforts by the Black-owned distiller to gain a foothold in Canada are on hold, as are plans to break into Germany and France, said Brough Brothers Distillery CEO Victor Yarbrough. That's because the iconic American spirit's widening global appeal is caught in the crossfire of trade conflicts instigated by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d said Yarbrough, who started the Louisville distilling company with his brothers, Bryson and Chris. \u201cWe are collateral damage.\u201d\n\nFor distillers looking to sell to consumers of all political stripes, talking politics can be as distasteful as discussing Prohibition. But along with the turmoil and uncertainty over tariffs, bourbon makers and other U.S. firms trying to do business in Canada are confronting public relations challenges still reverberating from the president's blunt-force \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to international relations.\n\nWith Canadian hockey fans booing the U.S. national anthem and some liquor stores north of the border clearing American spirits from their shelves even before there\u2019s clarity over tariffs, businesses like Brough Brothers are watching to see how the trade conflict plays out.\n\nIn the building being converted into the new distillery near the Ohio River, drywall dust covers the floor of the project that the brothers hope will raise the company's profile in the ultra-competitive bourbon world.\n\n\u201cI believe there\u2019s going to be some type of repair of the relationships that needs to happen,\" said Yarbrough, who was hoping, before the trade war erupted, to introduce his bourbon in New Brunswick and later expand to Ontario and other parts of Canada. \"So I think some type of media blitz, PR blitz is definitely going to have to take place.\u201d\n\nThe trade wars pose an immediate threat to an American-made success story, built on the growing worldwide taste for bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and other products.\n\nKentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said the president's zig-zagging tariff policy is hurting the American economy and will lead to higher consumer prices while disrupting business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the imposition of tariffs, it\u2019s this month-to-month, \u2018I may do it to you at any moment\u2019 policy,\u201d said Beshear, a potential presidential candidate in 2028. \u201cYou can't create stability.\u201d\n\nTrump on Thursday postponed 25% tariffs on some imports from Canada for a month amid fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. Yarbrough said his company's expansion plans are still in limbo.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change our situation,\" he said. \u201cJust as quickly as it changed to a reprieve, it could just as quickly turn into next month that we\u2019re back on.\u201d\n\nFor an industry that has to plan well into the future, based on aging its whiskey products, such angst is widespread in Kentucky, which produces 95% of the world's bourbon supply. At this point even a delay in tariffs wouldn't alleviate the practical problems confronting U.S. whiskey makers.\n\n\u201cThe issue for us is long-term planning, and a postponement does nothing for us in long-term planning except leaves it still up in the air,\" said Judy Hollis Jones, president and CEO of Buzzard's Roost in Louisville, which sells to two provinces in Canada and has been looking to expand.\n\n\u201cMaybe other people adapt to it easier than I do, but I tend to like some certainty,\" Jones said.\n\nThe Kentucky Distillers' Association says the newest trade conflicts feel like deja vu. The industry group has long sounded the alarm that tariffs and retaliatory levies would wreak havoc on the spirits industry. Along with the North American trade dispute, the European Union is set to reinstate a tariff by April 1 on American whiskey if nothing is done to head it off.\n\nThat trans-Atlantic dispute is a reprise of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on European steel and aluminum. The EU\u2019s retaliatory tariff caused American whiskey exports to the EU to plunge 20%, costing distillers more than $100 million in revenue from 2018 to 2021, the Distilled Spirits Council says. Once the tariff was suspended, EU sales rebounded for American distillers.\n\nNow, Europe's infatuation with Kentucky bourbon and other U.S. spirits is threatened by the potential 50% tariff \u2014 double the previous levy \u2014 that would inflict \"irreparable harm to distillers large and small,\u201d said Chris Swonger, the council\u2019s CEO.\n\nTariffs amount to a tax, which whiskey producers can either absorb in reduced profits or pass along to customers through higher prices \u2014 and risk losing market share in highly competitive markets. In 2024, the EU was by far the largest export market for U.S. distilled spirits, followed by Canada, the council said.\n\nTrump maintains that open trade has cost the U.S. millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to American-made prosperity.\n\nLarge distillers possess the capital and market reach to ride out disruptions caused by tariffs \u2014 built-in luxuries that most small producers don't have.\n\nCanada accounts for just 1% of total sales for Brown-Forman Corp., the maker of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and the Louisville-based company could withstand disruptions there, said its CEO, Lawson Whiting.\n\nBut Whiting said the decision by Canadian provinces to take American products off store shelves is \u201cworse than a tariff because it\u2019s literally taking your sales away.\u201d He called it \u201ca very disproportionate response to a 25% tariff.\u201d\n\nThe threat of a prolonged trade war has Brough Brothers exploring other options. They could lean harder into domestic sales or look for other markets overseas \u2014 but again, it's hard to plan.\n\n\u201cTalking about this is starting to make my head hurt,\u201d Yarbrough said.\n\nFor Tom Bard, another Kentucky craft distiller, the risk is that all his hard work to gain a foothold in Canada could evaporate due to the cross-border trade conflict.\n\nBard and his wife, Kim, own The Bard Distillery in Muhlenberg County in western Kentucky. Their products had penetrated British Columbia and Alberta, but a new purchase order for north of the border is on hold amid Trump's ever-changing trade war.\n\n\u201cThat hurts,\u201d Bard said. \u201cFor a small distillery like us, where every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference, that\u2019s huge for us.\u201d\n\nBard said his team invested heavily to break into Canada, where business grew so quickly that he had hoped it would account for at least 25% of his overall sales this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to ship as much of it as we can to Canada,\u201d Bard said. \u201cWe just expanded our distillery to take advantage of all the global demand for our products. What we hate is that once we get this equipment online this year, that we won\u2019t be able to run it full throttle because we\u2019ll be afraid to put too much inventory away not knowing what\u2019s going to happen.\"\n\nThe dispute needs to be resolved before Canadian distributors will risk accepting shipments of American spirits, he said.\n\nBard plans to ramp up domestic distribution to try to make up for lost sales in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re small-business Americans, so we\u2019re going to make it work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be nice to not have these roadblocks.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\n\nA woman reads her ballot during an early voting for Greenlandic parliamentary elections at the city hall in Nuuk, Greenland, Monday, March 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\n\nNUUK, Greenland -- The single polling station in Greenland \u2019s capital city is ready.\n\nThis big Arctic island with a tiny population holds early parliamentary elections Tuesday that are being closely watched. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear he wants to take control of the region that occupies a strategic North Atlantic location and contains rare earth minerals key to driving the global economy.\n\nTrump\u2019s overtures aren\u2019t on the ballot, but they are on everyone\u2019s minds.\n\nThis self-governing region of Denmark is home to 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds. It has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009. Now, Greenlanders are debating the best way to ensure they control their future.\n\n\u201cI think most of us have been scared since the new year because of (Trump\u2019s) interest,\u201d Pipaluk Lynge, a member of parliament from the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit, or United Inuit party, told The Associated Press. \u201cSo we\u2019re really, really looking to Europe right now to see if we could establish a stronger bond with them to secure our sovereign nation.\u201d\n\nOpinion polls show most Greenlanders favor independence.\n\nMost say they don\u2019t dislike Americans, pointing to the good relations they have with the local Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, where U.S. military personnel have been stationed since 1951.\n\nBut Greenlanders show no sign of wanting to become Americans. Even some of Trump\u2019s biggest fans cling to the principle that they should control their destiny. That includes Gerth Josefsen, a 53-year-old fisherman from Nuuk who sports a MAGA hat and is proud to have visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida home.\n\nTheir mantra is that Greenland is open for business, but not for sale.\n\n\u201cThe situation has changed because of Trump and because of the world,\u201d said Doris Jensen, representative of the social democratic Siumut party who said she has always favored independence, \u201cSo we have decided in our party that we have to do (it) more quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attention has transformed the deeply local process of democracy. Suddenly, the presence of journalists from as far away as Japan and Croatia are reminders that these are far from normal times.\n\nAfter candidates\u2019 final televised debate at a school auditorium in Nuuk, Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede was greeted by about 75 supporters who were almost outnumbered by photographers and cameramen.\n\n\u201cAll these reporters are frightening to us,\u2019\u2019 said Aviaja Sinkbaek, who works at the school. \u201cIt means that something must be happening soon.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI wonder what Trump has up his sleeve.\u201d\n\nPolitics in Greenland have a different rhythm. Debates during campaigning rarely got heated. People who became too animated were asked to step outside. Issues included building a skilled workforce and how to decorate the new airport, which opened a runway long enough to handle jumbo jets in November.\n\nOn Tuesday, the capital\u2019s lone polling station at the Nuuk sports hall will have political parties pitching tents outside, with campaigners offering hot drinks and Greenlandic cake -- a raisin-laced bread served with butter -- in hopes of swaying voters.\n\nA bus will circle the city of about 20,000 people, offering rides.\n\nUnofficial election results should be available soon after polls close, but they won\u2019t be certified for weeks as ballot papers make their way to the capital from remote settlements by boat, plane and helicopter.\n\nThat\u2019s because there are no roads connecting communities across the island\u2019s 2.16 million square kilometers (836,330 square miles), which make Greenland the world\u2019s 12th biggest country.\n\nNow the vast size has drawn outsize attention.\n\nGreenlanders know what they have. They hope the rare earth minerals will help diversify an economy where government jobs account for 40% of employment.\n\nBut the government has imposed strict rules to protect the environment on the island, most of which is covered by ice year-round. The harsh atmospheric conditions raise questions about whether extracting them is commercially feasible.\n\nHurricane-strength gusts over the weekend triggered warnings for boats and building materials to be securely tied down. As the wind howled like a revving jet engine, local people retreated to their homes to play board games."

InfoWars founder Alex Jones called White a \u201cone-of-a-kind man who poured his devotion into anything he did.\u201d\n\nShortly before Midnight on Sunday, Austin police officers responded to a \u201cshoot/stab hotshot\u201d call at an apartment complex in the 2300 block of Douglas Street. Responding officers found a male in the parking lot with \u201cobvious signs of trauma,\u201d KXAN NBC reported. EMS crews transported the man to a local hospital, where he died a short time later from his wounds.\n\nAustin Detective Leah Ratliff told reporters that officers attempted to save the man\u2019s life but he died at 12.19 a.m on Monday. She said it was unclear what kind of injuries caused his death. Police are investigating the death as the city\u2019s eighth homicide of the year.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, InfoWars founder Alex Jones identified the slain man as his reporter, Jamie White. \u201cJamie was a light we were blessed to experience as much as we did,\u201d Jones said while announcing the news. \u201cHe\u2019s a one-of-a-kind man who poured his devotion into anything he did.\u201d\n\nJones blamed White\u2019s murder, in part, on the policies of \u201cSoros Austin, TX D.A. Jose Garza.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pledge that Jamie\u2019s tragic death will not be in vain, and those responsible for this senseless violence will be brought to justice,\u201d Jones stated. He pledged to carry on \u201cJamie\u2019s important work.\u201d\n\nMediaite quoted more from Jones broadcast announcing White\u2019s death:\n\nWe sent some people over this morning when he didn\u2019t answer the phone because he\u2019s always here early, loves to work, loves to fight tyranny, loves to promote freedom, and when they got to the apartment complex there was yellow tape everywhere, blood all over the parking lot. Jones continued, \u201cI\u2019m gonna talk about in a moment who I hold responsible for this, and who is responsible for this, and who are accomplices to Jamie and so many others\u2019 murder,\u201d before describing Garza \u2013 whose campaign for district attorney was funded by billionaire Democratic Party donor George Soros \u2013 as \u201ceven worse than Alvin Bragg\u201d and \u201cprobably the worst in the country.\u201d\n\nJones said police told InfoWars that they have some suspects. \u201cI\u2019m gonna leave it at that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to tell us whether it was a stabbing or a shooting. I can just tell you that from the amount of blood I heard, it was serious. They were there scrubbing his blood off the ground when our folks got there.\u201d\n\nAs a reporter for InfoWars, White covered politics, entertainment, and current affairs, TimesNowNews reported.\n\nTimesNowNews reported:\n\nWhite covered many politically charged topics for InfoWars, including international affairs and high-profile controversies. One of his notable articles reported on Romania\u2019s ban on presidential candidate C\u0103lin Georgescu, which led to widespread protests. Another focused on Glenn Beck\u2019s claim that the Epstein client list would be released if Kash Patel became FBI Director. Beyond InfoWars, White\u2019s work also appeared on platforms like Scribd and TRANSCEND.\n\nA motive for the murder has not been released at this time."

Gavin Newsom for a conversation on his new podcast that defied expectations, covering a wide range of topics \u2014 from the state of San Francisco to the future of the Democratic Party \u2014 offering sharp disagreements but also moments of surprising common ground.\n\nAn exclusive sneak peek provided to Breitbart News in advance offers a glimpse into the soon-to-be-released interview where Savage takes the seat as the second guest on the governor\u2019s This Is Gavin Newsom podcast, where no topic appears to be off-limits.\n\nPolitical Divides and JFK\u2019s Influence\n\nDespite their ideological differences, the iconic right-wing commentator and Democratic California governor acknowledged their decades-long acquaintance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other over the course on and off for a couple decades now, right?\u201d Newsom remarked.\n\nSavage, in turn, reflected on how John F. Kennedy inspired him as a young man.\n\n\u201cI loved JFK. He was one of my heroes \u2026 \u2018Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country\u2019 \u2014 that put steel in my spine; I wanted to go out and march into something for my country,\u201d Savage recalled, as they criticized modern politics for losing that sense of responsibility.\n\nBorders, Language, and Culture\n\nReasserting his long-standing mantra, \u201cBorders, language, culture,\u201d Savage \u2014 citing historical examples \u2014 argued that without these, a nation ceases to exist. Newsom countered, touting California\u2019s efforts to support border enforcement, claiming he deployed nearly 400 National Guard members to supplement border security.\n\n\u201cWe put down almost 400 \u2026 National Guards since the week I first became governor to supplement and support Customs and Border Patrol at the border,\u201d he stated.\n\nHowever, Savage actually voiced support for long-term undocumented workers, saying, \u201cI know of a person who was here 20 years from Mexico. He\u2019s worked seven days a week, he\u2019s paid taxes, he can\u2019t become a citizen. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nNewsom agreed, adding that \u201c67 percent of people that are here without documentation in California have been here for ten-plus years \u2026 and paying taxes.\u201d\n\nHealth and Nutrition\n\nTurning to Savage\u2019s background in nutritional ethnomedicine, Savage detailed his academic journey.\n\n\u201cI earned [my PhD] in two years and seven months, which is a world record,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe also criticized what he saw as discrimination in academia: \u201cI was rejected from every position I applied for. And I was told point blank \u2014 we can\u2019t hire you because we have to fill quotas.\u201d\n\nSavage lamented the state of the healthcare system, sharing a personal story of being delayed in a hospital ER while suffering a heart attack.\n\n\u201cI have to wait in line. It\u2019s filled with illegal aliens, and the girl at the desk makes me wait,\u201d he stated. \u201cI said [to her], \u2018I\u2019m dying, do you understand?\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsom responded by defending California\u2019s approach, emphasizing preventative care.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we do preventative care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have a different approach.\u201d\n\nClimate Change and Science\n\nSavage dismissed mainstream climate concerns as \u201ctotal bullshit,\u201d citing the Vostok ice core samples.\n\n\u201cThere were carbon dioxide increases millennia ago, but they always followed temperature increases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t cause the temperature increases.\u201d\n\nNewsom countered by pointing to extreme weather patterns, saying, \u201cWe had a three-year historic drought \u2014 the most significant drought in California\u2019s history since statehood \u2014 and it ended in three weeks with the wettest three weeks since statehood.\u201d\n\nHowever, Savage remained skeptical, insisting that climate change has always occurred naturally.\n\n\u201cIn 1872, it was so hot in the state of California before there was the first internal combustion engine, the cornfields exploded in the Sacramento Valley from a heat wave,\u201d he stated.\n\nCrime and San Francisco\u2019s Decline\n\nSavage described a turning point for his relationship with San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI was having dinner in North Beach, and a man comes by \u2014 if you want to call him that \u2014 takes his pants down and defecates outside the window in the street,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwithout civility, there could be no civil order in a country.\u201d\n\nNewsom acknowledged the crisis but defended the city\u2019s efforts, saying, \u201cThe homeless population \u2026 it\u2019s not a static environment \u2026 It\u2019s been decades.\u201d\n\nHowever, Savage argued for a more forceful approach, offering his own \u201csolution\u201d to the issue.\n\n\u201cYou build camps for them in places outside cities and you give them the care that they need \u2014 against their will,\u201d he suggested.\n\nNewsom countered that California was already addressing this issue, citing recent reforms, including having \u201cstrengthened the conservatorship law so we can begin to get people off the streets.\u201d\n\nThe Future of the Democratic Party\n\nAsked what the Democratic Party needed to learn from recent political shifts, Savage pointed to what he saw as the party\u2019s alienation of working-class voters.\n\n\u201cThe thing that triggered most of the people who turned against the Democrat party was this incessant drumbeat, going back years, vilifying the white male,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018White supremacy,\u2019 \u2018white supremacy,\u2019 \u2018white supremacy.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also cited the influence of gender ideology in schools as a turning point.\n\n\u201cThe trans issue triggered the women who were normally liberal,\u201d Savage said. \u201cBut when you have kids being brainwashed in school to accept that stuff into kindergarten \u2014 hey, I\u2019m a sexual libertarian, I really don\u2019t care what people do to make themselves happy \u2014 but leave the kids alone.\u201d\n\nTrump and Savage\u2019s Influence\n\nSavage claimed that many of President Donald Trump\u2019s key talking points were inspired by his own work, with one of Trump\u2019s advisers \u201cexplicitly telling me: \u2018We took all of your books [and] we made talking points. He ran on your platform.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalling himself \u201cthe father of a lot of what [Trump\u2019s] doing,\u201d he expressed frustration at not being formally recognized for his influence, saying, \u201cNo one called me from the White House and said, \u2018We want to give you the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe conversation was marked with mutual respect, despite the sharp debates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with you, nor you with me, for us to sit and have civilized conversations,\u201d Savage noted. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to solve the problems of the state and of the country\u2019s rights, and I feel the same thing about the country itself: the left and the right are at each other\u2019s throats. They hate each other, and they would like me not to have been on this podcast and be screaming and yelling like a foaming idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get nowhere with that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s idiotic, idiotic.\u201d\n\nNewsom agreed, adding that that is \u201cthe whole point\u201d of these discussions.\n\nThe full interview, which offers a fascinating glimpse into two towering figures from opposite ends of the political spectrum, engaging in the kind of frank discussion rarely seen in today\u2019s divided climate, is scheduled to be released Tuesday.\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.
