            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we explore how the Donald Trump-Elon Musk dynamic is defining the political state of play at the White House, on Capitol Hill and outside of Washington. Plus, Peter Nicholas dives into just how seriously Trump\u2019s supporters are taking his third-term flirtations.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nTrump and Musk dominate the first Cabinet meeting of the new administration\n\nBy Katherine Doyle\n\nWhen President Donald Trump convened his Cabinet secretaries for the first meeting of his new term today, a tableful of big personalities largely sat and watched as the main character of the early days of the administration took center stage once more.\n\nThe group, which included nominees who haven\u2019t yet been confirmed, was also joined by Elon Musk, whose early actions to reshape the federal bureaucracy have stoked rancor and unease among government employees, as well as murmurs of concern among some Republicans in Congress.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sacrificing a lot,\u201d Trump said as he introduced Musk. \u201cHe\u2019s getting a lot of praise, I\u2019ll tell you, but he\u2019s also getting hit.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting outlined the hierarchy in his administration, with many of his Senate-confirmed department heads spending an hour as audience members after the president gave the floor to Musk at the top of the meeting.\n\nTrump\u2019s secretaries watched as Musk, standing at the edge of a long table, explained DOGE and its work as \u201ca support function for the president and for the agencies and departments to help achieve those savings to effectively find 15% reduction in fraud and waste.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we bring the receipts,\u201d Musk added.\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Fact check: Jane C. Timm reports that many of the \u201creceipts\u201d on the DOGE list of savings aren\u2019t cuts to active contracts, but dozens of \u201cblanket purchase agreements\u201d about potential future work, meaning that some of the advertised cuts don\u2019t actually save money.\n\nTrump also made his expectations for his Cabinet clear. \u201cOh yeah, they\u2019ll follow the orders,\u201d Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about his control of the executive branch. \u201cOf course, no exceptions.\u201d\n\nRead more from Katherine on Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting \u2192\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f On the other end of Pennsylvania Ave.: Trump and Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn tactics are emerging as a key sticking point between the two parties, as the March 14 deadline to fund the government fast approaches, Sahil Kapur reports.\n\nRepublicans who control the House and the Senate are making it clear they won\u2019t accept constraints on Trump\u2019s authority.\n\nBut they will need Democratic support on a bill to avert a government shutdown to overcome the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, as well as to make up for expected defections from conservatives in the House. Democrats are using that leverage to demand guardrails in the bill to limit the executive branch\u2019s discretion and require the administration to carry out spending directed by Congress.\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Outside of Washington: Trump and Musk\u2019s efforts are having another effect for lawmakers: House Republicans are growing weary and wary of in-person town hall meetings after facing backlash over federal government cuts, Melanie Zanona, Jonathan Allen and Matt Dixon report.\n\nParty leaders suggest that if lawmakers feel the need to hold such events, they should do tele-town halls or at least vet attendees to avoid scenes that become viral clips. A GOP aide said House Republican leaders are urging lawmakers to stop engaging in them altogether.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump keeps toying with a third term \u2014 even though the Constitution forbids it\n\nBy Peter Nicholas\n\nA coterie of Donald Trump loyalists is in the early phase of a campaign to rewrite the Constitution so he can serve another term \u2014 an idea Trump has done nothing to discourage.\n\nAs a candidate last year and since he took office, Trump has teased, stoked, nurtured, fed and, if nothing else, kept alive the improbable notion that he might run and serve one more time.\n\n\u201cAm I allowed to run again?\u201d Trump said last month at a meeting with House Republicans in Florida.\n\nThe Constitution is clear on that point: He\u2019s not. Under the 22nd Amendment, no one may be elected president more than twice. That rules out Trump.\n\nDiehard supporters are undeterred, hoping to overcome that not-so-small obstacle.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., proposed a constitutional amendment that calls for extending presidential term limits from eight years to 12, meaning that if Trump wins again, he could stay in office until January 2033, when he\u2019d be 86 years old.\n\nAnd a poster displayed at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., over the weekend was captioned \u201cThird Term Project\u201d and showed Trump in imperial Julius Caesar garb.\n\n\u201cFor Trump 2028 ... And Beyond!\u201d it read.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 A serious or joking matter?: Opinions differ about the seriousness of the prospect among GOP lawmakers and former advisers who\u2019ve worked with Trump before. There\u2019s a strong view that he\u2019s simply trolling his critics \u2014 tormenting them by suggesting he\u2019s not going away.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump joking about a third term is like a chef joking about putting a Michelin star on his own restaurant \u2014 obviously not happening, but fun to watch the critics lose their minds over it,\u201d Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2020, told NBC News.\n\nYet others believe that if the Constitution is somehow amended to permit a third term, Trump would take the leap.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a procedural way to accomplish it, he\u2019s likely very much considering it,\u201d said Jenna Ellis, a 2020 Trump campaign attorney.\n\n\u201cThat does take a constitutional amendment, but let\u2019s not forget that the Constitution was amended to impose term limits, and that can be undone,\u201d Ellis added in an interview.\n\nRead more from Peter \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83d\udcdd Budget battles: Speaker Mike Johnson managed to get the House\u2019s budget resolution to advance Trump\u2019s legislative agenda approved by the narrowest of margins.

            "full_content": "Photo: Julio Cortez/AP Photo\n\nTexas officials announced Wednesday that a child has died after contracting the measles, the first fatality in an ongoing serious outbreak in the state and neighboring New Mexico over the past few weeks.\n\nThis marks the first death from measles in the United States since 2015, when a woman in Washington State died after likely contracting the virus at a medical facility during an outbreak. Prior to that, the last measles-related death of a child was in 2003, per a report from the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has a history of vaccine skepticism, said during a Cabinet meeting that his department has been following the outbreak. But Kennedy claimed that there had been two deaths from the spate of cases, even though there has been no public confirmation of an additional death.\n\nAnd despite the notable fact that anyone has died of measles at all, the HHS secretary also appeared to downplay the outbreak, noting that they aren\u2019t uncommon in the U.S. \u201cThere\u2019ve been four measles outbreaks this year. In this country last year, there were 16. So it\u2019s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year,\u201d he said. The CDC confirms that there were 16 measles outbreaks in 2024, categorized as an instance of three or more related cases, compared to three so far this year. But last year\u2019s figures marked a significant rise from the four reported outbreaks in 2023, after a quiescent post-pandemic period. And outbreaks have clearly become more common over the past 15 years amid surging vaccine skepticism.\n\nIn a press release, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed that the child who died was hospitalized in the town of Lubbock last week and had tested positive for the measles. The agency did not identify the child but said they were school age and not vaccinated for the disease.\n\nTexas first reported an outbreak of the measles in the state\u2019s South Plains region earlier this month. Since late January, the DSHS has identified 124 cases with most of the cases occurring among children and teenagers. Per the agency, 18 people have been hospitalized in connection with the ongoing outbreak. By comparison, there were 285 confirmed cases of measles in the United States in 2024, according to CDC statistics.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to originate in Gaines County, a rural region of Texas that has the bulk of the identified cases. According to the Texas Tribune, the state\u2019s vaccination rates have decreased since the COVID-19 pandemic, while requests for religious exemptions from vaccines rose significantly from 45,900 in 2018 to 93,000 in 2024."

            "full_content": "Angry birds of a feather. Photo: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nOne of the major themes of the very turbulent second Trump administration has been a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy to downplay or even reverse tensions between Washington and Moscow at the expense of relationships with Ukraine and Western Europe. This isn\u2019t much of a surprise, given the 47th president\u2019s long-standing admiration for Vladimir Putin as a fellow strongman (the best kind of a man, in their mutual estimation), along with the strategic imperatives of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach that eschews alliances or loyalties that aren\u2019t strictly transactional. There are also some parallels between the two men that are well known, including narcissism and a sort of cartoonish toxic masculinity, along with a base of support that includes billionaire oligarchs, Christian nationalists, and thuggish right-wing \u201cpopulists.\u201d\n\nBut the excesses surrounding Trump\u2019s return to office are bringing to light a more pointed set of comparisons, as explained by Jonathan Rauch in The Atlantic:\n\nToday, it is clear that what has happened since January 20 is not just a change of administration but a change of regime \u2014 a change, that is, in our system of government. But a change to what?\n\nThere is an answer, and it is not classic authoritarianism \u2014 nor is it autocracy, oligarchy, or monarchy. Trump is installing what scholars call patrimonialism \u2026\n\nPatrimonialism is less a form of government than a style of governing. It is not defined by institutions or rules; rather, it can infect all forms of government by replacing impersonal, formal lines of authority with personalized, informal ones. Based on individual loyalty and connections, and on rewarding friends and punishing enemies (real or perceived), it can be found not just in states but also among tribes, street gangs, and criminal organizations.\n\nIn its governmental guise, patrimonialism is distinguished by running the state as if it were the leader\u2019s personal property or family business. It can be found in many countries, but its main contemporary exponent \u2014 at least until January 20, 2025 \u2014 has been Vladimir Putin.\n\nPutin\u2019s form of patrimonialism is often compared to criminal, Mafia-boss conduct, with personal respect based on fear and loyalty being the coin of the realm, as Christian Baghai observed not long ago:\n\nBill Browder, head of the Global Magnitsky Justice campaign and author of Red Notice and Freezing Order, has been a staunch critic of Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership style. He likens Putin to the archetype of a mafia boss, suggesting that the Russian president\u2019s authority is precariously dependent on a type of respect that is rooted in fear rather than admiration. This comparison is not made lightly; in both popular culture and reality, a mafia boss commands through a combination of fear, violence, and the unspoken threat of retribution. Browder posits that Putin operates within a similar framework, where respect is synonymous with fear, and losing that respect could mean losing everything.\n\nPutin has managed to create a loose network of patrimonialist leaders, including Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and Narendra Modi of India, which Trump seems inclined to join.\n\nWithout question, Trump shares Putin\u2019s proprietary attitude toward the government over which he presides as though it is an extension of his business holdings; that\u2019s one reason he is so cavalier about conflicts of interest: Governing and profit-making are interchangeable activities in his mind. He has extended that mentality to his claims of unprecedented personal power over the executive branch, and as the embodiment of the executive branch, as well as over the legislative and judicial branches. Indeed, he has seen fit to delegate that vast personal power to the preeminent funder of his 2024 campaign, Elon Musk, who is treating the federal bureaucracy exactly the way he treated employees of companies he took over as owner. Musk is regarding the federal government as something he owns, because the actual owner, Trump, has given him free rein. Much of the confusion over Musk\u2019s official status (or the lack thereof) stems from the complete refusal by either Musk or his boss to view themselves as employees rather than owner-operators of the public sector. Owners don\u2019t need titles or limited grants of authority.\n\nThe \u201cpersonal business\u201d view of government also helps explain the ferocious Trump-Musk assault on the \u201cdeep state,\u201d which represents an alternative power base, as Rauch explains:\n\nPatrimonialism is suspicious of bureaucracies; after all, to exactly whom are they loyal? They might acquire powers of their own, and their rules and processes might prove obstructive. People with expertise, experience, and distinguished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are likewise suspect because they bring independent standing and authority. So patrimonialism stocks the government with nonentities and hacks, or, when possible, it bypasses bureaucratic procedures altogether.\n\nSound familiar? It should.\n\nAnother aspect of patrimonialism shared by Putin and Trump is a categorical refusal to share power with the opposition unless it is absolutely necessary. Both men have turned election victories into \u201cmandates\u201d so vast and unlimited as to make future elections as meaningless as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean Trump will be as successful as his friend (or other \u201cstrongmen\u201d who originally took power democratically) in subverting democracy; U.S. institutions designed to thwart dictatorship are undoubtedly more robust than their Russian counterparts ever were. But as we learned after the 2020 election, Trump has nothing but contempt for democracy unless it happens to serve his purposes.\n\nThe bottom line is that Trump will take his power grabs exactly as far as he is allowed to do by his congressional allies, the courts, and perhaps even some members of his administration who didn\u2019t sign on for making America great again via the concentration of all power in one very fallible man. If we are lucky, smart, and brave, the 47th president may still admire and emulate Vladimir Putin but won\u2019t achieve his corrupt and corrupting status as the personification of his country. Trump recently proclaimed: \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d Dress it up in red, white, and blue all you want, but that\u2019s un-American."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump made numerous false claims in remarks at the first Cabinet meeting of his new administration. The falsehoods spanned a wide variety of topics, including aid to Ukraine, trade with the European Union, the history of the EU, inflation, mail-in voting, drug overdose deaths, and where the US stands in international education rankings.\n\nTrump also left out critical context from two claims related to Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal government. Here is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s statements.\n\nUkraine and Europe\n\nUS vs. European wartime aid to Ukraine: Trump repeated his regular false claim that the US has provided $350 billion in aid to Ukraine while Europe has collectively provided just $100 billion in aid to Ukraine. That is not close to correct.\n\nAccording to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, Europe \u2013 the European Union plus individual European countries \u2013 had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December 2024 (about $259 billion) than the US committed (about $125 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $139 billion) than the US allocated (about $120 billion).\n\nThe US did have a slim lead in one particular category, military aid allocated, providing about $67 billion compared to about $65 billion from Europe. But even that was nowhere close to the giant gulf Trump described.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s \u201c$350 billion\u201d figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response has said on its website that \u201cas of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion, with $130.1 billion obligated and $86.7 billion disbursed\u201d \u2013 and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.\n\nObama\u2019s Ukraine aid: Trump revived a false claim he regularly made during his first presidency about the Obama administration\u2019s military aid to Ukraine, saying that \u201cthey said\u201d that Obama \u201cgave sheets.\u201d While he didn\u2019t say who \u201cthey\u201d are, it\u2019s not true that the Obama administration merely provided bedsheets to Ukraine (or \u201cpillows and sheets,\u201d as Trump used to say). While it\u2019s true that the Obama administration declined to provide weapons to Ukraine, it provided more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 that included counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, armored Humvees, tactical drones, night vision devices and medical supplies.\n\nThe European Union and trade: Trump repeated a false claim that the European Union doesn\u2019t \u201caccept, essentially, our farm products.\u201d The claim is false even with the \u201cessentially\u201d qualifier. The EU bought $12.3 billion worth of US agricultural exports in the 2023 fiscal year, making it the fourth-largest export market for US agricultural and related products behind China, Mexico and Canada, according to official data.\n\nThe formation of the European Union: Trump repeated his false claim that the European Union \u201cwas formed in order to screw the United States; I mean, look, let\u2019s be honest.\u201d Experts on the EU told CNN during Trump\u2019s first presidency that there is no basis for such claims, noting that US presidents had consistently supported European integration efforts.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s claims are preposterous,\u201d Desmond Dinan, a public policy professor at George Mason University who is an expert in the history of European integration, said during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cThe European Communities (forerunner of the EU) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint US-Western European plan to stabilize and secure Western Europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space.\u201d\n\nTrade\n\nTariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falsely claimed that the US took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs \u201cfrom China\u201d during his presidency, then falsely claimed that before his presidency, no other president took in even \u201c10 cents.\u201d\n\nThe US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, and often pass on some or all of the cost to US consumers. Study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nTrade with Canada: Trump repeated his vague claim that the US is losing $200 billion per year to Canada; he didn\u2019t define \u201close,\u201d but this is how he generally refers to trade deficits, and he has previously claimed the US has a $200 billion annual trade deficit with Canada.\n\nIn fact, the US goods and services trade deficit with Canada was about $40.6 billion in 2023, according to US government figures; even if you only consider trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the US deficit with Canada was about $72.3 billion, still far shy of Trump\u2019s figure. And it\u2019s worth noting that the deficit is overwhelmingly caused by the US importing a large quantity of inexpensive Canadian oil, which helps keep Americans\u2019 gas prices down.\n\nEconomy, education and health\n\nInflation during Trump\u2019s first term: Trump repeated his false claim that there was \u201cno inflation\u201d under his first presidency. In fact, year-over-year inflation was 1.4% in the month he left office, January 2021 \u2013 relatively low, but not nonexistent \u2013 and prices rose about 8% from the beginning of that presidency to the end.\n\nInflation today: Trump baselessly claimed that \u201cthe inflation is stopping, slowly.\u201d Inflation rose to 3% in January (a month largely under the Biden administration), and there is no indication that it is \u201cstopping,\u201d slowly or otherwise; Trump is pushing various policies that many economists describe as inflationary, notably including a variety of tariffs on imported goods. (Some low level of inflation is generally considered healthy for an economy, so the Federal Reserve targets a rate of 2% rather than stopping inflation completely.)\n\nEducation rankings: Trump repeated his false claim that the US ranks dead last, 40th out of 40 countries, in international education rankings. When asked by CNN to identify any education rankings list in which the US placed 40th out of 40, the White House couldn\u2019t do so. FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have noted that even among the wealthy, developed countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the US ranks well above average in reading and science and below average, but still far from last, in math.\n\nFentanyl deaths: Trump repeated his inaccurate rejection of official statistics on overdose deaths, claiming that \u201cwe lose 300,000 people a year to fentanyl, not 100 (thousand), not 95 (thousand), not 60 (thousand) like you read\u2026close to 300,000 people, dead.\u201d\n\nThere is no basis for Trump\u2019s \u201c300,000\u201d figure. In the 12-month period ending in September 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there were 55,126 deaths involving synthetic opioids including fentanyl \u2013 a terrible figure, but nowhere close to what Trump said. Even at the peak, US deaths involving synthetic opioids hovered under 80,000 for any given 12-month period.\n\nWhen Trump made similar \u201c300,000\u201d claims in 2024, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University, told CNN that this is \u201ca made-up number,\u201d saying, \u201cI have no idea where Trump is getting \u2018300,000\u2019 from.\u201d\n\nKolodny said it\u2019s likely that the number of US overdose deaths is undercounted, but that there is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s insistence that the real number is nearly triple the reported number. And Kolodny said the undercount issue is centered not on overdoses from illicit fentanyl smuggled across the southern border but on seniors\u2019 overdoses from accidentally taking too much of their legal prescription medications.\n\nForeign affairs\n\nTrump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that he \u201cgot rid of\u201d the ISIS terror group in just \u201cthree weeks\u201d even though \u201cpeople\u201d had told him it would take five years. The ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nMail-in voting: Trump falsely claimed, \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world that has mail-in voting.\u201d Various other countries, including Canada, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Spain allow some or all voters to vote by mail, though the specifics of their policies vary.\n\nFentanyl and Canada: Speaking of fentanyl, Trump claimed, \u201cA lot of it comes through Canada.\u201d It\u2019s debatable what counts as \u201ca lot,\u201d but US official statistics show that, of 21,889 pounds of fentanyl seized by US border authorities in the 2024 fiscal year, about 0.2% \u2013 43 pounds \u2013 was seized near the Canadian border. That\u2019s compared to 21,148 pounds at the Mexican border, about 96.6%.\n\nMilitary equipment and Afghanistan: Trump repeated his exaggeration that the US left tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. The Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.\n\nGovernment workers and spending\n\nThe five accomplishments email: Trump, speaking of the federal employees who did not respond to an Elon Musk email blast asking them to list accomplishments from the previous week, said, \u201cUsually that means that maybe that person doesn\u2019t exist, or that person doesn\u2019t want to say they\u2019re working for another company while being paid by the United States government.\u201d He added that these million people who didn\u2019t respond are \u201con the bubble\u201d for continued employment even though \u201cmaybe they don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t explain that there are benign explanations for the large number of non-responses. Leaders at multiple federal agencies told their employees not to respond to the email, and the Trump administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management told agencies that replying was voluntary. And some employees may have been sick, on vacation, on leave or without access to their email account by the response deadline of Monday; the email was sent to federal employees on Saturday.\n\nIn other words, a non-response certainly doesn\u2019t mean a federal employee is imaginary or that they are a real person improperly moonlighting at a second job on government time.\n\nDeceased people and Social Security: Trump said of Social Security: \u201cYou see people that are 200 years old that are being sent checks for Social Security. Some of them are actually being sent checks. So we\u2019re facing that down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that some Social Security checks are being sent to some long-deceased people. But as Musk insinuates that millions of long-deceased people might be getting money, it\u2019s important to note that Social Security already has a system in place to stop payments to people listed as being age 115 and older.\n\nA 2023 report from the inspector general who monitors the Social Security Administration found 18.9 million people age 100 or older who were not marked as deceased on their entry in a Social Security database, an issue Musk has discussed. But while the inspector general was critical of the Social Security Administration (SSA) over the issue, she also found that only 44,000 of these 18.9 million people were receiving payments.\n\nEven those 44,000 payments were not obviously fraudulent or erroneous. The inspector general noted that a larger number of living people in the US, an estimated 86,000, were age 100 or older.\n\n\u201cRegarding the 44,000 figure, I\u2019m confident that the vast majority of those are legit payments. So while there probably is some fraud, I don\u2019t think these numbers show any evidence of it,\u201d Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank who served as principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration during the George W. Bush administration, told CNN last week.\n\nThe acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, Leland Dudek, who was elevated to that post by the current Trump administration, tried to set the record straight in a February statement.\n\n\u201cThe reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,\u201d Dudek said."

            "full_content": "The ostensible Speaker of the House applauds the real Speaker of the House. Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIt was one of those moments Washington insiders love. Tuesday night, after a tense few days of negotiations with wayward GOP congressmen, House Speaker Mike Johnson pulled his budget blueprint from the floor and sent members home only to \u2026 reverse the decision and then win the vote by the smallest possible margin. Johnson pulls a rabbit out of the hat again, with a little help from Donald J. Trump, and his \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d is on course!\n\nPutting aside the hype, what really happened is that the very first stage of the process by which Trump\u2019s legislative agenda may be enacted is roughly half over. Because Trump was extremely tardy in communicating any preference between the Senate\u2019s approach of enacting that agenda in two budget reconciliation bills and the House\u2019s approach of rolling it all into one, the two chambers now have separate budget resolutions laying out a blueprint for the ultimate legislation. The Senate is now expected to defer to the House\u2019s approach but will rewrite the resolution to meet its own needs (Republican senators are reportedly anxious for even bigger tax cuts than the House). So some version of the resolution that passed Tuesday night on a 217-215 vote (Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only member to break party ranks) will be worked out between House and Senate in discussions that could take weeks. Only then will an actual budget reconciliation bill become possible, and all this maneuvering will become very real.\n\nThe broad outlines of the House budget resolution provide for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, $1.5 to $2 trillion in spending cuts for \u201cmandatory\u201d programs (i.e., those not subject to annual appropriations), and a $4 trillion increase in the national debt limit. The bill doesn\u2019t provide specifics; it just instructs House committees to cut spending to certain levels. A lot of attention is being paid to the $880 billion in cuts demanded from the Energy and Commerce Committee, since that will almost certainly require major cuts in Medicaid.\n\nA lot of the intra-GOP debate before passage of the resolution revolved around fears among House Republicans from marginal districts about the depth of cuts, particularly for Medicaid, and the desire of House Freedom Caucus types for even bigger cuts, not only for Medicaid and other safety-net programs but for the nonmandatory spending governed by annual appropriations bills. As the clock wound down for the vote on the House floor, Johnson brought in Trump to tell wavering members pretty much whatever they wanted to hear. The president jawboned the hard-core House Freedom Caucus members hungering and thirsting for deeper cuts, as the Washington Post explained:\n\nTrump worked the phone earlier in the day and during the evening vote series to sway Reps. Tim Burchett (Tennessee), Victoria Spartz (Indiana), Warren Davidson (Ohio) and Thomas Massie (Kentucky) to support the plan.\n\nAll the holdouts except for Massie flipped. \u2026\n\nBurchett said his conversation with Trump was the key factor to changing his mind. \u2026\n\nThere was no quid pro quo, but the president assured me that he would work toward cuts, and he\u2019s never lied to me.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the most persuasive argument may have been Johnson\u2019s incessant reminders that the budget resolution didn\u2019t mention specific cuts, giving those who wanted more and those who wanted less plausible deniability, as HuffPost reported:\n\nTo sway the moderates, Johnson and his lieutenants in the House GOP have fashioned a new talking point that insists the budget would not actually cut Medicaid because the word \u201cMedicaid\u201d isn\u2019t in the resolution.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even mention Medicaid in the bill,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nEventually, of course, decisions on budget and tax cuts will have to be made, though perhaps not until the cherry blossoms have bloomed and faded and summer\u2019s heat strikes Washington. In the meantime, separate negotiations over appropriations are underway to keep the federal government operating when stopgap spending runs out on March 14 (though some short-term extensions are likely), which in turn may revolve around Democratic demands that the Trump administration and Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE stop usurping congressional spending prerogatives and violating civil service protections. How it all fits together is anybody\u2019s guess at present, but so long as Democrats remain united, every step will require more promises, pressure, and lies from real Speaker of the House at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."

            "full_content": "Photo: Bryan Dozier/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty\n\nLast month, Donald Trump presented an absolutely appalling plan to have the United States \u201ctake over the Gaza Strip\u201d and \u201cdevelop it.\u201d This would entail expelling the 2 million Palestinians who currently live in the war-ravaged territory and giving them no right of return.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be cute, I don\u2019t want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East could be something,\u201d Trump said at a February 4 press conference. \u201cThis could be so magnificent.\u201d\n\nMany world leaders, activists, and religious figures agreed that Trump\u2019s plan \u201ccould be something\u201d \u2026 and that something is called ethnic cleansing.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what could be worse than that, but somehow Trump found a way to make his vision for Gaza even more disgusting. Late on Tuesday, Trump shared an AI-generated video to Truth Social and Instagram that depicts \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d for Gaza. Apparently, the president dreams of turning the territory into a Dubai-esque city of skyscrapers where he will revel in his wealth with pals Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and be worshipped as a golden god.\n\nThe deranged video crams a lot of information into just 33 seconds, so here\u2019s a breakdown.\n\nThroughout the clip, a dance track plays in the background proclaiming, \u201cTrump Gaza\u2019s finally here!\u201d These are the lyrics:\n\nDonald\u2019s coming to set you free, bringing the life for all to see. No more tunnels, no more fear, Trump Gaza is finally here. Trump Gaza shining bright, golden future, a brand-new life. Feast and dance; the deed is done. Trump Gaza No. 1.\n\nFirst we see the rubble that is present-day Gaza morph into a scene of children running onto a gorgeous beach with yachts and tall buildings in the background (presumably these are not Palestinian children as they will have been relocated). There are more scenes of palm-tree-lined luxury-shopping districts, then a shot of Elon Musk enjoying a hummuslike dip. The clip features four shots of the DOGE chief living it up in Gaza. In two, he is eating:\n\nAnd in two others, he is making it rain dollars:\n\nTrump will enjoy the pleasures of the new Gaza as well (maybe a bit too much: He looks pretty chunky throughout). We see Trump dancing with a scantily clad woman who is not his wife:\n\nAnd lounging on the beach with the Israeli prime minister:\n\nThis new Gaza will actually be freer than the United States under Trump, judging from the bearded, bikini-clad belly dancers frolicking in public:\n\nToward the end of the video, it\u2019s revealed that \u201cTrump Gaza\u201d doesn\u2019t just refer to the president\u2019s plan for the territory. It\u2019s actually the name of a new luxury resort:\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t just dreaming of slapping his name on another property. He wants to see the denizens of Gaza carrying golden Trump-head balloons (not to be confused with Trump-baby balloons):\n\nAnd perhaps basking in the glow of the Suddam Hussein\u2013esque golden Trump statue:\n\nPeople can also buy tiny gold Trump statues so they can worship false idols in the comfort of their own home:\n\nRecently, members of the Trump administration have portrayed the president\u2019s plans for Gaza as a kind of negotiating tactic meant to spur Arab leaders into action, as the New York Times reported:\n\nAfter President Trump shocked the Arab world last month by suggesting the entire population of Gaza be expelled from the territory, his aides reframed the idea as an invitation to the leaders of the Middle East: Come up with a better plan, or do it our way.\n\n\u201cAll these countries say how much they care about the Palestinians,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week. \u201cIf the Arab countries have a better plan, then that\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Rubio added.\n\nPresumably, some will argue that Trump is playing four-dimensional chess by dropping this revolting AI video. But maybe all it really shows is that Trump is a megalomaniac who doesn\u2019t care if Palestinians live or die and no longer feels the need to hide it."

Biden moved to halt oil and natural gas leases, banned offshore drilling, and sought to require a majority of new cars sold in the U.S. to be electric vehicles or hybrids by 2032, Breitbart News\u2019 Sean Moran reported.\n\nThe burden hit all Americans, especially those in Lummis\u2019s home state \u2013 \u201cWyoming exports 12 times more energy than it consumes,\u201d Lummis emphasized. But Trump\u2019s designation of a national energy emergency is both increasing energy availability and lowering costs as well as furthering clean energy efforts.\n\n\u201cNow that President Trump has correctly opened opportunities for energy production \u2013 and I mean energy production of all kinds in this country \u2013 it helps us achieve a cleaner environment worldwide, because we can produce it so much cleaner than China, Russia and other countries on the other side of the planet,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt is going to have benefits all over the country, including the Northeast, the West Coast and areas that tend to be dominated by Democrat voters,\u201d Lummis expounded, adding \u201cit will give us a chance to show them that we can have less expensive, more abundant clean energy in this country, that we can protect our environment at the same time that we make ourselves not only energy independent, but energy dominant.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 resolution to revoke Trump\u2019s order is privileged, therefore, the Senate has to schedule a vote on the legislation. Lummis believes their effort is doomed to fail on the Senate floor and with voters weary of paying high energy prices.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get shot down in a big way,\u201d she said of Democrats. \u201cAnd it gives us, those of us who are for producing more clean American energy and the attendant jobs that go along with that, an opportunity to explain that\u2026 when we produce energy in the United States is actually cleaning up the global environment.\u201d\n\nChina is building dozens of coal plants, yet Democrats, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) have argued that America is in a clean energy \u201carms race\u201d with China.\n\nLummis, who saw firsthand the Chinese pollution emitted across the globe during a visit to South Korea, believes Democrats\u2019 crusade to promote alternative energy sources regardless of the consequences is short-sighted.\n\n\u201cModern coal fired power plants that use Yankee ingenuity and American technology and are extremely clean, and so I would tell my friend, Sen. Wyden, we should be building more clean coal-fired power plants here in the United States, and in fact, as a gesture of environmental goodwill around the world, we should teach China how to do their coal-fired power plants in a cleaner way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on the Democrats\u2019 resolution Wednesday.\n\nLummis is a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

            "full_content": "Photo: Michael M. Santiag/Getty Images\n\nWhen Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos stunned the newsroom on Wednesday by announcing that he was remaking the ideology of the \u201cOpinions\u201d section so that it would be \u201cwriting every day in support and defense\u201d of \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets,\u201d publisher Will Lewis eagerly hopped onboard. In a follow-up letter to staff, Lewis said he \u201cwill be so very proud for the Post to be known for its two key pillars,\u201d a departure from the righteous motto of \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d that Bezos adopted during Donald Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThis is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cDoing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.\u201d\n\nBut behind the scenes, Lewis had pointed out to Bezos that the change would have consequences for the health of the paper, according to a source familiar with conversations around the decision. This is ostensibly because the \u201cOpinions\u201d section is a crucial component of Lewis\u2019s vision for revitalizing the Post, the second of three newsrooms he outlined in his big plan to drive subscriptions and increase reader engagement. Opinion sections, though smaller than their news-gathering counterparts, are cheaper to produce and known to punch above their weight in terms of getting eyeballs \u2014 particularly when taking aim at the Trump administration. \u201cYou have an owner whose political perspectives are evolving quite rapidly and who, like a lot of billionaires, lives outside of consequence,\u201d said one Post insider. \u201cThis is probably not a great commercial move, but he has the cash to be careless.\u201d\n\nBezos\u2019s decision is the latest earthquake to hit the Post since he pulled the editorial board\u2019s endorsement of Kamala Harris on the eve of the 2024 election \u2014 a move that cost the paper some 250,000 angered subscribers, who likely associated the Post more with the truth-to-power journalism of the Watergate era than defending the integrity of free markets. Sources said it became clear at the beginning of 2025 that Bezos wanted such a shift, and Ben Mullin of the New York Times reported that Lewis in January sent \u201cOpinions\u201d editor David Shipley a memo with Bezos\u2019s ideas for an opinion section that more closely resembled that of the Rupert Murdoch\u2013owned Wall Street Journal. Shipley made the decision to step down in the past week or so.\n\nBezos has now made it clear that he intends to use the Post as an instrument of his own ideas and agenda after years in which he let Marty Baron, Fred Hiatt, and other editors steer the ship. \u201cJeff has clearly shifted his relationship with the paper from distant steward to person who has a plaything, and he\u2019s demonstrated a kind of impetuousness and a little bit of careless disregard that are very familiar to public life right now,\u201d the Post insider noted. And Bezos has also made it clear that, whatever plans Lewis may have to bring back subscribers, those are secondary to his political aims, which appear to include appeasing the Trump administration. (That Lewis\u2019s authority has been undermined was painfully evident in the fact that staff got the memo from Bezos first.) Baron said he couldn\u2019t be more \u201csad and disgusted\u201d with Bezos\u2019s change in approach.\n\n\u201cOpinions\u201d staff gathered for a meeting on Wednesday in which Shipley explained that he wanted an opinion section reflecting a wide range of voices and views \u2014 a \u201c360-degree view,\u201d as he put it, per an \u201cOpinions\u201d staffer. The staffer noted that Bezos has \u201ctalked in the past about wanting a broader range of views and encouraged us to look all over the country \u2014 and not in the traditional opinion silos of the coasts,\u201d adding, \u201cit seems like Jeff has reversed himself on that and no longer believes in hosting a national conversation.\u201d In his memo, Bezos wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\u201d\n\nWhat this decision means for \u201cOpinions\u201d staffers who don\u2019t align with Bezos\u2019s viewpoint remains to be seen. (Or even for those who do: \u201cI\u2019m very much in favor of free markets and individual liberty, but I never signed up to be a mouthpiece for Jeff Bezos or anyone else,\u201d as one staffer put it.) There is also the question of whether Bezos will begin meddling in the newsroom. His encroachment into the \u201cOpinions\u201d section prompted several top Post journalists to say publicly that they would quit if he interferes with their reporting. \u201cNo one has ever told me what to write,\u201d White House reporter Dan Diamond wrote on X. \u201cIf that changes, I\u2019d speak out and leave.\u201d Executive editor Matt Murray assured reporters that Bezos had no desire to do so. The opinion section \u201cis traditionally the provenance of the owner at news organizations,\u201d Murray wrote in a memo to the newsroom. \u201cThe independent and unbiased work of the Post\u2019s newsroom remains unchanged, and we will continue to pursue engaging, impactful journalism without fear or favor.\u201d\n\nAll this turmoil comes as the Post has seen an exodus of top talent, with more to come, including Pulitzer Prize winner Caroline Kitchener, who is heading to the Times. \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for the reporters of the Washington Post to do their jobs. It\u2019s his paper \u2014 I get that \u2014 but it just feels like a joke,\u201d one staffer said. \u201cIs Jeff Bezos going to allow the Washington Post editorial page to write things about freedom of speech for people he doesn\u2019t like? Or to write about free markets and how Amazon is a threat?\u201d\n\nAt least one person is a fan of the changes. \u201cBravo, @JeffBezos!\u201d Elon Musk wrote on X."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration moved forward Wednesday with its plans to conduct large-scale layoffs across agencies, the latest move to downsize the federal workforce.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management issued a memo to agency leaders with guidance on how to conduct their reductions in force, known as RIFs, and the reorganizations plans, taking another step to carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order entitled \u201cImplementing The President\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization Initiative.\u201d\n\nThe memo comes as the Trump administration is conducting a multi-pronged effort to overhaul federal operations and shed employees. In less than six weeks, it has laid off tens of thousands of probationary workers, placed other employees on administrative leave, offered a deferred resignation package and ordered staffers to return to the office full time.\n\nThe moves, along with a confusing weekend demand that staffers list their activities of the past week, have ratcheted up the anxiety levels of many federal workers, who until now had felt they had some job security. The federal government has not conducted a widespread reduction in force since the Clinton administration in the 1990s.\n\nAccording to Wednesday\u2019s memo, the principles to guide the agencies include conducting \u201ca significant reduction\u201d in the number of federal workers by eliminating positions that are not needed and reducing federal property holdings and budget, as well as providing better service to Americans and increasing productivity, according to the memo.\n\nThe first phase includes submitting lists of agency divisions and employees performing functions not mandated by law or regulation who are not considered essential employees during government shutdowns. The plans should also include lists of all jobs categorized as essential, of agency divisions that provide direct service to Americans and of any statutes that establish the agency, as well as the tools the agencies plan to use to reduce their staffs.\n\nPlus, agencies should provide suggestions for how to engage Congress to gain agreement on major restructuring efforts and on moving funds between accounts. The deadline for submitting the plans, which should include an implementation timetables, is no later than March 13.\n\nIn the second phase, OMB and OPM are asking for an outline of \u201ca positive vision for more productive, efficient agency operations going forward.\u201d Those are due no later than April 14 and should be implemented by September 30.\n\nThe information requested includes an agency\u2019s proposed organizational chart and confirmation that it has reviewed all employees\u2019 job descriptions, recent performance reports, length of service and veterans\u2019 status. OMB and OPM also want to know proposed relocations of offices away from the Washington, DC, metro area and plans to reduce costs and improve efficiency through technology.\n\nAgencies\u2019 plans should also include provisions of union collective bargaining agreements that could inhibit cost-savings and efficiency efforts and proposals to renegotiate those provisions. Also, agencies should provide justifications for excluding programs and divisions from the reductions, as well as areas for future large-scale layoffs.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Source: Trump administration to direct agencies to prepare for firings 01:40 - Source: CNN Source: Trump administration to direct agencies to prepare for firings 01:40\n\nAnd, as in the executive order, the memo notes that future hiring should be limited to one position for every four people who depart.\n\nExempted from this restructuring are positions in law enforcement, border security, national security, public safety and immigration enforcement, as well as the military and federal uniformed personnel, including the US Coast Guard. Also, the US Postal Service and the executive office of the President are not subject to the memo.\n\nIn addition, the guidance notes that any agencies or divisions providing direct services to citizens, such as Social Security, Medicare and veterans\u2019 health care, should not implement any reductions until OMB and OPM certify that the plans would have a \u201cpositive effect\u201d on delivering those services.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "Photo: Andrea Renault/STAR MAX/IPx/Getty Images\n\nEric Adams has long professed his innocence of the federal corruption charges levied against him. He also has a major rhetorical tendency toward the grandiose. So perhaps it wasn\u2019t surprising when the mayor invoked Jesus Christ on Tuesday as a comparison for his current plight.\n\nAdams was speaking at a Gracie Mansion reception alongside other administration officials commemorating Black History Month. During his remarks, the mayor told a story from his policing days about pulling over to assist civilians with a stalled car in the pouring rain, using it as a metaphor to advise the crowd to use their own personal light well.\n\nThen Adams turned to his unsettled legal situation, calling out those who have pushed for the mayor to resign from office. \u201cSo, this is a biblical moment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, when Jesus was on the cross, he said, \u2018God, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\u2019 All these Negroes who were asking me to step down, God, forgive them,\u201d he said, to applause and shouts from the crowd.\n\nAdams then ran down a list of his administration\u2019s accomplishments, claiming a record amount of new and affordable housing being built as well as an increase in job creation and tens of thousands of guns off the city\u2019s streets. \u201cWhat we have done, you have to be stupid to try to stop me from running this race. It\u2019s a level of buffoonery that\u2019s going on that\u2019s spreading as fast as COVID,\u201d he said.\n\nAdams was questioned about his comments during an appearance on FOX 5 New York\u2019s Good Day New York. Anchor Curt Menefee pressed Adams on his use of the word \u201cNegroes,\u201d noting that some people have an issue with that term being used.\n\n\u201cAre you implying if you\u2019re Black, you have to support you?\u201d Menefee asked.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019m asking for all New Yorkers to support me,\u201d Adams said.\n\nMenefee asked the mayor whom he was specifically referring to during his comments.\n\n\u201cWell, who has asked me to step down? If you look at that whole speech, the speech talked about the continuation of lighting your flame and continuing to light and shine. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in this administration with our team,\u201d Adams said. \u201cSo, those who have called for me to allow my flame to be prematurely extinguished, that\u2019s who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nAdams said that the people of New York City selected him to be their mayor and that nothing he has done has warranted his resignation or removal. \u201cI have not been convicted of a crime. I\u2019ve moved the city forward. I\u2019ve done the job that New Yorkers asked me to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, when you have those that are trying to usurp the power of the people, that is not democracy, and God forgive them.\u201d"

            "full_content": "At the 97th annual Academy Awards, presented on March 2, Adrien Brody won the Oscar for best actor for \"The Brutalist.\" Watch scenes from the winning performance and others nominated in the category of best actor, as well as interviews with the nominees below.\n\nThe 2025 Academy Award nominees for best actor: Adrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"; Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"A Complete Unknown\"; Colman Domingo, \"Sing Sing\"; Ralph Fiennes, \"Conclave\"; and Sebastian Stan, \"The Apprentice.\" A24; Searchlight Pictures; Focus Features; Briarcliff Entertainment\n\nAdrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"\n\nIn 2003 Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor Oscar-winner in history for his performance in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician struggling to survive in the Jewish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It was a role for which he virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning the piano so that he could play Chopin.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Brody is back with his second Oscar nomination for \"The Brutalist,\" Brady Corbet's lacerating tale of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States, and his efforts both to resume his career and to assimilate in a society where antisemitism and classism are rife.\n\nT\u00f3th is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. In this scene, T\u00f3th \u2013 who is working a construction site in Pennsylvania \u2013 is discovered by Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce), who sees in T\u00f3th a talent for which he wants to be the patron.\n\nT\u00f3th accepts a commission. But once his wife Erzs\u00e9bet (best supporting actress nominee Felicity Jones) arrives from Europe, T\u00f3th feels caught between his artistic impulses and the realities of working in an America that, in many cases, is closed to the foreign born:\n\nBrody, whose mother and grandparents fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution, said their sacrifices informed his performance. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"\n\nHe also heard the voice of his Hungarian grandfather in T\u00f3th. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said. \"I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"\n\nIn this extended interview with \"Sunday Morning,\" Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"\n\nBrody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the Golden Globe for best motion picture actor (drama), and the BAFTA for \"The Brutalist.\" The film received 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director (Brady Corbet).\n\n\"The Brutalist,\" released by A24, is playing in select theaters in 70mm, and is available via VOD.\n\nUPDATED: Brody received his second Academy Award, winning for his performance as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th in \"The Brutalist.\" [The film also won Academy Awards for its cinematography and original score.]\n\nIn an emotional speech, Brody addressed the film community: \"Acting is a very fragile profession. It looks very glamorous, and in certain moments it is, but the one thing that I've gained having the privilege to come back here is to have some perspective. And no matter where you are in your career, no matter what you've accomplished, it can all go away, and I think what makes this night most special is the awareness of that, and the gratitude that I have to still do the work that I love.\n\n\"Winning an award like this is, it signifies a destination. And It's something my character references in the film, but to me it also, beyond the pinnacle of a career, it is a chance to begin again, and the opportunity to hopefully be fortunate enough so that the next 20 years of my life that I can prove that I am worthy of such meaningful and important and relevant roles.\"\n\nBrody alluded to both the characters he played in \"The Pianist\" and \"The Brutalist,\" saying, \"I'm here once again to represent the lingering traumas and the repercussions of war, and systematic oppression, and of anti-semitism and racism, and of othering. ... I pray for a healthier and a happier and a more inclusive world, and I believe if the past can teach us anything, it's a reminder to not let hate go unchecked.\"\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"A Complete Unknown\"\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his first best actor Oscar nomination at age 22 for \"Call Me By Your Name,\" as a teenage boy who becomes the target of an older man. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet plays the iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan during the years when he made a name for himself as a folk artist and as a rock star who, to a segment of his fans, left the roots of folk music behind.\n\nIn this scene Dylan is introduced by Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton) for his first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he performs \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":\n\nPrior to shooting, Chalamet travelled to Minnesota to research Dylan's roots and his formative days. He returned to the state for a screening of the finished film in Minneapolis. In December Chalamet told CBS Minnesota station WCCO, \"I think he's very proud of his Minnesota heritage, and I think, in some ways, the way I relate to him is, I think the iron ore in his songs and the iron ore in his voice \u2014 as a New Yorker, as a 28-year-old New Yorker, I don't think my path would have really brought me out here, ever.\n\n\"So, the first time I got here I thought, 'Wow, what a gift, Bob Dylan, being in this guy's worldview.'\"\n\nThe actor was first attached to the project in 2019, but shooting was repeatedly delayed due to COVID and then the actors' strike. In the intervening years, Chalamet learned how to play the guitar. \"I don't know if I'll ever get this much time to work on something in advance,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter. He also gained 20 pounds prior to shooting, to better match the folk singer's physique.\n\nHe said the role marked the furthest that he'd stretched himself. \"And it became so biblical to me in terms of this man's life and his work that I felt if I let my focus err for a second, that I'd be self-loathing about it for years to come. I had three months to play Bob Dylan, and the rest of my life I don't get to be about that, so why not give it my all?\"\n\nTo connect with what the reclusive Dylan represented, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he disconnected from his own life for the two-and-a-half months of filming. He did not use his cellphone, or have visitors on set. \"I've never approached a character so intensely as Bob, 'cause I have such respect for the material,\" Chalamet said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day when something went wrong.\"\n\nIn addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he learned to perform about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script. But while Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie (to be played back on set during filming), he said they sounded \"too clean,\" and so he tried performing live on set, doing so the first time in a scene in which Dylan visits his terminally ill hero, folk artist Woody Guthrie, in a New Jersey hospital.\n\nDirector James Mangold said he knew Chalamet nailed \"Song to Woody\" on his first take: \"There's a moment in that scene right at the last stanza where he holds a note \u2013 that would never have happened if we'd used the playback track,\" Mangold said.\n\nChalamet also examined video of the singer, including footage taken of a Dylan performing a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" with Joan Baez, which he played at a reduced speed. \"That was when I really slowed down, 'cause it's fascinating the way Bob observes her,\" he said. \"And how he refuses eye contact in that video.\"\n\nIn \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet and Barbaro perform \"It Ain't Me Babe\":\n\nSpeaking of the finished film, Chalamet said, \"I was honored and counting my lucky stars that we got to bring this to life. Because nothing's a given. No opportunity is a given. No career is a given. I talked a lot about this with Edward Norton: the gift to work on something where every day \u2014 whether listening to the musicians we were playing, or the musicians that inspired them, or reading the authors that inspired them \u2014 you learn more about yourself.\"\n\nChalamet told \"60 Minutes\" he's not sure what he'd say to Dylan if he ever did meet him \u2013 but maybe not even mention the movie, and only talk about the weather: \"What his favorite sandwich is, or something like that ... I would play it super cool, you know? 'Cause I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise.\"\n\nChalamet won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.\n\nNominated for 8 Academy Awards, \"A Complete Unknown,\" released by Searchlight Pictures, is playing in theaters. and is available via VOD.\n\nSee also:\n\nColman Domingo, \"Sing Sing\"\n\nAt New York's Sing Sing prison, the organization Rehabilitation Through the Arts, or RTA, was formed to produce plays featuring incarcerated men performing classics by Shakespeare, as well as original plays that spoke to the lived experiences of men. The value of theater as a tool of reform was made palpable by RTA's success; compared to the prison's typical recidivism rate of 60%, only 3% of former inmates who had taken part in RTA were back in prison three years or less after their release.\n\nDirected by Greg Kwedar, the film \"Sing Sing\" was built on the experiences of real-life former inmates (two of whom, Clarence Maclin and John Divine G Whitfield, share an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay). Colman Domingo was nominated for playing Divine G, a founding member of Sing Sing's theater program and an award-winning author.\n\nIn this scene, Divine G attends a clemency hearing and describes to the commissioners how the prison program grew into something he calls \"wonderful\":\n\nDomingo was a journeyman actor whose work in recent years has exploded, from \"Fear the Walking Dead\" and \"Euphoria,\" to \"The Color Purple\" and \"The Madness.\" He received two Tony Award nominations (for acting in the musical \"The Scottsboro Boys\" and producing the play \"Fat Ham\"). He earned his first Oscar nomination last year for playing civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"\n\nHe talked about his recent success on \"CBS Mornings\" last November: \"I feel that it's been a long time in my journey, where suddenly the roles are sort of meeting my skill set and what I'm curious about and what I can do. So, it just feels like I'm a journeyman actor. I've been working for 34 years, and it just feels like, I never knew what this time would be like.\"\n\nLast March, on the day of the Oscars, Domingo posted a picture of himself on Instagram as a child, writing, \"His dream came true. Not easily. With dedication, hard work, hardships, triumphs, pitfalls, detours, reroutes and love and faith. Today is a good day for this kid. He already won. And as you can tell he always loved a pop of color. Got it from his parents.\"\n\nThat \"pop of color\" led to Domingo being asked by Anna Wintour to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala. \"She actually said, 'I'm not sure if you'd be interested in something like this or if you have time,'\" Domingo laughed. \"I said, 'I think I have time!'\"\n\n\"Sing Sing,\" released by A24, is available on VOD.\n\nSee also:\n\nRalph Fiennes, \"Conclave\"\n\nIn the thriller \"Conclave,\" based on Robert Harris' novel, Ralph Fiennes plays a Vatican insider tasked with running the gathering of the College of Cardinals in Rome to select a new pope. As Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, Fiennes navigates the intrigue of papal politics, a reluctant player consumed with doubt.\n\nIn this scene, Lawrence gives a sermon about the power of uncertainty in faith.\n\n\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.\n\n\"I was brought up a Catholic and then rebelled when I was 13,\" Fiennes said. \"My mother was a committed Catholic. So, 'God questions' have been in my family since I was a child.\"\n\nAnd did he come away with any answers to his own questions? \"No, I came away with more questions,\" he said.\n\nFiennes was nominated for an Oscar twice before, for \"Schindler's List\" and \"The English Patient.\" His performance in \"Conclave\" also earned him Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA nominations.\n\n\"Conclave\" is playing in theaters and is available via VOD.\n\nSebastian Stan, \"The Apprentice\"\n\nIn \"The Apprentice,\" set in 1970s and '80s New York City, a young Donald Trump, trying to take charge of his father's real estate business, comes under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, a notorious attorney-fixer, who instructs Trump on how to promote himself in the media. Cohn's dictum: Attack, attack, attack. Deny, deny, deny. Never admit defeat \u2026 lessons that Trump would carry through in his business career, social media projections and, later, political branding.\n\nIn this scene, Trump (best actor nominee Sebastian Stan) tries to sell himself to a newspaper reporter, using the motivation of Cohn (best supporting actor nominee Jeremy Strong) to not-quite-successful effect. It's clear he has a ways to go\u2026\n\nThe film, written by journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Ali Abbasi, premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival. While it received critical praise, potential film distributors shied away after the Trump campaign threatened to sue. The movie was ultimately picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment and released shortly before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn an appearance last October on \"CBS Mornings,\" Stan (whose credits include \"Gossip Girl,\" \"I, Tonya,\" \"Pam & Tommy,\" and playing Bucky Barnes in Marvel's Captain America franchise), admitted that he'd been warned by some to stay away from the project, specifically because it could be seen as a political third rail.\n\n\"Yeah, it's usually when I hear 'Don't do it,' I end up doing it!\" he laughed. \"But generally speaking, I think fear should motivate us to go into the storm, not run away from it.\n\n\"People are going to come into the film with a lot of baggage, a lot of projections [about Trump],\" he said. \"But I think trying to strip away all the noise and getting down to the basics \u2014 what is the emotional need? What is the drive? What was the potential of the man, and where did it end up? How did it all get to this today? And I think there's still value in understanding that.\n\n\"I think the film's about trust,\" said Stan. \"I think we have an opportunity to look at these people and genuinely ask ourselves, do we trust them? Can we use our human instinct rather than what we're being told to think, feel, and understand? Can we use our instinct to trust these people as we're going forward into the future?\"\n\nThis is Stan's first Academy Award nomination. He received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his \"Apprentice\" performance as well. This year he also received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in \"A Different Man.\"\n\n\"The Apprentice,\" nominated for two Oscars, is available via VOD.\n\nSee also:\n\nMore on the 2025 Oscars:"

            "full_content": "The following content is sponsored by PragerU.\n\nAndrew Breitbart famously said, \u201cPolitics is downstream from culture.\u201d This simple yet profound statement reveals the key to saving America. The left has long understood this principle, which is why they spent decades infiltrating media, entertainment, and education. They know that shaping culture is the surest way to shape society\u2014and they have been relentless in their mission.\n\nThe consequences are everywhere: an entire generation is bombarded with anti-American, leftist propaganda from celebrities, social media influencers, and corporate media. The loudest voices in our culture push socialism and open borders. They demand \u201ctrans visibility,\u201d bash President Trump, and rage against Elon Musk and DOGE for exposing government corruption.\n\nBut there is hope. Common sense is finally fighting back. Young people are questioning the radical ideas they\u2019ve been force-fed, and for the first time in decades, conservatism is gaining ground among the youth and in the age of social media, there has never been a better time to cultivate the next generation of young thought leaders than now.\n\nThis is where PragerU steps in.\n\nFor over a decade, PragerU has been at the forefront of changing the national conversation by reaching young people where they are\u2014online. In 2024 alone, PragerU videos were viewed nearly two billion times, with over 60 percent of its YouTube audience under the age of 35. More importantly, these videos change minds. A recent survey found that 70 percent of viewers reported changing their stance on an important issue after watching PragerU content.\n\nEven left-wing media outlets have been forced to acknowledge PragerU\u2019s influence. MSN recently admitted:\n\n\u201cAlthough PragerU traditionally sticks to multi-minute videos, they\u2019ve also gotten good at delivering short-form video clips with hard-hitting sound bytes, mastering a niche where conservatives often neglect to tread. This makes them highly influential among younger voters, an important voting bloc that turned out en force for the 2024 election cycle.\u201d\n\nPragerU doesn\u2019t just reach young conservatives\u2014it reaches young people across the aisle. In fact, 25 percent of PragerU viewers are not conservative. This means we are persuading the very people the left relies on to maintain their cultural dominance.\n\nBut they\u2019re just getting started.\n\nPragerU Is Looking for the Next Rising Conservative Star\n\nYoung people today are still lost. They\u2019re being misled by celebrities, influencers, and activists who tell them that America is the problem, that success is oppression, and that victimhood is a virtue. But we know their minds can be changed\u2014PragerU has a proven track record of doing just that.\n\nThat\u2019s why PragerU is launching a nationwide casting call to find the next generation of conservative influencers\u2014young, dynamic personalities who love truth, freedom, and America. If that sounds like you\u2014or someone you know\u2014this could be the opportunity to make a real impact.\n\nIn addition to working with some of the movement\u2019s most influential voices like Michael Knowles, Allie Beth Stuckey, and Charlie Kirk, PragerU has a history of cultivating the next generation of conservative leaders. Here are just a few of the talents PragerU has helped launch:\n\nWill Witt became a favorite among young conservatives with his Man on the Street interviews, short documentaries, and viral videos on PragerU, bringing millions of new viewers to the movement.\n\nAmala Ekpunobi was once a leftist activist\u2014until PragerU helped her become one of the most powerful free-thinking young voices in the country.\n\nAldo Buttazzoni joined PragerU after gaining national attention for exposing \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d drag shows in Dallas. His PragerU short documentary on masculinity, as well as his interviews with everyday Americans, conservative commentators, and young entrepreneurs, have garnered millions of views.\n\nCJ Pearson, the current Co-Chair of the GOP Youth Advisory Council, joined PragerU to help reach millions of young Americans through 5-Minute Videos, PragerU\u2019s Left vs. Right series, and recapping the biggest news of the week in PragerU\u2019s The Wrap Up.\n\nAlexis Wilkins, a country singer and unapologetic supporter of America\u2019s armed service members and veterans, blends entertainment, politics, and conservative values as a young cultural commentator.\n\nXaviaer DuRousseau was a BLM activist who transformed into one of Gen Z\u2019s strongest conservative voices. The former woke social justice warrior now hosts PragerU\u2019s new show Respectfully, Xaviaer, tackling pop culture and politics with a \u201cZillennial\u201d point of view.\n\nFranklin Camargo, a political refugee from Venezuela, uses his platform and PragerU Espa\u00f1ol to warn against the dangers of socialism and advocate for capitalism and free speech.\n\nPragerU has a proven track record of finding talent and amplifying their voices to reach millions with a pro-America message. If you want to join the movement as PragerU\u2019s next personality, apply today!\n\nHollywood and the corporate media have spent billions promoting young leftist influencers to spread their radical agenda. It\u2019s time for us to build up our rising stars\u2014the voices that will inspire young Americans to love their country, embrace freedom, and reject the left\u2019s destructive ideology.\n\nThis is the new front in the fight for America\u2019s future. If politics is downstream from culture, then culture is where we must win.\n\nAre you ready to be part of the movement?\n\nPragerU is looking for the next conservative influencer. Could it be you?\n\nTo learn more about how to apply, visit PragerU\u2019s official casting call page here."

            "full_content": "A flight officer scans the water in the southern Indian Ocean during a search for MH370 on March 22, 2014. Photo: Rob Griffith/AP Photo\n\nThe third search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has begun, 11 years after the plane practically vanished. On Sunday, a ship belonging to the American maritime-survey company Ocean Infinity arrived at a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean where the plane is believed to have crashed. It then deployed a trio of advanced robot subs three miles under the waves to scan the seabed using sonar waves. If successful, the effort will locate the wreckage of the aircraft together with the black boxes that will allow investigators to solve the mystery. If not, it will effectively disprove the analysis underlying the seabed search and suggest that officials bungled some fundamental assumptions.\n\nThe first underwater search for the missing plane was launched more than a decade ago, months after MH370 disappeared from air-traffic controllers\u2019 screens on March 8, 2014, during a routine red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China. Scientists at the satellite-communications company Inmarsat later found that the plane had sent seven automatic radio signals before vanishing for good. In analyzing the data, scientists were able to extract a route from Malaysia into the southern Indian Ocean and concluded that the plane\u2019s wreckage must lie near the end point of this path. Australia, which was responsible for finding the plane due to the search-and-rescue zone, hired a Dutch marine-survey company, Fugro, which dispatched a trio of ships to drag underwater sensors over the seabed. At first, officials were highly confident that they would locate the plane in short order, with one boasting that they had a 97 percent chance of success. But the plane was not in the search area measuring 46,000 square miles. Fugro increased the size of the search zone, then increased it again, without success. In 2017, the search was abandoned.\n\nHopes for finding the plane on the seabed would have ended there had not Ocean Infinity stepped forward the following year and offered to restart the search on its own dime, with payment only forthcoming if it was successful in finding MH370. Ocean Infinity used newer technology: autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that could prowl the depths in packs. Deployed from a single ship, the AUVs scanned an area nearly as big as the first search in a fraction of the time. But this effort, too, was in vain, and Ocean Infinity\u2019s second search was called off in May 2018.\n\nIn the years since its first search, Ocean Infinity has earned a name for itself as a highly capable underwater-survey company, not least by locating the wreck of a missing Argentine submarine in 2018. Since 2022, Ocean Infinity has launched a fleet of eight state-of-the-art, 250-foot-long ships that are capable of operating autonomously. It is one of these, Armada 78 06, that is currently on station in the search area, tending a flotilla of AUVs.\n\nAfter the second search, there was no reason to continue looking. Any reasonable scenario involving the plane\u2019s direction, speed, or changes in heading would have resulted in an end point in the ocean that had already been scanned. Malaysia, which retained overall responsibility for the investigation, announced that it would not authorize any further searches unless \u201cnew and credible information\u201d emerged indicating where exactly the plane had ended up.\n\nNo such information was forthcoming, but over the years various independent researchers continued to study the mystery, with some speculating that various lines of evidence all indicated a final resting place close to 35 degrees south latitude. The area had already been searched twice, but the ocean floor is rugged enough that the wreckage just might have been missed by earlier searches because it had fallen behind an outcropping or into a ravine. (Alternatively, if someone had hijacked the plane, they might have put it into an extended glide that took it beyond the area scanned so far.) It\u2019s this area that Ocean Infinity has now begun to search, less than a tenth of the size of previous searches. If the wreckage is there, the AUVs will likely find it quickly.\n\nGiven the scope of the search, it\u2019s entirely possible that the seabed scan will be finished before the 11th anniversary of MH370\u2019s disappearance in two weeks. If the wreckage is found, Armada 78 06 will likely deploy a different kind of robot sub called an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) to retrieve the black boxes, including a flight-data recorder that will show exactly how the plane flew into the southern ocean and a cockpit voice recorder that may contain clues about what happened to the pilots.\n\nIf the wreckage is not found, the picture will be altogether different. The plane\u2019s absence will strongly suggest that the authorities must have made a fundamental error when they analyzed the Inmarsat data. It will no longer be possible to say that they were just unlucky, that they happened to draw a line around a part of the probability distribution that didn\u2019t include the plane. By this point, every point in the ocean where the plane could plausibly have gone will have been searched. One or more of their assumptions must have been wrong.\n\nThere could be a positive outcome to the failure of the third and final seabed search: a long-overdue realization that investigators have been sleepwalking down a dead-end path. This, hopefully, will spur those responsible for finding the plane to acknowledge the failure of the past approach and bring in fresh blood. The case is too important to let go with a shrug and a wave of the hand. Eleven years ago, 239 people disappeared into the night. Until we make every effort to figure out what happened \u2014 including taking the painful step of admitting that all our past efforts were misguided \u2014 then we\u2019ll never solve the case, and there will be no way to say for sure that the same won\u2019t happen again.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Quite frankly, this makes no sense. Photo: Aaron M. Sprecher/Getty Images\n\nMy favorite genre of Donald Trump sound bites are the ones in which he obviously has no idea what he\u2019s talking about but keeps plowing forward regardless \u2014 the verbal equivalent of posting through it. A classic of the form came when he went on-camera in the wake of Hurricane Florence and said that it was \u201cone of the wettest we\u2019ve ever seen, from the standpoint of water.\u201d Trump\u2019s trademark public-speaking strength \u2014 one that, it must be said, has been waning considerably in the past couple of years \u2014 has been to feel entirely comfortable going in front of a camera and, rather than doing even the slightest bit of research to have the faintest notion of what might actually be going on, just winging it. Of all the Trump personality quirks that have lowered our national floor over the last decade, this is one of the most pervasive. We used to mock people for going on television despite being clueless on whatever they\u2019re supposed to be talking about. Now we\u2019re too busy looking at a second screen to notice. We\u2019re like the kids in Charlie Brown cartoons listening to teachers; we just hear the sounds.\n\nBut it\u2019s not like Trump is the only famous person who has made authoritative-sounding ignorance a trademark over the years. As a sports fan, Trump\u2019s soliloquies have always reminded me of a man who mastered the practice a long time ago. I suppose, then, I should not be surprised that people are encouraging him to run for president.\n\nThere are many quintessential Stephen A. Smith clips; he has, after all, built his career on the two-minute segment. But this one from 2018 is my favorite:\n\nStephen A Smith's scouting report for #TNF has Hunter Henry and Derrick Johnson as a key matchup...\n\n\n\nNeither has played a snap for the Chargers or Chiefs all year \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/1NyqfJY52G \u2014 NFL Retweet (@NFLRT) December 13, 2018\n\nTo recap: Smith, while discussing a game he was paid to analyze, mentioned two players who were not in fact on either team playing in the game, emphasized the importance of another who was not currently in the league, and got the name of one of the teams wrong. If he did not have someone else on the panel with him to correct him, he would have just plowed right through. Smith isn\u2019t a sports analyst. He has just mastered the art of sounding like one \u2014 he has, essentially, weaponized sports shouting.\n\nSmith isn\u2019t doing any more research now than he used to, but he and his network have learned that there\u2019s no reason to put him in a position where he\u2019s supposed to spout actual facts. The mistake of the 2018 segment wasn\u2019t that Smith didn\u2019t know anything about the teams he was discussing; it was that ESPN acted as if he was supposed to. Smith\u2019s segments now are constructed to be vague and basically content free \u2014 their main purpose is to generate a takeaway quote (on the 76ers from the other day: \u201cThis season is a joke!\u201d ). Then it\u2019s on to the next segment and the next quote. For all the talk of Smith \u201cdebating\u201d other commentators, that\u2019s not what he does anymore; that would require research or even talking points. It\u2019s much easier and safer to simply roll him out there, let him bark for a while, \u201crespond\u201d to someone else on the panel by cartoonishly furrowing his eyebrows, and cut back so he can bark some more.\n\nSmith has said his favorite debate \u201cpartner\u201d was Skip Bayless because \u201cI didn\u2019t have to show up to a morning meeting with [him].\u201d He used to be famous for writing his newspaper columns (back when he deigned to write anything at all) on his BlackBerry while commuting. He views knowledge as just something that might slow him down, get him bogged down in the annoying minutiae of facts and reality. His primary rhetorical trick is to loudly proclaim something so obvious that only a moron would think otherwise, so that when his opponent attempts to explain why an issue might actually be complicated and involve some nuance, it makes them sound like a sputtering simp. My old friend and Deadspin successor Tommy Craggs once said that Stephen A\u2019s sole skill was being \u201cemphatic on command.\u201d This skill is now the only skill anyone needs.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a skill that transfers easily into our degraded political discourse. After Democrats\u2019 crushing loss in November, the party has been agonizing over ways to appeal to disaffected voters \u2014 especially young men \u2014 who have drifted right over the years, often wooed by straight-talking, ostensibly nonpolitical figures like Joe Rogan. Though Smith has shown plenty of interest in politics, he doesn\u2019t come off as especially partisan (he\u2019s an independent), and, unlike much of the Democratic Party, he\u2019s undeniably entertaining. So why not him? Suddenly, the idea has gained currency. There he is, telling CNBC\u2019s Alex Sherman that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind being in office.\u201d There he is, explaining why Democrats find themselves in such a hole to Pod Save America\u2019s Tommy Vietor.\n\nIn an interview with The New Yorker\u2019s Jay Caspian Kang \u2014 a fine writer who has hopefully not become so much of an online creature that he honestly is taking any of this seriously, though with a headline like \u201cStephen A. Smith for President,\u201d there\u2019s definitely reason to worry \u2014 Smith says, \u201cWoke culture and cancel culture ravaged the country, the Democrats were way more focussed on that than the economy, immigration, and crime.\u201d This is, not to put too fine a point on it, surface-level drivel; it sounds like so much of Smith\u2019s output \u2014 like something your relative would pound onto their Facebook feed, or what a crank radio talk-show listener would call in to blare about while stuck in traffic. It\u2019s basically the political equivalent of \u201cJosh Allen can\u2019t win the big one!\u201d Surely Kang has heard this argument, such as it is, a billion times, and I can\u2019t imagine he takes it seriously at any sort of face value. Were any other person speaking, he\u2019d roll his eyes. But Stephen A. says it so emphatically that it almost takes the shape of an actual thought.\n\nThese two paragraphs in Kang\u2019s piece are telling. I have put the words that Smith actually says in bold.\n\n\u201cThey need to cleanse the Democratic Party as we know it,\u201d Smith told me in a phone call on Wednesday. Career politicians and consultants should still have some say in how future campaigns should be run, but he believed the Party, as a whole, had adhered to a litany of failed ideas and practices. \u201cThe Republicans said, \u2018We want Donald Trump,\u2019 \u201d Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been that way for ten years now. The Democrats say, \u2018It\u2019s Hillary\u2019s turn, now it\u2019s Biden\u2019s turn, now it\u2019s Kamala Harris\u2019s turn.\u2019 \u201d This succession of entitled candidates not only ignored voters who were indicating they wanted change; the Party swapped out kitchen-table issues for a series of alluring, and ultimately destructive, ideas about justice. \u201cWoke culture and cancel culture ravaged the country,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe Democrats were way more focussed on that than the economy, immigration, and crime.\u201d\n\nSmith also believes that the Party cannot overly engage in \u201cdemagoguery\u201d against Trump because the American people have grown tired of that message and are looking, instead, for someone who will take a more analytical approach. \u201cIf he\u2019s doing something good, let\u2019s say so,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf he\u2019s doing something harmful, let\u2019s say so.\u201d He has his reservations about Musk, but he does not object, in theory, to someone performing an audit of the federal government and trying to find pockets of waste and inefficiency. \u201cWhy are we reacting like this when we haven\u2019t even discovered everything he\u2019s found?\u201d Smith asked.\n\nI am not sure exactly what sort of political savior could save us from this moment, or whether one could actually exist, but, come on: \u201cWhy are we reacting like this?\u201d Uh, that definitely ain\u2019t it. (What a slogan! Get your picket signs and get out in the streets! Vive la r\u00e9sistance!) Why are we reacting like this? Seriously, what is this shit?\n\nThere are some completed thoughts in the above paragraphs, but they\u2019re Kang\u2019s, not Stephen A\u2019s. Smith\u2019s political \u201canalysis\u201d is a knee-jerk mishmash of RFK Jr. -style \u201cjust asking questions\u201d and the worst version of both-sides journalism, combined with a near-total lack of interest in what Trump or Musk may actually be doing. Most of his comments sound like a guy trying to pretend he prepared for his next camera segment. Who, exactly, was saying it was Biden\u2019s \u201cturn?\u201d When did Kamala Harris focus on \u201cwoke culture?\u201d (Probably not when she was talking about \u201clethal fighting forces\u201d in her nomination acceptance speech.) I\u2019m reminded of John Mulaney\u2019s great joke that the New York Post reads like \u201csomeone read a better newspaper and now they\u2019re trying to text you everything they can remember. Doesn\u2019t have to be right, just has to be short.\u201d Smith talks about politics like he scrolled through Post headlines and, to use Mulaney\u2019s term, \u201cgot the gist.\u201d Which is not all that different from how he talks about sports.\n\nLook, I\u2019ve got a long and complicated history with Smith myself, but I\u2019ll confess to have softened on him a bit in recent years. He has a shtick, and I do think this shtick has been corrosive to any sort of intelligent sports discourse, but I do not believe Smith is malevolent and, in the end, I do suspect his heart is generally in the right place, if it hasn\u2019t been entirely consumed by his persona at this point. In an age of Barstool and Pat McAfee, Smith is hardly the worst guy on the lot. He does seem to have an occasional sense of humor about himself \u2014 you can sense an earnest, even kinda likably dopey guy in there somewhere, as evidenced by his ever-amusing appearances on General Hospital. And anybody who does this to Jason Whitlock by definition cannot be all bad.\n\nBut in a world where expertise, rationality, and complexity are under constant assault by cartoonishly vile people foundationally motivated by willful and aggressive ignorance, the Stephen A. Smith political boomlet represents a deeply flawed kind of counterattack. The reasoning here is nothing more than \u201cHey, they have a bunch of people who don\u2019t know anything, maybe we should get our own person who doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d Stephen A. Smith for president \u2014 my God, I do not think I have ever written a more ridiculous phrase \u2014 is the result of giving up, of ceding everything that actually matters. If he is any sort of answer, then quite frankly we are not serious people."

            "full_content": "Britain\u2019s top LGBTQ+ charity is reportedly considering cutting half of its staff as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump freezing foreign aid payments.\n\nFar-left LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall has become so reliant on money from American taxpayers that up to half of its 114-person staff may be let go after foreign aid from the United States was cut off as a part of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda.\n\nAccording to a report from The Times of London, Stonewall staff were told last week that there would be a restructuring to \u201csecure the future of Stonewall for the long term as a significant LGBTQ+ organisation able to deliver impactful campaigns and legislative change across the UK and further afield\u201d.\n\nThe British paper of record said that insiders within the charity warned that such a restructuring could result in up to half of its staff being laid off.\n\nThe leftist charity received over half a million pounds sterling in the past three years from the American taxpayer through a State Department cutout known as the Global Equality Fund (GEF), which focussed on \u201cadvancing LGBTI rights around the world\u201d.\n\nAccording to the most recent accounting, the U.S. government foreign aid fund gave Stonewall \u00a3137,254 in 2021-22, \u00a3204,442 in 2022-23 and \u00a3233,583, making the American taxpayer the largest funder of the British LGBTQ+ charity during the time span.\n\nWhile Stonewall has claimed that its decision to \u2018restructure\u2019 its operation was motivated by several factors, chief executive Simon Blake previously acknowledged that the Trump administration\u2019s move to suspend foreign aid would impact \u201cprogrammes supporting LGBTQ+ communities around the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cStonewall\u2019s work in eastern Europe and the Caucasus is enabled by many funders, including the US government, and supports communities and law enforcement agencies to respond to anti-LGBTQ+ violence, often providing vital services to victims,\u201d he added.\n\nTherefore, Blake said that Stonewall would seek to \u201cmitigate the impact of the US government\u2019s decision\u201d.\n\nIn addition to the United States government, the leftist charity has also previously taken in millions from the British government, including under so-called Conservative party rule.\n\nOne of Stonewall\u2019s key influence operations has been to provide or sponsor woke training seminars to government officials, media companies, and educators in which they would lecture on the ever-evolving politically correct terminology, such as telling schools to stop using the words \u201cboys and girls\u201d and to use phrases like \u201clearners\u201d. On the backend, this was essentially enforced with diversity scores handed out by the charity to various organisations.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a backlash as the charity became increasingly radical on gender politics, particularly for downplaying biological sex and promoting the concept of \u201cgender identity\u201d, which have sparked accusations that the charity was promoting transgender issues at the expense of women. The charity also came under fire for its vociferous promotion of puberty-blocking drugs for children, the\n\nPublic backlash against the radical ideology promoted by Stonewall saw major institutions such as the BBC, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), and broadcasting regulator Ofcom, among others withdraw from its so-called \u201cDiversity Champion\u201d scheme and distance themselves from the organisation. Last month, The Times reported that every major government department had withdrawn from the diversity scheme."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe White House is suspending the active security clearances of lawyers from the large legal defense firm Covington & Burling who are working with former special counsel Jack Smith, who prosecuted Donald Trump unsuccessfully on behalf of the Justice Department under the Biden administration.\n\nAccording to a memo released Tuesday by the White House, all executive agencies are to suspend the clearances that may be used by Covington lawyers in private practice as the White House launches a \u201creview and determination of their roles and responsibilities, if any, in the weaponization of the judicial process.\u201d\n\nThe direction from Trump is clear pushback to the firm\u2019s work now, as it represents Smith as a private citizen facing investigations from Republicans. It also marks an escalation of the White House\u2019s retaliation against those who have supported the former special counsel\u2019s work.\n\nThe president, targeting Smith, said ahead of signing the memo in the Oval Office on Tuesday, \u201cWe\u2019re going to call it the deranged Jack Smith signing or bill.\u201d\n\nCovington lawyers are not the first attorneys to represent people perceived as political enemies of Trump who have lost their security clearances. Those clearances can allow them flexibility in practicing law when it relates to national security issues and classified aspects of cases.\n\nThe suspension of security clearances for private practice lawyers at Covington who previously held significant DOJ roles is a startling political approach that has rattled lawyers across Washington. It\u2019s long been a protected right for defendants and others facing investigations to be able to use lawyers of their choosing.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing less than a petty and vindictive attack on the legal profession, and particularly the ability of a select group of cleared lawyers to defend the interests of officials across the intelligence community,\u201d said Washington national security attorney Bradley Moss in response to the White House\u2019s move. Moss is a law partner of Mark Zaid, who also has had his security clearance revoked. \u201cThe bigger question is, how far is he going to take this war against the legal profession, and against anyone who stands for the rule of law?\u201d\n\nWhite House aide Will Scharf said ahead of the signing, \u201cOne law firm that provided pro bono legal services to the special counsel\u2019s office under Jack Smith\u2019s leadership was Covington & Burling. As a result of those actions, we\u2019re now going to be suspending and putting under review the security clearances for the attorneys and employees at that firm who worked with Jack Smith\u2019s team.\u201d\n\nIn response to the White House\u2019s move, a Covington spokesman said on Tuesday: \u201cWe recently agreed to represent Jack Smith when it became apparent that he would become a subject of a government investigation. Covington serves as defense counsel to Jack Smith in his personal, individual capacity.\u201d\n\nThe firm declined to provide any more information about a possible investigation into Smith, though Trump, appointees in his Justice Department, and Republicans in Congress have made clear they intend to revisit Smith\u2019s office\u2019s work. Covington also didn\u2019t say if or how many of its lawyers had active security clearances.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to defending Mr. Smith\u2019s interests and appreciate the trust he has placed in us to do so,\u201d the statement also said.\n\nSmith disclosed in a federal ethics form recently that Covington & Burling provided $140,000 worth of legal services to him as a gift.\n\nThe two lawyers at Covington representing Smith are Lanny Breuer, the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, and Peter Koski, formerly a public integrity prosecutor."
