            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal judge has indefinitely blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender service members, dealing a major defeat to a controversial policy the president resurrected from his first term.\n\nIn a scathing ruling, US District Judge Ana Reyes said the administration cannot enforce the ban \u2014 which was set to take effect later this month.\n\nReyes, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote that the ban \u201cis soaked in animus and dripping with pretext. Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2013 some risking their lives \u2013 to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe judge said she was pausing her preliminary injunction until Friday morning to give the administration time to appeal it to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by transgender active-duty service members and others hoping to enlist in the military who would be barred from service under the ban. Reyes said they had shown that they would likely succeed on their claim that the ban violated rights afforded to them by the Constitution.\n\nDays after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directing the Pentagon to implement its own policies that say transgender service members are incompatible with military service. The government had argued that continuing to permit trans individuals to serve in the US would negatively affect, among other things, the military\u2019s lethality, readiness and cohesion.\n\n\u201cDefendants have not provided a legitimate reason for banning all transgender troops,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Defense Department for comment.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued that the president had broad authority to determine who can serve in the military, but Reyes rejected that argument in her ruling, writing: \u201cThe President has the power \u2014 indeed the obligation \u2014 to ensure military readiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt times, however, leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons,\u201d Reyes continued. \u201cFirst minorities, then women in combat, then gays filled in that blank. Today, however, our military is stronger and our Nation is safer for the millions of such blanks (and all other persons) who serve.\u201d\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, a similar ban he issued in 2017 that drew at least four lawsuits arguing the prohibition represented an unconstitutional form of sex discrimination. Federal district courts across the nation temporarily blocked the ban from taking effect. Judges from Washington, DC, to Washington state said that it violated the constitutional rights of transgender people.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, let the ban take effect in 2019, but did not rule on whether it was constitutional before President Joe Biden reversed it in 2021.\n\nLate last month, the Pentagon released its guidance implementing Trump\u2019s order. The guidance said the military would kick out transgender service members who don\u2019t meet specific requirements under its new policy.\n\n\u201cService members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria will be processed for separation from military service,\u201d said a memo outlining the new policy, which was signed by the official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\n\n\u201cThe Department only recognizes two sexes: male and female,\u201d the policy memo says. \u201cAn individual\u2019s sex is immutable, unchanging during a person\u2019s life. All service members will only serve in accordance with their sex.\u201d\n\nAt the time, a senior defense official said there are 4,240 service members across active-duty, reserve, and the National Guard with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, defined as the psychological distress an individual feels when their gender identity differs from their gender at birth. But not every transgender individual has gender dysphoria.\n\nThe official said that approximately 1,000 service members have received gender-affirming surgery between 2014 and 2025.\n\nReyes\u2019 ruling was quickly hailed by the lawyers representing the ban\u2019s challengers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decisive ruling speaks volumes,\u201d said Jennifer Levi, an attorney with GLAD Law. \u201cThe Court\u2019s unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the Court\u2019s clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Haley Britzky contributed to this report."

That\u2019s a number that for decades has trended downward as the country\u2019s population has diversified, but it\u2019s still more than six times larger than the share of Black and Hispanic voters (11% each) and nearly 25 times that of Asian voters (3%).\n\nTypically, the white vote is understood as being Republican-friendly, with pronounced gender and education gaps.\n\nBut there is a more useful \u2014 and revealing \u2014 way to understand the politics of white voters, something that is evident in the new NBC News poll. Call this the gap within the gap.\n\nIt represents a layering of the education gap (which has exploded during the Trump era) on top of the more established gender gap. When these are combined, a gaping chasm emerges \u2014 and two specific groups come into focus.\n\nOn one end are white men without four-year college degrees. This is a generally blue-collar demographic that is now deeply aligned with Trump and opposed to progressive politics. On the other end are white women with at least a four-year college degree. This is a more affluent demographic that has been racing leftward, particularly on cultural issues, and is squarely opposed to President Donald Trump.\n\nBoth groups pack a formidable punch. Eighteen percent of all voters last year were non-college white men and 17% were college-educated white women. And they have come to exist in polar opposite political and cultural universes, each one unrelatable and probably unrecognizable to the other.\n\nThis is captured vividly in the NBC News poll. Take a basic question: Do voters have a positive or negative view of Trump? Among all voters \u2014 regardless of race, gender or class \u2014 46% have a positive view and 49% a negative one. Among white voters only, Trump is a bit more popular: 52% have a positive opinion compared with 45% who have a negative opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, 69% of white men without a degree view Trump positively and just 28% see him negatively \u2014 a 41-point net-positive rating. And among white women with a degree, it\u2019s 29% positive and 67% negative \u2014 for a net-negative of 38 points. That adds up to a whopping 79-point net rating gap between these two groups when it comes to their perception of Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to the various aspects of Trump\u2019s job performance, the splits are just as massive.\n\nMore from the NBC News poll: American voters are deeply divided on DEI programs and political correctness, by Bridget Bowman\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pushes back against calls to impeach judges who rule against Trump\n\nBy Lawrence Hurley\n\nChief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement today rebuking President Donald Trump and his allies for calling to impeach judges who have ruled against the administration.\n\n\u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\u201d Roberts said in a statement.\n\nTrump allies have called for various judges to be impeached for blocking administration policies in the first months of his second term.\n\nBut Trump himself raised the stakes on Tuesday, when he called for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg after he blocked the deportation of Venezuelan migrants.\n\n\u201cThis judge, like many of the Crooked Judges\u2019 I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d Trump posted.\n\nSoon after Roberts issued his statement, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, wrote in a post on X that he had introduced articles of impeachment against Boasberg. He claimed Boasberg had committed an impeachable offense by issuing a temporary restraining order against the administration over its novel invocation of a wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport certain illegal immigrants.\n\nWhile a handful of federal judges have been removed from office in the past, it has been because of gross misconduct in office, such as taking bribes, not as a result of individual decisions they have made.\n\nFederal judges have frequently intervened on Trump\u2019s agenda since he took office again in January and began implementing a set of aggressive policies that have raised several novel legal issues. That has angered the administration and the broader MAGA base, leading to increasingly frequent calls for impeachment and raising concerns within the judiciary.\n\nRead more from Lawrence \u2192\n\nRelated: DOJ refuses to answer some questions from the judge who blocked Alien Enemies Act deportations, by Gary Grumbach, Chloe Atkins and Dareh Gregorian\n\nExplainer: How Congress could \u2014 but probably won\u2019t \u2014 impeach a federal judge, by Frank Thorp V, Kyle Stewart and Lawrence Hurley\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \u27a1\ufe0f Gaza ceasefire collapses: Israel\u2019s military launched the deadliest strikes on the Gaza Strip since the agreement of its ceasefire with Hamas, killing hundreds of people and threatening to compromise the fragile truce.

            "full_content": "Trump and Musk in the hypermasculine world of UFC. Photo: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nArguments over how Trump won and Democrats lost in 2024 remain in the background of today\u2019s political discourse: Trump fans are focused on exaggerating the size and significance of the GOP victory, and Democrats are mostly settling scores with one another. But there\u2019s also some serious analysis of hard data underway. And this week, an election diagnosis from Blue Rose Research\u2019s David Shor, who was interviewed by Vox\u2019s Eric Levitz and the New York Times\u2019 Ezra Klein, is drawing particular attention.\n\nMuch of Shor\u2019s findings confirm the conventional wisdom about how Trump won in 2024, including three main points: (1) Trump made significant gains as compared to his 2020 performance among Black, Latino, Asian American, immigrant and under-30 voters; (2) Trump did better among marginally engaged voters than did Kamala Harris, reversing an ancient assumption that Democrats would benefit from relatively high turnout; and (3) inflation was the overriding issue among persuadable voters, even as Democrats overemphasized the threat to democracy posed by Trump\u2019s return to power.\n\nIt\u2019s Shor\u2019s explanation of why these trends occurred that\u2019s most interesting. Among every Trump-trending slice of the electorate, unique pressures related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic inflation that followed undermined support for the incumbent Democratic Party. But there were some other things going on. For example, the non-white-voters trends reflected, Shor told Levitz, a delayed ideological polarization that had hit white voters decades ago:\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nTo put it another way, non-white voters were disproportionately loyal to the Democratic Party for many years, and that loyalty inevitably began to wear off. The intense ideological polarization of the 2024 election sped that process along, even though one might expect that Trump\u2019s barely concealed racism and overt nativism would slow it down. Why didn\u2019t they? Mostly, Shor suggests, because Trump-trending voters weren\u2019t viewing or reading media coverage of the 45th president\u2019s horrific views and conduct:\n\nPeople who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They\u2019re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it\u2019s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don\u2019t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nThe massive impact of diverse media consumption is most evident in Shor\u2019s analysis of the single-most-stunning finding about the 2024 results: the huge gender gap among young voters, with Trump doing exceptionally well among young men, as he explained to Klein:\n\n18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics \u2026\n\nIf you look at zoomers, there are some really interesting ways that they\u2019re very different in the data. They\u2019re much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them.\n\nIf I were going to speculate, I\u2019d say phones and social media have a lot to do with this.\n\nKlein suggests some very specific points of divergence between young men and young women that Shor agrees with entirely:\n\nIt seems plausible to me that social media and online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get. If you\u2019re a 23-year-old man interested in the Ultimate Fighting Championship and online, you\u2019re being driven into a very intensely male online world.\n\nWhereas, if you\u2019re a 23-year-old female and your interests align with what the YouTube algorithm codes, you are not entering that world. You\u2019re actually entering the opposite world. You\u2019re seeing Bren\u00e9 Brown and all these other things.\n\nFinally, Shor provides some definitive evidence that Democratic messaging about Trump\u2019s anti-democratic characteristics fell on rocky ground. By an astonishing 78 percent to 18 percent margin, voters said \u201cdelivering change that improves Americans\u2019 lives\u201d was more important than \u201cpreserving America\u2019s institutions.\u201d This finding suggests that in 2024, and right now, Democrats should exploit Trump\u2019s broken promises about the economy and other practical concerns instead of focusing on how Trump has broken those promises. This isn\u2019t a binary choice as much as a perspective on how to talk about outrages like Elon Musk\u2019s assault on the federal government, which negatively affects the benefits and services Americans rely on and is intended to benefit Musk\u2019s fellow plutocrats via skewed tax cuts and paralysis of corporate oversight, as Shor told Levitz:\n\nTrump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party \u2014 namely, they\u2019re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they\u2019re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It\u2019s Paul Ryan\u2013ism on steroids.\n\nSo, in office, Trump may be undermining the very trends that made his 2024 comeback possible. That\u2019s important to know."

            "full_content": "Photo: Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nAs it turns out, there may be some unintended consequences to telling the world that you once got so high on magic mushrooms that you thought Courteney Cox\u2019s toilet had turned into a head, which then talked to you as you were peeing in it.\n\nIn his memoir, Spare, Prince Harry admitted to doing various recreational drugs including marijuana, cocaine, and several psychedelics. The British royal probably didn\u2019t think this was a big deal, as he is not an elected official, we\u2019re well past the \u201cI didn\u2019t inhale\u201d era, and he spilled lots of far juicier gossip in the book.\n\nBut in March 2023, two months after his memoir was released, the Heritage Foundation raised concerns that Harry may have lied on his visa application when he moved to the U.S. in 2020, responding to questions about current and past drug use that all applicants must answer. The conservative think tank behind Project 2025 tried to obtain Harry\u2019s immigration records under the Freedom of Information act. The Department of Homeland Security denied the request, so the Heritage Foundation sued.\n\nNow, after a lengthy legal battle, Harry\u2019s records are set to be released. On Saturday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled in favor of the Heritage Foundation, ordering the Department of Homeland Security to release redacted versions of Harry\u2019s immigration documents by the end of the day on Tuesday.\n\nTheoretically, Prince Harry could be in trouble with immigration authorities if he lied on his application, as CBS News explains:\n\nAdmission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S..\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t seem very likely that Harry, who lives in California with his American wife, Meghan Markle, and their two young children, is going to be deported.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation said all along that it was pursuing Prince Harry\u2019s files to make a broader point about the Department of Homeland Security allegedly giving certain people preferential treatment under the Biden administration, as CNN reported:\n\nAttorneys for the Heritage Foundation see the case as part of a larger effort to uncover non-compliance with the law by DHS in different areas \u2013 including accusations from Republican lawmakers that DHS is \u201cdeliberately refusing to enforce the Country\u2019s immigration laws and is responsible for the current crisis at the border,\u201d court filings read.\n\n\u201cThis is a case that concerns Prince Harry, but what it\u2019s focused on is DHS\u2019s conduct,\u201d Dewey previously said.\n\nThese comments were made in 2023, and obviously a lot has changed since then. The second Trump administration is already cracking down on immigration, with ICE even sweeping up some U.S. visa and green-card holders. Meanwhile, the president is floating the idea of a new \u201cTrump gold card\u201d visa program that would give \u201cvery high-level people\u201d a new \u201croute to citizenship\u201d \u2014 if they pay about $5 million. So presumably highlighting the inequities of the U.S. immigration system is not a top conservative priority at the moment.\n\nImmigration attorney Charles Kuck told CNN that he was \u201cstunned\u201d the judge allowed the release of Harry\u2019s immigration files, and he does not think the prince will be booted from the U.S.\n\n\u201cGiven that many of these facts were known about Harry before he filed for his green card, then I don\u2019t think immigration is going to be able to revoke his green card,\u201d Kuck said. \u201cThis is being done as a publicity stunt, not, I think, to ultimately take Harry\u2019s green card away.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump himself is no longer interested in kicking the prince out of the country. Last year Trump said, somewhat vaguely, that U.S. authorities should take \u201cappropriate action\u201d if it turns out Harry lied on his immigration application. But last month Trump did a 180 when the New York Post asked if he still wants to deport Prince Harry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cI\u2019ll leave him alone. He\u2019s got enough problems with his wife. She\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nWhy did Trump change his tune? It\u2019s unclear. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t want to create any more family drama for King Charles ahead of his second state visit to the U.K. Or maybe Trump meant what he said, and for once people\u2019s distaste for Meghan Markle is working in Prince Harry\u2019s favor."

(Xiomara Vizcaya via AP)\n\nMIAMI -- Franco Caraballo called his wife Friday night, crying and panicked. Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants held at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo\u2019s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny S\u00e1nchez, learned Caraballo was among the more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are now held in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nS\u00e1nchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE\u2019s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that prison in El Salvador, a massive complex where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold the prisoners, many of them Venezuelan. The Venezuelan government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about my son,\u201d said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nAli David Navas Vizcaya had been in U.S. detention since early 2024, when he arrived from Mexico at a U.S. border crossing where he had an appointment to talk to immigration officers. He called her late Friday night and said he thought he was being deported to Venezuela or Mexico. His name is no longer in ICE\u2019s system.\n\nNearly 8 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy collapsed. Most initially went to other Latin American countries but more headed to the U.S. after COVID-19 restrictions lifted during the Biden administration.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservative have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard line to deal with immigration.\n\nThe Trump administration says it is using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Tren de Aragua members, saying the gang was invading the U.S., though it has not provided any evidence to back up gang-membership claims.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged in a court filing Monday that many people sent to El Salvador do not have criminal records, though they insisted all are suspected gang members.\n\n\u201cThe lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat,\u201d said a sworn declaration included in the filing, adding that along with their suspected gang membership \u201cthe lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 3, Caraballo went to an ICE office in Dallas office for another mandatory check-in with the agents handling his asylum request. He had been coming regularly to the office for months.\n\nWhat gang member, his wife asked, would walk into a federal law enforcement office during a Trump administration crackdown that has left immigrants across the country terrified they would be deported?\n\n\u201cWe followed the law like we were told to. We never missed any\u201d meetings with authorities, said S\u00e1nchez, who remains in the U.S. trying to secure her husband\u2019s release. S\u00e1nchez said her husband, who she married in 2024 in Texas, has had no run-ins with the law in the U.S. She also showed The Associated Press a Venezuelan government document showing he has a clean criminal record there.\n\nS\u00e1nchez believes he was wrongly accused of belonging to Tren de Aragua because of a tattoo in the shape of a clock marking the birthday of his daughter from a previous relationship.\n\n\u201cHe has lots of tattoos but that\u2019s not a reason to discriminate against him,\u201d she said.\n\nS\u00e1nchez said she and her husband left Venezuela in 2023 with barely $200 and spent the next three months sleeping in plazas, eating out of trash cans and relying on the goodwill of fellow migrants as they journeyed north.\n\nShe thought the sacrifice would be worth it. Her husband had been working as a barber since the age of 13 and in the United States he was hopeful he could find a new start, escaping the poverty wages and toxic politics of Nicolas Maduro\u2019s ironfisted rule in Venezuela.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has blasted the transfers, calling them \u201ckidnappings\u201d and urging people to protest Tuesday in the capital, Caracas, to demand that detainees in El Salvador be sent to their homeland.\n\nJorge Rodriguez, Maduro\u2019s chief negotiator with the U.S., urged Venezuelans living in the U.S. to return to home.\n\nThe American dream, he said, had turned into \u201ca Salvadoran nightmare.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez agrees. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n\u201cWe fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, and Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis contributed to this report."

Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLast week, Chuck Schumer helped Congress avert a potentially lengthy shutdown by supporting a Republican stopgap bill to fund the government. But in doing so, the Senate minority leader has sparked significant ire from several factions of his party.\n\nAmid the intense backlash, which appeared to prompt a swift postponement of his pending book tour (though security concerns were given as the official reason), Schumer took to the airwaves in a series of interviews Tuesday to defend his position and his leadership role. In an appearance on The View, Schumer made a point he had made before: that the continuing resolution presented by the Republicans was \u201cbad,\u201d but that the prospect of a shutdown would\u2019ve been far worse.\n\n\u201cI knew it was a difficult choice and I knew I\u2019d get a lot of criticism for my choice. But I felt as a leader I had to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer told the hosts that a shutdown would\u2019ve allowed Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and U.S. Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, whom he called a \u201creally evil man,\u201d to enact further deep cuts to government spending, posing a potential risk to key programs like SNAP and Medicaid that could be eliminated under the guise of not being \u201cessential\u201d to government function:\n\n\"I felt as a leader I had to do it.\"\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader @SenSchumer defends his decision to vote for the Republicans' House-approved government funding bill, telling @TheView a government shutdown would have been \"devastation like we have never seen.\" pic.twitter.com/MOvquCLS6M \u2014 The View (@TheView) March 18, 2025\n\nSchumer\u2019s decision to back the Republican funding bill went against House Democrats, who largely voted against the legislation, as well as members of his own caucus who loudly went against the minority leader\u2019s move. Ultimately, only nine Democratic senators joined Schumer in voting to advance the bill. The outrage has prompted speculation that Democrats might seek new leadership in the Senate as groups like Indivisible called on Schumer to step aside. CNN reported last week that some Democrats have even begun to urge people to challenge Schumer for his seat in 2028, specifically naming Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has denounced Schumer\u2019s move as a \u201ctremendous mistake.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about such chatter, Schumer insisted that he\u2019s still the right leader for this moment, citing his Democratic gains in the Senate in 2005 and 2020. \u201cWe have a lot of really strong talent in the House, in the Senate, in the governors. We have a great bench. As for the Senate caucus, of which I\u2019m the leader, I should be the leader,\u201d he said.\n\n.@SenSchumer responds to Democrats questioning his leadership after he supported the Republican spending bill to avert a government shutdown: \"We are united in going after Trump and showing the American people that he is making the middle class pay for the tax cuts on the rich.\" pic.twitter.com/TgwbnlosYR \u2014 The View (@TheView) March 18, 2025\n\nIn an earlier appearance on CBS Mornings, Schumer said Democrats\u2019 strategy of hammering home the impact of Trump\u2019s policies on the lives of everyday Americans is already having an impact. \u201cIf we keep at it every day relentless, fighting and showing how they\u2019re hurting people so badly, Trump\u2019s numbers will get much lower and his \u2014 both popularity and his effectiveness \u2014 will decline,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer on CBS: \"I am the best leader for the Senate ... I am the best at winning Senate seats.\" pic.twitter.com/kWK9dkRsle \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 18, 2025\n\nLast week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the rest of the leadership initially lambasted Schumer\u2019s decision to advance the bill in a statement, writing that Democrats in the chamber \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d But on Monday, Jeffries responded to a reporter asking if he supports Schumer\u2019s leadership in the Senate after avoiding a similar question days earlier. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said."

And while the U.S. military is far from the only one in the world that shows negligence toward civilian life in combat zones, its conduct is the most highly scrutinized and influential in the world given its unrivaled reach, power and interventionism since World War II.\n\nAtop all this, Hegseth is also cutting jobs and offices focused on reducing civilian deaths from U.S. combat operations. Though the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and the Civilian Protection Center were set up during Trump\u2019s first term, in his second term these offices are being framed as an obstacle to the U.S.\u2019 ability to wage war. But retired U.S. Army Gen. Joseph Votel told NPR last week that he believed that it would be harmful to the military\u2019s functioning to remove them. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is designed to be more constricting on commanders. I think it\u2019s really designed to be more informative in helping us be a better educated and smarter force.\u201d\n\nThese changes are all consistent with what we know about Hegseth\u2019s draconian and primitive attitudes toward combat. The former Fox News host \u2014 who has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault, excessive drinking and mismanagement in his previous jobs \u2014 is obsessed with the narrative that the U.S. military has gone soft and needs to be reignited with a \u201cwarrior ethos.\u201d In particular, Hegseth insists that the military is held back by \u201cwokeness.\u201d\n\nIn his book \u201cThe War on Warriors,\u201d Hegseth wrote of his experience as a soldier with the Army National Guard during the George W. Bush administration, \u201cIn some cases, our units were so boxed in by rules and regulations and political correctness, we even second-guess ourselves. That needs to end.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that Hegseth was deployed in the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. In both conflicts, the U.S. carried out morally and strategically catastrophic wars that resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths \u2014 often due to overly permissive rules of engagement \u2014 and torture of locals. The problem wasn\u2019t too many rules, it was too few of them.\n\nIn a breach of norms, Hegseth has appointed his personal lawyer and former naval officer, Timothy Parlatore, as a Navy commander in the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps. Jason Dempse, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former U.S. Army officer, wrote in The Atlantic that Parlatore\u2019s appointment reflected \u201can odious philosophy of warfare\u201d:\n\nLike his new boss at the Pentagon, Parlatore has a pattern of providing support to soldiers accused of grave misconduct, even war crimes. He notably represented Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL court-martialed on charges including the murder of a captured fighter (though he was found guilty only of one, lesser charge), along with a second SEAL accused of serious sexual offenses. Elevating a lawyer with this record does not bode well for the armed services Hegseth hopes to build.\n\nMoreover, as my colleague Steve Benen recently reminded us: Parlatore \u201chad another very high-profile client: Parlatore was part of Donald Trump\u2019s legal defense team after the president was charged with multiple felonies in the classified documents/Mar-a-Lago scandal.\u201d It\u2019s safe to predict that Parlatore isn\u2019t going to be elevating the already-beleaguered moral stature of the U.S. military.\n\nHegseth\u2019s vision for American defense policy is consistent with Trumpism more broadly \u2014 an appetite for strong man rule and a disregard for rule of law and decency. It certainly doesn\u2019t bode well for Trump\u2019s increasingly preposterous claims that he wants to be a president \u201cof peace.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The stock market rose to record heights after Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 re-election. Wall Street reveled in Trump\u2019s promises of even more tax cuts and defanged regulators, not to mention making the world safe for saying all those politically incorrect thoughts about DEI. What could go wrong?\n\nPlenty, it turns out. Trump\u2019s only been in office two months and the S&P 500 is lower than it was before Nov. 6 and in correction territory. The risk of a recession is rising, and confidence for consumers and small businesses is plummeting, even as fears of inflation are increasing. Multiple Fortune 500 companies report a softening in consumer spending. The dreaded word \u201cstagflation\u201d is getting tossed around.\n\nThe Trump administration is hardly offering reassurance.\n\nNo wonder so few people, it seems, want to plan a getaway: The Conference Board reports that under 40% of Americans are planning a vacation in the next six months. In the last 40 years, that number has only been lower during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Recession.\n\nThe Trump administration is hardly offering reassurance. Not only do the president and staffers like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent refuse to rule out the possibility of a recession, they are even arguing that economic pain will result in a better future. The president called it \u201ca period of transition.\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted Trump\u2019s tariff policies will be \u201cworth it\u201d even if they lead to a recession.\n\nAs one banker told the Financial Times, \u201cWith hindsight, we did not appreciate the nature of what the administration was going to be like.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say.\n\nWall Street\u2019s enthusiasm for Donald Trump was always a triumph of hope over experience and evidence. True, absence makes the heart grow fonder, but there were signs everywhere, long before Trump was elected, that he was serious about tariffs \u2014 which Wall Street, rationally or irrationally, abhors \u2014 and other policies that have both roiled the markets and sparked warning signs in the economy since his inauguration. And if nothing else, you would think the chaotic management of the Covid pandemic and violent end of his first term would give the masters of the financial universe pause.\n\nIt did not.\n\nEven in the best of circumstances, Trump is a chaos monster. More than ever before, he\u2019s embraced chaos as both an economic and governing strategy. That is, you shouldn\u2019t need me to tell you, is a risky way to run an economy.\n\nFor example, there is a case to use tariffs in a way that is strategic, stable and reliable, and that would promote the long-term goal of strengthening the nation\u2019s manufacturing capacity. Trump\u2019s approach has none of these qualities. His goals include nonsense like attempting to annex Canada. He imposes them one day only to call them off the next. And even his choice of targets, according to Lutnick, depends not on any rational criteria but on which countries \u201cmake him unhappy.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets and businesses crave stability and predictability; they react poorly to chaos and political favoritism.\n\nThe administration\u2019s approach to slashing government is another issue. Trump has allowed Elon Musk\u2019s minions at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cancel scores of federal contracts and even stiff businesses that have already performed work for the federal government. Many of these actions might well get reversed in the nation\u2019s courts, but for now, universities and other impacted businesses are instituting hiring freezes and laying off employees. Others \u2014 like former Social Security Commissioner Martin O\u2019Malley \u2014 fear that DOGE cuts to Social Security amid false claims of rampant fraud are risking a \u201ctotal system collapse.\u201d All this uncertainty and fear, in turn, is contributing to increasing consumer pessimism.\n\nThen there is Trump\u2019s open corruption and vengeance politics. He\u2019s attacking multiple law firms that have played a role in his various legal woes. At the same time, he and his family are profiting from everything from cryptocurrency sales to Amazon\u2019s $40 million deal to stream an \u201cunprecedented, behind-the-scenes\u201d documentary about Melania Trump.\n\nAs I have pointed out in the past, the United States is a financial giant not just because it is a resource-rich country. We are \u2014 or were \u2014 considered a stable country as well, where the rule of law is enforced fairly and consistently. Financial markets and businesses crave stability and predictability; they react poorly to chaos and political favoritism. Just as people need some assurance that their job will be there for them tomorrow before they make a big purchase, the same is true for businesses. They can\u2019t plan for the future if they don\u2019t have a secure sense of what their underlying expenses and sales will be \u2014 something that is increasingly impossible in the Trump economy.\n\n\u201cThe problem for the markets is when they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said billionaire investor Marc Lasry last week. \u201cAn economy can\u2019t survive like that.\u201d\n\nLet me reiterate that uncertainty is bad for all of us, not just the financial markets.\n\nThere\u2019s a pervasive myth that Republicans are better for the economy than Democrats. Nothing could be further from the truth. Job growth is higher when a Democrat is in the White House. The S&P 500 performs better under Democratic presidents. Nine out of the last 10 recessions \u2014 including each of the last five \u2014 have begun with a Republican sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nBut many who should know better don\u2019t want to believe the evidence.\n\nIt\u2019s all personal. Even as inequality soared to near-record levels, many of the wealthiest Americans \u2014 from Wall Street to Silicon Valley and everywhere in between \u2014 have insisted they were the true victims, lashing out at the Biden administration and complaining about any regulation or possible tax increase. These supposed financial experts let their greed and pique blind them to the reality that always was and always will be Donald Trump."

            "full_content": "The lure of cheap labor is bad for innovation, productivity, civic solidarity, and national strength, Vice President JD Vance told business leaders at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday.\n\nThe promise of cheap labor is \u201d a drug that too many American firms got addicted to \u2026 [and] globalization\u2019s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it\u2019s been bad for innovation,\u201d Vance told his audience of investors, adding:\n\nBoth our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation.\n\n\u201cReal innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor,\u201d Vance said in a short speech.\n\nThe statement shows how Vance is trying to repair the political bridge between the party\u2019s voters and business leaders that was deliberately demolished by ruthless pro-migration policies pushed by the two Bush presidencies. The two Bush presidencies dramatically expanded legal and illegal migration to inflate the stock market with cheap labor, more consumers, and more renters.\n\n\u201cThere were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization,\u201d Vance said:\n\nThe first is assuming that we can separate the making of things from the design of things. The idea was that rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things. You would open an iPhone box and it would say \u201cDesigned in Cupertino, California.\u201d Now the implication, of course, is that it would be manufactured [in China] or somewhere else. And yeah, some people might lose their jobs in manufacturing, and they could learn to design, or to use a very popular phrase, and \u201clearn to code.\u201d But I think we got it wrong. Turns out that the geographies that do the manufacturing get awfully good at the designing of things. There are network effects, as you all well understand, the firms that design products work with firms that manufacture. They share intellectual property, they share best practices, and they even sometimes share critical employees. Now we assume that other nations would always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end [so] we were squeezed from both ends. Now that was the first conceit of globalization. I think the second is that cheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and it\u2019s a crutch that inhibits innovation. I might even say that it\u2019s a drug that too many American firms got addicted to. Now, if you can make a product more cheaply, it\u2019s far too easy to do that rather than to innovate. And whether we\u2019re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I\u2019d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you\u2019ve seen productivity stagnate. That\u2019s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. Now, one of the debates you hear on the minimum wage, for instance, is that increases in the minimum wage force firms to automate. So a higher wage at McDonald\u2019s means more [service] kiosks. And whatever your views on the wisdom of the minimum wage, I\u2019m not going to comment on that here \u2026 [we think] companies innovating in the absence of cheap labor is a good thing. I think most of you are not worried about getting cheaper and cheaper labor. You\u2019re worried about innovating, about building new things, about the old formulation of technology is doing more with less. You guys are all trying to do more with less every single day. And so I\u2019d ask my friends, both on the tech optimist side and on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of globalization as a failure of innovation. Indeed, I\u2019d say that globalization\u2019s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it\u2019s been bad for innovation. Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. \u2026 Our goal is to incentivize investment in our own borders \u2014 in our own businesses, our own workers, and our own innovation. We don\u2019t want people seeking cheap labor. We want them investing and building right here in the United States of America.\n\nBreitbart News has posted many articles about migration\u2019s harmful impact on productivity and innovation, and how tight labor markets and rising wages pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity.\n\nFor example, the Fortune 500 has increasingly imported foreign white-collar labor to cut costs. But the programs created by Congress and the executive \u2014 such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs \u2014 have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing.\n\nThe damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers.\n\nIn 2024, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that President Joe Biden\u2019s migration policy would reduce productivity growth in the United States.\n\nVance told his listeners that elites\u2019 demand for cheap labor also fractures societies:\n\nI think the populists, when they look at the future, and when they compare it to what\u2019s happened in the past, I think a lot of them see alienation of workers from their jobs, from their communities, from their sense of solidarity. You see the alienation of people from their sense of purpose. And importantly, they see a leadership class that believes welfare can replace a job and an application on a phone can replace a sense of purpose. \u2026 Now, I remember a Silicon Valley dinner in particular, back when I was in \u2014 in my tech days, where my wife and I were sitting around talking to some of the leaders of \u2014 of the important technology firms of the United States \u2026 And I remember one of the tech CEOs who was there that \u2014 you know, CEO \u2014 you would know his name if I mentioned it. He was the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m actually not worried about the loss of purpose when people lose their jobs.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay, well, what do you think is going to replace that sense of purpose?\u201d And he said, \u201cDigital, fully immersive gaming.\u201d\n\nThe same economic and civic problem has occurred in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, where national leaders are inflating the economy with immigrants, dragging down average income and prosperity.\n\nFor example, immigration forces nations to divert investment to housing and consumerism and away from factory automation and high-tech research.\n\nThe economic damage has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees.\n\n\u201cI can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,\u201d BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia.

            "full_content": "\"Maybe America needs to be broken so someone can fix it.\"\n\nAs former Vice President Kamala Harris considers running in California's gubernatorial race, many of her powerful and longtime national supporters, who helped bolster her to national stardom six years ago, tell ABC News they are lukewarm on a potential 2028 presidential run.\n\n\"I think she's done at the top of the ticket.\" said one donor, who like several other donors, spoke with ABC News on the condition of anonymity because they are still actively involved in Democratic party fundraising. He added, \"I think the country will not have moved in a progressive direction during that time, it will have become more conservative.\"\n\nThe donor was one of the over 20 donors that ABC News spoke with from Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who supported Harris as a junior senator, during the most crowded Democratic presidential race in history, and remained unified during her 2024 bid.\n\nThe support Harris spent years cultivating faces deep fissures.\n\nAnother donor, Areva Martin, who has known Harris since college, said Harris has a history of quieting the doubters.\n\n\"She's proven she has staying power. When people think she can't recover she's proven her ability to do so,\" Martin told ABC News.\n\nKamala Harris drops by a phone bank event at the Democratic National Committee headquarters on Election Day November 05, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOthers were noncommittal, feeling it was too early to consider anyone running for president.\n\n\"I don't know if I would get involved at this point even if God were running. ... I think it's going to be tough for any Democrat to raise any money. There is little enthusiasm,\" Democratic fundraiser Michael Kempner told ABC News.\n\nCase for Harris running for governor\n\nNearly every member of Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who spoke with ABC News backed her for a gubernatorial run.\n\nHarris' aides previously told ABC News she will make a decision by the end of summer. Some supporters see a successful Harris bid for governor in 2026 as a dealbreaker to run for president in 2028, because of the short window between a gubernatorial inauguration and a potential presidential launch.\n\nBakari Sellers, former co-chair of Harris' 2020 campaign, said, \"If she wants to run for governor, I don't think the Katie Porter's of the world are formidable. I think if she wants to run for president, she has to ask: is the country ready for her? I don't know the answer to that. \u2026 a lot of things are going to change in the next three and a half years.\"\n\nOthers avoided commenting about a potential 2028 run, citing timing, but expressed confidence in a Harris gubernatorial run.\n\n\"My opinion and my dedication to her hasn't changed one iota. I believe she's one of the most talented, brilliant, kind, empathic people that I have met in all my time in politics,\" lawyer Judith Barnett told ABC News.\n\nThe lifetime Democratic donor who said she has known Harris for nearly a decade added, \"I would think running for governor, running the 5th largest economy in the world, would be a good move. It's not my decision \u2026 it's all hers. But I think it's a wonderful step,\" Barnett said.\n\nAsif Mahmood, who led Asian outreach for Harris' 2019 campaign, said Harris could follow in another Californian's footsteps.\n\n\"Reagan ran for president. He lost, came back to California, served his state as governor, went back and ran for president and won twice,\" said Mahmood, who was also Hillary Clinton's deputy national finance chair.\n\nMultiple donors pointed out that if Harris were to win a gubernatorial race, she'd make history. She'd be the first Asian American woman and the first Black woman to be governor of any state.\n\nKamala Harris speaks at a canvass kickoff event on November 04, 2024 in Moosic, Pennsylvania. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nOnly one donor who spoke with ABC News said he was not enthusiastic about supporting Harris for governor.\n\n\"If she even thinks of running for president, it will be very bad. If she even puts feelers out it will be embarrassing,\" he said, adding, he would need to be convinced to write big checks for her for any race.\n\nHe claimed donors struggled after Harris' presidential loss to get answers from staffers, \"I don't want to deal with her campaign apparatus.\"\n\nDemocrats vs Democrats\n\nSome donors who spoke with ABC News believe the lack of consensus over Harris says more about Democrats than it does about her.\n\n\"The Democratic party is well known for killing their losers and finding someone else,\" said one donor.\n\n\"I think losing to Donald Trump is the cardinal sin of the Democratic party. The left and people that supported her don't appear to be trying to articulate that this loss was narrow and her ideas were popular,\" said one loyalist.\n\n\"It's tough for anyone to come back from a loss and run again. Trump is, of course, an exception. In my opinion, I don't think she would get significant support as a presidential nominee.\" Dr. Manan Trivedi, a donor and former candidate for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district, told ABC News.\n\nThomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Grover Cleveland, Richard Nixon, Trump were all presidential nominees who lost before winning a general election. Grover Cleveland was the only Democrat to accomplish the feat.\n\nSome donors were skeptical of Harris joining that list.\n\n\"If Kamala wanted to be president of the United States, she needed to position herself as the leader of the resistance. Not only has she not done that but no other leader has pushed themselves forward,\" said one donor.\n\nKamala Harris met with Senior White House and Administration officials, January 9, 2025. Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nMontgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija met Harris during her 2010 attorney general run and said he believes Democrats have time to better position themselves for a successful presidential run.\n\n\"I think she has the luxury of not having to dive into the political fray during this time. By focusing on the human impact of what this administration is doing. It could draw on her strength as an empathetic leader. It could make a difference in these interim years,\" Makhija told ABC News.\n\nAnother donor said Democrats need to be strategic.\n\n\"I want to win. I am not supporting a woman, a Black person, or a gay person. I am supporting the non-threatening white dude. Even if a woman were the best candidate, I would have a hard time until it became really clear that there is a real pathway,\" said one female donor.\n\nDemocratic bundler Alex Heckler said he has remained a big fan of Harris' but fears Democrats are playing a defensive game.\n\nWhile he says he's happy with the new party chair, he says, \"Democrats over-correct. Three white men led the votes for party chair - it's ridiculous. We can't help ourselves. I struggle being a Democrat these days.\"\n\n\"Democrats are reactionary - they think two women lost - we can't put a woman up again,\" Heckler said.\n\nActivist Tina Duryea said she's also frustrated with the party.\n\n\"She [Harris] could run on: 'look how miserable everything is now you could have had me' that could be a very powerful message. I don't have a lot of tolerance for people living in fear. Democrats overthink things,\" Duryea told ABC News. She said she's \"100% behind\" any decision Harris makes.\n\nRapidly changing political landscape\n\nLike any voter, donors change their minds about politics. Multiple did during the course of this reporting.\n\nTwo weeks ago, one prominent donor said, \"I don't think she has it in her,\" adding he believed the next democratic nominee \"will be one of the governors.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris accepts the Chairman's Award onstage during the 56th NAACP Image Awards at Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, Calif., Feb. 22, 2025. Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET\n\nBut the donor changed his mind after Harris' recent appearances. \"Putting your heart and soul into an election is devastating. Watching her [Harris] over the last few weeks, she seems to be getting her legs back. She's been out there speaking,\" the donor said.\n\nHe added, \"If the world is falling apart economically and geopolitically and she gets a head start on fundraising, with her name recognition and leadership, she could easily become the frontrunner and win.\"\n\nOthers acknowledged their positions could change.\n\nCalifornia donor Mark Buell said he is watching how California's gubernatorial and the presidential races unfold before he publicly endorses anyone.\n\n\"I've learned my lesson, you have to wait to be able to see the full landscape. \u2026We have many issues in this country. If I have to hold my nose to vote for a Democratic who I don't like but think would win - I would. It's not who my favorite is or who I love.\"\n\nAnother donor cited a possible fundamental change in American democracy, led by Trump's actions.\n\n\"I am very reluctant to back a horse. Because I'm not even sure we're horse racing anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"Are we going to have an election in 2028? When he [Trump] jokes about it, I don't know if he's joking. But I think she would be great. I still think she would have been great,\" donor Mara Cohen told ABC News.\n\nColorado DNC delegate Wanda James expressed frustration watching Harris' narrative flip, arguing it could easily flip back.\n\n\"On Nov.3, we were calling her campaign flawless,\" James told ABC News. \"Maybe America needs to be broken so someone can fix it. I don't know who will arise, maybe it will be someone no one suspected, but if the election was happening tomorrow I would still be with Kamala.\"\n\nLike several other donors, Janni Lehrer-Stein, a longtime Harris donor and disability advocate, said she has seen Harris multiple times since the election, and has not received any indication as to what she plans to do in the future, but said, \"Kamala Harris is going to lead us toward justice and a better life for everyone. That's the reason I'll support her in whatever direction she takes.\""

            "full_content": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is holding his fire \u2026 perpetually. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nA key difference between the first and second Trump administrations is the latter\u2019s aggressive obliteration of the traditional line between executive and legislative authority and responsibilities \u2014 and the congressional-Republican acquiescence to this ongoing power grab. In Trump\u2019s first term, the president\u2019s executive orders were relatively limited and targeted, there was no major effort to rescind spending without congressional authorization, and there was absolutely nothing like DOGE. Much of Trump\u2019s agenda was advanced by straightforward legislative vehicles, and there was sufficient independence remaining in the GOP ranks to make the first of two big budget-reconciliation bills (the so-called Obamacare-repeal legislation) difficult and ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nSo far, there has been a remarkable lack of congressional-Republican pushback to the ongoing Trump-DOGE-OMB seizure of powers reserved for the legislative branch. But this submissiveness has a dual purpose for the president\u2019s faithful servants on Capitol Hill: Yes, it helps them avoid a possible primary challenge backed by Trump and financed by Elon Musk. But it also absolves them of responsibility for executive-branch actions that are unpopular or might be reversed by the courts or by the administration itself.\n\nA good example of the desire of congressional Republicans to back Trump to the hilt while distancing themselves from responsibility occurred shortly after Trump launched his trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China, as the New York Times reported:\n\nHouse Republican leaders on Tuesday quietly moved to shield their members from having to vote on whether to end President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, tucking language into a procedural measure that effectively removed their chamber\u2019s ability to undo the levies.\n\nThe maneuver was a tacit acknowledgment of how politically toxic the issue had become for their party, and another example of how the all-Republican Congress is ceding its power to the executive branch. In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.\n\nAs Mike Brock noted, congressional Republicans created \u201cthe day that never ends\u201d:\n\nThe tariffs themselves are already having real-world consequences \u2014 spooking financial markets and threatening to reignite inflation. Yet rather than engaging with these economic realities or even defending the tariffs on their merits, Republican leaders have chosen simply to avoid the conversation entirely.\n\nThis is not governance; it\u2019s avoidance. Not leadership, but abdication. Not democracy, but its hollow simulation.\n\nBut it might also be smart \u2014 if deceptive and cowardly \u2014 politics. An even better example of intentional GOP abdication was illustrated by the extreme usefulness of lawless DOGE cuts as a way to corral House conservative votes for a budget resolution and then a spending bill that Freedom Caucus types would normally oppose. \u201cVote for our bills and you can count on Elon Musk to obtain the cuts you want, and we won\u2019t stand in the way\u201d was the implicit message from Speaker Mike Johnson to the fiscal ultras whose support he needed in order to pass legislation on a strict party-line vote.\n\nThe underlying question is whether there is any action Trump might take that would force congressional Republicans to speak out rather than deferring to the executive branch while keeping their own hands relatively clean? In a long Politico Magazine profile of Senate Majority Leader John Thune that stressed the South Dakotan\u2019s decency and respect for hallowed congressional and constitutional precedents, Michael Kruse posed that very question to Thune himself \u2026 and couldn\u2019t get a real answer:\n\nI think people understand that it\u2019s not an easy job. I mean, you\u2019re working with a really big personality who has a distinct way of doing things, which kind of keeps you on the edge of your seat. And you have to be adaptable. You have to be somebody who plays the long game and realizes that you do live your life in 24-hour compartments \u2014 it\u2019s a day-to-day thing \u2014 but you try and keep in perspective the long game. And so every day that we get up and do the work here you understand that you\u2019re trying to bend the trajectory of what you\u2019re doing in the direction of freedom, preserving democracy and making the world and this country a better place.\n\nIt\u2019s significant that this mealymouthed rationalization for silence and inaction came from a senator who treated John McCain as his role model, who had a lot of issues with Trump in 2016, who opposed Trump\u2019s 2020 election denial and the conduct of his supporters on January 6, and who didn\u2019t even endorse Trump in 2024 until he had all but locked up the GOP nomination. Even admirers wonder if he\u2019ll ever protest what\u2019s happening:\n\n\u201cI would hope there\u2019s a little inner turmoil,\u201d Mark Salter, a longtime adviser to the late John McCain, told me. \u201cYou are watching the executive branch usurp all the power and authorities given Congress under Article I,\u201d Salter said. \u201cMaybe he thinks, \u2018I\u2019ll preserve my influence, and down the road, when something worse comes along, I\u2019ll be able to stop him from doing it\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s going to get harder to oppose him, not easier.\u201d\n\nSo what will represent the \u201credline\u201d for Republicans like Thune? Open defiance of court orders? DOGE going directly after the most popular entitlement programs? Tariffs and federal layoffs tanking the economy? Constituents cowering in fear of DOGE or ICE or Justice Department avengers? The search for that redline is on."

            "full_content": "Berlin CNN \u2014\n\nThe German chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has won a vote in parliament to allow a huge increase in state borrowing that is set to super-charge the country\u2019s military spending. The victory completes a Damascene conversion in German politics \u2013 using the outgoing parliamentary arithmetic.\n\nAfter a week of wrangling with the Greens, who held out for some concessions from Merz on how the money would be spent, the vote in the recalled parliament Tuesday saw him secure the two-thirds majority needed to change Germany\u2019s constitutional \u201cdebt brake\u201d \u2013 a mechanism to limit government borrowing.\n\nThe policy U-turn is Merz\u2019s attempt to achieve a number of goals: generate fresh winds for an economy stuck in the doldrums, super-charge military spending and inject much-needed cash into Germany\u2019s aging infrastructure.\n\nMerz won the vote on the relevant law by 513 to 207. His victory means any defense spending and certain security-related outlays that exceed 1% of gross domestic product will be exempt from the debt brake. It will also enable usually fiscally conservative Germany to create a \u20ac500 billion ($545 billion) fund for infrastructure.\n\nRobin Winkler, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank, called the debt overhaul \u201ca historic fiscal regime shift, arguably the largest since German reunification.\u201d But he added that the onus was now on the incoming government to deliver the structural reforms needed to turn the stimulus into sustainable economic growth.\n\nBefore the vote, Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at pan-European bank ING, told CNN that changing Germany\u2019s debt brake would also have implications beyond its borders. \u201cGermany, the guardian of fiscal austerity in Europe, is opening up its wallet,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cthis idea of fiscal discipline needed in Europe is quickly fading away.\u201d\n\nThe debt brake, enshrined in the constitution, was brought in by Angela Merkel in her first term as German chancellor, back in 2009. Nations across the world were reeling from the global financial crisis, having spent billions bailing out financial institutions.\n\nThe German policy was to grow in prominence in the years following the eurozone debt crisis.\n\n\u201cThe debt brake was a fantastic instrument to lead by example in Europe: preaching austerity to all the other countries \u2013 Greece, Italy and Spain \u2013 and at the same time showing that Germany was leading the way with these very restrictive fiscal policies,\u201d Brzeski explained.\n\nThere is \u201cno exact number\u201d on what Merz\u2019s government could spend on defense, he noted.\n\nBut one model he provided to CNN, based on Germany spending 3.5% of GDP over the next 10 years, could unlock \u20ac600 billion.\n\nA defense \u2018turning point\u2019\n\nFor a country that has for decades been very self-conscious about its militarized past, the potential increase in defense spending marks a sea change.\n\nMerz seized on his election victory to pass the reform, spurred on by fears sweeping Europe over the Trump administration\u2019s apparent wavering on security commitments to allies.\n\nYet the idea is not Merz\u2019s own. He is giving renewed impetus to a 2022 German security policy change dubbed Zeitenwende \u2013 \u201ca turning point\u201d in English \u2013 initiated by outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz just after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSudha David-Wilp, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank, said Scholz\u2019s implementation of the policy was hindered by his squabbling coalition.\n\nNow, she told CNN, \u201cMerz and (his) coalition need to accelerate this, not because Germany needs to be a military power but because Germany, with its European partners, needs to look at hard security, because it\u2019s a different world.\u201d\n\nThe debt brake also became a straitjacket for the German economy, Brzeski said, describing it as \u201cone of the more structural root causes of the current stagnation\u201d and comparing it to trying to accelerate a car with the handbrake on.\n\n\u201cA debt brake still makes sense if you have a nice, thriving economy,\u201d he said, adding that politicians had realized that, as Germany\u2019s economic growth had slowed, the mechanism was no longer working to the country\u2019s advantage.\n\nThe shadow of US President Donald Trump has also hung over Tuesday\u2019s vote. Speaking as it became clear Merz\u2019s party had come out on top in last month\u2019s federal election, Merz, known for his strong trans-Atlantic values, said his priority was to strengthen Europe as fast as possible \u201cso that step by step we can really achieve independence from the USA.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s comments the previous week, he added, it was clear that \u201cAmericans in this administration are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe law on the debt brake reform now needs to be approved by the upper house of Germany\u2019s parliament, also with a two-thirds majority, which Merz looks to have secured.\n\nAccording to David-Wilp at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, Merz sees a need for Germany to lead on defense in Europe because \u201cthings have really undergone major change since (Trump\u2019s) inauguration.\u201d\n\nDuring a debate Tuesday ahead of the vote, Merz said there had been a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in Germany\u2019s defense policy. Time will tell if more lavish spending will boost the country\u2019s security and fundamentally change its military.\n\nClaudia Otto contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSummary President Trump blames Biden for economic woes despite inheriting a stable economy, according to economists.\n\nMarkets have entered 'extreme fear territory' as consumer confidence plummets amid uncertainty about Trump's policies.\n\nEconomists attribute recent market volatility to Trump's tariff proposals rather than Biden's economic legacy.\n\nRSM has increased its recession probability to 20% from 15%, according to its chief economist.\n\nMany presidential administrations cherry-pick economic data to support their narratives, experts say.\n\nMarkets are on the fritz and investor sentiment has slumped into \u201cextreme fear\u201d territory. Consumer confidence readings have cratered and surveys show a sharp turnabout in Americans\u2019 feelings about their future financial well-being. Any positive reports are described by economists as the \u201ccalm before the storm.\u201d\n\nThe common denominator is pure and utter uncertainty \u2014 particularly about just how President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy actions could shake out, economists say.\n\nHowever, when the topics of the economy, volatile markets, shaken confidence and sudden recession fears have been broached with Trump, he\u2019s hammered on familiar notes: That the Biden administration left him with an economic situation that was \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d a \u201cnightmare,\u201d \u201chorrible,\u201d or \u201cdamaged.\u201d\n\nStill, data aside, the economy didn\u2019t feel great to all Americans who suffered through the highest inflation in decades, and those sour feelings helped send Trump back to the White House for a second term.\n\nSuch claims have become a hair-pull for economists, statisticians, academics and fact-checkers alike: By most gold-standard measures, President Joe Biden handed Trump a booming economy. And, if anything, the economy was ripe for a resurgence in early 2025 under Trump, economists have told CNN.\n\nConsumer confidence readings have declined sharply in recent weeks on fears that President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could drive prices higher. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe economy was bad under Biden and that was reflected in the polls last year; but inflation and every other economic indicator had more or less stabilized when President Trump took office,\u201d Jai Kedia, an economist and research fellow at the Cato Institute, told CNN in an interview.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now, Kedia said, is a tale as old as politics: The blame game.\n\nKedia, who\u2019s a Libertarian, is in the camp of politicians should \u201cleave things alone,\u201d when it comes to the economy.\n\n\u201cThis is true in the Biden administration with the massive spending bills and all of that, which in some part led to inflation; and that\u2019s true now with the tariffs that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Kedia said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to figure out why you would blame the previous administration. The stock market actually went up once Trump was elected, and it\u2019s only in the past month when the administration is playing around with dangerous economic ideas that you see the economy started to swivel back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a direct result of the tariffs and other economic proposals,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are plenty of caveats when it comes to economic data: One month does not make a trend; figures are preliminary and often subject to revision as more detailed information becomes available; reports often represent a snapshot in time and can be influenced by one-off events such as weather; and, above all else, it takes time for situations to evolve and be fully understood.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem across our political spectrum of cherry-picking one month of employment or inflation reports to make general conclusions about the trend,\u201d Kedia said.\n\nTake, for example, Biden taking credit for \u201ccreating\u201d nearly 16 million jobs during his time in office; and then, most recently, Trump touting a slice of the February jobs report: a 10,000-job boost in manufacturing that he credited to his tariff-heavy trade policy and desires to make America a factory superpower.\n\nBoth claims have truthful elements to them, but there are important distinctions to be made: For Biden, he needed to clarify that it took roughly 9.5 million jobs of those to get back to pre-pandemic levels of employment; and for Trump, those gains are preliminary estimates and very well could be reflective of investments put forth under the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to understand what the effects of the tariffs are on manufacturing and the rest of the economy,\u201d Kedia said. \u201cThe markets clearly are telling you where they think this is going.\u201d\n\nThis and other alarm bells are heightening recession fears.\n\nOn-again, off-again tariffs, mass government layoffs, funding cuts and other sweeping policy moves from the Trump administration have spooked investors. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis is not large enough to be a recessionary shock at this point; but it\u2019s going to cause growth to slow,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, RSM US principal and chief economist, said in an interview.\n\nBrusuelas\u2019 firm recently lifted its recession probability to 20% from 15%, or a one in five chance. If the current uncertainty evolves into a large trade shock that\u2019s sustained, RSM would revisit those projections, Brusuelas said.\n\n\u201cIf the shock is caused by a specific trade policy, it\u2019s highly likely that credit or blame \u2014 depending on your point of view regarding the recession \u2014 would fall squarely in the laps of the Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the administration won\u2019t say it\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault. They\u2019ve already laid the predicate on that.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, confidence surveys aren\u2019t always reliable indicators of future economic performance, said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an unprecedented amount of uncertainty, what I call a very thick fog, and we can\u2019t tell whether we\u2019re going north or south right now,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the fog clears up, the confidence will go up. So I would not use business confidence or consumer confidence as an indicator of how well or how poorly the economy is going to do going forward.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The Alma Mater statue at Columbia University. Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe leaders of America\u2019s top universities should have realized long ago that no amount of cowering and capitulation or attempts to hide will save them from the attack being unleashed and orchestrated by the Trump administration. It seems the leaders of these fine institutions do not understand the crude and lawless nature of their opponents or the focused, all-out war on higher education that the White House and its allies have launched.\n\nLike many New Yorkers, I am baffled and dismayed by Columbia University\u2019s meek acceptance of the outrageous, bullying announcement from the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and the U.S. General Services Administration that the White House intends to snatch back $400 million in federal research money based on what the administration called \u201ccontinued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\u201d an alleged violation of civil-rights law. For good measure, the letter warned that \u201cthese cancellations represent the first round of action and additional cancellations are expected to follow.\u201d\n\nBut the threat is plainly illegal. Federal law governing scientific grants specifies that clawbacks of research money can only happen after a voluntary resolution has been attempted and \u201ca full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action\u201d has been filed with the committees in Congress that initially authorized the grants. Importantly, cancellations must be limited to the offending section of the grantee organization, and \u201cno such action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s announcement skipped all the legal requirements, ignoring any attempt at voluntary resolution and basing its action on alleged discrimination at the undergraduate campus that has nothing to do with scientific work happening three miles north at the NewYork-Presbyterian\u2013Columbia research complex. The announcement makes no mention of the mandatory written report or the required notification to Congress. It should have been swiftly and publicly rejected by Columbia\u2019s president and trustees on the day it was received, ideally with language to the effect of \u201cOur lawyers will see you in court.\u201d\n\nInstead, the university immediately raised the white flag. \u201cWe take Columbia\u2019s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cWe remain dedicated to our mission to advance lifesaving research and pledge to work with the federal government to restore Columbia\u2019s federal funding,\u201d a spokesperson told the student-run Spectator publication.\n\nColumbia\u2019s meek public responses, which avoided calling out the plain illegality of the situation, failed to stop or even slow the attack. Within days, the Trump administration informed Columbia that it must change its student disciplinary policies and place its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under \u201cacademic receivership for a minimum of five years\u201d and announced it will begin investigating dozens of other universities for implementing diversity measures that the administration opposes.\n\nThat is how blackmail works. The moment of fearful surrender is precisely when the blackmailer informs his pitiful, groveling victim: \u201cUnfortunately that will no longer do.\u201d And then a new round of humiliation begins with even higher stakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely illegal. We\u2019re challenging that,\u201d Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told me. \u201cThis is a thinly veiled effort to bully the universities every which way. They\u2019re using every tool in their tool kit. They\u2019re going after faculty. They\u2019re going after students. They\u2019re going after grants that have absolutely nothing to do with politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an escalation of a kind that is unheard of,\u201d Joan Scott, a historian, told the Associated Press. \u201cEven during the McCarthy period in the United States, this was not done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not too late for Columbia to change course and start fighting back. The school\u2019s website lists five attorneys among the 22 members of the board of trustees, but at least one of them, former Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson, surely understands enough about Washington politics to warn against the folly of appeasement.\n\nThe Trump administration has been open about its mission of defunding and disabling elite institutions. As Christopher Rufo, an anti-diversity ideologue affiliated with the Manhattan Institute who has advised the Trump administration, recently told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat: \u201cI think that you could put the university sector as a whole into a significant recession. And I think that would be a very salutary thing \u2026 A medium- or long-term goal of mine is to figure out how to adjust the formula of finances from the federal government to the universities in a way that puts them in an existential terror.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that Columbia installed its 13th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, shortly after he had led the historic Allied armies to victory over Nazi tyranny and not long before he became the first supreme commander of NATO and then president of the United States. It\u2019s hard to imagine a leader of that stature giving in to a lawless power grab staged by the likes of Trump, Rufo, and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. Until the leadership of Columbia and other institutions recognize that the White House isn\u2019t really interested in battling antisemitism, or diversity programs, or waste in government, they will get battered and beaten every time.\n\n\u201cInstead of pandering and trying to appease the administration, they actually need to show up for their faculty, for their students, for their mission, which is education,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cEducation does not mean rolling over and censoring people to please some master or some donor. It means fighting for the right to free expression, fighting for the notion that democracy requires free and open debate. And that means people have to be free to express themselves. Columbia will get nowhere by trying to mollify the MAGAs.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Lance King/Getty Images\n\nFor 51 weeks of the year, only diehards like me (go Illini!) think or care about college basketball. While the rest of you may spend your summers outside, near, like, sand or something, fellow hoop heads and I are scouring recruiting rankings or watching grainy video of Lithuanian point guards. It\u2019s a kind of sickness. But for one week, this specific week in March: We\u2019re all a little sick.\n\nThe NCAA Tournament and all its glories \u2014 the brackets, the upsets, the earnest young people on your television painting their faces and screaming into a tuba \u2014 is upon us. Preliminary rounds take place on Tuesday and Wednesday night, and the real enchilada launches around lunchtime on Thursday. (That\u2019s when your brackets are due, so you know.) This is a particularly fascinating tournament happening at an unusually intriguing moment for college basketball, a sport that has largely been usurped by its mean older brother, college football, and yet may just end up in a stronger, more sustainable place. If you\u2019re just tuning in \u2014 and if you\u2019re reading this, you probably are \u2014 here are the biggest story lines heading into this year\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments.\n\nDuke is the favorite again \u2014 but they\u2019re a little less unlikable than usual\n\n\n\n\n\nHating Duke is as grand an NCAA tournament tradition as a buzzer-beater or \u201cOne Shining Moment\u201c: It\u2019s the default mode for every casual sports fan, and with good reason. (In case you need a fresh injection of Duke hate, here is a picture of former Duke guard Grayson Allen, who famously looks exactly like Ted Cruz and is only slightly less hateable.) And while I will never stand in the way of some old-fashioned Duke bile, it should be noted that this year\u2019s version of the Blue Devils isn\u2019t quite as loathsome as some previous vintages. They\u2019ve got three of the top eight projected picks in next year\u2019s NBA Draft, led by certain top overall pick Cooper Flagg, who has been the best player in college basketball this year by a wide margin. While Flagg certainly resembles past hateable Duke players (which is really just another way of saying he\u2019s white), he\u2019s legitimately fun to watch, and his game has earned plaudits from the toughest critics in the world: NBA players. During the Olympics warm-ups last summer, Flagg practiced against Team USA and played so well that Kevin Durant said, \u201cHe looked like a hell of a player. Somebody who\u2019s going to only get better with more experience. Seventeen years old coming in here playing like he\u2019s a vet almost.\u201d Also: He is from Maine. He\u2019s already the best player ever from Maine. I have no idea who would possibly be second. (Can Stephen King hoop?) The main reason to let up a little bit on Duke this year, though? Coach K is gone. Remember: He\u2019s not a basketball coach. He\u2019s a leader who happens to coach basketball. You can still cheer against Duke. But I suspect it won\u2019t quite have the vigor for you that it once did.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Flagg \u2014 the men\u2019s tournament finally has some star power\n\nA common criticism of men\u2019s college basketball in recent years has been its lack of stars: Four of the top six picks in last year never played college basketball at all. But that is not the case this year, largely because of NIL (which stands for \u201cname, image, and likeness,\u201d which basically stands for \u201cthe players are getting paid now\u201d): Players who might have skipped college, or played in the G-League or overseas, have learned that college is a great place to build a brand, sell some jerseys, earn some cash, and show off their stuff to scouts. Other than the Duke guys, there\u2019s Baylor\u2019s V.J. Edgecombe, Texas\u2019s Tre Johnson, Illinois\u2019s Kasparas Jakucionis, Oklahoma\u2019s Jeremiah Fears, Maryland\u2019s Derik Queen, BYU\u2019s Egor Demin, and a whole host of future NBA stars who will be a part of what is considered one of the best drafts in years. Even if you\u2019re one of those pro-basketball snobs who likes to mock the college game, if you want to see the future of the league, you\u2019ll see it in the men\u2019s tournament.\n\nThe hipster pick to win the national title has a brewing headache as a coach\n\nThe hottest team in men\u2019s college basketball down the stretch was Florida, which won its last six games and 12 of its last 13 en route to a tournament championship in the SEC, the best league in the sport this year. But the team\u2019s success wasn\u2019t the biggest news to come out of Gainesville this year. That would be Gators coach Todd Golden, who, according to a blockbuster report in the student-run Independent Florida Alligator when the season started, was accused by an \u201cundefined\u201d number of women, most of them students, of sexual harassment and stalking. The paper talked to two of the women. A sample from its report:\n\nThe first woman, a former UF student, said that Golden stalked her in person, both in his car and on foot, and that this occurred \u201cmore than ten times.\u201d On one occasion, she said she posted her location on her Instagram Story, and Golden messaged her shortly after saying that he was in the area \u201cwaiting for [her].\u201d\n\nShe also said Golden sent unsolicited photos of his genitalia to her. On multiple occasions, the first woman said she received the photos while the team was traveling on the road. The nature of Golden\u2019s alleged stalking became more assertive over time, she said. \u201cAt first, it starts off slow, like, \u2018Oh, wow. That\u2019s odd. This guy is showing us attention,\u2019\u201d the first woman said. \u201cAnd then it becomes, \u2018Wow, he\u2019s kind of crossing a line. No, he didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u2019 Then it\u2019s, \u2018Wait, he\u2019s fully stepping over that line.\u2019 Then it\u2019s, \u2018Wow, there\u2019s a picture of his dick.\u2019 It was a full grooming process with all of us.\u201d\n\n\n\nGolden, who is one of the three highest paid employees by the state of Florida, underwent a Title IX investigation, but the school closed it in January, saying it found \u201cno evidence\u201d he violated the law \u2014 though only because none of what he was accused of \u201coccurred within a university program or activity.\u201d Every men\u2019s NCAA tournament seems to include some sort of story in which a key participant is asked about an ugly scandal every time they step in front of a microphone. This year, that story involves the head coach of a team that may well win the national championship.\n\nSouth Carolina goes for the dynasty\n\nSouth Carolina, led by already legendary coach Dawn Staley, won last year\u2019s women\u2019s national championship, their second in three years and their third in the last seven tournaments. But one thing they haven\u2019t done is win two in a row \u2014 widely considered the true mark of any women\u2019s basketball dynasty. Winning multiple titles is far more difficult than it used to be, largely because of the dramatic steps forward the game has made over the past decade; there\u2019s much more talent now, and it\u2019s much more diffuse. The age of Connecticut winning four in a row is long over. But the Gamecocks are ranked No. 2 in the country and are in fact the Vegas favorite to win the whole thing. They\u2019ll have no better chance than this.\n\nPaige Bueckers tries to win her first title \u2026\n\n\u2026 In Connecticut history \u2014 and maybe all of women\u2019s college basketball history. And while she has been great, and is expected to be the first pick in this year\u2019s WNBA Draft, her career has been riddled with injuries and is even considered a letdown for one obvious reason: She has never won a title at Connecticut. The last, best Connecticut recruit before her was the legendary Breanna Stewart who, during her four years at Connecticut, won, uh, four. Bueckers is an incredible player with a long career ahead of her. But if she\u2019s unable to win a title for Connecticut, she\u2019ll inevitably, and surely unfairly, be remembered as a disappointment.\n\nCollege basketball is extremely healthy\n\nWomen\u2019s college basketball continues to explode in popularity; that we have gone this far without mentioning USC\u2019s JuJu Watkins is a sign of just how many compelling characters there are in the sport right now. But it should be noted that men\u2019s college basketball, thought by many (including me) to be facing existential peril just a year or two ago, has had a resurgent season. That\u2019s thanks largely to NIL and the transfer portal, which have made the sport attractive given some of the best players in the world in a way it had never been before. (The irony being that these were supposed to be the things killing the sport.) The tournament is always intoxicating, but the story lines, and the characters, in this year\u2019s brackets are unusually vivid and compelling. We die-hards freaks who care about this stuff all the time are glad you\u2019re here. You might just find some stuff that\u2019ll make you want to stick around."
