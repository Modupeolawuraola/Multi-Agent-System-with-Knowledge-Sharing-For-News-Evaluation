            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US State Department is \u201cundertaking a full review of all visa programs,\u201d a department spokesperson confirmed amid reports of an impending new travel ban, and a US official familiar with the situation told CNN that Afghanistan could be among the countries included.\n\nThe official said the ban could come as soon as next week but noted it was unclear if final decisions on countries and timing had been made.\n\nIn an executive order issued on January 20, President Donald Trump directed cabinet members, including the Secretary of State, to compile a list of countries \u201cfor which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.\u201d The executive order calls for this to be done within 60 days.\n\n\u201cThe Department is undertaking a full review of all visa programs as directed under this EO and executing on administration priorities,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson would not give further details, saying they do \u201cnot comment on internal deliberations or communications.\u201d\n\nA White House official told CNN, \u201cNo decisions regarding possible travel bans have been made, and anyone claiming otherwise does not know what they are talking about.\u201d\n\nIn his first term, Trump barred travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations from coming to the US, a policy that saw court challenges before President Joe Biden repealed it when he took office in 2021.\n\nIf Afghanistan is included in the new travel ban, it could impact tens of thousands of Afghans who worked alongside the US during its two decades of war there, as it would block Afghan nationals from coming to the US.\n\nTens of thousands of Afghans have already been caught in limbo due to other Trump administration executive orders suspending the US refugee admissions program and the suspension of foreign aid funding for flights of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders.\n\nOn Wednesday, AfghanEvac, a coalition of organizations that has been working to bring Afghan allies to safety since the end of the war in Afghanistan in 2021, urged \u201call Afghan nationals holding valid U.S. visas to travel as soon as possible amid credible indications that a travel ban affecting Afghan nationals may be imminent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile no official announcement has been made, multiple sources within the U.S. government suggest that a new travel restriction could be implemented within the next week. This potential policy change may significantly impact Afghan visa holders who have been awaiting relocation to the United States,\u201d the group\u2019s notice said.\n\nThe International Refugee Admissions Project (IRAP) also spoke out against reports of a new travel ban, saying in a news release Friday that many of their clients \u201chave been waiting years for their visas to be processed and remain in extremely dangerous circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cA new travel ban would put their lives at risk by denying them the opportunity to reach safety. Even a temporary suspension will result in immediate and lasting harm for refugees and their families,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not yet know the full scope of who could be impacted, reports indicate that Afghan refugees targeted by the Taliban, including Special Immigrant Visa holders and others who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, could all be subjected to this unlawful ban,\u201d it continued. \u201cIt is shameful that the Trump administration is abandoning America\u2019s promise to protect Afghan allies and other forcibly displaced people around the world.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Angelica Franganillo Diaz and Kit Maher contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "MIAMI \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s threats of tariffs and sanctions to Russia as leverage to negotiate a ceasefire with Ukraine may be a welcome pivot that draws some attention away from the administration\u2019s recent support for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt may also move the focus away from the flak that Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 known for his hard-line policies against Russia and its backing of communist and socialist countries such as Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua \u2014 has been taking as the country\u2019s top diplomat.\n\nAfter Trump and Vice President JD Vance excoriated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a heated televised exchange from the Oval Office, and following Trump\u2019s assertions that Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 started the war, the Cuban American secretary of state has been criticized by Americans who condemn Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as well as Russia\u2019s longstanding involvement with some Latin American countries.\n\nOne letter to the editor in the Miami Herald, his hometown newspaper, questioned how Rubio can \u201csleep at night\" now that he\u2019s \u201canxious to partner with Russia, which recently sent oil to Havana to keep that socialist state\u2019s engine running.\u201d Another letter lambasted Rubio for \u201csitting in the Oval Office as his tangerine-tinted Caudillo (strongman) paid tribute to and openly embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fidel Castro once did the same with Nikita Kruschev in 1961.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, the State Department referred NBC News to recent remarks Rubio made on ABC News, Fox News and CNN, in which he\u2019s insisted that Trump\u2019s goal is to get Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement and an end to a war that has gone on for three years and cost thousands of civilian lives.\n\n\u201cAll the president is trying to do here is figure out if there\u2019s a path towards peace. We have to engage both sides, the Russians and the Ukrainians. And we asked the Ukrainians not to sabotage it,\u201d Rubio told Fox News following Trump\u2019s exchange with Zelensky at the White House.\n\nThe role of secretaries of state is to carry out their president\u2019s foreign policy agenda. But the White House\u2019s Russia policy stands in contrast to Rubio\u2019s. A foreign policy hawk who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, Rubio has been a staunch opponent of the Kremlin and a defender of Ukraine, and has often criticized Russia for its involvement with other countries.\n\nAfter Russian warships visited Cuba last summer, then Sen. Rubio, along with fellow Florida Sen. Rick Scott, introduced a resolution condemning Cuba\u2019s government, stating that \u201cthe world is bearing witness to the multiple ways the Castro/D\u00edaz-Canel regime has served as a puppet for Communist China, Iran, and most recently Russia.\u201d\n\nLike Rubio, many Cubans as well as exiles from Venezuela and Nicaragua see Russia not only as an aggressor against Ukraine, but as a regime with strong alliances to the governments they fled.\n\nFor Anamely Ramos, a well-known Chicago-based activist and art historian who came from Cuba three years ago, the Trump administration\u2019s recent overtures toward Russia worry her.\n\nShe said it\u2019s a delicate topic for many Cubans because they don\u2019t have all the information yet, but it\u2019s worse to \u201cremain silent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy role, as a Cuban and defender of human rights is to insist on certain demands with Cuba policy in mind, regardless of which party is in power,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cThe softening with Russia affects us and, as activists, we cannot take this out of our sight, not even for a second.\u201d\n\nAfter the 1959 revolution, Cuba became a major ally of the Soviet Union and depended on them for subsidies and military support. The 1962 Cuban missile crisis \u2014 when the Soviet Union placed missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles from U.S. soil \u2014 brought the two superpowers to the brink of nuclear conflict. Russia has continued aiding Cuba, most recently with oil shipments as the island is mired in economic crisis, and it\u2019s also helped the leftist authoritarian governments of Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nSome pro-democracy activists in the U.S. don\u2019t take issue with the administration\u2019s Russia policy.\n\n\u201cTrump is trying to end a war where there has been great loss of life on both sides,\u201d said Ernesto Ackerman, president of the group Independent Venezuelan-American Citizens, who is a Trump supporter. \u201cWhat he wants is to achieve peace between these two countries,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers wanted to make clear they supported Rubio, but were worried about the government\u2019s recent overtures toward Russia.\n\nCarolina Barrero, who moves between Madrid, Washington, D.C., Miami and New York as the director of the organization Ciudadan\u00eda y Libertad (Citizenship and Freedom), said for Cubans like her it\u2019s an \u201chonor\u201d to have Marco Rubio serve as secretary of state and they want him in that role. But she said she\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about the strengthening alliance between the U.S. and Russia.\n\n\u201cMost Cubans are conscious of who Vladimir Putin is and the threat he represents because of the history we have had,\u201d Barrero said.\n\nThe Trump administration has toughened its policies toward various Latin American countries, too: it revoked a license that allowed Chevron to pump oil in Venezuela, returned Cuba to the state sponsors of terrorism list, slapped tariffs on Mexico and threatened to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama Canal.\n\nOn the other hand, the administration ceased offensive cyber operations against Russia and ended efforts to seize assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\n\u201cIt looks a little suspicious and the secretary of state has a hard time explaining why,\u201d said Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University.\n\nIf Rubio has presidential aspirations, he needs to make the best of the current situation, according to Gamarra.\n\n\u201cImagine a situation where Rubio is able to preside over a peace process. That almost guarantees Rubio a huge political bump,\u201d he said."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Friday! In today\u2019s edition, \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker digs into a topsy-turvy week on tariffs, Trump administration officials\u2019 warnings of economic pain ahead \u2014 and how voters might respond. Plus, Sahil Kapur explains why Medicaid has emerged as a major sticking point in Republicans\u2019 budget plans.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nHow will voters react to Trump\u2019s twists and turns on tariffs?\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nIt\u2019s been a volatile week for President Donald Trump\u2019s economic and trade policies, with twists and turns on tariffs dominating the headlines \u2014 and raising new questions about how voters will react.\n\nTrump knows well that the economy and concerns about high prices helped propel him to the Oval Office.\n\nHere\u2019s what he told me back in December: \u201cI won on the border, and I won on groceries. \u2026 When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\u201d\n\nBut there are already some signs that Americans are concerned that Trump is not prioritizing the issue. A CBS News/YouGov poll released earlier this week found that 80% of Americans believe inflation should be a high priority for the administration, but just 29% say Trump is prioritizing the issue \u201ca lot.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has acknowledged that there could be some economic pain ahead.\n\nTrump noted in his address to Congress this week that \u201cthere will be a little disturbance\u201d when tariffs take effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC this morning that there will be a \u201cdetox period\u201d as the economy adjusts to less government spending. And Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox News this week that as a result of tariffs, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a short period of time where there will be some higher prices on certain products.\u201d\n\nMy colleague Peter Alexander asked Trump earlier today how long Americans should expect things to cost more. The president said in part, \u201cThere could be some disturbance, a little bit of a disturbance.\u201d Trump also acknowledged there could be more tariff shifts to come, noting, \u201cThere will always be changes and adjustments.\u201d\n\nSo how much time will voters give Trump to bring prices down? And how might they react if prices actually go up?\n\nWe\u2019ll delve into the next steps for Trump\u2019s economic agenda and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday, with Lutnick and Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.\n\nThe latest on the economy:\n\nTrump suggested he may implement tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber, the latest broadside by his administration in the brewing trade war between the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, falling short of expectations as employers in a range of industries continued making hires, while the federal government slashed its workforce by 10,000.\n\nThe S&P 500 regained some ground on Friday, but the index still posted its worst week in several months as the salvo of trade policy actions unnerved investors, CNBC reports.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nAside from tariffs, it was another busy day at the White House, with Trump making news on issues ranging from foreign policy to education.\n\nHere are the toplines:\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Mailbag: What does the future hold for Medicaid?\n\nThank you to everyone who emailed us with questions this week! Several of you wrote in to ask about the future of Medicaid as Republicans consider a budget proposal to advance Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nHere\u2019s senior national political correspondent Sahil Kapur to explain why the program has emerged as a major focus and could be on the chopping block:\n\nMedicaid has rapidly become one of the biggest flashpoints of Trump\u2019s presidency. The simple reason is that Republicans have approved a budget plan that would necessitate significant cuts to the program in order to meet their targets. Don\u2019t take my word for it. That\u2019s according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe math is simple: The House Republican budget to advance Trump\u2019s agenda requires the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut spending by $880 billion. But when you set aside Medicare and Medicaid, the entire jurisdiction of the committee totals $581 billion. The GOP is deeply leery of cutting Medicare, given the politics with older voters, but Medicaid has been in the party\u2019s crosshairs for years. It\u2019s less sacred to them. In fact, Republican lawmakers have openly told us they want to include cuts to Medicaid spending in their big party-line bill.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where it gets more interesting. Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, say they want to root out fraud and waste in the program. But there\u2019s no reason to think they can find hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid fraud. Nobody can cite evidence of that, including the speaker\u2019s office when I asked them to show their math. If the GOP wants to meet its targets, they will have to take actions that risk political blowback.\n\nThere\u2019s another option: They could wave the white flag on that deficit-reduction target and rewrite the budget. But in the wafer-thin House GOP majority, that number was the product of concessions made to conservative hard-liners who demanded sharp spending cuts as the price of their vote.\n\nBottom line: There\u2019s no easy way out here, and the future of Medicaid is hazy at the moment.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83d\udc40 Shutdown watch : Democrats blasted a stopgap funding bill, which has not been released yet, that Republicans plan to bring to floor next week to avert a government shutdown.

            "full_content": "A Hispanic Trump backer who is regretting his vote after a horrific encounter with ICE. Photo: NBC News4\n\nA local Washington, D.C., TV news reporter has a story that we are almost certainly going to hear often once the Trump administration\u2019s mass-deportation initiative intensifies:\n\nA naturalized Hispanic man says he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who were looking for another person on a deportation order, and now the man is questioning his vote for President Donald Trump. \u2026\n\n[Jensy] Machado said he was driving to work Wednesday with two other men when he was stopped by ICE agents on Lomond Drive in Manassas, a short distance from his home. He said he was confused by what was happening, why agents surrounded the pickup truck.\n\n\u201cAnd they just got out of the car with the guns in their hands and say, turn off the car, give me the keys, open the window, you know,\u201d Machado told Telemundo 44\u2019s Rosbelis Quino\u00f1ez, who first reported his story. \u201cEverything was really fast.\u201d \u2026\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me for any ID,\u201d Machado said. \u201cI was telling the officer, if I can give him ID, but he said just keep my hands up, not moving. After that, he told me to get out of the car and put the handcuffs on me. And then he went to me and said how did I get into this country and if I was waiting for a court date or if I have any case. And I told him I was an American citizen, and he looked at his other partner like, you know, smiling, like saying, can you believe this guy? Because he asked the other guy, \u2018Do you believe him?\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out the ICE agents had erroneously been given this American citizen\u2019s address, but since he looked Hispanic, they figured they\u2019d act and ask questions later. He was released after finally being allowed to show his driver\u2019s license, but \u201cthe two men with him were taken into custody. He does not know why.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion he reached isn\u2019t surprising: \u201cI voted for Trump last election, but, because I thought it was going to be the things, you know, like \u2026 just go against criminals, not every Hispanic-looking, like, that they will assume that we are all illegals.\u201d\n\nIf this happened with trained ICE agents, it\u2019s going to happen a lot more often when local law enforcement officers are pulled into the mass-deportation effort. At that point, the big and much-discussed improvements Republicans made among Hispanic voters in 2024 could begin melting away in the heat of widespread ethnic profiling.\n\nBut the possibility of buyer\u2019s remorse among Trump voters isn\u2019t limited to Hispanic voters who didn\u2019t believe the rabid hostility of Republicans toward illegal immigrants might affect them. After a campaign that so very successfully divided Americans into an aggrieved and deserving \u201cus\u201d battling an privileged and undeserving \u201cthem,\u201d it\u2019s going to become apparent that the line between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d isn\u2019t so clear and can be shifted as quickly as a DOGE raid on a federal agency.\n\nFor example, exit polls showed military veterans favoring Trump over Kamala Harris by a 65 percent to 34 percent margin, and Trump made an even more conspicuous display than ever of his alleged super-patriotism and love for those wearing the country\u2019s uniform. But these pro-Trump voters probably weren\u2019t expecting the administration to instantly fire thousands of veterans who have previously been given a preference in federal hiring, or to demand that the Veterans Administration dismiss 80,000 workers engaged in providing veterans with health care and other benefits.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised not to touch Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, which likely reassured seniors (representing 28 percent of the 2024 electorate) that his attacks on \u201cthe deep state\u201d wouldn\u2019t affect them personally. But now Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE is massively reducing the administrative staff required to ensure Social Security and related benefits can be accessed smoothly, and it\u2019s very clear Trump\u2019s congressional Republican allies cannot implement his budgetary plans without major \u201csavings\u201d from Medicaid. Those who voted for Trump may feel deceived or betrayed.\n\nTrump did conspicuously well among self-identified Catholic voters in 2024. Almost immediately, the new administration picked a nasty fight with Catholic bishops over the services the church provides to undocumented immigrants and its insistence on treating them with dignity. At least some Catholic Trump voters may realize that immigrants aren\u2019t the only targets of MAGA rage.\n\nAbove all, millions of Americans voted for Trump at least in part because they were concerned about grocery and gasoline prices and believed his promises that he\u2019d act quickly to reduce them to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, his economic policies have focused on imposing broad-based tariffs sure to raise consumer prices while inviting retaliation that could blight the lives of many producers of American goods and services (notably farmers).\n\nAll these potential developments are worth watching closely as Trump\u2019s agenda unfolds and begins stimulating a public backlash. At present, Americans are split right down the middle on the 47th president\u2019s job performance with a steady downward trend since his inauguration. For the most part, the country is divided precisely as it was on Election Day. But with every day that passes, memories of Joe Biden\u2019s or Kamala Harris\u2019s shortcomings will fade and Donald Trump will be vulnerable to the unhappiness of Americans about their government and conditions of life. It won\u2019t take that many 2024 Trump voters deciding they made a mistake to tilt the balance of public opinion decisively against him. Even if the president himself no longer cares about popularity (and his ego probably requires that he imagine himself as revered), his Republican allies, particularly in the U.S. House with its fragile GOP majority, probably do. They know voters who feel betrayed tend to be highly motivated to make their anger known at the ballot box."

            "full_content": "Elon Musk with Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump famously deploys a confusing and borderline incoherent style of discourse that he assures us is deliberate: He calls it \u201cthe weave,\u201d which my colleague Margaret Hartmann defines as a \u201cfree association word salad.\u201d Aficionados of Trump\u2019s rhetoric have probably noticed that \u201cthe weave\u201d gets more impenetrable when he is asked to address difficult subjects like his position on abortion. Language aside, the 47th president also sometimes sows deliberate confusion about his position on highly controversial issues. That\u2019s important to keep in mind when trying to understand his most recent statements about Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE and its power to ravage and remake the federal government.\n\nAmid public protests and private complaints from members of Congress about the chaos and errors surrounding DOGE\u2019s \u201cgo fast and break things\u201d assault on federal employees and programs, Trump held a Cabinet meeting that, according to the New York Times\ufeff, produced heated interchanges between Musk and at least two department heads (Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy). What Trump did to resolve these disputes is much less clear. Politico suggests the president laid down the law:\n\nPresident Donald Trump convened his Cabinet in person on Thursday to deliver a message: You\u2019re in charge of your departments, not Elon Musk.\n\nAccording to two administration officials, Trump told top members of his administration that Musk was empowered to make recommendations to the departments but not to issue unilateral decisions on staffing and policy.\n\nThe president\u2019s message represents the first significant move to narrow Musk\u2019s mandate. According to Trump\u2019s new guidance, DOGE and its staff should play an advisory role \u2014 but Cabinet secretaries should make final decisions on personnel, policy and the pacing of implementation.\n\nIf true, that would be a major development. But Trump did the functional equivalent of the weave in a subsequent Truth Social post:\n\nThe Golden Age of America has just begun! Over the past six weeks, our Administration has delivered on promises like no Administration before it, always putting America First! DOGE has been an incredible success, and now that we have my Cabinet in place, I have instructed the Secretaries and Leadership to work with DOGE on Cost Cutting measures and Staffing. As the Secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various Departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go. We say the \u201cscalpel\u201d rather than the \u201chatchet.\u201d The combination of them, Elon, DOGE, and other great people will be able to do things at a historic level. We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one. It\u2019s very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it\u2019s also important to keep the best and most productive people. We\u2019re going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done. The relationships between everybody in that room are extraordinary. They all want to get to the exact same place, which is, simply, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nAll one big happy team, right? Actually, it looks more like Trump will \u201crein in\u201d Musk only if his appointees do what DOGE tells them to do. After the Cabinet meeting, Trump told reporters \u201che wanted cuts, and that Musk would remain a power center: \u2018If they can cut, it\u2019s better. And if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u2019\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound to me like a definitive brushback pitch aimed at Musk\u2019s head.\n\nWhat may actually be going on is an effort to regularize DOGE\u2019s activities legally by treating them not as decision-makers but as advisers to both the president and to agency heads. Multiple federal judges have signaled that DOGE has no authority beyond a very general executive order from Trump to intervene in agency personnel and policy decisions. Indeed, one judge halted the peremptory firing of probationary employees by the DOGE-dominated Office of Personnel Management as having exceeded that entity\u2019s powers. So masking DOGE actions by channeling them through individual agency heads could be the play, creating the impression Musk is on a leash without diminishing his authority in any meaningful way.\n\nIn view of Trump\u2019s famous mob-boss management style, suffused with paranoia and incessant demands for personal loyalty, he may have also been subtly reminding Musk that his authority flows entirely from the Oval Office and can be withheld if he gets too big for his britches. But barring further clarification, it\u2019s likely that DOGE personnel will operate as extremely powerful commissars throughout the federal bureaucracy, manipulating the formal decision-makers to act in accordance with Musk\u2019s vision of a radically diminished, MAGA-compliant, and AI-driven workforce. It would be na\u00efve to assume the Trump-Musk partnership that helped create the 47th presidency is at any sort of an end or has even achieved a sustainable balance of power. These are two very complicated and dangerous men."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Walt Disney Pictures, Getty Images\n\nThese days, there are a lot of extremely alarming headlines featuring Donald Trump. At first glance, \u201cTrump\u2019s Own Declaration of Independence\u201d doesn\u2019t seem like one of them. The Atlantic headline published on March 6 sounds like a metaphor that could refer to anything from Trump\u2019s attempt to distance himself from alleged co-president Elon Musk to Canada-related tensions with King Charles III.\n\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s a story about Trump trying to seize the literal Declaration of Independence because it would look cool in his office.\n\nTrump \u201casked advisers in recent days about moving the Declaration of Independence into the Oval Office, according to people familiar with the conversations who requested anonymity to describe the planning,\u201d Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer report.\n\nIt seems even sycophantic Trump staffers were dismayed by his desire to remove the original copy of America\u2019s founding document from public view \u2014 just so it could be displayed alongside his Diet Coke button and framed mug shot in the Oval Office:\n\nTrump\u2019s request alarmed some of his aides, who immediately recognized both the implausibility and the expense of moving the original document. Displayed in the rotunda at the National Archives Building, in Washington, D.C., it is perhaps the most treasured historical document in the U.S. government\u2019s possession. The original is behind heavy glass in an oxygen-free, argon-filled case that can retract into the wall at night for security. Because of light damage to the faded animal-skin parchment, the room is kept dimly lit; restrictions have been placed on how often the doors can even be opened.\n\nTrump eventually decided to leave the original Declaration of Independence at the National Archives:\n\n\u2026 To the relief of aides, subsequent discussions appear to have focused on the possibility of moving one of the historical copies of the document, not the original. \u201cPresident Trump strongly believes that significant and historic documents that celebrate American history should be shared and put on display,\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung told us in an email.\n\nIndeed, it appears Trump has commandeered one of several historic copies of the Declaration in the government\u2019s possession. Trump tweeted photos of his new office decor on March 17 (the post was later deleted with no explanation). The White House didn\u2019t say which copy Trump is using.\n\n\u201cThe Nationals Archives delivered the Declaration of Independence to the White House at the President\u2019s request. It is displayed in the Oval Office where it will be carefully protected and preserved,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump put a framed version of the Declaration of Independence on the wall in the Oval Office. pic.twitter.com/zUYD9C8kUd \u2014 ALX \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@alx) March 17, 2025\n\nThough The Atlantic said, \u201cIt is unclear where Trump first got the idea to add a Declaration to the Oval Office\u2019s d\u00e9cor,\u201d I think we all know the likely genesis of this scheme:\n\nAs Trump, who\u2019s a bit of a cinephile, likely recalls, in the 2004 film National Treasure Nicolas Cage steals the Declaration of Independence because he thinks there\u2019s a map on the back written in invisible ink. So if Trump returns his copy of the Declaration with lemon juice all over it, we\u2019ll have our confirmation. In the meantime, let\u2019s just hope he doesn\u2019t destroy too much of the White House while hunting for the presidents\u2019 Book of Secrets.\n\nThis post was updated after Trump added a copy of the Declaration to the Oval Office."

The work of DOGE at the agency so far, the lawsuit says, mirrors how other foreign aid agencies have been dismantled by the Trump administration.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan for the African Development Foundation snapped into action almost immediately, with DOGE staffers meeting with the foundation\u2019s leadership within days of Trump\u2019s February 21 executive order. The Trump administration then told a board member, Ward Brehm, he was being removed from his position, and a new acting chair would be in charge.\n\nStaffers with the Department of Government Efficiency enter the offices of the U.S. African Development Foundation in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times/Redux\n\nFaced with the overhaul, the board held an emergency meeting on Monday to push back, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington this week. The board decided Trump\u2019s appointee, Peter Marocco \u2014 the de-facto acting leader of USAID, another agency Trump has targeted \u2014 was not lawfully in the job, and they alerted Congress, the removed board member Ward Brehm\u2019s lawsuit said.\n\nMarocco still showed up at the fund\u2019s headquarters with staffers of the Department of Government Efficiency on Wednesday afternoon. They \u201cwere denied access to those offices,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cMarocco and his colleagues threatened to return to the offices with United States Marshals and Secret Service.\u201d\n\nYet Marocco did get into the building on Thursday with the backing of federal law enforcement, Brehm\u2019s attorneys also said in court papers. Staffers from DOGE also attempted to get access to the foundation\u2019s computer systems and personnel files on Thursday, the court papers said.\n\n\u201cMarocco and DOGE showed up with U.S. Marshals and forced their way into USADF,\u201d Brehm\u2019s lawyers wrote about the events of Thursday. \u201cAt the very moment that this motion is being finalized, Marocco and DOGE are demanding\u2014based on Marocco\u2019s illusory authority\u2014immediate access to USADF\u2019s computer systems.\u201d\n\nA White House official, however, defended the right of Marocco and his team to enter the building.\n\n\u201cEntitled, rogue bureaucrats have no authority to defy executive orders by the President of the United States or physically bar his representatives from entering the agencies they run,\u201d Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, said on Friday.\n\nKelly noted that Trump\u2019s previous order had reduced the foundation, as part of the executive branch, to its \u201cstatutory minimum.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times published photos on Thursday of DOGE workers in an elevator at the foundation\u2019s offices and US Marshals walking down a hallway past the foundation\u2019s reception desk.\n\nA spokesperson for USADF said Friday the agency\u2019s locks were changed and staffers couldn\u2019t access the offices, adding that DOGE staffers have not been able to access USADF systems yet. The spokesperson claimed the agency\u2019s X account was banned or shut down on Thursday, which they described as \u201ca concerning development for the agency\u2019s right to free speech.\u201d\n\nWhile the lawsuit, filed by lawyers from the left-leaning group Democracy Forward, contests Brehm\u2019s removal from the leadership post, it also argues that it fears the Trump administration is attempting to shutter the fund\u2019s work by ending its foreign development grants and taking over its software systems.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to use every tool available to protect USADF and fight back against the Trump-Musk overreach,\u201d Skye Perryman, the head of Democracy Forward, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the African Development Foundation\u2019s board must be approved by the Senate. The Foundation was created specifically by an act of Congress 45 years ago, the lawsuit notes.\n\nFederal judge Richard Leon of the DC District Court on Thursday said that from now until a least a court hearing next Tuesday, Brehm can\u2019t be removed from the board and Marocco can\u2019t be appointed to it.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

Combs has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBankman-Fried told Carlson that Diddy is \u201ckind to people in the unit,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201cbeen kind to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a soul crushing place for the world in general, and what we see are just the people that are around us on the inside rather than who we are on the outside,\u201d Bankman-Fried told Carlson in the roughly 40-minute interview posted on X.\n\nCarlson said that he and Diddy are \u201ctwo of the most famous prisoners in the world,\u201d but Bankman-Fried won\u2019t tell the rapper that it was his 33rd birthday this week. \u201cSomeone else might, but I\u2019m not,\u201d he said.\n\nLiving with a celebrity is one of the more interesting aspects of Bankman-Fried\u2019s life, he said. That changed last year after he was found guilty for defrauding customers and investors in his failed crypto exchange FTX. His sentence of 25 years was about half of what prosecutors had asked for, but still put him at the high end for sentence length in prominent white-collar fraud cases.\n\nBankman-Fried said he\u2019s made some friends, but said prison was a \u201cweird environment\u201d because it\u2019s a \u201ccombination of a few other high profile cases and then a lot of \u2026 ex-gangsters, alleged ex-gangsters.\u201d Many of them are \u201csurprisingly good at chess,\u201d he learned.\n\nHe\u2019s also shifted his political stance. Once a donor to former President Joe Biden, Bankman-Fried said he\u2019s moved right and started donating to Republicans \u201cprivately\u201d as much as he was to Democrats in late 2022. He said his politics changed after spending a lot of time in Washington, DC, during the Biden era and was \u201creally, really shocked by what I saw \u2014 not in a good direction \u2014 from the administration.\u201d\n\nTucker Carlson and Sam Bankman-Fried. From Tucker Carlson/X\n\nCarlson followed up that it\u2019s \u201csort of weird\u201d to ask Bankman-Fried if crypto regulation is moving in a \u201cgood direction,\u201d but said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t resist.\u201d\n\nHis response? \u201cHopefully \u2026 Changing the guard helps. But financial regulators \u2014 they\u2019re big, giant bureaucracies in the federal government \u2014 they\u2019re not used to changing overnight. They have been playing a big, obstructive role for a decade in crypto.\u201d\n\nAs for Bankman-Fried\u2019s wealth, once worth around $15 billion, has all but diminished. In addition to the prison sentence, he also ordered a forfeiture of $11 billion.\n\n\u201cThe company that I used to own \u2026 had nothing intervened, today it would have about $15 billion of liabilities and about $93 billion of assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer should be, in theory, yes, there was enough money to pay everyone back in kind. But that\u2019s not how things worked out. Instead, it all got roiled up in a bankruptcy.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nEvery big consumer tech cycle has its free-trial era. In 1999, in a few cities, it was the magic of at-cost same-day delivery from Kozmo, which lost money on every order in a bid for growth. Through the 2000s, it was the rise of powerful search engines and social networks with relatively few ads. In the 2010s, the VC-backed lose-money-to-make-money strategy returned to the physical world, with services like Uber (and a hundred Uber-fors) hemorrhaging money on underpriced taxis, food delivery, and DTC goods in a multibillion-dollar experiment in customer acquisition memorialized as a fleeting \u201cmillennial lifestyle subsidy.\u201d As with just about everything else, after 2020, things, you know, got a little hazy for a while \u2014 although you might argue that low interest rates produced so many examples of unsustainably priced services and goods that it\u2019s hard to pick just one.\n\nCompanies do this, and investors allow it, because it sometimes works. In the process, early adopters can reap small but real benefits from strategic underpricing. Kozmo was beloved by its tiny customer base but collapsed into a punch line; Amazon, its money-losing contemporary, is one of the largest companies in the world. Most free (and ad-free) social-media apps failed, but a few of them became so dominant that they can now add as much friction and advertising to their products as they want, making longtime users nostalgic for how they used to be. A lot of Uber-type businesses failed, but Uber made it through. Rides cost more because Uber needs to charge more and can, even if longtime riders remember paying $15 for what\u2019s now a $50 ride.\n\nIn 2025, we\u2019re somewhere in the front half of a historically massive tech-investment cycle in and around AI, and the pattern is showing signs of repeating. An \u201cinteresting situation has returned where free-to-access AI is very close to the frontier,\u201d writes Wharton professor and AI evangelist Ethan Mollick. There are nearly as many pricing strategies in AI as there are AI products to pay for \u2014 subscriptions, ads, metered usage, and combinations of all three \u2014 and the products themselves are complicated, tiered, and broadly unfamiliar. Still, if you\u2019re looking for it, you can see the outline of a familiar situation: OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and smaller firms like Anthropic are losing massive amounts of money by giving away their AI products or selling them at a loss. \u201cWe are in the era of $5 Uber rides anywhere across San Francisco but for LLMs,\u201d wrote early OpenAI engineer Andrej Karpathy in response to Mollick, \u201cweee.\u201d Chatbots are free, programming assistance is cheap, and attention-grabbing, money-losing AI toys are everywhere. AI is in its free(ish) trial era.\n\nThe sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is strongest at companies that have done this sort of thing before. Meta is slotting chatbots and AI-powered tools into virtually all of its products in an attempt to amass \u2014 re-amass? \u2014 as many users as possible. As with acquired products like Instagram and WhatsApp, attempts to turn a profit are delayed but inevitable. There are \u201cpretty clear monetization opportunities here over time, including paid recommendations and including a premium offering,\u201d the company\u2019s finance chief said in January. (That\u2019s ads and subscriptions, in plain English.) Google charges developers for access to its models and also sells subscriptions to Gemini, but the company is installing free AI features in virtually all of its popular products, including Android, Search, Gmail, and Docs. OpenAI\u2019s confusing and constantly changing pricing currently gives unpaid users limited access to near-cutting-edge models and unlimited access to its basic ChatGPT and Search functions, with more powerful models, and more features, tiered at $20 and $200 per month, a price at which the company still loses money, according to CEO Sam Altman:\n\ninsane thing: we are currently losing money on openai pro subscriptions!\n\n\n\npeople use it much more than we expected. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) January 6, 2025\n\nAltman is projecting confidence by making a joke out of this and has made no secret of the fact that OpenAI is losing a lot of money to grow. And the trend Mollick is referring to \u2014 in just a few disorienting years, the industry has alternated directionally between moving more AI tools behind paywalls and just making everything free by default \u2014 might not last. In July of last year, Altman was talking about \u201cintelligence too cheap to meter,\u201d a phrase popularized in debates about nuclear power. (To some extent, competition between AI firms can be understood as a battle to control the next version of the omnibox, the universal computer interface that has made Google hundreds of billions of dollars; in this more familiar territory, providing services for free, or very cheaply, is a necessary part of the plan.) This week, after some major pivots in how these companies develop and deploy models, and somewhat to Altman\u2019s own surprise, he\u2019s floating ideas like this:\n\nan idea for paid plans: your $20 plus subscription converts to credits you can use across features like deep research, o1, gpt-4.5, sora, etc.\n\n\n\nno fixed limits per feature and you choose what you want; if you run out of credits you can buy more.\n\n\n\nwhat do you think? good/bad? \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) March 4, 2025\n\nAs familiar as some of this is, there\u2019s a lot about this cycle that isn\u2019t. Unlike, say, food delivery, the cost of serving even relatively recent AI models has tended to drop quickly and precipitously, while the cost of creating new ones has continued \u2014 with an occasional trillion-dollar caveat \u2014 to go up. (You can run freely available models that would have been considered cutting-edge just a year ago on a hardy PC.)\n\nAlso unlike Uber or Seamless or even Facebook \u2014 but perhaps a bit more like Amazon \u2014 the quality of the product on offer is tied, at least in theory, not just to scale but to massive up-front and ongoing material investment (for Amazon, in logistics infrastructure; for OpenAI, in GPUs). The actual costs of providing an Uber ride have been relatively stable for the life of the company, and higher current prices are just closer to the actual cost of hiring a person with a car to drive you somewhere, plus whatever Uber needs to add to cover its other operations and turn a profit. Uber was undercharging, and now it\u2019s not. OpenAI is undercharging, too, and one day it might not \u2014 the free trial might come to an end, and its mainstream product might be filled with ads or cost more to use \u2014 but it could also be a fundamentally different product, with different capabilities and value to its customers. Karpathy\u2019s suggestion is perhaps a bit narrower than that. Now, pretty much anyone can play with the latest AI tools. Soon, in part because of new models that require a lot of computing power not just to train but to use, this might not be true. This dovetails with recent reporting that OpenAI is considering much higher price tiers for its next generation of AI \u201cagents\u201d:\n\nOpenAI executives have told some investors it planned to sell low-end agents at a cost of $2,000 per month to \u201chigh-income knowledge workers\u201d; mid-tier agents for software development costing possibly $10,000 a month; and high-end agents, acting as PhD-level research agents, which could cost $20,000 per month, according to a person who\u2019s spoken with executives.\n\nOpenAI is claiming that it sees a path to creating tools to match these prices, and some others in the industry do as well \u2014 in other words, this is the lawyered, quantified, pitch-deck version of looser public discussions about AGI, the exhilarating and/or terrifying (and fundamentally fuzzy) prospect of which has pulled hundreds of billions of dollars into AI investment.\n\nAccording to the Information, though, it\u2019s monetizing ChatGPT, not suddenly vaporizing a significant percent of knowledge work, that\u2019s core to the company\u2019s actual plans, at least for the next couple of years:\n\nOverall, OpenAI told investors it expects revenue to more than triple this year, from $3.7 billion to more than $12.5 billion \u2026 By 2026, OpenAI expects revenue to hit $28 billion. It expects most of its revenue in 2025 and 2026 to come from ChatGPT, with the rest of its sales coming from software developer tools and AI agents.\n\nWhether OpenAI can scale its technology to \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d or meaningfully deploy its agents \u201cinto the workforce\u201d are fascinating questions that the company enjoys drawing attention to, but in its most optimistic projections \u2014 again, regarding products it has not yet built for customers it has not yet identified \u2014 this sort of stuff represents up to a quarter of its revenues \u201cin the long run.\u201d In the meantime, OpenAI intends to figure out how to make money from its one popular product that actually exists. For most people who use ChatGPT, it\u2019s a novel tool that can answer questions, help with homework, and search the web through an interface that is, in 2025, unusually uncluttered and clean. It\u2019s also something they use for free, with increasing awareness of multiple free and comparable alternatives. They\u2019re enjoying the AI trial period, and despite broad uncertainty about the future of the underlying technology, when it comes to the tools they\u2019re already using, they have a pretty good sense of what comes next."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nA grassroots movement\u2019s call for Americans not to shop at major chains for 24 hours in an \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d last week went viral \u2014 and now, its organizer is launching a weeklong boycott against Amazon that starts Friday.\n\nJohn Schwarz, the 57-year-old founder of The People\u2019s Union USA, is calling on Americans to boycott Amazon and its companies, including Zappos, Ring, Whole Foods, Twitch and Prime Video, for one week.\n\nThe Amazon boycott is about \u201csending a message loud enough to shake up the system\u201d and rattle the company, Schwarz said Thursday on his Instagram account.\n\n\u201cAmazon is one of the biggest, wealthiest, most powerful corporations in the world,\u201d he said in a video. \u201cIt crushes small businesses. It exploits its workers. It fights against unions while raking in billions. It could make a positive difference in the world, but it chooses not to.\u201d\n\nSchwarz is leveraging the attention from the wider \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d on February 28. He told CNN in an interview last week that he hadn\u2019t expect much traction for his post, which was viewed millions of times. Celebrities like Stephen King and Bette Midler encouraged participation, and reporters wrote and aired TV pieces about it.\n\nOn The People\u2019s Union USA\u2019s website, Schwarz calls the group \u201ca grassroots movement dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform,\u201d adding that the \u201cgoal is to unite Americans against the corruption and greed that has kept us struggling for decades.\u201d\n\nBlackout\u2019s impact\n\nSchwarz\u2019s boycott call last week gained strength online because it has captured the visceral public anger with the American economy, corporations and politics.\n\nStill, the \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d effort is relatively uncoordinated and nebulous. Experts on consumer boycotts and corporate strategy are dubious that it will make a dent in the bottom lines of the massive companies that it targets, let alone the vast US economy.\n\nLast week\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t make much of an impact to those corporations\u2019 bottom lines, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that uses phone location data to track store visits.\n\nThe firm said that \u201cmany retailers experienced year-over-year declines in weekly visits throughout February 2025,\u201d but attributed this to \u201cpost-holiday spending pullbacks, decreased consumer confidence, economic and tariff uncertainty, and unseasonably cold weather\u201d\n\nAs a result, Placer.ai said, the February 28 event\u2019s \u201cspecific impact is difficult to isolate, as most retailers saw year-over-year declines in line with recent weekly trends.\u201d\n\nAmazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment."

            "full_content": "Photo: Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nEvery six hours or so, it seems, some federal judge blocks or unblocks or reblocks some action taken by Elon Musk, DOGE, and the Trump administration: mass firings of government employees, billions of dollars in frozen funding, near-dissolution of an entire government agency, targeted dismissals of departmental leaders and internal watchdogs, emails demanding that federal workers list five accomplishments or else risk either \u201cresignation,\u201d being \u201csemi-fired,\u201d or nothing at all, depending on the day.\n\nWhenever one judge greenlights some DOGE gambit, another court moments later slaps a temporary pause on some other cost-cutting measure. Don\u2019t worry; if you\u2019re confused, that just means you\u2019re paying attention.\n\nHow, then, can we understand these dozens of legal disputes as they play out across our federal courts? There\u2019s no magic decoder ring here, no unifying field theory that explains or predicts the decisions as some coherent whole. But it\u2019s not total chaos. (Not in the courts, at least; the executive branch is a tad disheveled at the moment.) We can largely understand the judicial rulings we\u2019ve seen so far, and those that lie ahead, by applying three basic principles.\n\n1.\n\nEyes glaze when we talk about legalistic formalities like \u201cstanding\u201d (does the plaintiff have a dog in the fight?) or \u201cjurisdiction\u201d (can this court hear this case now?). But technicalities can turn outcomes, with massive consequences. For example, many of Trump\u2019s attempts to challenge the 2020 election failed because the plaintiffs lacked standing \u2014 meaning they had no direct, tangible stake in the matter. And the abortion medication mifepristone remains widely available because the Supreme Court in 2023 rejected a challenge by anti-abortion medical associations based on lack of standing.\n\nSimilarly, some legal challenges to Musk and DOGE have failed because of technical (but fatal) defects. One federal judge, John Bates (a George W. Bush appointee), noted that \u201cthe Court harbors concerns about defendants\u2019 alleged conduct\u201d \u2014 but temporarily rejected a challenge by labor unions seeking to deny DOGE access to sensitive data because the plaintiffs lacked standing. (A labor union is no substitute for an aggrieved employee and is too far removed from the dispute, the judge found.) Another federal judge in Washington, D.C., the Obama-nominated Christopher Cooper, declined to temporarily block DOGE from firing probationary employees because the law requires certain federal workers first to contest adverse employment actions through administrative hearings. Thus, the judge found, the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Keep these threshold questions in mind as we move ahead. The bar is low, but if challengers can\u2019t clear it, they\u2019re cooked.\n\n2.\n\nTo this point, virtually all the cases filed against Musk and DOGE have sought emergency relief \u2014 typically a \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d from a court that somebody must stop doing something. But plaintiffs in these cases bear a heavy burden. They must show, even before the case has gotten into fact-specific discovery, that if the disputed action is not blocked, they will suffer \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an uphill climb. Two Obama-nominated D.C. federal judges \u2014 Randy Moss (not the wide receiver) and Tanya Chutkan (the one and same who presided over the Trump January 6 prosecution, plainly no fan of the president) \u2014 rejected challenges to DOGE actions because the plaintiffs could not meet this requirement. Judge Chutkan stressed that the party seeking the \u201cextraordinary\u201d remedy of a restraining order must show some injury that is \u201cboth certain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond remediation, and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.\u201d\n\nDespite these setbacks, the majority of challenges to Musk and DOGE have met with early success. We\u2019ve seen judges across the country temporarily block the Trump administration from accessing private data, withholding federal funding, and firing certain executive branch employees. But these wins are temporary; it\u2019s been only 46 days since Trump took office, after all. (I know.) The larger disputes on the merits still lie ahead, and they raise fundamental questions that could shift the foundations of our government.\n\nWhich brings us to our third and final principle:\n\n3.\n\nTake, for example, Trump\u2019s firing of 17 inspectors general. Some have sued because, under a law passed by Congress in 2022, the president must first provide 30 days\u2019 notice to Congress and a \u201csubstantive rationale\u201d for any such termination. Trump characteristically skipped the formalities and just straight-up canned them \u2014 no notice provided, no reasons given. Similarly, Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, an official in charge of a whistleblower agency, for no particular reason other than he wanted the guy gone. But a law provides that that official can be fired only for performance-related issues.\n\nThese might seem like easy cases at first glance. \u201cThe law\u201d \u2014 actual statutes passed by Congress \u2014 says the president must do certain things before he can fire certain employees, and the president did not do those things. Hence the president broke \u201cthe law\u201d and the employees should win \u2014 right?\n\nNow we\u2019ve come to the crux. The Trump administration maintains broadly that these laws are unconstitutional incursions on the executive branch by Congress and therefore violate separation-of-powers principles. All due respect to the esteemed gentlemen and women up on the Hill, but you simply can\u2019t tell the president what to do inside the executive branch, the argument goes.\n\nIndeed, conservatives \u2014 and we\u2019ve got six of them on the Supreme Court at the moment \u2014 typically view executive-branch power expansively, and the president\u2019s power within that branch as absolute, or near-absolute. Take, for example, last summer\u2019s criminal-immunity ruling, in which the Court\u2019s conservative majority granted the president astonishingly broad protections against prosecution based on a sweeping view of executive authority. Indeed, according to the \u201cunitary executive theory\u201d popularized in the Federalist Society and other conservative strongholds, the president not only leads the executive branch \u2014 he is the executive branch unto himself.\n\nPut it this way. Which five justices do you see ruling that Congress can micromanage how the president handles his business within the executive branch that he was elected to lead? Jon Stewart \u2014 no conservative (and, yes, I will cite him for serious legal propositions when he cuts to the heart of the matter) \u2014 isn\u2019t buying it. He mocked the technocratic argument against the president\u2019s power to run his own branch of government: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what? Oh, apparently, you can fire them [inspectors general], but you have to give them 30 days\u2019 notice. Oh, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re upset about? \u2018No! You can do it \u2014 but not in that font!\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest that all the legal challenges to Trump, Musk, and DOGE will fail. Congress (and plaintiffs) stand on stronger constitutional footing in the funding-freeze cases given the Constitution\u2019s explicit grant of the power to tax and spend to the legislative branch. Indeed, on Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s effort to withhold $2 billion in foreign aid that had already been allocated by Congress. The decision was largely procedural, but the practical result, as the four dissenting conservatives noted, is that the disputed money almost certainly will be paid out.\n\nUltimately, these lawsuits \u2014 the ones that clear our aforementioned technical barriers \u2014 are about far more than whether the president can fire one particular official or whether a certain pot of money must be spent. As they move through the courts, these cases will test and reshape our constitutional balance of powers. And while the Supreme Court won\u2019t take up every matter, when it does, the smart money is on executive power. Prepare for the ground to shift.\n\nThis article will also appear in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nOne week after Elon Musk held court before the cameras during President Donald Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting, many of the Senate-confirmed leaders of government departments and agencies reconvened in the Cabinet Room on Thursday for a different kind of discussion.\n\nDuring a nearly 90-minute meeting \u2013 this time, without any cameras \u2013 Trump delivered a clear message as Musk, one of the most influential members of his administration, sat nearby.\n\nThe president told his agency heads that while Musk\u2019s effort to slash the size and spending of the federal government has his full support, they are the ones, not Musk, who are in charge of staffing at their respective agencies.\n\n\u201cKeep all the people you want, everybody that you need,\u201d Trump told his Cabinet, as he recounted to reporters later in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI want them to do the best job they can,\u201d the president went on. \u201cWhere we have good people, that\u2019s precious, that\u2019s very important, and we want them to keep the good people.\u201d\n\nThe meeting on Thursday, which Trump said would be repeated every two weeks, was among the first examples of the president acting to rein in Musk\u2019s broad powers. Instead of a proverbial chainsaw, which Musk held up during a high-profile appearance last month, Trump said the administration would be wielding a \u201cscalpel\u201d to make cuts going forward.\n\nMusk is still expected to make recommendations on the agencies\u2019 cuts. And Trump made clear that if his department heads weren\u2019t making sufficient reductions, the tech billionaire would intervene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be watching them, and Elon and the group are going to be watching them, and if they can cut, it\u2019s better,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, Trump told his team, it\u2019s the Senate-confirmed Cabinet members who have the final say.\n\nA White House official described the meeting as a check-in after Trump\u2019s address to Congress, where he laid out the work his administration has done over the last six weeks. Aside from the Department of Government Efficiency, aides said, the Cabinet also conferred on national security issues and top priorities. At least six Cabinet members were not present, with many traveling outside of Washington this week for official duties.\n\nBut it was Trump\u2019s directive on cuts going forward that appeared the most consequential and provided the most clarification to date on the power dynamics of the second Trump term. Staffing has been one of the foremost concerns for agency heads, some of whom complained last week that their departments were undermanned, according to a person familiar with what transpired in the first Cabinet meeting after reporters left the room.\n\n\u201cVery productive meeting,\u201d Musk posted on X, replying to photographs the White House posted on social media that showed images of the closed-door meeting. After wearing a black hat and t-shirt to the first Cabinet meeting, Musk wore a suit and tie Thursday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune sent an unmistakable signal this week that members of the Cabinet should take the lead in making hiring and firing decisions at their own agencies, telling CNN: \u201cThey are going to be better attuned to the individual programs.\u201d\n\nOver the last several weeks, quiet grumbles have emerged from atop agencies as they contended with Musk\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal government.\n\nAfter Musk issued a directive to all federal employees to recount their workweeks or risk termination, several agency heads advised their own workforces to ignore the request until they could sort out the demand.\n\nLater, a second email request was sent \u2013 this time from individual agencies, providing the departments more control over their own personnel.\n\nThe closed-door meeting on Thursday, which was not included on the president\u2019s daily public schedule, also stood in stark contrast to the marquee moment earlier this week when Musk rose to his feet in the House chamber and was repeatedly lauded by Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nWhile the richest man in the world basked in applause from Republicans in that prime-time moment, he has also been increasingly working behind the scenes to try and soften the rough edges from some of the more controversial decisions from his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nFor weeks, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has been paying close attention to a rising wave of criticism and complaints about Musk from Republicans and business leaders. Wiles has a cordial and businesslike relationship with Musk, people familiar with their dynamic say, and he accepted her suggestion to extend his hand and be more available to members of Congress.\n\nWiles ducked out of the first Cabinet meeting last week a bit early \u2013 a pre-planned exit, long after Musk had finished speaking \u2013 to attend a lunch with Senate Republicans. She listened to feedback, acknowledged how she understood some of their angst and explained the nuts and bolts of how the president and Musk work.\n\n\u201cMusk is working directly with the president and the president then works with the Cabinet secretaries,\u201d Wiles said, according to an account from Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, who was at the lunch.\n\nSeveral attendees said they wanted to learn more and hear directly from Musk. A day later, 22 Republican senators came to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House to meet with Musk. They listened as Musk explained the cuts he was making and posed for a photograph with him after the meeting.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota called on Musk to better explain how DOGE would fix mistakes they make.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of cases, where they are carte blanche making significant cuts, how do we go about making sure that that message gets back and it gets corrected as quickly as possible?\u201d Rounds said.\n\nHe said Wiles \u201coffered to be the contact when she\u2019s been in front of us,\u201d but noted \u201cshe\u2019s just one person,\u201d so a formal process was needed.\n\nThis week, Musk, who has also become one of the biggest political benefactors for Republicans, held forth in back-to-back meetings with members of the House and Senate on Wednesday.\n\nHe distanced himself and his team from the widespread firings across the federal government and placed blame on department heads, GOP lawmakers said.\n\n\u201cHe just said that they trusted the departments to, you know, instead of using a cudgel to use a scalpel to get rid of people that are unproductive,\u201d said Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point.\u201d\n\nTo any senators with questions, Musk offered his personal cell phone number. But hours later, as he spoke to House members, he urged them to consult the DOGE website.\n\n\u201cHow can I get ahold of you? He said there\u2019s a web site for that,\u201d Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, told CNN. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t give us his number.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

Coca Cola with sparkling water, sweetened with Canadian maple syrup.\n\nAt the end of January, as US President Donald Trump ramped up threats to annex Canada and wreck its economy with tariffs, Graham Palmateer, who runs a pizza joint in Toronto\u2019s west end, told his customers he\u2019d be making some swaps to his fridges and shelves: no more products produced in the United States, or by American companies.\n\n\u201cAt one point I just figured, that\u2019s enough, I\u2019m going to do this,\u201d Palmateer, the owner of Gram\u2019s Pizza, told CNN.\n\nAn unfamiliar emotion has been brewing in normally polite Canada: anger.\n\nSince Trump first threatened to enact sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports and began referring to the US\u2019 northern neighbor as the 51st state, animosity toward the US and its leader has been mounting.\n\nCanadians have canceled vacations south of the border and loudly booed \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at sports events. An ice hockey game between the two countries last month quickly turned into a geopolitical event as players on both sides threw fists.\n\nOthers, like Palmateer, have boycotted US products \u2013 not always an easy task in a country that has been economically tied to its southern neighbor for decades, with trade exceeding $760 billion last year.\n\nGraham Palmateer, owner of Toronto pizzeria Gram\u2019s Pizza, is among Canadians boycotting US goods in the wake of the tariffs. Courtesy\n\nTrump\u2019s targeting of Canada has given rise to a rare moment of unity in a country that just months ago was facing a political crisis as the public\u2019s frustrations over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s leadership reached boiling point, prompting the longtime leader to announce his resignation.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have fueled a surge in Canadian patriotism and disrupted the country\u2019s politics in an election year, giving a surprising boost to the floundering ruling Liberal Party and forcing opposition Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre \u2013 long considered a shoo-in for Canada\u2019s next prime minister \u2013 to rethink his messaging.\n\n\u201cWe, as Canadians, we don\u2019t go out and try to create fights,\u201d said Torontonian Dylan Lobo, who runs online directory Made in Canada, which has seen a surge in traffic in recent months as Canadians look to support domestic brands in response to Trump\u2019s threats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an attack on Canada,\u201d he said.\n\nCanadians boycott US products\n\nAfter months of warnings, Trump on Tuesday slapped 25% tariffs on nearly all Canadian goods, sending markets plummeting and driving Canada-US relations to a new low.\n\nAlmost immediately, Canadian leader Trudeau responded with matching tariffs on 30 billion Canadian dollars ($20.8 billion) worth of American goods, with potentially more to come.\n\n\u201cCanadians are reasonable and we are polite but we will not back down from a fight \u2014 not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at stake,\u201d Trudeau said Tuesday.\n\nTrump said he told Trudeau on a Wednesday telephone call that the Canadian leader hadn\u2019t done enough to curb fentanyl crossing the border \u2014 despite the minuscule amount that arrives in the US from its northern neighbor. Trump suggested after the call \u2014 which he said \u201cended in a \u2018somewhat\u2019 friendly manner\u201d \u2014 that the outgoing Trudeau could be using the tariff issue to \u201cstay in power.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, the US president announced brief reprieves from the tariffs for automakers, and for goods that fall under the North American free trade agreement negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nBut for many, the two months of back-and-forth with Trump on tariffs have irreparably damaged ties.\n\n\u201cThe relationship has been changed forever,\u201d British Columbia Premier David Eby told reporters this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got friends, family and relationships that have gone back for generations across the border. We love our American family members,\u201d he added. But Canadians \u201cwill never again put ourselves in the position of being so dependent on the United States.\u201d\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump\u2019s repeated threats against Canada \u2013 punctuated by him mockingly referring to Trudeau as \u201cgovernor\u201d \u2013 have struck a nerve in the country, America\u2019s longtime friend and ally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol on Tuesday. Win McNamee/Pool/AP\n\n\u201cI can tell you that Canadians right now are upset, we\u2019re angry, we\u2019re dismayed,\u201d said John Liedtke, from Windsor, Ontario, which neighbors the US city of Detroit.\n\n\u201cI know of people who have said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to step foot on that side of the border again,\u2019\u201d he told CNN.\n\nNikki Gauthier, a retired nurse living in St. Catharine\u2019s, Ontario, said she felt anger \u201cright off the bat,\u201d when she heard about the \u201cunkind and unwarranted\u201d US tariffs.\n\nGauthier said she canceled her subscription with US tech giant Amazon in favor of the Chinese online marketplace Temu, and has been carefully inspecting product labels in the grocery store and prioritizing Canadian products when she can.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no Canadian lettuce, I\u2019ll look for Mexican lettuce,\u201d she said.\n\nCanadian officials responded swiftly to Trump\u2019s move, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford directing workers at the province\u2019s government-run liquor retailors to remove all US products \u2013 from California chardonnay to Jack Daniel\u2019s whisky \u2013 from the shelves. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario is one of the world\u2019s largest wholesalers and sells about $1 billion worth of US liquor per year, according to Ford.\n\nFord told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday his province is implementing a 25% tariff on electricity exports to 1.5 million Americans\u2019 homes in Minnesota, Michigan and New York next week.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Canadians have fought Trump tariffs. Seven years ago, during his first term as president, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all foreign steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports while in the middle of negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\n\"Made in Canada\" stickers displayed next to price tags of maple syrup at Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, on Tuesday.

He said he\u2019s gone from receiving four to five submissions for new businesses a day to nearly 5,000 in the past few weeks, with the site\u2019s daily traffic jumping tenfold from previous years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never witnessed such a large response from the community,\u201d said Lobo, who runs the site solo as a \u201cpassion project.\u201d\n\nPalmeteer, the Toronto pizza shop owner, said making the switch from US products \u2013 including dropping American retailer Costco as a supplier \u2013 has been relatively easy, and has been met with resounding support from his community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen Canadians united about much,\u201d Palmateer said. \u201cThis seems to be something pretty much everybody is on the same page about.\u201d\n\nAs Canadians\u2019 opinion of the US and its leader has plunged, their perception of their own country has improved, said David Coletto, CEO of Canadian polling and research firm Abacus Data.\n\nIn a recent survey, the number of Canadians who said they think the country is headed in the right direction hit a two-year high, up to 30% from just 19% when Trudeau resigned in January, Coletto said.\n\nPatriotism \u2013 traditionally less overt in Canada than in the US \u2013 is on the rise. The Canadian flag, which had in recent years become associated with 2022\u2019s right-wing \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d protests opposing Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, has been rebranded as a symbol of national pride and resistance to Trump.\n\nCanadian flagmaker Flags Unlimited\u2019s sales have doubled from a year ago, the company\u2019s owner told CNN affiliate CBC News.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a news conference on US tariffs in Ottawa on Tuesday. Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press/AP\n\nTariffs fuel surge in support for Liberals\n\nTrump\u2019s targeting of Canada was \u201ca shock to the Canadian psyche that just completely reoriented the way that people were seeing things,\u201d Coletto said \u2013 so much so that it could influence the outcome of the country\u2019s next federal election.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s replacement as Liberal leader and prime minister will be picked next week.\n\nAmong those running are former Liberal finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement with the first Trump administration, and former central bank governor Mark Carney.\n\nUnder Canadian law, the next general election must be held before October, but it is likely to be called sooner.\n\nSupport for the Liberals has bounced back in recent weeks after years of decline, with recent polls showing the Conservatives\u2019 long-held lead could be narrowing.\n\nTensions with the US have shaped what Canadians are looking for in their next leader, Coletto said.\n\n\u201cWe went from an environment where the public was so much looking for a change in government, to one where a growing number of people are looking to hire somebody to replace the prime minister who can help handle the effects of Trump\u2019s decision on our country,\u201d Coletto said.\n\nPoilievre, leader of the Conservatives, has distanced himself from Trump and refocused his message from one about Canada\u2019s internal struggles to a \u201cCanada first\u201d patriotism pitch.\n\nMade in Canada owner Lobo said he\u2019s received hundreds of thousands of emails from Canadians across the political spectrum who are angry about Trump\u2019s policies \u2013 and from Americans and Europeans who want to support Canada.\n\nCelebrities have jumped on the bandwagon, too.\n\nCanadian actor Mike Myers, portraying Elon Musk on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last weekend, wore a t-shirt with the slogan \u201cCanada is not for sale.\u201d\n\nAs the credits rolled, he shared another message for Canadians. He flexed his arm and mouthed: \u201cElbows up,\u201d an ice hockey term signaling it\u2019s time to fight."
