Trump has done that with other countries as well; Greenland and talking about Panama and these threats have to stop,\" Michelle Cook, a protestor said.\n\nTrump's trade war with Canada has many people concerned about the relationship with America's long-standing ally.\n\n\"As a state here in Michigan and the city of Detroit, we work with Canadians so closely, and they're so integral to our infrastructure,\" Alia Brodie, an event organizer said. \"And everything that we do, this is a unique opportunity for us to show solidarity with our allies.\"\n\nThe protest was organized by \"We the People Dissent\" and other activist groups.\n\n\"We want to work together, and our country putting tariffs on them is [not] only hurting them, but also us,\" Brodie said.\n\nPeople sang the Canadian national anthem before waving to Canadian residents gathered on the other side of the river.\n\n\"I want them to see that we still consider them our friends and allies and that we're doing everything we can to change this dangerous rhetoric,\" Cook said.\n\nDemonstrators on the American side of the rally said this issue is about more than just politics.\n\n\"It's really kind of good versus evil at this point, like human decency versus, you know, capitalism and greed and exploiting the rest of us and so basic, foundational values. I think those things unite us and are going to keep us together,\" Brodie said."

            "full_content": "Photo: Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock\n\nOn December 3, 2024, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, hurling his country into an ongoing political crisis that has already resulted in his impeachment and arrest. In their effort to reconstruct the events of the day, investigators uncovered a strange detail: Hours before the declaration, the president\u2019s head of security was asking ChatGPT about coups. From Korean paper The Hankyoreh, in translation:\n\nAccording to the police and prosecution on the 18th, the police\u2019s application for an arrest warrant submitted to the Seoul Western District Prosecutors\u2019 Office reportedly included content showing that Chief Lee searched for \u201cmartial law,\u201d \u201cmartial law declaration,\u201d and \u201cdissolution of the National Assembly\u201d at around 8:20 p.m. on December 3rd of last year \u2026 [W]hen Chief Lee searched for the word, the State Council members had not yet arrived at the Presidential Office.\n\nThis is farcical, sure, and things didn\u2019t work out. It also doubles as a deranged ad for the service. Is your boss declaring martial law? Is he communicating poorly and failing to provide clear directions about what happens next? Need someone, or something, to talk to about a sensitive subject? Are you not getting what you need from a Google search for \u201cmartial law Korea?\u201d Try ChatGPT!\n\nMeanwhile, in the United Kingdom, a Freedom of Information request filed by a reporter for New Scientist produced a comparatively tame \u2014 but also sort of embarrassing \u2014 story:\n\nThe UK\u2019s technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has asked ChatGPT for advice on why the adoption of artificial intelligence is so slow in the UK business community \u2014 and which podcasts he should appear on \u2026 ChatGPT returned a 10-point list of problems hindering adoption, including sections on \u201cLimited Awareness and Understanding,\u201d \u201cRegulatory and Ethical Concerns\u201d and \u201cLack of Government or Institutional Support.\u201d The chatbot advised Kyle: \u201cWhile the UK government has launched initiatives to encourage AI adoption, many SMBs are unaware of these programs or find them difficult to navigate. Limited access to funding or incentives to de-risk AI investment can also deter adoption.\u201d\n\nHere we have a different sort of farce: A guy whose job involves ingesting and repeating a bunch of anodyne conventional wisdom getting what he needs from a sort of conventional-wisdom machine; as in the case of the martial-law chat, the use of AI here is mostly notable for its novelty. People in power with access to a wide range of rare resources also Google like the rest of us, and now some of them use chatbots, too.\n\nStill, these stories tell us things. One is about chatbot products themselves, which, however else their users understand them, are commercial web services that record what they\u2019re doing. No less than chats with a person, or search logs, they produce evidence. We can expect ChatGPT and similar products to make more cameos in world events, but also in criminal and civil court. They also suggest a particular sort of chatbot user who doesn\u2019t show up so often in conversations about AI adoption, which tend to focus on phenomena like homework help and/or cheating, office productivity and programming, and routine Google replacement.\n\nThe Kyle example, in particular, brings to mind a conversation I had early last year with a media executive \u2014 the sort of person who is used to asking things of people professionally gathered around him \u2014 who gushed about AI and how it had changed his life. Asked how, he said, with a hint of self-deprecation, that it was simple: He could ask it about anything, it would spit out a nice clean paragraph, and then he could walk into any room and pretend to know what he was talking about.\n\nFor most of us, having access to a chatbot that can effectively or at least plausibly answer a wide range of questions is strange and new. For a certain class of power people, chatbots don\u2019t provide something novel but rather a pocketable version of something familiar: a constantly available \u2014 and maybe flattering, and maybe obsequious \u2014 assistant. Like a human assistant, it can make you look good, or maybe get you out of a bind (but, so far, not through a coup). Also like a human assistant, it keeps notes. You know, just in case."

Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d\n\nBut rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin during an ice hockey match in Sochi in 2020. Alexander Zemlianichenko / POOL / AFP via Getty Images file\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.\n\nAs a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.\n\n\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"\n\nThese overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nUntil now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.\n\nIn the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.\n\nU.S. and Russian officials meet at Riyadh\u2019s Diriyah Palace in February. Evelyn Hockstein / AFP - Getty Images\n\nAsked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d\n\nThroughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.\n\n\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d\n\nPutin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d\n\nIn response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.\n\nIt\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOne governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.\n\n\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d\n\nThat caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.\n\n\u201cLike most politics, this is mostly posturing.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Stella Ragas/Columbia Daily Spectator\n\nMary, a graduate student at Columbia University, was riding the subway home last Thursday night when she received a text message from a friend: \u201cICE raids allegedly.\u201d Only a few days earlier, agents from the Department of Homeland Security had arrested and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and a legal permanent resident of the U.S., and tried to arrest Ranjani Srinivasan, a 37-year-old Fulbright scholar from India, accusing them of supporting Hamas during demonstrations on campus. In both instances, DHS showed up at Columbia housing, apartment buildings similar to Mary\u2019s home.\n\nMary (whose name has been changed for privacy) is an international student attending Columbia on a student visa. In the past 16 months, she went to a few pro-Palestine rallies on campus. She never held a bullhorn or appeared in the news, but the mere fact that her opinions, as she puts it, \u201ccould be known\u201d by either the university or the U.S. government, was enough to paralyze her with worry. After receiving the text message, she got off the subway and waited while her partner circled the block, scouting the route between the station and their apartment for signs of DHS agents. \u201cI am double-, triple-thinking everything I do. The paranoia is justified in many ways, and it\u2019s been pretty debilitating,\u201d she says. \u201cColumbia\u2019s administration didn\u2019t care about Mahmoud or Ranjani, so why would I trust them to help me?\u201d\n\nKhalil\u2019s detention set off protests across the city, including rallies that drew hundreds around Columbia\u2019s campus. Yet those protests masked a quieter reality: International students have largely retreated from public life, fearing they may be next. Before this week\u2019s spring break, visa and green-card holders hunkered down in dorms or fled the Upper West Side altogether. (All the students interviewed for this story participated in pro-Palestinian actions.) \u201cPeople are just terrified,\u201d says Layla Saliba, a Palestinian American graduate student. \u201cInternational students are scared to come to campus, and people aren\u2019t getting guidance from their deans. They\u2019ve been left to deal with it by themselves. Students are the ones who are taking care of each other, organizing an \u2018ICE Watch\u2019 chat. The administration hasn\u2019t done anything.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Khalil\u2019s arrest, Columbia\u2019s communications with students have been steady but vague. Interim president Dr. Katrina Armstrong wrote a letter acknowledging the \u201cdistress\u201d students are feeling about having federal immigration agents around campus. In a follow-up email, Armstrong said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the presence of federal agents in university housing. \u201cThe university is obligated to comply with the law,\u201d she wrote, omitting any mention of Khalil or his case. One statement denied rumors circulating among students and faculty that Columbia\u2019s leadership had requested the immigration officers. \u201cThe school has sent out Orwellian emails about wellness resources; this doesn\u2019t feel like a problem that\u2019s going to be solved by expanding counseling and gym hours,\u201d says Nara Milanich, a professor of Latin American history at Columbia\u2019s affiliate school, Barnard College. \u201cThere is a desire from everyone for the administration to do something less anemic.\u201d Meanwhile, Jelani Cobb, dean of Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism, attempted to level with international students during a meeting. \u201cNobody can protect you,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cThese are dangerous times.\u201d\n\nArmstrong, who took office last summer, weighed concerns about academic freedom and safety against the $400 million in federal grants and contracts the Trump administration suspended earlier this month over what it said was the school\u2019s tolerance of antisemitism. On Friday, Armstrong and Columbia\u2019s board caved and agreed to meet a list of the government\u2019s demands, including a ban on nonmedical face coverings and appointing a senior vice-provost to oversee the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department. \u201cWe have worked hard to address the legitimate concerns raised both from within and without our Columbia community, including by our regulators, with respect to the discrimination, harassment, and antisemitic acts our Jewish community has faced in the wake of October 7, 2023,\u201d the university wrote in an unsigned memo, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf Columbia hadn\u2019t met the government\u2019s demands, some faculty worried Trump could have gone further, cutting off more than $400 million to make an already existential crisis exponentially worse. People familiar with Armstrong\u2019s thinking say she was trying to take a practical approach to secure funding while appeasing the Trump administration. The school\u2019s capitulation won\u2019t address activists\u2019 concerns, and it inflames those about academic freedom. \u201cThe university is bending over for the administration,\u201d says a Palestinian student who is worried about his immigration status. \u201cThere is a deep sense of betrayal students are feeling right now.\u201d Another international student wondered what would stop Trump from doing this again at Columbia next semester or at any other school the administration wants to target. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they putting up any fight?\u201d\n\nFearful as they may be, student activists are hardly shocked by Khalil\u2019s detention or the school\u2019s capitulation. Many are certain Khalil ended up on Trump\u2019s list because he was doxxed. Pro-Israel groups were naming pro-Palestinian students before October 7, 2023, but since then, groups like Betar, as well as Zionists with large social-media followings like Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School who was suspended for harassing and intimidating colleagues, have taken the practice to new heights. Student protesters made efforts to hide their identities, being careful not to draw undue attention to students who aren\u2019t U.S. citizens, and they were discreet with information. Ask a question like \u201cWho\u2019s in charge?\u201d at a demonstration, and campus activists tended to answer vaguely, recalling The Battle of Algiers. Many pro-Palestine protesters hid their faces behind masks or keffiyehs, a tactic that today would violate the terms of Columbia\u2019s bargain with Trump. \u201cOnce your face is all over one of these doxxing pages, the university gets external pressure to punish you, and they seem extremely willing to respond to that pressure,\u201d says Marie Adele Grosso, a Barnard junior who is currently on probation after participating in a sit-in.\n\nOver the past 16 months, Khalil didn\u2019t hide his own identity at rallies and protests. He was aware of the risk, acknowledging at a press conference last spring that he had avoided arrest, fearing it might jeopardize the student visa he had at the time. Still, he made efforts to protect himself and his fellow students. In January, he sent an email to Columbia administrators telling them students were \u201cfacing severe and pervasive doxxing, discriminatory harassment, and very possibly deportation in retaliation for the lawful exercising of their rights to freedom of speech, expression, and association.\u201d But things only got worse: A few weeks later, Davidai called Khalil a \u201cterror supporter\u201d on X, then tagged Secretary of State Marco Rubio in another post, which suggested Rubio should deport Khalil. It was all getting to Khalil, who shared his fears with a Palestinian American student who was also facing mounting threats; pro-Israel activists had recently tried to get her father fired from his job. The day before his arrest, Khalil followed up with a more personal appeal to the administration: \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home.\u201d\n\nKhalil\u2019s first public statement after his arrest echoed those of his friends and fellow activists in New York. \u201cColumbia targeted me for my activism,\u201d Khalil wrote in a letter from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana. \u201cWhile I await legal decisions that hold the futures of my wife and child in the balance, those who enabled my targeting remain comfortably at Columbia University.\u201d"

He has also used similar rescissions to crackdown on top law firms.\n\nFriday\u2019s memo formalized the revocation of Biden\u2019s security clearance, along with several others who the Trump administration has previously said it removed clearances from, and went on to block the former president\u2019s family\u2019s access to classified information \u2013 assuming they had any.\n\nIn addition to his Democratic rivals in the 2016 and 2024 election, Trump also revoked clearances from the two Republicans on the House committee that investigated his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.\n\nEarlier this month Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that in accordance with a directive from Trump, she had revoked the security clearances of a number of the people named in Friday\u2019s memo, including top Biden officials, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as two of the attorneys who brought legal cases against Trump: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nIn another late-night memo on Friday, Trump revisited past grudges against lawyers who have opposed him and vowed to punish lawyers and law firms by rescinding security clearances and canceling federal contracts they hold.\n\nHe directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the conduct of lawyers and law firms the administration considers to have filed frivolous lawsuits against the Trump administration or attempted to block immigration initiatives, broadening the president\u2019s crackdown on the US legal community in the United States.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Clay Voytek and Evan Perez contributed to this report."

Trump\u2019s Executive Order.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s transgender sports order, which he signed last month, prohibits trans women and girls from participating in female sports and states that the federal government will rescind funds from educational programs that don\u2019t comply. The order, which refers to trans women as men, says that having trans women in female sports \u201cis demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.\u201d\n\nThe USDA temporarily paused UMS\u2019 funding, the system said in a news release on March 11. In an email, the USDA\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer said it was evaluating \u201cif it should take any follow-on actions related to prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,\u201d according to the release.\n\n\u201cUSDA is committed to upholding the President\u2019s executive order, meaning any institution that chooses to disregard it can count on losing future funding,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said last month, according to a news release.\n\nSamantha Warren, UMS\u2019 chief external and governmental affairs officer, said Maine\u2019s public universities have always been compliant with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, and the system \u201cremained compliant when the NCAA updated its rules in February.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the NCAA adopted a sport-by-sport approach for transgender athletes, deferring to policies set by each sport\u2019s national governing body, subject to review and recommendation by an NCAA committee. Last month, following Trump\u2019s executive order, the college sports association updated its policy to limit \u201ccompetition in women\u2019s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (March 24, 2025, 9:10 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated which Maine institution was found to be in violation of Title IX. It was the Maine Department of Education, not the University of Maine System."
