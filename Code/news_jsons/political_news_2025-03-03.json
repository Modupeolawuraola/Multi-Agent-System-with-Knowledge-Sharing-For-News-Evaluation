            "full_content": "Trump\u2019s Farm Belt supporters are in for a nasty shock as a trade war develops. Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA popular idea among Republican business types (and those from trade-sensitive farm states) has been that Donald Trump\u2019s oft-expressed love for tariffs is just part of his blustery approach to world affairs \u2014 a negotiating ploy rather than a genuine commitment to the 19th-century gospel of protectionism. For that reason, it was widely predicted that Trump would find a way to postpone or at least reduce the 25 percent tariffs he had been threatening to impose on Canada and Mexico on March 4 (delayed for 30 days after their initial announcement), along with another 10 percent tariff on China. The likelihood of retracting these threats was enhanced by the deadline\u2019s coinciding with the day of the 47th president\u2019s first big address to Congress. Surely, he wouldn\u2019t want the distractions of a falling stock market and renewed jitters about inflation while he tries to bask in congratulations over his second administration\u2019s breakneck pace of change. Or maybe not, since he is still insisting the tariffs will go into effect no matter what, as CNBC reports:\n\nTrump, speaking at the White House on Monday afternoon, said there was \u201cno room left\u201d to negotiate with the two U.S. allies. \u201cThey\u2019re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,\u201d he said. Stocks, already trading in the red, sank further following Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nTariffs, of course, raise prices on imported goods and on domestic goods that compete with them as the increased costs are passed on to consumers. Despite Trump\u2019s past claims that \u201cforeigners\u201d will pay the tariffs and/or that they will produce a rapid reinvestment in U.S. production in order to avoid them, he acknowledged in a social-media post last month that the short-term impact will hit already inflation-weary Americans:\n\nWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\n\nUnfortunately for the man who once called tariff the \u201cmost beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d the public, including many Americans who voted for him in November, believe fighting higher prices is job one. In a February 25 Economist-YouGov survey, 98 percent of Americans called inflation and prices an \u201cimportant\u201d issue, 78 percent called it \u201cvery important,\u201d and it ranked first on a list of \u201cissues important to you\u201d with \u201cjobs and economy\u201d ranking second. The sense that Trump has not adequately prioritized conquering inflation is already growing: 66 percent of respondents to a February 9 CBS News poll agreed that the administration\u2019s efforts to lower prices are \u201cnot enough.\u201d\n\nUp until now, Team Trump 2.0 has concentrated its fire not on inflation but on disrupting the federal bureaucracy. Even if you believe federal deficit spending is a principal cause of inflation, the wild cuts to federal personnel and programs being pursued by Trump and Elon Musk are completely outstripped by demands for tax cuts and more spending on defense and border security, so it\u2019s not as if the administration can credibly argue it is bringing down deficits or debts.\n\nIf Trump doesn\u2019t recalibrate his priorities pretty soon, he will be vulnerable to the charge that he\u2019s pursuing a course that will punish some of his most loyal supporters. Already his tariff agenda is becoming decidedly unpopular, as the Washington Post reports:\n\nWhile Americans seemed open to and even supportive of the broad concept of tariffs when Trump pitched them during the 2024 campaign, the momentum appears to have swung in the other direction. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll in mid-February showed Americans were about evenly split on Trump\u2019s more-limited tariffs on Chinese goods. But they opposed the tariffs on Mexico 59 percent to 34 percent, and they opposed the tariffs on Canada 64-31. Independents opposed both by around 40 points. The same poll showed 69 percent of Americans felt the tariffs would increase the prices they pay. That included 53 percent of Republicans.\n\nOne upcoming batch of threatened tariffs on agricultural goods may particularly hit working-class supermarket customers, as Bloomberg observed:\n\nTrump said the U.S. would impose tariffs on \u201cexternal\u201d agricultural products starting on April 2, his latest threat to impose trade barriers on imported goods \u2026 The president did not provide more detail on which products would be affected, or if there would be any exceptions. But the move comes just as U.S. food imports balloon, driving the country\u2019s agriculture trade deficit to a record $49 billion this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast last week.\n\nAside from immediately raising the price of imported foods, these tariffs will definitely produce retaliations, risking overseas markets for farmers in deep-red heartland areas. Trump\u2019s message for these farmers? It\u2019s pretty much the same thing free-trade fans used to say to manufacturing workers facing job losses \u2014 get ready to change your lives in a big hurry:\n\nTo the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!\n\nSomehow, it\u2019s unlikely that farmers who are being forced to completely abandon old markets and find new sources of income (and, in many cases, grow different crops) will find the process much \u201cfun.\u201d And like consumers paying more for groceries and other goods, they may not experience much compensatory joy in Trump\u2019s efforts to make himself a global bullyboy at their expense. Like letting Musk run wild, Trump\u2019s pursuit of his protectionist agenda is a self-indulgence that may cost him dearly."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Monday and welcome to our first newsletter of March. In today\u2019s edition, we talk with Sen. Chris Murphy about how he\u2019s attempting to position himself as the tip of the spear of Democratic Party efforts to oppose President Donald Trump. Plus, Scott Bland notes there are lessons for the party from an election last month across the Atlantic. And we sort through the fallout from last week\u2019s Oval Office spat.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nHow one Democrat is placing himself at the center of the Trump resistance\n\nBy Ben Kamisar, Julie Tsirkin and Andrew Arenge\n\nWhat\u2019s Chris Murphy up to?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that prompted us to sit down with the Democratic senator from Connecticut last week. Since the start of the new Trump administration, Murphy has traded in a reputation as a behind-the-scenes, bipartisan dealmaker for a new posture as one his party\u2019s most vocal critics of the president.\n\nAnd he\u2019s spending big bucks to get his message out to the public. Murphy has put more money toward ads on Meta platforms in the last month than he has in the previous five years combined. In many of these ads, he\u2019s asking donors to help him fund a political movement.\n\nIt\u2019s a shift even Murphy admitted could \u201clook a little schizophrenic.\u201d But it\u2019s one he says is born from his belief that President Donald Trump represents a threat to democracy that forces people like him to shake free of their old ways of doing things.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody is trying to grab power, when somebody is trying to destroy democracy, they benefit from people who are static, who refuse to be nimble,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cThis moment is different, that this threat is unique \u2014 and to me, you know, we don\u2019t have another year to fight this attempt to destroy democracy. Our democracy might be gone in six months.\u201d\n\nMurphy is also focused on how he believes the Democratic Party should stand up to Trump while not defining itself exclusively through his lens. It\u2019s a trap he said the party fell into in 2020, when he believed a campaign centered on a message of \u201csaving democracy\u201d gave voters the wrong impression that Democrats approved of a broader system he says is slanted against everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cThat economic message, the message that speaks to a lot of things that Bernie Sanders talks about, is a unifying message in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people in the Democratic Party tried to make it sound like Bernie was divisive, when, in fact, Bernie\u2019s message, still to this day, speaks to a lot of folks that voted for Donald Trump, a lot of folks that we would love to have back in our camp.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats desperately searching for their next generation of leaders, Murphy, 51, shrugged off the idea he is setting himself up for a future White House bid.\n\nBeing president is \u201cjust not in my brain at all right now,\u201d he said, adding that \u201csounds like a pretty hard, miserable job.\u201d\n\nRead more from our interview \u2192\n\nMeanwhile, in Illinois: Natasha Korecki digs into how Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker is also attempting to carve out space for himself as an oppositional force to Trump.\n\nA lesson for Democrats from an election overseas\n\nBy Scott Bland\n\nAmong the many questions Democrats are trying to figure out after 2024: How did they lose the massive edge among young voters they had relied on in recent years, and what can they do to fix it?\n\nElection results from an ocean away serve as a reminder that the Democratic Party\u2019s problems aren\u2019t just its problems \u2014 that there are broader forces buffeting voters beyond the personalities that often seem to be driving U.S. politics.\n\nExit polls from Germany\u2019s parliamentary elections last month showed how the traditional political parties in the country\u2019s coalition government saw their support splinter \u2014 and, in particular, how young voters rushed to the far left (the Left party) and the far right (the AfD). The two parties combined for 30% of the vote overall but collected nearly half of their support from voters under 25, according to the public broadcasters\u2019 exit polls.\n\nJust as in the U.S., there was also a notable youth gender gap, with 35% of the youngest female voters backing the Left party (versus just 16% of young men), while 27% of young men backed AfD (versus just 15% of young women).\n\nThe trends speak to the same polarization by gender and general dissatisfaction with traditional politicians and institutions hitting young voters in the U.S.\n\nJohn Della Volpe, the polling director at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, noted some of the factors affecting young voters in the U.S. are true throughout other Western democracies.\n\n\u201cThe Covid pandemic, but also the global economy, inflation, cost of housing \u2014 these are issues that transcend national borders,\u201d said Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard Youth Poll. \u201cCertainly in this country, I don\u2019t feel like the young people I talk to on a weekly basis feel like their leaders understand the challenges a young person faces, or that they care about them. \u2026 So they\u2019re looking for other voices, independent voices often, who are able to connect with them.\u201d\n\nFallout from the Trump-Zelenskyy Oval Office clash\n\nThe ripple effects from last Friday\u2019s shouting match between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office are still ongoing. Here\u2019s the latest:\n\nZelenskyy said over the weekend that he believes his country\u2019s relationship with the U.S. \u201cwill continue\u201d and that he\u2019s still willing to sign a rare-earth minerals deal.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted Zelenskyy on Truth Social for suggesting that an end to his country\u2019s war with Russia is \u201cvery, very far way.\u201d Trump wrote: \u201cThis is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\u201d\n\nThe clash has raised new questions about the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, with Trump administration officials discussing whether to pause military aid to the country.\n\nIt has also led some Republican leaders in the U.S. to suggest Zelenskyy should resign. Critics say that would be a boost for Russia, which has tried to oust Zelenskyy for years.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udcb2Tariff watch: Trump said that U.S. tariffs are still expected to take effect tomorrow on Canada and Mexico.

Photo: Jemal Countess/MoveOn/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday night, President Trump will give the first joint address to Congress since his reelection. \u201cTOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BIG. I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS!,\u201d he said on Truth Social Monday morning.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech comes as his administration, in league with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, continues to make significant cuts to federal agencies in the name of eliminating excess spending, resulting in mass layoffs in various government sectors. With more Americans voicing their displeasure in town halls and polls, Democrats are looking to capitalize on the momentum and keep those reductions top of mind for voters.\n\nSeveral Democratic members of Congress revealed they have invited federal workers who recently lost their jobs to attend the president\u2019s address as their personal guests. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Monday that he would be joined by Alissa Ellman, a disabled Army veteran who was fired from her position at the Buffalo VA. \u201cFiring her, firing veterans, and slashing thousands from the VA workforce is outrageous and should be reversed. This is not how you treat our veterans \u2014 it\u2019s not just unacceptable, it\u2019s un-American,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAxios reported last week that Schumer was privately urging congressional Democrats to invite people who have been personally impacted by the administration\u2019s cuts. A similar request went out from the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, per CNN. Members in both chambers heeded the call. Representative Joe Courtney of Connecticut will be joined by Gabriel D\u2019Alatri, a Marine veteran who was laid off from the IRS. Representative Ritchie Torres of New York invited Nancy Bolan, a constituent who worked for USAID for six years. Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota invited Kate Severson, a former park ranger who worked at the state\u2019s Voyageurs National Park, writing on social media, \u201cMusk and Trump should have to face the hardworking Park Rangers they sacked.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats, however, are choosing to skip Tuesday\u2019s speech entirely, an action reminiscent of past boycotts of Trump\u2019s first-term congressional addresses. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said Sunday that he\u2019s opting out of Trump\u2019s speech and will be holding a virtual town hall on Facebook instead, urging his constituents to submit questions ahead of time.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut announced his intention to boycott in an CNN interview Sunday, saying he believes the president\u2019s speech will be a \u201cMAGA pep rally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Donald Trump is going to spew a series of lies about his alignment with Russia, about what he\u2019s trying to do to allow Elon Musk to essentially monetize the American government to enrich Musk and his billionaire crowd. And I\u2019m just not going to be a part of that,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nSince Trump has taken office, Musk\u2019s DOGE has touted billions of dollars in savings for the American taxpayer by eliminating grants, contracts, and even real-estate leases. A recent New York Times report, however, alleges its successes have been inflated with the organization removing some of its claimed savings from its own website. While the cuts\u2019 impacts are still being determined, recent polling suggests the American public is mixed on the changes. An NPR\u2013PBS News\u2013Marist poll released Monday found that 55 percent of U.S. residents believed the extensive cuts in federal staffing and funding would do more harm than good, while 45 percent said they thought the opposite."

The widespread presence of abusive behavior in the digital domain affects the daily lives of our children, families, and communities,\u201d Trump said at an event on Capitol Hill on Monday, which comes as she has so far spent limited time in Washington.\n\n\u201cIn an era where digital interactions are integral to daily life, it is imperative that we safeguard children from mean-spirited and hurtful online behavior,\u201d Trump added \u2013 expressing sentiments seemingly at odds with some of President Donald Trump\u2019s social media posts that often use personal attacks and name-calling for political opponents and perceived enemies.\n\nSpeaking at a roundtable with lawmakers and advocates against and survivors of revenge porn, the first lady reaffirmed the \u201cBe Best\u201d platform established during the first Trump administration, which included a focus on online safety, as she urged House lawmakers to pass the \u201cTAKE IT DOWN\u201d Act, which is aimed at protecting Americans from deepfake and revenge pornography.\n\nThe bill \u2014 first introduced by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and passed in the Senate last month with bipartisan support \u2014 \u201cwould criminalize the publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \u2018deepfake pornography\u2019), and require social media and similar websites to have in place procedures to remove such content upon notification from a victim,\u201d according to Cruz\u2019s office.\n\nTrump offered a dig at Democrats, who were largely absent from the roundtable discussion.\n\n\u201cI expected to see more Democrat leaders with us here today to address this serious issue. Surely as adults, we can prioritize America\u2019s children ahead of partisan politics,\u201d the first lady said at the event, which drew top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, as well as Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California.\n\nIn the past year, targets of AI-generated, non-consensual pornographic images have ranged from prominent women such as Taylor Swift and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to high school girls, including Elliston Berry, a 15-year-old from Texas who joined the first lady on Capitol Hill Monday.\n\n\u201cThey superimposed her (Berry\u2019s) face into pornographic content without her consent, solely to humiliate her. And although Elliston\u2019s family contacted the social media companies for help, their efforts fell upon deaf ears. Ultimately, the fake images circulated worldwide,\u201d the first lady said.\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content, like deepfakes. This toxic environment can be severely damaging. \u2026 Every young person deserves a safe online space to express themselves freely, without the looming threat of exploitation or harm.\u201d\n\nBerry, along with her mother and stepfather, Anna and Mark McAdams, will be guests of the first lady at the president\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, according to the office of the first lady.\n\nAfter attending the inauguration and joining her husband to tour natural disaster damage in North Carolina and California, Melania Trump was absent from the White House between January 24 and February 22, when she reemerged to host a dinner with the nation\u2019s governors.\n\nTrump was expected to spend a majority of her time between New York, where son Barron is attending college, and Florida, CNN reported during the presidential transition. Sources familiar with her thinking said at the time that she would still be present for major events and would have her own platform and priorities as first lady.\n\nEven as she\u2019s been open about traversing the East Coast, the first lady has previously emphasized that she\u2019d be in DC. Asked where she planned to spend her time in a January 13 interview with Fox News\u2019 Ainsley Earhardt, Trump said, \u201cI will be in the White House. And, you know, when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cBut my first priority is, you know, to be a mom, to be a first lady, to be a wife, and once we are in on January 20, you serve the country.\u201d\n\nThe president has also spent significant time in Florida since Inauguration Day, traveling to Miami or Palm Beach for five out of his first six weekends in office."

            "full_content": "Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry that sunk tens of millions into the Trump campaign and inauguration has so far gotten everything its investors have wanted from the new president. The Securities and Exchange Commission is abandoning or pausing its cases against some of the biggest players in the industry while agreeing not to police the Wild West shootout that is the meme-coin market these days. They\u2019ve got major influence in the Trump Cabinet, and the first-ever \u201ccrypto summit\u201d will be held on Friday. But despite all these warm signals coming from the White House, the crypto market was kind of sucking in February. There were massive sell-offs, tentpole tokens like bitcoin were taking a beating, and much of the news cycle in crypto was dominated by how much of a messy scam it could be for politicians who got too involved.\n\nBut on Sunday, Trump, or one of his crypto advisers, had an idea. For months now, the president has been promising a strategic national stockpile for cryptocurrency \u2014 an idea heavily promoted by the industry as a shortcut for the U.S. to assert some financial dominance in crypto. Rather than make the difficult (and potentially legislative) push to create the stockpile, Trump simply revealed the assets that would be inside it.\n\nIn the social-media announcement, Trump wrote that his stockpile would help ensure that the \u201cU.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\u201d But it was also a fairly obvious play to the crypto crowd, juicing prices without having to actually do anything. The value of bitcoin rallied by $9,000 over the afternoon while the other coins involved (ethereum, solana, XRP, and cardano) all saw significant gains. Cardano, the least valuable of the digital tokens, saw its price jump nearly 100 percent.\n\nBut the easy win could not reverse the larger forces (weakish demand for bitcoin, massive crypto hacks) that, in February, stymied the asset class that is supposed to be divorced from the larger economy. Today, bitcoin lost roughly half of yesterday\u2019s gains from the Trump bump. But more of a concern for Trump than the short-term value of these volatile tokens is the fact that many crypto bigwigs weren\u2019t thrilled by his announcement. Big investors, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, thought that including any coins other than bitcoin was an error. Others \u2014 like Palantir co-founder and libertarian billionaire Trump fan and Elon Musk friend Joe Lonsdale \u2014 called the president\u2019s stockpile dream a \u201ccrypto-bro scheme\u201d that he didn\u2019t want to realize with taxpayer money. Angel investor Jason Calacanis dismissed the idea as the latest \u201cTrump pump\u201d and \u201ccrypto grift.\u201d Considering Calacanis\u2019s close relationship to Trump\u2019s \u201ccrypto czar,\u201d David Sacks, this type of stuff may be a bad sign for the president on the crypto front:\n\nIf you tax Americans to buy crypto, don\u2019t be surprised if the people revolt. pic.twitter.com/OoatPdolOl \u2014 @jason (@Jason) March 2, 2025\n\nSacks, whose investment firm has massive investments in the five coins in the proposed stockpile, is hosting the White House\u2019s crypto summit on Friday. Perhaps everything will be hashed out among Trump, his advisers with massive crypto investments, and the industry leaders they are hoping to satisfy. But Trump is now entering the difficult part of his courtship of the crypto world. So far, he\u2019s lived up to the good will through simple actions under his office\u2019s control \u2014 like forcing out ex-SEC chair Gary Gensler, killing civil actions against major firms, or freeing the crypto-libertarian champion Ross Ulbricht. But now he might actually need to do something to move the market. As crypto skeptic Molly White wrote, we may finally be arriving at the point where \u201cwords alone seem to be running out.\u201d"

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump has said Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 started the war. He\u2019s called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 not Vladimir Putin \u2014 a dictator. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration is standing down on a suite of tough anti-Kremlin policies.\n\nIn just over a month, Trump has executed a startling realignment of American foreign policy, effectively throwing U.S. support behind Moscow and rejecting the tight alliance with Kyiv cultivated by former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe extraordinary pivot has upended decades of hawkish foreign policy toward Russia that provided a rare area of bipartisan consensus in an increasingly divided nation. Trump\u2019s recent moves have drawn international attention, unsettling U.S. allies in Europe and thrilling conservative populists who favor a turn away from Zelenskyy.\n\nThe new posture was put in stark relief on Friday during a tense Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. The leaders clashed in front of the press, raising questions about the future of American support for Kyiv, more than three years after Russia opened the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.\n\nU.S. officials have made a series of policy changes in recent weeks that seem to herald a more cooperative stance with Russia:\n\nThe White House ordered a pause on military aid to Ukraine as the administration carries out a review, a White House official and a U.S. official told NBC News on Monday.\n\nLate last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the U.S. Cyber Command to cease offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told NBC News. It\u2019s unclear how long the order will last.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, on her first day in office, disbanded efforts to seize the assets of Russian oligarchs, breaking up Biden-era programs known as Task Force Klepto Capture and the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.\n\nIn a separate directive, Bondi ordered a halt to a federal law enforcement initiative to combat secret influence campaigns by Russia, China and other traditional U.S. adversaries that attempt to sow division in U.S. politics.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and other top Trump administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to start peace negotiations with Russia \u2014 but Zelenskyy said Ukrainian officials hadn\u2019t been invited.\n\nTrump has long professed a desire to reset and improve relations with Russia. He has repeatedly said he believes it is in the national interest to \u201cget along\u201d with Moscow and cast doubt on the value of core parts of the post-World War II global security architecture, including NATO and the European Union. Trump\u2019s first term was shadowed by former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation \u2014 a probe that Trump has repeatedly dismissed as the \u201cRussia hoax.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in Helsinki in 2018. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP file\n\nTrump has pushed back on Democrats and other critics who have accused him of deferring to Russia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aligned with Putin. I\u2019m not aligned with anybody. I\u2019m aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I\u2019m aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with,\" Trump said Friday from the Oval Office, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nBut the U.S. government now appears to be pivoting away from Kyiv. In the weeks since his inauguration, Trump has suggested Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion and \u201cstarted\u201d the war, echoing familiar talking points from the Kremlin.\n\nThe president's relationship with Zelenskyy has long been fraught, partly owing to a July 2019 phone call in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the latter's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. After the call leaked, it helped touch off the first impeachment of Trump. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.)\n\nVice President JD Vance has likewise been consistently skeptical of continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThe bitter irony of America\u2019s present predicament is that the very people who cheer for permanent arms shipments to Ukraine also supported the de-industrialization of America,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Sunday. \u201cThe very things you want us to send are things we don\u2019t make enough of.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s approach is a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia, a period spanning the Cold War with the former Soviet Union as well as the rise of Putin. American presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, typically struck a more bellicose tone on the threat posed by an emboldened Russia.\n\nPutin\u2019s regime has welcomed the overtures from Trump. In statements reported by Russian state media agency TASS, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised Trump as a pragmatist who operates with \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see that the collective West has begun to partially lose its unity,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday.\n\nDemocrats and anti-Trump Republican commentators have sharply criticized the administration since the Oval Office meeting, accusing Trump of effectively selling out Ukraine. In a post on his Truth Social platform early Monday, Trump defended himself and insisted he had helped keep much of Ukraine intact.\n\n\u201cThe only President who gave none of Ukraine\u2019s land to Putin\u2019s Russia is President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cRemember that when the weak and ineffective Democrat\u2019s criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out anything they say!\u201d\n\nBut there is a partisan divide on Ukraine; Gallup recently found that 84% of Democrats have a favorable view of Ukraine, whereas only 54% of Republican poll respondents said the same.\n\nIn the wake of the Trump-Zelenskyy spat, a handful of Republican lawmakers defended Ukraine, while most \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 said Zelenskyy may have to resign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet Friday in the Oval Office. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nThe feud between continued Monday, with Trump disparaging his Ukrainian counterpart in a post on social media.\n\nTrump is by no means the first president to aim for a less hostile relationship with Moscow, however. Barack Obama and his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, embarked on a high-profile bid to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia. But those efforts largely fell apart after Putin invaded Crimea and seized it from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe relationship between Biden and Zelenskyy showed signs of strain, too. NBC News has reported that Biden lost his temper with Zelenskyy during a phone call in June 2022, according to four people familiar with the call. Biden raised his voice and said Zelenskyy could afford to show more gratitude for the billions in U.S. military assistance for Kyiv.\n\nBiden and his top diplomats nonetheless worked to rally international support for Kyiv\u2019s resistance to Moscow; the United Kingdom, France and other European allies joined the fight.\n\nThe disagreement between Biden and Zelenskyy came in a private phone call \u2014 not a public dressing down in the Oval Office. During their meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy he should be much more grateful as the conversation grew more tense, ending with the Ukraine leader leaving the U.S. without signing a minerals deal.\n\n\u201cYou got to be more thankful, because, let me tell you, you don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said."

            "full_content": "Details continue to emerge about the deaths of Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog after they were found dead in their home in New Mexico on Feb. 26.\n\nOver a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95, and they had different causes of death. Here's what we know from officials.\n\nWhat did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die from?\n\nHackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.\n\n\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.\n\nArakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.\n\nIt does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.\n\nBoth Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.\n\nHow long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?\n\n\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.\n\nBut with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.\n\nCellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.\n\nBased on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.\n\nA search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet. Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nIt is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.\n\nWhere were Hackman and Arakawa found?\n\nHackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.\n\nHackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.\n\nArakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.\n\nArakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.\n\nThe pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.\n\nHackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead\n\nOne of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.\n\nArakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nDogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.\n\nThere were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.\n\nHow did Arakawa get hantavirus?\n\nHantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.\n\nIt was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.\n\nHer and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.\n\nHantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.\n\nNo signs of a carbon monoxide leak\n\nThere were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.\n\nSanta Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.\n\nThe gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.\n\nNo signs of foul play\n\nDeputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.\n\nThere were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.\n\nWhat movies was Gene Hackman in?\n\nHackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.\n\nSome of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).\n\nHe won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"\n\nHackman retired from the screen in 2004.\n\nHe also wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels.\n\nGene Hackman tribute at the Oscars\n\nThe Oscars paid tribute to Hackman at the awards show on March 2.\n\n\"Our community lost a giant and I lost a dear friend,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman before an In Memoriam video recognized actors and others who had died in the past year.\n\nFreeman appeared in two films with Hackman, \"Unforgiven\" and \"Under Suspicion.\"\n\n\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said.\n\nWho was Betsy Arakawa?\n\nArakawa, who was raised in Honolulu, was a concert pianist and co-founder of a home furnishing business, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhen she was 11, she performed at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall and later in life, she played with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, the AP reported.\n\nArakawa and Hackman met while she was working part-time at a California fitness center in the 1980s, according to a New York Times article.\n\nArakawa helped found Pandora's, a home decor store in Santa Fe, in 2001, the AP reported.\n\nDoes Gene Hackman have any children?\n\nHackman had three children \u2014 two daughters and a son \u2014 with his first wife, Faye Maltese.\n\nHis daughters Elizabeth and Leslie and granddaughter Annie confirmed his death in a statement.\n\n\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,\" they wrote.\n\ncontributed to this report."

            "full_content": "The co-president struts his stuff. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOn the eve of Donald Trump\u2019s big speech to a joint session of Congress, the name on everyone\u2019s lips in Washington, D.C., isn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s, but the man so often described as co-president, Elon Musk. His firing and canceling rampage across the federal government at the helm of his strange and law-disdaining DOGE has both preempted and complicated Trump\u2019s agenda to an extent that is extraordinary in part because it was so unexpected (the whole scheme was apparently thought up well after Election Day) and remains unprecedented.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance the absolute and very intentional chaos of DOGE will soon give way to something slightly more orderly as Trump\u2019s appointees get settled in and take over the task of demolishing their own agencies. But that\u2019s as unclear as the fate of the vast litigation DOGE has generated by treating the U.S. government like a privately owned tech company being stripped down to the studs. In the meantime, Musk has become the central figure in the congressional drama that could very well lead to a government shutdown in less than two weeks.\n\nThe government is currently being funded by a stopgap bill enacted in December, which Musk very nearly blew up at the time with a tweetstorm demanding deeper cuts than congressional Republicans were in a position to obtain. It expires on March 14. First Trump and then Republican leaders Mike Johnson and John Thune agreed that rather than adding to the instability in Washington with an early government shutdown, they\u2019d just back another stopgap (know as a \u201cclean continuing resolution\u201d or \u201cclean CR\u201d) until the end of the fiscal year in September. It was presumed that Democrats \u2014 who absolutely have the power to block any CR with a Senate filibuster or by denying Johnson House votes that his fractious right wing might refuse to supply \u2014 would go along out of relief that Republicans weren\u2019t demanding big new spending cuts.\n\nBut Musk has screwed up this deal. Initially Johnson talked about including existing DOGE cuts in a not-so-clean CR, recognizing that the fiscal hawks of the House Freedom Caucus were a Musk fan club thrilled by the chainsaw he was wielding across federal agencies. But now Johnson has backed off that plan and gone \u201cclean\u201d with his CR plans. So now it\u2019s Democrats who have a big decision to make. Do they continue to insist that any deal on current spending include putting a leash on DOGE? Or do they take the deal on offer because they fear being blamed for a government shutdown and hope that either Trump gets sick of Musk upstaging him or the courts rein him in?\n\nSo as the blame game over a potential shutdown intensifies, privately Democrats and Republicans would probably agree it\u2019s Musk who is the chief obstacle to a rare bipartisan deal in 2025. And as the leering cartoon-villain face of the Trump administration, he is also a threat to Trump\u2019s standing in public opinion, as one Republican consultant admitted to Politico:\n\n\u201cThe bigger risk is people being like, \u2018[Elon\u2019s] a fucking asshole. Can you at least have some compassion about what these people are going through? Can you at least treat them with respect? They have mouths to feed, roofs to keep over their heads,\u2019\u201d the consultant added. \u201cYeah, it has to happen. But why does an extremely pale lion have to play with his food here?\u201d\n\nThe answer to that question may be that no one, not even Trump, can completely control Musk, and his freedom to be a jerk is considerably enhanced by his superstar status among the noisiest elements of Trump\u2019s MAGA base, where cruelty in dealing with \u201cthe enemy\u201d is valued above all. And there\u2019s another problem for Musk\u2019s ostensible boss just ahead: Even if Democrats surrender and agree to the \u201cclean CR\u201d Republicans want, is there any guarantee that Musk won\u2019t again rile up a vast troll army on X to defeat it unless it includes more destructive spending cuts? Having enjoyed himself so conspicuously in trying to gut the hated federal government, why not shut it down entirely for a while? Any deal in Congress had better include Musk or he could very well make life difficult for his co-president."

            "full_content": "A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson released a statement on the detainment of the owners of a popular New Jersey restaurant amid outrage from local community leaders and residents.\n\nLast Tuesday, ICE officers raided the Jersey Kebab restaurant in Haddon Township and arrested the owners, Emine Emanet and her husband, Celal Emanet.\n\nEmine Emanet and her husband, Celal. WCAU\n\n\u201cDuring the investigation, ICE administratively arrested two Turkish citizens, Emine and Celal Emanet, who are present in the United States illegally. ICE authority under Title 8 of the U.S. Code enables the agency to investigate and enforce immigration laws, particularly in cases where immigration violations intersect with national security, public safety and transnational crime,\u201d the ICE spokesperson wrote in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe Emanets were served a notice to appear before an immigration judge and place in removal proceedings.\u201d\n\nCelal Emanet was released from custody with an ankle monitor and spoke with NBC10 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and my heart was getting crushed,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so much nervous. But I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong in my life.\u201d\n\nHis wife remains in custody at an ICE detention center in North Jersey.\n\nJersey Kebab Mediterranean Grill restaurant in Haddon Township, N.J. WCAU\n\n\u201cEmine Emanet remains in ICE custody and Celal Emanet is on an Alternative to Detention (ATD), each pending removal proceedings. ICE\u2019s ATD program, which began in 2004, uses technology and case management to ensure alien compliance with release conditions, court hearings and final orders of removal,\u201d the ICE spokesperson wrote in part.\n\nImmigration attorney Joseph Best told NBC10 the couple moved to the United States from Turkey in 2008 on an R1 visa. According to Camden County officials, Celal Emanet applied for a green card before the visa expired. Emanet said his application was denied three times and the couple has been in limbo since 2016.\n\n\u201cThis incident is appalling and an unfortunate example of just how broken the immigration system is here in our country,\u201d Camden County commissioner director Louis Cappelli Jr. said in a statement on Feb. 27. \u201cThis couple works hard every single day to provide for their four children, grandchildren and to feed the community. They have been left without any options when it comes to their immigration status and to be arrested for something they have no control over, is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nCappelli, Haddon Township Mayor Randall Teague and other community leaders held a press conference in support of the Emanet family outside Jersey Kebab on Thursday.\n\nTeague described the couple\u2019s restaurant as a \u201cpillar\u201d in Haddon Township. He also said the family has participated in Toys for Tots drives and organized food drives that have \u201cleft a lasting impact\u201d on the community.\n\n\u201cWe consider this situation maybe somewhat different than some of the other ones that we hear on TV where there\u2019s criminals and rapists and so forth coming into our country, Teague said. \u201cThey came in here legally and they\u2019re trying to stay here legally.\u201d\n\nTeague said Haddon Township leaders reached out to Rep. Donald Norcross, D-N.J., for guidance on the ongoing case.\n\nThe local officials also had a broader message about the immigration system and delays within it.\n\n\u201cThis family is a family that embodies the very best of Camden County. And now they\u2019re torn apart by this broken immigration system,\u201d Cappelli said. \u201cIt is time to stand up for good people. It is time to stand up for humanity. These folks do not deserve this. These folks do not deserve this. Fix the immigration system and let\u2019s fix it now.\u201d\n\nCamden County Commissioner Virginia Betteridge, whose parents came to America from Cuba in the 1960s, also spoke about fixing the \u201cpathway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for people to be incarcerated when they\u2019re waiting to get their documents in order and to be sure that they can become a resident and then a citizen of this country,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to Camden County leaders, Haddon Township residents are also showing their support for the couple. A GoFundMe for the family has raised more than $310,000 as of Sunday.\n\nAlso on Sunday, community members gathered inside Anjali Power Yoga across the street from Jersey Kebab to write letters in support of Emine Emanet\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cThe goal is for the judges, the politicians and anyone locally with influence and power to know that the community stands by this resident,\u201d Isis Williams of the Haddon Township Equity Initiative told NBC10.\n\nThe couple\u2019s son, Muhammed Emanet, plans to take those letters to the immigration judge who ultimately presides over his mother\u2019s case. He said his family has been touched by the outpouring of support.\n\n\u201cI just cannot thank the community enough for the support they have given us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just wish that we were judged amongst our peers instead of being judged by other judges who do not personally know us at all.\u201d\n\nWhile Jersey Kebab remains closed until further notice, Muhammed Emanet still cooked free food for the community over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThey are a good family. They are not criminals. They entered the U.S. legally,\" Best, the immigration lawyer, wrote in a statement to NBC10 on Sunday. \u201cThe Federal immigration and nationality law provides for them the legal means to rectify their situation and seek relief from removal before the immigration court.\u201d\n\nBest told NBC10 he is waiting for the couple\u2019s case to be entered into the immigration court system, which will start the removal proceedings ICE is requesting but also allow the Emanets to ask for legal status. It\u2019s unclear how long that process would take. New Jersey\u2019s immigration court currently has more than 220,000 pending cases.\n\nThe couple\u2019s arrest occurred amid a nationwide push from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to detain immigrants who entered the United States without the proper documents.\n\nWhile the administration vowed to prioritize the \u201cworst first\u201d when it comes to arrests and deportations, the number of detainees in ICE custody without a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges increased by more than 1,800 in the first two weeks of February, representing 41% of the 4,422 total new detainees in that period, according to data obtained by NBC News.\n\nThis story was originally published in NBC 10 Philadelphia."

This includes ensuring that accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy is disseminated. We must engage with communities to understand their concerns, provide culturally competent education, and make vaccines readily accessible for all those who want them. It is also our responsibility to provide up-to-date guidance on available therapeutic medications. While there is no approved antiviral for those who may be infected, CDC has recently updated their recommendation supporting administration of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate, and severe infection. Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality. Parents play a pivotal role in safeguarding their children\u2019s health. All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\n\nKennedy noted the Texas outbreak has escalated rapidly, with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reporting 146 confirmed cases since late January 2025, primarily in the South Plains region.\n\nThis outbreak has claimed the life of a school-aged child, the first measles-related fatality in the United States in over a decade.\n\nKennedy has previously addressed those who claim he is \u201canti-vaccine\u201d and more.\n\nWATCH \u2014 Protester Disrupts RFK Jr. Confirmation Hearing:\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Kennedy said in January that he is simply \u201cpro-safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked for years to raise awareness about the mercury and toxic chemicals in fish, and nobody called me anti-fish. And I believe that my that vaccines play a critical role in healthcare. All of my kids are vaccinated. I\u2019ve written many books on vaccines. My first book in 2014, a first line of it is, I am not anti-vaccine, and the last line is, I am not anti-vaccine,\u201d he said, explaining that he is not the \u201cenemy of food producers,\u201d either, placing an emphasis on the importance of American farms.\n\n\u201cAmerican farms are the bedrock of our culture, of our politics, of our national security. I was a kid, and I spent my summer working on ranches. I went to work with our farmers. I want to work with our farmers and food producers. Remove burdens regulations and unleash American ingenuity. MAHA simply cannot succeed without a partnership, a full partnership of American farmers,\u201d he continued.\n\nUltimately, Kennedy acknowledged he has \u201coften disturbed the status quo by asking uncomfortable questions.\u201d"

            "full_content": "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.\n\nEither Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d\n\nCritics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.\n\nAn Ukrainian serviceman carries an artillery shell to fire toward Russian positions near Donetsk on Sunday. Roman Chop / AP\n\nKremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d\n\nStill, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.\n\n\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d\n\nTrump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d\n\nMore and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.\n\nOther polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President JD Vance meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nZelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.\n\nOne man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.\n\nBut in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d\n\nStill, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.\n\nOne soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d\n\nYevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d\n\nTrump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d\n\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.\n\nAlexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

            "full_content": "Sunday, during his show\u2019s opening monologue, FNC\u2019s \u201cLife, Liberty & Levin\u201d host Mark Levin told his viewers there was nothing to be \u201cgiddy\u201d about regarding Friday\u2019s blowup between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nLevin, who maintains he supports Ukraine\u2019s cause, said Zelensky \u201cblew it\u201d during the meeting with Trump.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nSaturday, before \u2014 this past Saturday, I spent the monologue discussing the genius of the Trump plan with respect to rare earth minerals in Ukraine, the partnership with Ukraine, and what would it do? It would involve American private sector investments, hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars to extract rare earth minerals in Ukraine, which, for the most part, cannot do it, and certainly after the war, it can\u2019t do it, which would help Ukraine in numerous ways more than the Marshall Plan.\n\nImagine that capital flowing into Ukraine, rebuilding its infrastructure. Imagine the number of Ukrainians getting jobs, the buildings going up, the highways being built.\n\nImagine the benefit to the United States. We would not only be making money, but we would have access to rare earth minerals that we need. We need for our defense, we need for our space system. We need for our medical industries.\n\nRussia wants those minerals, in addition to geographic ideas and claims, all of which are ridiculous, Putin wants those minerals. China wants those minerals.\n\nAnd so the idea is we have a real business relationship with the people of Ukraine, Americans working next to each other with Ukrainians. We have a significant presence there, and that significant presence there serves as a National Security buffer, a commercial buffer, as I explained last week.\n\nSo really, Ukraine wouldn\u2019t even need to join NATO. We\u2019d have a special relationship with Ukraine, critical to the United States and critical to Ukraine. Brilliant.\n\nThe Biden administration didn\u2019t come up with that plan. The Democratic Party didn\u2019t come up with that plan. Trump came up with that plan. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, the blow up that took place in the Oval Office. In thinking about this, you know, people react immediately. I like to think about things a little bit. There\u2019s two camps that are giddy about this, absolutely giddy. And there\u2019s nothing to be giddy about.\n\nNumber one, the Democrats, they\u2019re all over TV with their Democrat media trashing Donald Trump, accusing him again of being in Putin\u2019s back pocket. That is a lie. He\u2019s not in Putin\u2019s back pocket, and he\u2019s never been in Putin\u2019s back pocket. He\u2019s dealing with reality, and he\u2019s trying to bring this thing to an end on terms that also improve the situation with the United States.\n\nNumber two, the pro-Putin forces on the right. I\u2019m not of the right. I\u2019m a constitutional conservative. We conservatives are not right wingers. That\u2019s what the Democrats call us. We\u2019re not right wing anything. We\u2019re square in the middle of the political spectrum. We are the center of the political spectrum, constitutional conservatism.\n\nThe radical left, the Marxists; the radical right, the fascists. We are in the center. We need to take that political spectrum back.\n\nThat said they\u2019re thrilled. They\u2019re giddy. They support Putin. They actually want Putin to win.\n\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line, Zelensky blew it and he blew it big, and I speak as somebody who supports Ukraine. Ukraine, which was invaded without provocation. Ukraine, the cities and the people are targeted. The infrastructure is targeted.\n\nUkraine, up to 700,000 of their children, children have been brought into Russia against their will, against the will of their parents, and adopted out to Russian families to become Russian citizens. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s grotesque.\n\nI see how little people talk about Putin, how little they talk about his role in this war, how little you read about it or hear about it, very little condemnation of Putin as he sits back and watches.\n\nZelensky, you handed Putin a victory and only you can fix it. Donald Trump has offered Ukraine and you a lifeline, a lifeline to build your ties with the United States, to build your economy, to build up your country, so that you can contribute to your own defenses as well. But you blew it, and you blew it, and you need to fix it.\n\nWhat was in this deal in part? It was a good deal.\n\nBBC: The preliminary agreement envisions that an investment fund will be set up for Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. The fund would be managed on equal terms.\n\nThere was no America coming in and raping the land and all the rest of it. According to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50 percent of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas, to the fund. The fund will then invest to provide the safety, security, and prosperity of Ukraine. That was the language in this deal.\n\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the U.S. while subject to U.S. law, maintain a long-term financial commitment, I quote, \u201cto the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.\u201d\n\nNobody else is going to do this. Nobody else can do this.\n\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC last week it was too early to talk about money. We\u2019re not talking about money. We\u2019re talking about building up your country.\n\nThe agreement states the U.S. will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under U.S. law. Ukrainian President rejected an initial request from the U.S. for half a trillion dollars in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has been dropped. Dropped.\n\nThere\u2019d be co-ownership, there\u2019d be no direct claims on anything.\n\nIn his wildest dreams, Zelensky should have grabbed this deal.\n\nBut before he met with Donald Trump, he met with a bunch of Democrats on Capitol Hill and others, and the story was broken by Michael Goodwin of \u201cThe New York Post.\u201d Before meeting Trump, Zelensky met with anti-Trump Democrats who advised him to reject the terms of the mineral deal the President was offering.\n\nAccording to Senator Chris Murphy \u2014 this guy is a loathsome reprobate from Connecticut. He is a cancer in the body politic. He\u2019s constantly on cable T.V. trashing Trump, trashing Elon Musk, just trashing every single time he possibly can \u2014 \u201cJust finished a meeting with President Zelensky here in Washington\u201d \u2014 this is what Murphy posted. \u201cHe confirmed that the Ukrainian people will not support a fake peace agreement where Putin gets everything he wants and there are no security arrangements for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s office posted that 11:15 AM on Friday, just an hour before Zelensky was meeting with President Trump, and then Murphy attached a picture of Zelensky at a conference table with Murphy seated on the opposite side. The purpose of the meeting was to sign the mineral agreement he and Trump represented had negotiated.\n\nSo this was supposed to be a formality, but he had twice refused to sign it after promising to, so he went back on the deal multiple times, and thanks to Murphy and his ilk, we now know he had no intention of signing it on Friday when he met with Trump.\n\nLike the original Russia hoax, Goodwin writes, that consumed much of Trump\u2019s first term. Russia 2.0 was born, a political desperation.\n\nSo the Democrats wanted this. The Democrats were trying to set up Trump, and Zelensky was foolish enough to go along with this and embrace it. Zelensky has to fix this for the sake of his own country.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry the Western Allies, they\u2019re rallying around Zelensky, you know, after the event with Donald Trump, says CNN, rallying around Zelensky.\n\nYou know what, America? It\u2019s about time somebody tell you how pathetic the Europeans have been in their support of Ukraine.\n\nPoland has stepped up. The Baltic States have stepped up. A few other countries. The four worst countries have the leaders with the biggest mouths \u2014 France, Britain, Germany, Italy, although I like their leader, but Italy, they have not stepped up to the plate like they could and should. Why? This is from the Center for Strategic and International Studies by Max Bergmann: Europe\u2019s approach to supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort is no longer fit for purpose. There\u2019s a desperate need for Europe to ramp up its defense industrial production.\n\nBut despite a clear consensus behind this urgent need, European production lines are not maxing out their capacity.\n\nThe root of the issue is not so much a lack of political will, but as is frequently the case with European defense, a failure to cooperate and a lack of funding.\n\nWhat the hell? They are all rallying around Zelensky, talk is cheap. Why don\u2019t they step up and do more?\n\nEurope has not yet shifted to the new reality that Ukraine faces a long war, he wrote, and this was several months ago.\n\nNow, Europe is contributing, as a collective 0.2 percent of their gross domestic product, 0.2 percent, not even one percent, not even a half percent.\n\nIf Europeans had to foot the entire bill, it would be 0.4 percent. In other words, if the United States withdrew altogether, they would have to double it to 0.4 percent still not even one percent of their GDP from countries that are telling us this is a vital defense issue, and I happen to think it is. I happen to think it is.\n\nHe says the new paradigm is urgently needed for Europe\u2019s military support for Ukraine. The challenge now is less about incentivizing countries to give weapons to Ukraine, but about getting European defense industries to ramp up production. This requires significant new funding and requires Europeans to do something they rarely do in defense \u2014 work together.\n\nThey\u2019ve been unloading their post-World War Two type weapons and some of their World War Two weapons to Ukraine, some new weapons, but mostly not. And now that those stockpiles have run out, and now that President Trump is the President and not Biden, Europe has an issue.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has awakened European governments to the need to invest in defense. European defense spending is up across the board with production increases as well. But it\u2019s not happening at the speed and scale it requires.\n\nIf this is the prelude to a potential World War Three, they need to step it up. They need to step it up. Donald Trump\u2019s idea of peace is a brilliant idea. We engage with Ukraine. We help build their economy while we\u2019re building ours. We help exploit their rare earth minerals that we don\u2019t have access to while we access them, which benefits them.\n\nIt keeps the Russians off their tail. It keeps the Chinese off their tail. Meanwhile, for us, China, Russia, India, are all competing throughout the third world, mostly for these minerals.\n\nRussia is taking over the Arctic Circle with 10 military bases, with the support of China. Donald Trump says, wait, that\u2019s a huge problem. Greenland, you\u2019ve got minerals. Greenland, you\u2019re there through their navigable waters to the Arctic Circle, we need to have a new relationship with Greenland. So the President sees this. He\u2019s not a Putinoid.\n\nNo, the Democrats did more to serve Putin by advising Zelensky to kill this deal than anything Donald Trump could possibly have done. And for the Putin supporters out there, you think you\u2019re giddy? You think you\u2019re funny? You\u2019re pathetic, as a matter of fact.\n\nBut let\u2019s go on. The biggest challenge to establishing what is the European Union fund will be getting approval within the European Union. Complacency and frugality are beginning to take over European politics, and European leaders, particularly Finance Ministers, they\u2019re used to claiming helplessness when it comes to funding defense.\n\nSo this is the realpolitik, America. This is the realpolitik. Ukraine is the victim. Russia is the aggressor.\n\nAsk the families in Syria, a half a million people Russia helped slaughter citizens. Ask them.\n\nRussia, under Putin. He\u2019s invaded Crimea, and he stole it from the Ukraine. Before that, he invaded the country of Georgia, and he stole 20 percent of that. He\u2019s got a thousand warheads aimed at us, a thousand.\n\nHe\u2019s got nuclear submarines off our shores. He keeps threatening our coasts. They keep buzzing our ships. They keep threatening the coast of Alaska.\n\nThey have a presence in Central and South America, hypersonic missiles. They have advanced hypersonic missiles aimed at us. They\u2019re not aimed at Ukraine or anybody else. They\u2019re aimed at us.\n\nThey now have a military relationship with China, and China\u2019s enemy is us. They have a military relationship with Iran. Iran\u2019s enemy is us. They have a military relationship with North Korea. North Korea\u2019s enemy is us.\n\nSo you Putanoids, you\u2019re pathetic. You\u2019re the 1930s isolationists. You Democrats, are a disgrace, a disgrace in trying to undermine this deal that Donald Trump is putting together.\n\nHonestly, the only one who has a sound policy, the only one who thought this through, the only one that actually has a plan that can work is Donald Trump."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nA top official at the US Agency for International Development was put on leave after issuing a scathing memo blaming Trump political appointees for the US government\u2019s inability to conduct lifesaving humanitarian work.\n\nThe official warned the Trump appointees\u2019 moves will \u201cno doubt result in preventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale.\u201d\n\nThe memo from Nicholas Enrich, the acting administrator for global heath at USAID, details \u201cobstacles\u201d put in place by \u201cpolitical leadership at USAID, the Department of State, and DOGE\u201d that have prevented the agency from implementing waivers for lifesaving assistance. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has repeatedly claimed he issued such waivers to exempt the assistance from a sweeping foreign aid freeze put in place in late January.\n\n\u201cThese actions individually and in combination have resulted in the U.S. Government\u2019s failure to implement critical lifesaving activities,\u201d Enrich wrote in the memo dated February 28 and seen by CNN.\n\nIn a separate memo obtained by CNN, Enrich warned a suspension of foreign aid and delays to lifesaving humanitarian assistance could cause surges in diseases like malaria, Ebola and avian flu, which he warned could have dire impacts on the US.\n\n\u201cA failure to contain infectious diseases at their source heightens the risk of transmission to the United States, posing a direct threat to public health and economic stability. The consequences extend beyond human health, impacting American businesses and families by increasing healthcare costs, disrupting international trade, and straining domestic resources,\u201d Enrich said in the 20-page memo, which was linked in the one dated February 28.\n\nHe projected there would be an additional 12.5 million to 17.9 million cases of malaria annually and an additional 71,000 to 166,000 deaths, with about 2,000 cases of malaria imported to the US per year.\n\nFor highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), Enrich said a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d could see 775 million cases globally, with 105 million in the US.\n\n\u201cBased on the known impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a HPAI pandemic is likely to cost the US at least $14 trillion,\u201d Enrich warned. \u201cThe economic impact of just animal losses from bird flu in 2022 cost the US economy up to $3 billion.\u201d\n\nEnrich also warned that suspending maternal and child health programs could cause tens of millions of pregnant women, newborns and children to lose access to lifesaving care. A suspension of nutrition services could result in 1 million children not being treated annually for severe acute malnutrition, Enrich said.\n\n\u201cMaternal and child health and nutrition foreign assistance makes America stronger by creating greater economic and political stability through improved family health, which increases the likelihood that children will attend school and grow into healthy, productive adults, thereby reducing conflicts, poverty, and radicalization of youth,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe separate memo, \u201crisks to U.S. National Security and Public Health,\u201d was dated March 4. Enrich had not filled out a recipient in the \u201cto\u201d field, but he had CC\u2019d four political appointees at USAID.\n\nEnrich recommended the US government \u201cresume all mechanisms with submitted life-saving waivers to avert crisis-level expenditures, prevent mortality and morbidity, and protect national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpholding these programs is not only a legal and humanitarian obligation but also a critical strategic investment to make America safer, more secure, and more prosperous,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his February 28 memo, Enrich detailed the types of activities impacted by the freeze, along with the actions taken by Trump administration appointees from January 29 through February 28 that blocked lifesaving work from moving forward.\n\nThese include \u201cemergency outbreak response activities needed to respond to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda \u2013 the first approved global health activities under the waiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite receiving approval to conduct these Ebola response activities approximately 1 month ago, the implementing partners were never able to draw down funds for these life-saving activities, and have not received any funds to date,\u201d Enrich wrote.\n\nThe statement directly rebuts a claim made by Elon Musk, who\u2019s leading the Trump administration\u2019s effort to downsize the federal government, that Ebola prevention was \u201caccidentally canceled\u201d but \u201cimmediately\u201d restored.\n\nEnrich was put on administrative leave after issuing the memo, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nCNN has reached out to the State Department and USAID for comment.\n\nAmong the actions that led to the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to implement the lifesaving assistance waivers were a refusal to pay for assistance that had been conducted, blocking access to USAID payment systems, \u201cthe ever-changing guidance as to what qualifies as \u2018lifesaving\u2019 and whose approval is needed in making that decision, and most recently, the sweeping terminations of the most critical implementing mechanisms necessary for providing lifesaving services,\u201d Enrich wrote.\n\nIn his February 28 memo, Enrich also noted that \u201csignificant staffing changes occurred within\u201d USAID\u2019s Bureau for Global Health \u201cthroughout the timeframe in question \u2013 including regularly affecting staff by terminating them without warning, turning on and off access to systems, placing and removing staff from administrative leave, etc. \u2013 severely limiting the ability to navigate and respond to the shifting guidance and bureaucratic hurdles outlined above.\u201d\n\nMore than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign assistance awards were suddenly terminated last week, including for work that had previously been issued waivers, nearly a dozen officials told CNN. The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit for failing to pay nearly $2 billion for work done before the foreign assistance freeze. That suit is now in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump arrives this week on Capitol Hill to deliver a speech to Congress, a coequal branch of government he has bulldozed past this first month in office, wielding unimaginable executive power to get what he wants, at home and abroad.\n\nThe Tuesday night address will unfold in the chamber where lawmakers crouched in fear four years ago while a mob of his supporters roamed the halls, and where Nancy Pelosi, Liz Cheney and others vowed to prevent him from ever holding office again. It\u2019s the same House chamber where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy received a hero\u2019s welcome for fighting off Russia\u2019s invasion, in the first year of that war.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has blazed across the federal government, dismantling not just norms and traditions but the very government itself. With billionaire aide Elon Musk by his side, he is firing thousands of federal workers, closing agencies established by law and publicly badgering Zelenskyy while positioning the U.S. closer to Russia.\n\nAs legal cases mount, more than 100 so far challenging the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s actions, the Republican president is daring the other branches of government \u2014 Congress and the courts \u2014 to try to stop him.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing about approaching a constitutional crisis is not quite true,\u201d said Rep. James Clyburn, of South Carolina, a senior Democrat in the House. \u201cWe\u2019re already there.\u201d\n\nTrump revels in going it alone, but there are limits\n\nReveling in the might of going it alone, Trump is about to test the limits of his executive branch authority as he turns to Congress to deliver tax cuts and other key aspects of his agenda. Only Congress, by law, can allocate funds \u2014 or pull them back \u2014 but the Trump administration\u2019s actions have been testing that foundational rule, enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nTrump also needs lawmakers to fund the government and ensure federal operations don\u2019t shut down when money runs out March 14. And he will need Congress to pass legislation to prevent an economically damaging debt default, something he has pushed lawmakers to resolve.\n\nWhile Trump enjoys the rare sweep of power in Washington, with the Republicans controlling the White House, the House and the Senate, he relies on political fear as well as favor to motivate lawmakers. With Musk having poured $200 million into electing Trump, the president has a ready patron whose vast political funds can influence any resisters.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who has positioned himself as a partner to the president, has said he\u2019s excited about what Trump is accomplishing in rooting out waste, fraud and abuse to downsize government.\n\n\u201cFireworks,\u201d is what Johnson, R-La., said he expects from Trump\u2019s speech, dismissing as \u201cnonsense\u201d concerns that Congress is ceding too much power to the White House.\n\n\u201cThe president is doing what he said on the campaign trail he would do,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on Fox News Channel\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures show.\n\nDemocrats, after their stunning rejection by voters, are slowly beginning to mount a resistance. They are fighting Trump in court, with amicus briefs to protect federal workers, and filing legislation to serve as a check on what House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York calls the \u201cparade of horribles.\u201d\n\nBut as the minority party, they are limited in their power. Jeffries brushed off calls for Democrats to boycott Trump\u2019s address. \u201cIt\u2019s the people\u2019s House. It\u2019s the House of Representatives,\u201d he said on CNN.\n\nInstead, Democrats are inviting fired federal workers as their guests.\n\nTax cuts and mass deportation funds all at stake\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s top campaign promises, extending the tax breaks approved during his first term in 2017, is posing one of his party\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nJohnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota are marshalling the GOP majority to deliver what Trump calls a \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d extending those tax breaks \u2014 and providing new ones. But Republicans also want some $2 trillion in budget cuts with changes to Medicaid and other services that millions of Americans count on, which Trump could decide is too much to bear.\n\nTrump\u2019s other big campaign promise \u2014 the biggest deportation operation in U.S. history \u2014 is running short of cash, and border czar Tom Homan has implored Republicans on Capitol Hill to loosen the purse strings to give the Homeland Security and Defense departments the money needed.\n\nThose budget debates all come as the Trump administration is ripping the federal government apart and freezing federal funds. It\u2019s challenging the Nixon-era Impoundment Control Act, which prevents the executive branch from halting allocations Congress has already approved, setting up a showdown that could wind up at the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cTesting the boundaries a little, I would expect that,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., who said he supports much of what the Trump administration is doing, to a point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got separate but equal branches of government,\u201d said Womack, whose committee controls vast funding. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is, we don\u2019t want a constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nLives, livelihoods and the echoes of Jan. 6\n\nIt\u2019s not just constitutional issues at stake but the lives and livelihoods of Americans. Communities depend on federal dollars \u2014 for health care clinics, school programs and countless contracts for companies large and small that provide goods and services to the federal government. Many are watching that money evaporate overnight.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, a former governor, said voters back home have concerns even as they support the idea of downsizing government.\n\n\u201cPeople are always afraid of the dark,\u201d he said, citing potential changes to Medicaid and preschool programs in particular. \u201cLet\u2019s give it time to see really what materializes before we run through the streets with our hair on fire.\u201d\n\nAnd the threat of Jan. 6, 2021, hangs over the building.\n\nTrump will stand on the dais where Pelosi, then the House speaker, was whisked to safety as the mob ransacked the Capitol. He will look out over the rows of lawmakers, some of whom blocked the back door to the chamber as Capitol Police were fending off rioters, steps away from where Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot and killed. Visitors will be watching from the galleries where representatives crouched on the floor in gas masks before being evacuated.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted Trump\u2019s presidential actions wide immunity from prosecution, and the four-count criminal indictment against him over Jan. 6 was withdrawn once he was reelected, in line with Justice Department policy.\n\nIn one of his first acts on Inauguration Day, Trump issued a sweeping pardon of all the rioters, including extremist leaders Stuart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, who were convicted of sedition. They have both returned to make appearances at the Capitol since their release from prison.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., was in the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cI acknowledge that he won and he\u2019s got the right to use all the executive authority to pursue his policies. He doesn\u2019t have a right to exceed constitutional authority,\u201d Welch said. \u201cSo how he does this should be of great concern to all of us.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Durham, North Carolina CNN \u2014\n\nAn out-of-work federal contractor with two master\u2019s degrees is applying for food stamps for the first time in her life. Others are considering selling their homes, or taking out loans and sinking deeper in debt. A furloughed single mother said that now that she has no income, she\u2019s gathering jewelry to sell at a pawnshop.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to drastically cut federal spending and slash the federal workforce are already having an impact in North Carolina \u2013 a key swing state that voted for Trump in November but is also among the top recipients of funding from some of the agencies his administration has targeted.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to evaluate the full extent of Trump\u2019s push to reduce the federal government. But in interviews with CNN, more than a dozen federal workers and contractors in North Carolina who have been furloughed or terminated described having to adjust their personal budgets in ways that will have ripple effects in their communities, such as filing for unemployment benefits, cutting personal spending and reducing childcare payments.\n\n\u201cThe only costs we\u2019re paying for right now are food and mortgage. Every other cost is heavily scrutinized,\u201d said Wayan Vota, an aid worker in Chapel Hill who was laid off at the end of January from a group that received funding from the US Agency for International Development. \u201cWe are actively not supporting the businesses in our community because we are hurting.\u201d\n\nBeyond the personal upheaval, the funding cuts could threaten North Carolina\u2019s economy, according to interviews with business leaders, economic experts and government officials. Universities and other organizations in the state, which is a center for biomedical research, were awarded about $2 billion last fiscal year from the National Institutes of Health, more than all but five other states. University officials say the administration\u2019s plans to cap some funding from NIH grants would likely lead to significant layoffs.\n\nBrianna Clarke-Schwelm, who leads a North Carolina public health alliance, says some aid and health workers in the state are struggling to get by. CNN\n\nSome of the top contractors for USAID, which has been subject to severe cuts in the Trump administration\u2019s first weeks, are also based in North Carolina. USAID agreed to pay more than $1 billion last year to organizations based in the state, more than to all but three other states and Washington, DC.\n\nWhile much of that money is spent on work abroad, it also supports jobs in the US. More than 300 staffers for groups that receive USAID funds have already been fired or furloughed in North Carolina alone, a CNN review found \u2013 likely just a fraction of the total impact in the state.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are applying for unemployment right now,\u201d said Brianna Clarke-Schwelm, who leads a North Carolina public health alliance. \u201cA lot of people are also pulling their kids out of child care. They\u2019re also thinking about their mortgages. They\u2019re thinking about if they\u2019re going to stay in North Carolina \u2013 if they can afford to stay living here.\u201d\n\nResearch Triangle feeling the fallout\n\nThe impact is concentrated in the Research Triangle region of the state, which spans Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill and is home to several major universities doing research funded by NIH grants, two of the top USAID contractors in the country, and other businesses that have received federal contracts and funds.\n\nLeonardo Williams, the mayor of Durham, said the Trump administration\u2019s cuts are taking a toll at home.\n\nWhile Trump allies have suggested that cuts are primarily aimed at waste and unnecessary spending abroad, the damage is actually \u201chappening right here in my city,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThose jobs are gone. That means I have one less resident that can\u2019t contribute to our economic vitality here. That means I have one less resident that could support the small businesses here locally. That\u2019s one less resident that can contribute to the tax base.\u201d\n\nMayor Leonardo Williams of Durham says the Trump administration cuts are already hurting his city. CNN\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s proposed cuts to NIH funding, which are currently blocked by a court, would cap the funding from research grants that can go to \u201cindirect costs\u201d at 15% \u2013about half of what such grants typically fund. Those costs include staff salaries, equipment and building upkeep, and other overhead that universities need to keep the lights on.\n\nThe change sounds technical, but it would actually be \u201cdevastating\u201d for research universities in North Carolina and around the country, said Colin Duckett, an executive vice dean at Duke University School of Medicine. Duke was awarded about $580 million in NIH grants last year.\n\nThinking about the thousands of people who could lose their jobs in North Carolina alone if the administration\u2019s proposal goes through \u201ckeeps me up at night,\u201d Duckett said. \u201cThe amount of downsizing we would have to do would really devastate the institution, but also the economy for the state.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, he argued, the change would lead to the US \u201cceding its position as the best place in the world to do scientific research.\u201d\n\nThe campus of Duke University, where officials say the Trump administration's planned NIH cuts could lead to major layoffs. Lance King/Getty Images\n\nSome local communities are fighting back against the proposed cuts. The town of Chapel Hill joined more than 40 other cities, counties and mayors across the country in filing an amicus brief in February to support a lawsuit challenging NIH funding changes.\n\nThe filing states some of those jurisdictions will lose income taxes and be forced to support people who have lost jobs, and that NIH grant recipients \u201cact as income and employment multipliers\u201d that subcontract with other businesses. The brief also referenced a report from the group United for Medical Research that found each dollar of NIH research funding in 2023 equated to $2.46 in new economic activity.\n\nNorth Carolina could be affected beyond the blue-leaning Research Triangle, too, because reduced federal funding could force state legislators to consider \u201ccuts to programs and services statewide,\u201d said Alexandra Sirota, the executive director of the NC Budget & Tax Center, a nonprofit group that analyzes economic conditions in the state.\n\nLaid off and harrassed\n\nSome USAID contractors in North Carolina have found themselves facing not just the devastation of losing their jobs, but also growing hostility and insults \u2013 both from strangers online and from political leaders who have pushed extreme views about the agency.\n\nThe research institute RTI International, a major USAID contractor, has been listed among the top corporate philanthropists in the Raleigh-Durham region and, in addition to its global initiatives, has worked on projects to improve health outcomes in the state. But when the nonprofit organization announced last month that it was temporarily laying off dozens of staffers in North Carolina due to the Trump administration\u2019s pause on foreign assistance, the news was met with glee from MAGA supporters online.\n\n\u201cThey have been stealing from the taxpayers for a very long time,\u201d one user wrote on X. Another declared that the \u201cgrift for NC is over. The majority of us are so here for it.\u201d\n\nDurham, North Carolina, part of the Research Triangle region, is home to major recipients of NIH and USAID funding. CNN\n\nSome zealous USAID critics have taken it upon themselves to snail mail their disdain. \u201cI hope [your company] goes bankrupt and you and everyone else get laid off and stay unemployed forever,\u201d stated a letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, that was sent to a foreign aid group that has also furloughed some workers in North Carolina. A staffer for another USAID contractor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about backlash, said her firm has received \u201cthreat letters mailed to our office,\u201d and that some employees had been directly targeted with harassment.\n\nThe anger at USAID, where most staff have been fired or placed on leave, has echoed vitriol expressed from the top of the Trump administration. Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has led efforts to slash USAID\u2019s budget in his role with the Department of Government Efficiency, declared the agency a \u201ccriminal organization,\u201d calling it \u201ca viper\u2019s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America.\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said USAID was \u201ca sinister propagator of totalitarianism and war across the globe.\u201d Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused the agency of \u201csowing bizarro destabilizing sexual politics into other people\u2019s cultures\u201d and \u201cpaying to wreck a lot of other places.\u201d\n\nBut staffers who have been laid off say that criticism radically distorted the work they were doing to try to save lives, promote the rule of law and boost America\u2019s image abroad.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric has felt like we are expendable, that foreign aid is not important, that, in fact, we\u2019re wasteful,\u201d said Ruth Garfinkel, a Durham mother of two who lost her job with a USAID contractor. \u201cThat\u2019s very hurtful when you\u2019ve spent 20 years doing this work and attempting to help people.\u201d\n\nRuth Garfinkel, a laid-off employee of a USAID contractor in Durham, has taken on debt since her position was terminated. CNN\n\nAt least some North Carolina-based organizations that have received USAID funds have seemingly welcomed the gutting of the agency. Franklin Graham, a Trump ally and the president of Boone-headquartered relief group Samaritan\u2019s Purse, which has received millions from USAID, said in a statement, \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing for the government to assess and reexamine the various programs that the U.S. is funding around the world. I encourage the State Department to continue providing life-saving aid such as food and medicine. We have a limited amount of money to spend, and I believe it should be spent wisely.\u201d Graham said less than 5% of his group\u2019s funding last year came from government grants.\n\nThe Trump administration has portrayed various USAID projects as examples of \u201cwaste\u201d and \u201cabuse.\u201d A White House webpage criticized specific initiatives, such as $1.5 million given to support opportunities for LGBTQ people in Serbia that according to contract data would increase employment potential and reduce workplace discrimination. Another project referenced is $6 million for development in Egypt that according to a linked USAID press release involved transportation access for rural communities and economic programs for families.\n\nFormer USAID staffers argue that in addition to causing job losses, the agency\u2019s undoing could more broadly undermine US security.\n\nForeign assistance \u201cprevents pandemics back home. \u2026 it prevents violent extremism from coming to our shores. It stems the tide of migration,\u201d retired USAID counselor Chris Milligan told CNN. \u201cWhen you turn that off and you fire the experts that are doing that, what\u2019s the plan for keeping America safe?\u201d\n\nGarfinkel, the laid-off development worker in Durham, said her job made up about three-quarters of her household\u2019s income, so now her family has had to find new ways to make ends meet. The day after she learned of her termination, she went to the bank to get a home equity line of credit. Her family had hoped to save money and invest in home renovations this year \u2013 but now they\u2019re going into debt, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like them to know that they are harming ordinary people, who are just trying to get by,\u201d Garfinkel said of those responsible for the funding cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s really shortsighted and, frankly, cruel.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Harvard professor Steven Levitsky co-authored How Democracies Die, a hit book that explored the way strongmen leaders, including Donald Trump, can erode once-stable political systems. How Democracies Die resonated in the middle of Trump\u2019s first term and made Levitsky a famous name among anxious liberals. Unfortunately, his work is even more relevant to American politics seven years later. Earlier this year, Levitsky and Lucan A. Way published an essay in Foreign Affairs titled \u201cThe Path to American Authoritarianism.\u201d (They wrote almost all of the article before January 20.) Levitsky and Way focus on \u201ccompetitive authoritarianism,\u201d a concept they have explored for more than two decades. Under competitive authoritarianism, aspiring autocrats acquire power through legitimate elections, then stack the deck in their favor by rewarding corrupt allies, seeking revenge on their enemies through lawsuits and harassment, and cowing mass media. (Sound familiar?) I spoke with Levitsky, who is also a senior fellow for democracy at the Council on Foreign Relations, about how the first few weeks of Trump 2.0 have gone, how Elon Musk has scrambled his thinking, and whether he ever thought competitive authoritarianism could actually come to the U.S.\n\nMany of the warnings in your essay have already turned into reality: deep politicization of the FBI and spurious investigations into Trump\u2019s political rivals, to name a couple. Have things accelerated more quickly than you were anticipating when you wrote it? In other words, how screwed are we right now?\n\n\ufeffWe\u2019re pretty screwed. A couple of things are a little worse than I anticipated. One is that while we knew the Republicans would not put up many obstacles, they have been even weaker than I thought. That the Congress is basically shutting itself down in the wake of the executive branch usurping its power is also really stunning. The Republican abdication has been worse than I expected, and I thought it would be bad.\n\nThe second thing I didn\u2019t anticipate was the role of Musk. I don\u2019t think anybody quite could have anticipated it. That article drew on 20 years of research on competitive authoritarian regimes elsewhere in the world. The kinds of stuff we predicted, a lot of which has come to pass, are strategies that have been carried out in literally dozens of other cases. But Musk is pretty new. This is something that I don\u2019t really have a model to understand. There\u2019s a sort of technological frontier element to this that\u2019s a little frightening. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do with data. And frankly, at least in democracies, I\u2019ve never seen a concentration of political, economic, and media power as vast as this.\n\nAnd in an unelected official.\n\n\ufeffIn an unelected official, right. With the exception of really old-fashioned dictatorships like Somoza and Trujillo, or Mobutu in Zaire \u2014 the concentration of political, economic, and media power here is just stunning. That\u2019s just never been seen in a democracy to my knowledge. So that\u2019s really new territory.\n\nYou wrote at the beginning of your article \u2014 again, before the events of the last few weeks \u2014 that it had become somewhat pass\u00e9 to worry about the fate of democracy, since America survived Trump\u2019s first term. What do you make of the strength of the opposition so far?\n\n\ufeffIf I could go back, I wouldn\u2019t need to write that paragraph. There has been a response to this authoritarian offensive, and it\u2019s not that surprising. I think Trump is probably hurting himself by making so many enemies so quickly. Every fired employee and their family is going to move into the opposition, and every group that is directly or indirectly affected by the cessation of payments. He\u2019s creating a certain amount of opposition at a pretty rapid clip.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s daring himself to do it, just running roughshod over people.\n\n\ufeffI never know what is driving him, what is motivating him. He\u2019s not a typical rational autocrat in a sense, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily going about this in the best way. I think he\u2019s probably not building a sustainable coalition the way Ch\u00e1vez and Orb\u00e1n and Erdo\u011fan did. That said, a lot of autocrats move very quickly early on. I\u2019m a sports fan, so I always find sports metaphors. This is the first round of a 15-round boxing match in which one fighter, maybe the underdog, comes out and decides to throw a thousand punches. And his rival is surprised, stunned, groggy, has maybe hit the mat. We don\u2019t know how long he can sustain it. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to transpire if we go 7, 8, 10, 15 rounds. But the first round has been kind of stunning, because Trump took everybody by surprise. In part because the Establishment was asleep.\n\nThat has to do with the nature of his victory, I think \u2014 Trump made inroads with unexpected populations, and Democrats don\u2019t know how to counter that exactly.\n\n\ufeffI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s true that I certainly did not expect him to win the popular vote, but we\u2019re talking about a 1.5 percentage-point victory, and we\u2019re talking about a 2, 2.5 percent difference from what was expected or what he\u2019s done in the past. The idea that this was some overwhelming shift or overwhelming victory is ludicrous.\n\nBut when Trump wins by one, it feels like he wins by 30 \u2014 because he\u2019s Trump.\n\n\ufeffWell, that\u2019s how everybody treated it. The New York Times talked about, literally, a sweeping election victory. It was not a sweeping victory. So this gave him a legitimacy that he didn\u2019t have before, that he probably didn\u2019t deserve, but I think it quieted a number of dissident voices for quite a while. And, certainly, it left the Democrats on the sidelines for a few weeks.\n\nTo go back to your boxing metaphor, perhaps Trump is George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle and he\u2019ll punch himself out?\n\n\ufeffJames Carville wrote that out a few days ago, right? He said explicitly, \u201cThe Democrats just need to roll over and play dead.\u201d\n\nThat they should take the rope-a-dope strategy, so to speak.\n\n\ufeffAbsolutely. I don\u2019t think he referred to Ali in \u201975, but that\u2019s exactly what he said. Which might, might be the right electoral strategy for the Democratic Party. But it is a horrible, horrible fact if you\u2019re thinking about defending democracy.\n\nThere\u2019s always this debate within the party about the extent to which politicians should be calling out every one of these anti-democracy infractions that Trump commits, and to what extent that they should just focus on the bread-and-butter issues, egg prices, and inflation, and all of that stuff that voters care most about. Is that a false binary to you?\n\n\ufeffYeah, I think it\u2019s false. It\u2019s mistaken on a couple of fronts. First of all, it confuses the division of labor between party strategists and everybody else in society. I know we\u2019re polarized \u2014 we divided the world into red and blue, and everybody\u2019s on team blue or team red. But when people are telling me not to talk about democracy so much because it\u2019s not the best strategy for the Democratic Party, I mean, give me a break. I\u2019m a political-science professor. I\u2019m supposed to talk. It\u2019s my job to talk about it.\n\nWell, not you. I meant more Chuck Schumer.\n\n\ufeffI know. But it\u2019s not my job to figure out the best way for the Democratic Party to win votes. The Democratic Party does have to think about winning votes. And in the campaign, it was a legitimate question as to whether they should have campaigned around democracy or not. But there aren\u2019t any elections for quite a while, and society \u2014 people who are not campaign gurus for the Democratic Party \u2014 has a responsibility to defend our democracy. And our politicians have a responsibility to defend our democracy. When democracy is under threat, you don\u2019t just say, \u201cWell, the polls say \u2026 My focus groups say bread-and-butter issues are better.\u201d You\u2019ve got to defend the Constitution, man.\n\nI was super critical of Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy for putting their own short-term political ambitions above the defense of democracy. That\u2019s in effect what they did. They knew better. They said as much in private, but in public, they decided that the best way to advance their careers was to enable Trump, to acquiesce to Trump, and the bulk of the party acted that way with huge consequences. But in a way, Schumer et al. are doing the same thing, right? If they decide that defending democracy is not in their best electoral interest, they\u2019re also abdicating the role of defending democracy. They\u2019re just not quite as culpable as the Republicans.\n\nYou\u2019ve written that approval ratings matter for would-be competitive authoritarians. Some of the people you\u2019ve covered have had 80 percent approval ratings; Ch\u00e1vez was very popular for a long time, for instance. Trump has never been that popular. He hit 50 percent recently, and it was a big deal because he\u2019s rarely been there before. Many of his policies are also underwater in polls. But as you said, it\u2019s a long time before any big elections, and he\u2019s not one to step away from doing unpopular things. So let\u2019s say he gets down to 35 percent or that area. What do you see as the effect of that on his power?\n\n\ufeffCertainly, that won\u2019t necessarily constrain his behavior. And unfortunately, I think he\u2019s unlikely to get down to the 35 percent.\n\nI think there would have to be a serious economic shock to get to that level.\n\n\ufeffYeah. More likely, around 40. But I think there\u2019s a good chance he gets down there relatively quickly. If he does decline from 50 to 40, it won\u2019t change his behavior. To be clear, he could still do a lot of damage, but it will send signals. It\u2019ll make Chuck Schumer a little more likely to speak out. It\u2019ll embolden Jeffries a little bit. You might see some more non-Trumpist Republicans taking a more independent position. The civil-society actors and CEOs may brownnose a little bit less. It\u2019s hard to say when this would happen, but once there\u2019s a little blood in the water, once that honeymoon\u2019s over, you often see kind of a pack effect in people jumping into opposition.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily block Trump from doing anything again. If the Republicans give him carte blanche, and certainly if the courts allow it, he can do a hell of a lot of damage. But there will be many, many more opposing voices in society, and that will slow him down a bit.\n\nI\u2019ve been struck by just how in lockstep big businesses have been in support of him over the last few months. That\u2019s one thing I could see changing, slowly, if he becomes truly unpopular.\n\n\ufeffLike you said, his 1.5 percent victory felt like a 30-point victory. And when he was up over 50 percent for the first time ever, that\u2019s a little bit like what it felt for years under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez when he was at 80 percent. When the president\u2019s at 80 percent, everybody knows he\u2019s untouchable. Nobody\u2019s going to criticize him. The media\u2019s quiet, the opposition shuts up because whatever it says is going to be unpopular. It has a really powerful, demobilizing effect on society and the opposition. That\u2019s going to dissipate as Trump declines, if he declines.\n\nAs you mentioned, the Republican Party has been almost totally docile. Is there an equivalent you can think of where somebody has been in charge of their party for this long, the way Trump is dominating them for this long, and then the party eventually does turn on them?\n\n\ufeffOh, that\u2019s a good question. This is a little less authoritarian and more on the side of corruption, but the ANC eventually turned on Jacob Zuma. For those who care, I think UMNO eventually turned on Mahathir Mohamad back in the early 2000s in Malaysia.\n\nThere are other cases. When a leader gets this level of personalized control of the party, very often, the party goes down with the leader. In this case, Trump has an astounding level of personal control of the party, more than any other leader in modern history in the United States. It\u2019s really possibly unprecedented.\n\nMaybe FDR.\n\n\ufeffI don\u2019t know. I think given the heterogeneity, FDR could not dominate the southern Democratic Party. FDR tried to intervene in primaries and failed miserably to get the southern conservatives onboard with the New Deal. FDR couldn\u2019t even think about promoting civil rights because of the southern Democrats. So, no, FDR didn\u2019t have anywhere near this.\n\nThat said, this is still a real party with many, many talented politicians emerging within it. If Trump does become quite unpopular, which is entirely possible, if he does fall into the 30s, the combination of his unpopularity and lame-duck status means that he\u2019s not going to be able to impose his son as a candidate or the guy he wants as a candidate. I think you will see Republicans begin to emerge and challenge him as DeSantis tried to do a couple of years ago.\n\nWhich I thought would work for a month or so. I was na\u00efve.\n\n\ufeffYeah. He turned out to be not a terribly talented politician. But I think there\u2019s a good chance that the party will find itself if Trump becomes sufficiently unpopular and it becomes politically useful to abandon him. Right now, it\u2019s just not politically useful.\n\nOr perhaps if he declines physically. Which I\u2019m sure has happened in comparable situations before.\n\n\ufeffOh, yeah. To give you one example, Juan Per\u00f3n returned to the presidency as an old man in 1973. He had been in exile for 18 years, so not just four years, but he came back and he died the next year, in 1974. And the party just went to war with itself. It ripped itself apart after he died.\n\nYou\u2019ve been writing about this for a long time, as we\u2019ve said. Did you ever think your theories would be so applicable in America?\n\n\ufeffNo. Lucan Way, who I co-authored the Foreign Affairs piece with \u2014 he and I published our first piece on competitive authoritarianism in 2002. We wrote it in 2000 and 2001, so we were finishing it up right around the time of 9/11. For a while after 9/11, a lot of liberals were concerned with the Patriot Act, that the Bush administration was going to be somewhat authoritarian. I was never as concerned as some of my friends. But people would ask us when we were first writing this up, \u201cIs competitive authoritarianism impossible in the United States?\u201d They had Bush and the Patriot Act and Cheney in mind.\n\nAnd we dismissed it. Lucan and I always had these dark fantasies: Would we ever have to write a piece saying that the United States is becoming competitive authoritarian? We\u2019d talked about it, but we always came to the conclusion that no, it would never really happen.\n\nMy political education was under Bush being pretty alarmed at the time. There was political corruption going on, but nothing compared to now.\n\n\ufeffThere was pushback. There are always going to be efforts to abuse power, and there are always going to be scandals. But the key is there has to be a reaction from society, from the media, ideally from the president\u2019s own party. There has to be a cost to it. The really scary thing right now is the lack of reaction, lack of pushback, especially among Republicans.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "Self-professed \u201cfree-speech absolutist\u201d Elon Musk. Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nIn the 2010s, a certain kind of social-justice activist took a hard turn against the mainstream media. The rancor was of a different flavor than the Chomskyan critiques of corporate media and the consent it allegedly manufactured. It wasn\u2019t so much that conventional journalists were too moderate for them and not sympathetic enough to their causes, though that explained some of their anger. It was more that the concept of journalism itself \u2014 independent reporters appearing at public events to gather facts, speak to individuals, and take photographs \u2014 was somehow a threat to these activists\u2019 well-being.\n\nThis sentiment might have been best encapsulated by Melissa Click, a University of Missouri communications professor who tried, a decade ago, to forcibly stop a student journalist from filming a racial-justice protest on campus. Caught on-camera asking for \u201cmuscle\u201d to block the student who was merely recording a public event, Click became emblematic of the \u201cwoke\u201d left run amok. She would apologize, but the controversy represented more than one hotheaded professor attempting to foolishly police the coverage of one campus protest.\n\nRather, it spoke to a growing consensus among a certain segment of the activist class that media coverage itself could be harmful or even destructive. First Amendment concerns and the concept of a public domain had to be, suddenly, subordinate to the feelings of individual activists. The left\u2019s growing skepticism of free speech as an inherent value \u2014 even the ACLU had evolved from an organization that defended the right of the Ku Klux Klan to march in public to one that, during Donald Trump\u2019s first term, began to reject the argument that the right wing needed civil-liberties protections \u2014 paved the way for conservatives to reinvent themselves as First Amendment warriors, or at least those more committed to free expression.\n\nNow, with Trump ascendant and Elon Musk dominating both the website formerly known as Twitter and the federal bureaucracy itself, conservatives have begun to adopt many of the same pathologies as the old social-justice class. Conventional journalism that identifies the members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) or exposed who might be the mother of Musk\u2019s latest child is reimagined as a grievous attack on a weaker, more vulnerable party that needs special protection \u2014 or what might have been called, not so long ago, a safe space.\n\nReporting on DOGE, for example, has been recast as \u201cdoxing,\u201d even though the young engineers and activists recruited to aid Musk\u2019s efforts are performing extraordinarily public work, implementing cuts and staffing changes that impact tens of thousands of federal employees and alter how most Americans interact with a government funded with their tax dollars. \u201cThe so-called New York Times outs 45 people working for DOGE,\u201d fumed Byron York, the chief political correspondent for the conservative Washington Examiner, in response to a Times report identifying by name numerous members of Musk\u2019s DOGE team.\n\nThe writer Geoff Shullenberger has referred to this trend as the \u201cbizarro awokening,\u201d with complaints of doxing replacing what was, on the old liberal Twitter of the 2010s, typically tagged as harassment. Before Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X, the platform was remarkably influential with activists, celebrities, politicians, pundits, and journalists, many of them on the left. There was an aristocracy of verified \u201cblue checks\u201d who could wield their clout to blast those who went against whatever popular consensus existed at the moment. That aristocracy, thanks to Musk, is largely dead, swapped for conservatives who have mostly paid for blue-check verification badges and parrot whatever Musk and Trump spew out. They are no more committed to free expression than the \u201cwoke\u201d left and furiously try to stamp out any criticism lodged at their dear leaders. Just as Twitter did eventually become real life, the manias of X now bleed out into the physical world: The president of NYU\u2019s chapter of the College Republicans was forced to resign earlier this month after she was quoted telling Vanity Fair that Barron Trump was \u201csort of like an oddity on campus.\u201d Cancel culture lives!\n\nAs Trump inevitably falters \u2014 his poll numbers are already slipping, and if Republicans enact devastating social-safety-net cuts, Democrats will have plenty to campaign on in the midterms \u2014 expect conservatives to further close ranks and panic, straining to stamp out whatever dissent they find in their midst. The witch hunts for anything resembling \u201cDEI\u201d are already more extreme than any of the liberal speech policing found at the height of the social-justice era. One college in Michigan has already preemptively banned readings from a variety of non-white writers (as well as George Orwell, ironically enough) out of fear that the Trump administration might pull their federal funding.\n\nThe dispiriting reality of our contemporary political discourse is that neither ideological faction cares much for free expression. The values inherent in the First Amendment are trampled on or outright discarded whenever it becomes convenient for one political party. Perhaps, in time, there will be a shift and these sort of destructive inanities will come to an end. It\u2019s all quite exhausting, at the very least."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US has suspended operations and planning for offensive cyber operations against Russia, a senior US official told CNN.\n\nThe suspension is \u201ca major blow,\u201d the official said, especially since planning for such operations takes time and research to carry out. The concern, the official said, is that the pause on offensive cyber operations against Russia will make the US more vulnerable to potential cyberattacks from Moscow, which has a formidable cadre of hackers capable of disrupting US critical infrastructure and collecting sensitive intelligence.\n\nThe pause in operations and planning from US Cyber Command, the military\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber unit, comes as the Trump administration has sought a broader d\u00e9tente with Russia three years into Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, throwing the US-Ukraine relationship into uncertainty.\n\n\u201cDue to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations. There is no greater priority to Secretary Hegseth than the safety of the warfighter in all operations, to include the cyber domain,\u201d a senior defense official told CNN, referring to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe Record first reported on Cyber Command\u2019s suspension of planning related to Russia.\n\n\u201cIt is not uncommon for the Pentagon to pause actions which are potentially destabilizing or provocative for negotiations, including cyber-effects operations,\u201d Jason Kikta, a former Cyber Command official, told CNN. \u201cBut if a planning pause was also directed, that could cause offensive options to become stale and therefore nonviable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny extended period without checking on access and updating planning, risks losing that access or missing a critical change,\u201d Kikta said, adding that he was not personally aware of any change in status of Cyber Command operations.\n\nRussia and the US are in a regular state of confrontation in cyberspace, current and former US official say. The Kremlin sees cyberspace as a source of asymmetric advantage with the US, as it can burrow into US critical infrastructure and try to influence US elections.\n\nFor their part, American military and intelligence hackers have in recent years increasingly gone after Russian cybercriminals and intelligence operatives.\n\nSince 2016, when Russia used bots, trolls and hackers to try to influence the election in favor of Trump, Moscow has repeated that playbook in some form in every US presidential election, according to US officials.\n\nCyber Command was established more than a decade ago, in part to respond to threats from Russia and other foreign powers. The command has matured considerably since its inception, growing into a several-thousand strong force of computer operatives who conduct offensive and defensive missions.\n\nFrom its base at Fort Meade, Maryland, alongside the National Security Agency, Cyber Command has also increasingly become a tool of US power projection. The command has sent specialists to allies around the world to try to help them defend against threats from cybercriminals and spies.\n\nThat includes a trip to Ukraine in December 2021, in anticipation of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, to help Kyiv prepare for an onslaught of Russian cyberattacks.\n\nMonths after Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion, Cyber Command confirmed that it was actively engaged in helping Ukraine defend itself through cyberattacks.\n\nCyber Command has also increasingly taken aim at ransomware gangs that extort US businesses for millions of dollars and threaten the safety of hospitals. Many of those gangs are based in Russia.\n\nCyber Command \u201cprovides people, resources and unique insights to support broader USG [US government] counter-ransomware operations,\u201d a former senior Department of Defense official told CNN. \u201cRussia is a permissive environment for some of the most prolific ransomware gangs and actors to operate. Does this operational planning hold apply to Russian ransomware actors that often target American companies?\u201d\n\nDespite the change in planning at Cyber Command, another major federal cybersecurity agency said it was not altering its posture.\n\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the lead civilian agency for defending federal networks from hacks, said Sunday night on X that its mission is to \u201cdefend against all cyber threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure, including from Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been no change in our posture,\u201d the agency said, in an apparent response to media reports that the agency was emphasizing non-Russia threats. \u201cAny reporting to the contrary is fake and undermines our national security.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand contributed reporting.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."
