            "full_content": "Summary Louis DeJoy resigned Monday as head of the US Postal Service after announcing plans to step down in February.\n\nDeJoy, a businessman and Trump donor, led the struggling agency through financial challenges following the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDeputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will lead USPS until a permanent successor is named by the Board of Governors.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has discussed giving Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick oversight of the independent government agency.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLouis DeJoy resigned from his role as head of the US Postal Service on Monday, leaving the independent government agency at a time when it faces calls for privatization and scrutiny from the Trump administration.\n\nIn a statement released by USPS, DeJoy said while the 250-year old-service had made \u201cbeneficial change to what had been an adrift and moribund organization,\u201d more work was necessary \u201cto sustain our positive trajectory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been one of the pleasures of my life and a crowning achievement of my career to have been associated with this cherished institution,\u201d he added, noting that Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take the reins until the USPS Board of Governors names a permanent successor. A statement from USPS said there is no \u201cestablished timeline\u201d for the announcement of DeJoy\u2019s replacement.\n\nDeJoy, who was appointed postmaster general as the agency struggled to survive financial woes from the Covid-19 pandemic, announced plans to step down in February.\n\nThe former businessman and GOP donor led the agency through the coronavirus pandemic and two high-turnout presidential elections that saw surges in mail-in ballots. He has sought to modernize the service, unveiling a 10-year plan in 2021 to stem ongoing losses.\n\nSome of his plans drew criticism, with many claiming that his efforts to consolidate deliveries ultimately slowed them down.\n\nHe also advocated for raising the postage rates, saying in 2022 that Americans should get used to \u201cuncomfortable\u201d rate increases to help get the agency, which is self-funded, on better financial footing. A First-Class domestic postage stamp for a standard sized envelope is currently $0.73, up from $0.55, when DeJoy arrived at the agency.\n\nWhile the USPS is four years into a reorganization initiative designed to cut costs and improve efficiency, President Donald Trump has said he wants to see more changes. He has floated plans to give Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick oversight of the agency, which is currently overseen by its board of governors, not a Cabinet secretary.\n\n\u201cWell, we want to have a post office that works well and doesn\u2019t lose massive amounts of money, and we\u2019re thinking about doing that, and it will be a form of a merger,\u201d Trump said at Lutnick\u2019s swearing-in ceremony on February 21, days after DeJoy said he would resign. \u201cIt\u2019ll remain the Postal Service, and I think it\u2019ll operate a lot better than it has been over the years.\u201d\n\nThe move could be a first step towards privatization \u2013 a change tech billionaire and White House adviser Elon Musk called for earlier this month.\n\nDays later, DeJoy told Congress that he had signed an agreement to let Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency work with the Postal Service. The agency, DeJoy said, will focus on improving the management of USPS retirement assets and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Program, which he argued have been \u201cmismanaged.\u201d\n\nRoughly 30,000 employees have been cut from the agency since 2021, and there are plans to slash another 10,000 people through a voluntary early retirement program, he added. The agency currently employs approximately 635,000 workers across the US.\n\nMark Dimondstein, the leader of the the American Postal Workers Union, encouraged the USPS to ensure that its next postmaster general is opposed to privatization as he warned of \u201ca White House intent on breaking up and selling off the public United States Postal Service.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, and I will say it again, this attack on the USPS is part of the ongoing coup by oligarchs against the vital public services APWU members and other public servants provide to the country,\u201d he added. \u201cPrivatized postal services will lead to higher postage prices, and a lower quality of service to the public.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Gabe Cohen contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "A network of progressive non-profits has quietly spent years pushing the IRS\u2019s new \u201cDirect File\u201d service.\n\nProgressive supporters of Direct File claim to advocate for low-income taxpayers. Research shows that key organizations promoting Direct File are closely tied to Arabella Advisors and its billion-dollar network of left-leaning dark money groups.\n\nOne Arabella-backed organization, the Economic Security Project (ESP), has funded advertising and research in support of Direct File. Last year, the group received a $752,197 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to \u201cconduct research on the impact and usage\u201d of Direct File.\n\nThat work culminated in a media blitz encouraging largely low-income taxpayers to adopt Direct File, which was first made available as a pilot program in 2024 for taxpayers across a dozen states. Last year, the IRS agreed to make the program permanent, but it has since come under fire from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump-appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent agreed to temporarily keep the program through the 2025 tax season, earning him praise from progressive groups including ESP.\n\nESP is fiscally sponsored by the Hopewell Fund, a nonprofit managed by Arabella Advisors. The arrangement allows ESP to operate as a project of the Hopewell Fund, taking advantage of Hopewell\u2019s nonprofit status without having to register with the IRS or publicly disclose its own finances.\n\nESP\u2019s goal isn\u2019t simply to make filing taxes easier. Adam Ruben, a former aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) who is now managing outreach for the group, called Direct File \u201c[o]ne of the best tools we have to create the infrastructure for guaranteed income in this country\u201d and said Direct File \u201cis a huge opportunity for economic security and racial equity.\u201d\n\nGroundwork Collaborative, another non-profit receiving funding through the Arabella Network, has led its own media blitz supporting Direct File. Groundwork Action, the group\u2019s advocacy arm, funded a \u201cBetter IRS\u201d ad campaign promoting direct file and attacking private-sector tax preparers. Like ESP, Groundwork is led by a former policy advisor to Elizabeth Warren.\n\nESP and Groundwork help fund and operate The Coalition for Free and Fair Filing, which \u201csupports the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s efforts to create a free online direct tax filing tool,\u201d according to the group\u2019s website. \u201cThe coalition is composed of organizations committed to racial and economic justice, consumer protection, the advancement of civic technology and the promotion of equity in tax administration.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Direct File frame it, in part, as an effort to help low-income tax filers and also as a better way to ensure collection of higher tax revenues by the IRS.\n\nCritics of Direct File highlight the inherent conflict of interest in having the IRS prepare people\u2019s tax returns. Last year, a group of Republican Senators challenged the IRS\u2019s ability to unilaterally launch such a program, saying \u201c[s]erious legal questions exist about the IRS Direct File launch,\u201d which was undertaken without Congressional approval.\n\nThe IRS initially received funding for a pilot program for an in-house tax filing tool through the Inflation Reduction Act. Last year, Direct File was made available to users in 12 states. For 2025, availability has expanded to 32 million taxpayers in 25 states.\n\nJacob McLeod is a researcher and writer focusing primarily on corruption in politics."

            "full_content": "The death of former U.S. Rep. Mia Love has brought renewed attention to an aggressive form of brain cancer that killed her at age 49\n\nWhat is glioblastoma, the aggressive brain cancer that killed former US Rep. Mia Love?\n\nSALT LAKE CITY -- The death Sunday of former U.S. Rep. Mia Love, the first Black Republican woman elected to the U.S. House, has brought renewed attention to an aggressive form of brain cancer that killed her at age 49.\n\nThe former lawmaker from Utah had undergone treatment for glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumor, and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial. Her daughter said earlier this month that she was no longer responding to treatment.\n\nLove died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement shared by the family.\n\nLove, born Ludmya Bourdeau, was a daughter of Haitian immigrants and a pioneering Republican congresswoman who represented Utah on Capitol Hill from 2015 to 2019.\n\nShe entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City, and later became the city\u2019s mayor. While in that role, Love spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention and drew rousing cheers with her criticisms of then-President Barack Obama.\n\nThat year, she narrowly lost a bid for the House against the Democratic incumbent. She ran again two years later and defeated a first-time candidate by about 7,500 votes, becoming the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress.\n\nLove was briefly considered a rising star in the GOP, but her power within the party petered out as President Donald Trump took hold. Love kept her distance from Trump and called him out in 2018 for vulgar comments he made about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations. Later that year, she lost in the midterm elections as Democrats surged.\n\nLove was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2022. She said her doctors estimated she had only 10-15 months to live, but she surpassed that.\n\nShe described during a speaking engagement in Salt Lake City how she discovered the tumor. Love said she was on vacation with her family and developed a bad headache when the plane landed. When she went to the beach, the sun\u2019s reflection on the water made her headache unbearable. Her husband brought her to the hospital, and a series of X-rays revealed a tumor in her brain.\n\nLove rushed home to Utah and had surgery to remove about 95% of the tumor. Biopsy results revealed it was cancerous and likely to spread to surrounding brain tissue.\n\nShe entered a clinical trial at Duke University's Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center in Durham, North Carolina, that involved using her body\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor. At first, the tumor shrank, but eventually it stopped responding to treatments.\n\n\u201cGlioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor that's known to mankind, and there is no cure for it,\u201d said Dr. Yasmeen Rauf, a neuro-oncologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who treats the disease. \u201cIt keeps mutating. No matter what you do, it always comes back.\u201d\n\nA glioblastoma is a fast-growing glioma, a type of tumor that arises from glial cells, which protect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nWhile there is no known cure, aggressive treatments such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and other targeted therapies may slow the growth of the tumor. Even if a surgeon is able to remove all that can be seen, Rauf said there are typically still some tumor cells left in the brain that cannot be seen and will multiply quickly.\n\nAbout 13,000 Americans are diagnosed with glioblastoma each year, accounting for almost half of all cancerous brain tumors, according to the Cleveland Clinic. More than 10,000 people in the U.S. will succumb to the disease every year, the National Brain Tumor Society reports.\n\nGlioblastoma can occur at any age but is more commonly found in older adults. The average age at diagnosis is 64.\n\nIt's the same type of brain cancer that killed former President Joe Biden's son Beau Biden in 2015 and Sen. John McCain in 2018.\n\nResearchers have not found a way to prevent glioblastoma, and the cause of most of these tumors is unknown. Glioblastoma occurs when glial cells in the brain or spinal cord mutate, altering their genetic makeup.\n\nIt does not run in families, and you won't pass it on to your children, Rauf explained.\n\nPeople who have been exposed to significant amounts of radiation have an increased risk of developing glioblastoma.\n\nPeople diagnosed with glioblastoma typically have about 15-18 months to live, with only a 10% chance of survival after five years, according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nWith aggressive treatments, Love lived for about three years after receiving her diagnosis.\n\n\u201cMy life has been extended by exceptional medical care, science and extraordinary professionals who have become dear friends,\u201d Love wrote in a recent op-ed in the Deseret News. \u201cMy extra season of life has also been the result of the faith and prayers of countless friends, known and unknown.\""

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Justice Department pressed a federal appeals court on Monday to lift a judge\u2019s temporary block against President Donald Trump\u2019s use of a sweeping wartime authority to quickly deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n\nThe nearly hour-long hearing before the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals was the latest front in what has become a bitter fight between the administration and the targets of a proclamation Trump signed earlier this month invoking the Alien Enemies Act to summarily remove them from the US.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the three-judge panel considering the Trump administration\u2019s request to put on hold a pair of lower-court orders will rule, or how quickly that ruling will come.\n\nTwo members of the panel \u2013 one liberal, one conservative \u2013 peppered attorneys for both sides with a series of questions on various issues central to the case, including whether the individuals subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation lacked any due process rights that would give them a chance to defend against claims that they are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2013 and what the appropriate place for such complaints to be raised is.\n\nBut one member of the panel \u2013 Judge Karen Henderson, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush \u2013 did not ask any questions during the proceedings.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the appeals court hearing:\n\nJudge: \u2018Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act\u2019\n\nJudge Patricia Millett, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, was the most active member of the panel on Monday, starting her line of questioning before Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign could even finish his opening arguments. Throughout the hearing, Millett voiced her concern with how Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act deprived those targeted by the president with any due process rights to challenge the government\u2019s allegation that they\u2019re members of the gang.\n\nAt one point, Millett went so far as to say that Nazis removed from the US decades ago under the wartime authority were afforded more rights than the foreign nationals challenging Trump\u2019s novel use of the law.\n\n\u201cThere were planeloads of people \u2013 there were no procedures in place to notify people,\u201d Millett said, referring to two deportation flights the administration allowed to continue earlier this month after Trump invoked the law.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Honig on what stood out to him in appeals hearing over Trump's 'alien enemy' deportations 02:42 - Source: CNN Honig on what stood out to him in appeals hearing over Trump's 'alien enemy' deportations 02:42\n\n\u201cNazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they had hearing boards, before people were removed. And yet here, there\u2019s nothing in there about hearing boards. There are no regulations, and nothing was adopted by the agency officials that were administering this. People weren\u2019t given notice \u2013 they weren\u2019t told where they were going.\u201d\n\nLater, when pressed by Millett about whether the DOJ agrees that the accused gang members are \u201centitled to notice that they are being removed based\u201d on their classification as alleged gang members, Ensign said he didn\u2019t think that was necessary.\n\n\u201cYour honor, we don\u2019t agree to the notice point,\u201d he told Millett. \u201cWe agree that if you bring habeas (complaints) you can raise such challenges.\u201d\n\nTrump appointee seizes on DOJ argument\n\nJudge Justin Walker, who was put on the bench by Trump during his first term, appeared to agree that the individuals challenging the president\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act deserved a chance to challenge their removal under the act, but seemed less persuaded that the wholesale challenge to Trump\u2019s proclamation could be brought and reviewed by the federal court in Washington under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nInstead, Walker repeatedly indicated that he believed the individuals singled out for deportation under the AEA should be able to funnel their removal challenges through habeas complaints brought in the district courts where they\u2019re being detained.\n\nThe argument is one also being pushed the Trump administration.\n\nAt one point the judge said that the claims being raised by some migrants that they\u2019re not members of Tren de Aragua can be made \u2013 just in the \u201cright\u201d court and \u201cthe right court is in Texas, not here.\u201d\n\nBut Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the challengers, said that wouldn\u2019t be a workable solution since if the orders from US District Judge James Boasberg are lifted, his clients would be loaded on to planes and removed from the US with no time for them to raise such claims.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear, Gelernt said, where everyone is who would be subject to such orders.\n\nChallengers want a more orderly process\n\nIn trying to persuade the appeals court to keep the block in place, Gelernt also argued that doing so would let the litigation continue to unfold before the district court, allowing the factual record to be more fully developed for when the case lands back before the intermediate court.\n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented move to use the Alien Enemies Act for only the fourth time in our country\u2019s history without a declared war,\u201d Gelernt said at one point, adding that Boasberg is saying to \u201cpreserve the status quo until we can find all the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think what we\u2019re going to show in the district court is that many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the people removed had no connection to the gang,\u201d Gelernt said.\n\nGelernt went on to say that the case was still in an early phase and that more facts were likely to emerge in coming days that, he argued, would ultimately buttress their case. If the appeals court allowed the administration to proceed with the deportations, all that work could be erased.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Sister searches for answers after her brother was deported to El Salvador 03:13 - Source: CNN Sister searches for answers after her brother was deported to El Salvador 03:13\n\nHe also argued, more broadly, that the orders at issue on Monday were not appealable in the first place. Temporary restraining orders are generally unappealable, as opposed to preliminary injunctions, which are regularly appealed to federal circuit courts.\n\nEarlier Monday, Boasberg told Gelernt and his colleagues that if they wanted to convert his orders to preliminary injunctions, they must inform him of their decision by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to move on a preliminary injunction very quickly,\u201d he told the appeals court. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back here \u2013 no doubt.\u201d\n\nWhat comes next\n\nRegardless of how the appeals court rules, it\u2019s likely the decision will be appealed to the Supreme Court by the losing side.\n\nWalker at one point asked Gelernt whether they should put their eventual decision on hold to give the losing side a chance to seek the high court\u2019s intervention before it goes into effect: In other words, should the appeals court be mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s role in all of this?\n\n\u201cIf that were going to happen and you were going to rule for the government on this then I would hope that your honors would give us time to seek a stay at the Supreme Court without allowing everyone to be put on a plane to El Salvador in the interim,\u201d Gelernt replied.\n\nBoasberg\u2019s orders are set to expire on Saturday."

And Democratic pollsters fret that if liberal politicians, in particular, do not address these issues, the party is at risk of losing more men to the GOP.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump talks about fixing the economy and being strong, they hear someone who gets it,\u201d said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, and an adviser to Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they trust him. But it does mean he\u2019s speaking to their reality in a way most Democrats aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer hopes to boost men's enrollment in higher education and skills training. Matt Rourke / AP file\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kamala Harris often spoke about issues of importance to women, emphasizing reproductive rights, for instance, and paid family leave policies. But soul-searching over her loss has prompted Democrats to reach out more aggressively to men, by engaging more with sports, for instance, and looking for ways to make the party seem less \u201cuncool\u201d to young voters. Shauna Daly, a Democratic strategist and co-founder of the Young Men Research Project, said candidates need to do more than show young men that they can hang. \u201cWhere the Democratic Party has really fallen short with this cohort is that they don\u2019t feel like Democrats are fighting for them,\u201d she said.\n\nThey need policies like those the governors have proposed, Daly said, that address men's tangible problems.\n\nIn every state, women earn more college degrees than men. Boys are more likely to be disciplined in class, and less likely to graduate high school on time than girls. Men die by suicide at higher rates than women and are more likely to rely on illicit drugs and alcohol. And while women increasingly participate in the workforce at higher rates, men have steadily dropped out of the labor market.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont launched a plan to help more men enter the teaching profession and serve as mentors. Jessica Hill / AP file\n\nThe governors\u2019 speeches touched on many of these issues, and earned cautious applause from masculinity researchers, who said they reflected a promising shift. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of a growing recognition among Democrats that neglecting the problems of boys and men is neither good policy nor good politics,\u201d said Richard Reeves, founder of the American Institute for Boys and Men, who has informally advised Moore\u2019s staff. \u201cIf Democrats weren\u2019t thinking about male voters, and especially young male voters, then it would be a pretty serious dereliction of duty, looking at the polls.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Democrats might have been wary of targeting programs toward boys and men for fear of excluding girls. Whitmer seemed aware of this dynamic in her speech, when she followed her announcement about young men with a shoutout to women and a vow not to abandon her \u201ccommitment to equal opportunity and dignity for everyone.\u201d\n\nA handful of other states, including some run by Republican governors, have already launched initiatives targeting men in recent years. Utah established a task force that aims to help \u201cmen and boys lead flourishing lives,\u201d and North Dakota created the position of a men\u2019s health coordinator to study and raise awareness of disparities affecting men.\n\nMoore said he was partly inspired by his own experience growing up in the Bronx after his father passed. He has described how troubles in his youth \u2014 including a brush with the police for vandalism, skipping school and getting poor grades \u2014 led his mother to send him away to military school, which he credits with helping him straighten up. \u201cIt is very personal for me, because I was one of those young men and boys that we\u2019re trying to reach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I felt like so many of the conversations that were being had about me were not being had with me.\u201d\n\nMoore will hold a cabinet meeting in April to discuss plans for the state agencies, but he has some initial goals: to encourage more men in his state to pursue jobs in education and health care, help boys within the juvenile justice system, and make sure he solicits input from boys and men on how the initiatives are designed.\n\nFor Della Volpe, from the Harvard Kennedy School, the governors\u2019 announcements are encouraging. \u201cThe truth is, young men are speaking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been telling us they want respect, opportunity, and strength. If Democrats don\u2019t listen \u2014 and act \u2014 they\u2019ll keep losing ground. But this moment offers hope.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Monday! We hope your brackets are intact after this weekend. (If you picked the favorites, you\u2019re probably in good shape.)\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we dive into the fallout over a journalist appearing to have been accidentally added to a group chat among Trump administration officials about U.S. plans to strike Houthis in Yemen. Plus, with the shutdown fight behind them, Sahil Kapur lays out the key hurdles Republicans in Congress must now clear to pass a massive bill to enact the president\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe Trump administration is reviewing how its national security team sent war plans to a magazine editor\n\nThe White House said it was reviewing how the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine could have accidentally been added to a group text where people who appeared to be members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration discussed plans to launch airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen, Kelly O\u2019Donnell and Daniel Arkin report.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\u201d the National Security Council said in a statement to NBC News.\n\nThe statement came in response to an article published Monday by The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran national security and foreign affairs journalist. Goldberg reported he had been added to a group chat called \u201cHouthi PC small group\u201d on March 13 via Signal, an encrypted messaging service widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications.\n\nGoldberg reported that he went on to receive a series of messages on Signal that appeared to come from Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and other prominent officials in the Trump administration.\n\nGoldberg reported that he exited the Signal group after he personally concluded it was \u201calmost certainly real.\u201d\n\nHow Trump responded: Trump claimed he had no knowledge of the matter, telling a reporter in the Oval Office: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me about it for the first time.\u201d\n\nHow Democrats are responding: Democrats were quick to sharply criticize the Trump administration.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said: \u201cEvery single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime \u2014 even if accidentally \u2014 that would normally involve a jail sentence.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for \u201ca full investigation into how this happened, the damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future.\u201d Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., blasted the episode as \u201camateur hour.\u201d\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, who drew intense criticism from Republicans for her use of a private email server, tweeted a screenshot of The Atlantic article with a simple message: \u201c\ud83d\udc40 You have got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\nHow Republicans are responding: Republicans have so far been more muted in their response. At least one GOP member of Congress chided Trump\u2019s national security team.\n\n\u201cClassified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\u201d said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. \u201cSafeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the administration is \u201caddressing\u201d the situation and has acknowledged \u201cit was a mistake,\u201d adding that he expects the White House to \u201ctighten up and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\n4 hurdles facing Republicans as they shift focus to a bill to pass Trump's agenda\n\nBy Sahil Kapur\n\nCongress is back after weeklong recess with Republicans planning to shift focus to a party-line bill to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar agenda after having dispensed with a separate government funding deadline.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has set a target of passing the legislation through the House in April before the Easter recess, which leaves Republicans in the House with three weeks \u2014 and a lot of work. And then the bill would go to the Senate, which has a different idea of how to proceed.\n\nHere are four hurdles they face.\n\nMedicaid cuts: A recent analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it\u2019s mathematically impossible for House Republicans to meet their own budget targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nPursuing hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts would put swing-district Republicans in a politically precarious position. But abandoning those cuts would anger hard-line conservatives who voted for the budget blueprint to begin the process because they were promised steep spending reductions.\n\nA $4.6 trillion asterisk? Extending Trump\u2019s expiring 2017 tax cuts would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the CBO. And that\u2019s before tackling Trump\u2019s other pursuits, like ending taxes on tips and overtime pay.\n\nTo get around the problem, Republicans are considering a far-reaching accounting change to hide the deficit impact, known as \u201ccurrent policy baseline,\u201d instead of \u201ccurrent law baseline,\u201d which would treat the cost of making Trump\u2019s tax cuts permanent as $0. Democrats are preparing to fight that with the parliamentarian, the in-house referee overseeing the reconciliation process.\n\nHouse-Senate divide: The two chambers adopted conflicting budget resolutions before Trump sided with the House version. On Monday, House GOP leaders called on the Senate to adopt the House measure. But Republican senators are waiting to see whether the House can deliver on the actual bill. Despite the paper-thin House majority, senators are in no mood to let the House dictate the outcome.\n\nDebt limit: The exact date by which Congress will need to act to raise the debt ceiling this year is still unknown. House lawmakers\u2019 budget plan called for a $4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, but they need to pass the reconciliation bill to make it official. That means they\u2019ll have to send the legislation to Trump\u2019s desk before the deadline or risk economic calamity.\n\nRead more from Sahil \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \u27a1\ufe0f Latest from Gaza: Israel is ramping up the risk of \u201call out war\u201d in Gaza as it escalates a renewed bombing campaign .

            "full_content": "Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s not often that the U.S. Supreme Court sees a lawsuit that directly invites it to overturn a long-established precedent. So given the overall atmosphere of authoritarianism and Donald Trump\u2019s very specific and long-standing interest in muzzling media criticism, many legal eagles trembled when Las Vegas casino mogul and Trump donor Steve Wynn petitioned the Court to reverse New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark 1964 decision that insulated the press from libel suits over good-faith criticism of public figures. More specifically, Wynn objected to a Nevada law incorporating the Sullivan standard that requires \u201cclear and compelling evidence\u201d of \u201cactual malice\u201d in libel suits involving public figures. Wynn felt this denied him the right to a jury trial over his claims against the Associated Press for accusing him of sexual misconduct without (he claims) sufficient evidence.\n\nThere were signs that at least two Supreme Court justices were ready to take the plunge on a review of Sullivan, as Adam Liptak observed when Wynn\u2019s petition was filed:\n\nStarting in 2019, Justice Clarence Thomas has repeatedly called for the Supreme Court to reconsider New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark First Amendment decision that made it hard for public officials to prevail in libel suits.\n\nThat project gained momentum in 2021, when Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said the decision \u201chas evolved into an ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods by means and on a scale previously unimaginable.\u201d\n\nCertainly, there was interest in the White House in determining if there was now broader interest among Court conservatives for helping the president activate his repeated threats to \u201copen up the libel laws\u201d to enable legal harassment of his media critics. Trump, as is very well known, was famed for using litigation to intimidate and even bankrupt his adversaries long before he ever ran for public office.\n\nBut now, the Supreme Court has dismissed Wynn\u2019s petition without dissent or comment. The unanimity was the most surprising development, as MSNBC\u2019s Jordan Rubin explained:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising that the court rejected Wynn\u2019s petition. It takes four justices to grant review. What was less clear heading into Monday was whether any of the justices would dissent from the denial. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 two of the court\u2019s six GOP-appointed justices \u2014 have previously questioned the Sullivan precedent, but they didn\u2019t do so on Monday. That doesn\u2019t mean their views have changed or that the precedent will stay on the books forever as challenges to it continue. But Wynn\u2019s rejection is the latest evidence that it isn\u2019t immediately at risk at the high court.\n\nSo it appears Thomas and Gorsuch haven\u2019t made enough progress toward undermining Sullivan among their colleagues to even merit a squawk in this case. This deafening silence represents extraordinarily good news for media folk who have wondered if they will soon get the same sort of harsh treatment being meted out to federal employees and contractors, not to mention noncitizens who thought they had permanent-resident status, at the hands of the second Trump administration. The 47th president may still freak out journalists by singling them out for abuse on Truth Social, and Elon Musk\u2019s vast troll army may menace them on X. But odds are they won\u2019t be hauled into court for saying the emperor has no clothes."

Circuit heard arguments from the Trump administration in its emergency appeal of a lower court ruling, which temporarily blocked its use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nDuring the hearing Monday, Judge Patricia Millett grilled Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign over the timing of the deportations, which sent at least 261 migrants to El Salvador, including more than 100 Venezuelan nationals who were subject to removal \"solely on the basis\" of the law temporarily blocked by the court.\n\n\"The point here was that there were planeloads of people,\" Millett told him. \"There were no procedures in place to notify people.\"\n\n'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO\n\n\n\n\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act than has happened here,\" she said, noting, \"They had hearing boards before people were removed.\"\n\nMillett pressed Ensign over whether the individuals deported under the law had any time to seek relief or challenge their status as a member of the gang in the form of a habeas petition before they were deported.\n\nJUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA\n\nThe government's position was not immediately clear, though Ensign noted they disagreed with the contention that Nazis got better treatment.\n\nCongress passed the Alien Enemies Act immigration law in 1798, and it has since been used only several times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the appeals court plans to issue its ruling.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

Yerlikaya also alleged that weapons were seized during the protests and the individuals detained were found to have ties to different terrorist organizations and prior criminal records.\n\nSome experts believe the move was orchestrated by Erdo\u011fan to sideline the opposition, silence political dissent and increase his own power.\n\n\"This is a dark time for democracy in Turkey, with such a blatantly lawless move to weaponize the justice system to cancel the democratic process,\" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\nTRUMP UNIQUELY PLACED TO \u2018WHISPER\u2019 IN ERDOGAN\u2019S EAR OVER TURKISH REGIONAL AMBITIONS: GREEK DEFENSE MINISTER\n\nBIPARTISAN LEGISLATION SEEKS TO REIN IN ERDO\u011eAN'S TURKEY OVER TIES TO US FOES\n\nIn an address to celebrate the festival of Nowruz on Friday, Erdo\u011fan said Turkey was not a country that was found on the street and will not submit to street terrorism.\n\n\"We will not allow public order to be damaged. We will not give in to vandalism or street terrorism,\" Erdo\u011fan said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) held a symbolic primary vote over the weekend and nominated \u0130mamo\u011flu to be the party\u2019s candidate for president to face Erdo\u011fan in the 2028 elections.\n\nDespite the increased repression and threats to their own safety and security, the Turkish opposition does not yet seem to be backing down.\n\n\"We, as the main opposition party that emerged as the first party in the last local elections in March 2024, will stand firm and resist any kind of oppression by the government,\" \u0130lhan Uzgel, CHP Deputy Chairman for Foreign Policy, told Fox News Digital.\n\nUzgel said Erdo\u011fan seems frightened of losing power, and is urging opposition supporters to take to the streets to defend democracy, challenge lawlessness, and challenge the Erdo\u011fan government's abuse of power.\n\n\"We are happy to see that our people take to the streets despite the occasional use of force by the riot police, and demonstrate peacefully, which is a constitutional right,\" he added.\n\nImamoglu, who is presently jailed and is awaiting trial on corruption charges, was viewed as the most serious challenger to the decades-long rule of Erdo\u011fan. His detention will likely keep him out of the political opposition for the foreseeable future, dealing a huge blow to Turkey\u2019s pro-democracy movement.\n\nTol of the Middle East Institute said Erdo\u011fan is banking on people\u2019s anger dissipating over time and that the mass protests will eventually die down. The election is not scheduled until 2028, and people, Erdo\u011fan hopes, will most likely forget and move on.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe danger, according to Tol, is that street protests in the Middle East and elsewhere tend to go in many different directions, and there is no telling how long the public anger over the arrests will last and how much more popular support the movement will gain.\n\n\u0130mamo\u011flu, member of the secular Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019 and re-elected in 2023. In both elections, he defeated Erdo\u011fan-backed opponents.\n\nTurkey\u2019s problems come at a time when President Trump is reportedly considering lifting sanctions on the NATO member and resuming the sale of F-35 fighter jets following a recent phone call with Erdo\u011fan.\n\nReuters contributed to this article."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS officials reacted with shock\u2014 and in many cases, horror \u2014 to revelations in The Atlantic that top members of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet sent detailed operational plans and other likely highly classified information about US military strikes on Yemen to a group thread on a messaging app to which a reporter had accidentally been added.\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledged the messages, sent over the nongovernment encrypted chat app Signal, seem to be authentic without offering any explanation for why senior officials were discussing national defense information outside of approved classified government systems.\n\nAlmost immediately, senior officials scrambled behind the scenes to review the use of Signal amid concerns that Trump administration officials are relying too heavily on it to conduct sensitive government work \u2013 posing a potentially grave risk to US national security, current and former officials said.\n\nAs soon as the story published, it was blasted out in multiple text threads throughout the Trump administration, with officials reacting with disbelief, according to those who spoke to CNN privately.\n\nMultiple administration officials told CNN they were shocked, with at least two speculating that this could result in the dismissal of one of their colleagues.\n\nAnd career national security officials expressed deep dismay to CNN, noting that having such sensitive conversations on an unclassified platform risked exposing the information to foreign hackers \u2013 and that any other employee who had done so would almost certainly have been immediately fired and probably referred for prosecution.\n\nAccording to the Atlantic, national security adviser Mike Waltz earlier this month convened a text conversation with top US officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to discuss strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen who had been threatening international shipping in the Red Sea. Waltz, apparently accidentally, added Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the chain.\n\nThe messages started with a discussion about when the action should be launched while Goldberg followed along. The strikes were carried out and the principals congratulated themselves on a job well done during a brief after-action discussion before Goldberg removed himself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Jeffrey Goldberg describes moment he realized Trump cabinet group chat about military strikes \u2018might be real\u2019 01:24 - Source: CNN Jeffrey Goldberg describes moment he realized Trump cabinet group chat about military strikes \u2018might be real\u2019 01:24\n\n\u201cDear Sweet Baby Jesus,\u201d said one former senior US official, reacting to the reporting.\n\nHegseth \u2013 who, according to The Atlantic, sent \u201coperational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen\u201d during the course of the conversation \u2013 denied on Monday evening that war plans were discussed over text, despite the Trump administration\u2019s earlier acknowledgement that the messages appeared authentic.\n\n\u201cNobody was texting war plans and that\u2019s all I have to say about that,\u201d Hegseth told reporters when asked why those details were inadvertently shared with Goldberg, after landing at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. The defense secretary also took jabs at the journalist, who he described as \u201cdeceitful and highly discredited.\u201d\n\nSignal is an encrypted messaging app that is popular around the world, including among journalists and government officials. Biden administration officials also routinely used it to discuss logistical planning for meetings and at times to communicate with foreign counterparts.\n\nBut the use of Signal to discuss planning for military operations \u2013 among the most closely guarded secrets the United States has in part because of the potential impact on American service members\u2019 lives \u2013 is a shocking risk to national security, current and former officials said. Multiple officials said they could recall no instance in which Signal was used to communicate classified information or discuss military operations. The top officials on the group chat have access to classified communications systems \u2013 including secure lines in their cars, according to one former senior official \u2013 and they have staff whose job it is to ensure communications of sensitive information remains secure.\n\n\u201cThey broke every procedure known to man about protecting operational material before a military strike,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official. \u201cYou have a total breakdown in security about a military operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d another said, flatly, when asked if there was any analogous use of the app during the Biden administration.\n\nEven as Trump\u2019s press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that he had the \u201cutmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz,\u201d a sense of concern was palpable inside the West Wing and across key agencies as questions emerged over whether new guidance or rules should be put in place for internal communications.\n\n\u201cEveryone is on Signal, all day and night,\u201d one official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations in the West Wing. \u201cThat may well change.\u201d\n\nTrust in the security of Signal is bolstered by the fact that the app is open-source, meaning its code is available for independent experts to scrutinize for vulnerabilities. But like any messaging app with high-value targets, state-backed hackers have tried to find a way into Signal chats \u2013 leaving open the possibility that it may be vulnerable to prying eyes.\n\nA report last month from Google-owned security firm Mandiant found that Russian-linked spies had tried to break into the Signal accounts of Ukrainian military personnel by posing as trusted Signal contacts.\n\nFor now, Trump has given no indication that he plans to fire anyone over the matter. He expressed surprise when asked about the story, telling reporters Monday afternoon, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it. I\u2019m not a big fan of The Atlantic. It\u2019s, to me, it\u2019s a magazine that\u2019s going out of business. I think it\u2019s not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\u201d\n\nBut several Trump administration officials noted that not only was the move seen as a major unforced error with serious national security implications, Trump holds a personal disdain for Goldberg, adding insult to injury in the matter.\n\nWhen the president was briefed Monday afternoon on The Atlantic story, he expressed his contempt for the journalist, two sources familiar with the briefing told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have picked a worse person than Goldberg to add to the chat,\u201d one person close to Trump said.\n\nA mistake that would normally prompt an investigation\n\nUsing a Signal chat to share highly classified information and accidentally including a reporter on the discussion also raises the possibility of violations of federal laws such as the Espionage Act, which makes it a crime to mishandle national defense information. It\u2019s a law that was used in the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of Trump for hoarding classified documents in unauthorized locations such as a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago after leaving his first term.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a mistake such as this would prompt an investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, according to former Justice Department officials.\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely here, in part because some of the top Trump administration officials on the Signal chat would be the ones to ask for such an investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department typically relies on receiving a crime report from the originating agency of the national defense information \u2013 in this case the Defense Department. The senior officials in the discussion also have what\u2019s known as original classification authority, meaning they can downgrade the classification status of the information.\n\nBut if lower-level government officials made a similar mistake, there\u2019s little doubt there would be consequences, including possible loss of their security clearances, current and former officials say. Pentagon regulations specifically state that messaging apps, including Signal, \u201care NOT authorized to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anyone else did it, no question it would be investigated,\u201d a former Justice official said.\n\nThe response amongst Republicans on Capitol Hill was mixed. Sen. John Cornyn, a senior Texas Republican, called it a \u201chuge screw up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there any other way to describe it? I can use a different word but you get the drift,\u201d Cornyn told CNN and other reporters.\n\nHe added: \u201cI would hope the interagency would look at that. It sounds like somebody dropped the ball.\u201d\n\nBut Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson downplayed the significance of the incident, \u201cWhat you did see, though, I think, was top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They\u2019re going to track that down and make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\u2018Somebody needs to get fired\u2019\n\nOver the course of the conversation, Hegseth sent \u201coperational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\u201d according to The Atlantic. Elsewhere in the conversation, CIA Director John Ratcliffe sent \u201cinformation that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\u201d\n\nAll would almost certainly be classified at the highest level, former officials said.\n\n\u201cSomebody needs to get fired,\u201d former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta told CNN. \u201cHow the name of a journalist was added to that list \u2013 this is just a serious blunder,\u201d he said, noting that if it had been someone other Goldberg, they \u201ccould reveal this information immediately to the Houthis in Yemen that they were about to be attacked and they in turn could have\u2026 attacked US facilities in the Red Sea, causing casualties of our troops.\u201d\n\nThe US government has several systems in place to transfer and communicate classified information, including the Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) network and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). Senior government officials, including the defense secretary, vice president, secretary of state, and others have access to these systems at virtually all times, including phones and laptops specifically configured for classified information.\n\nA former senior US defense official said you cannot send secret information from one of these systems to an unclassified network. Hegseth - or someone working for him - would have had to do it manually. The official said this amounts to a blatant mishandling of classified information and an illegal transfer of the material from a classified system to an unclassified network.\n\nHegseth \u201csomehow had to transfer it or copy it to get it onto Signal in the first place,\u201d the official said. \u201cYou can\u2019t forward a classified email to an unclassified system. You would either have to print it out or type it up while looking at both screens. So he had to have done it or somebody would\u2019ve had to have done it for him that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security,\u201d Brian Hughes, National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nVance is quoted in the texts expressing concern about the strikes being a \u201cmistake\u201d and uncertainty that Trump was aware of how strikes on the Houthi rebels would be inconsistent with messaging on Europe.\n\n\u201cI am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There\u2019s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\u201d Vance wrote in the Signal group chat, according to The Atlantic.\n\nTrump administration officials appear to have reacted to that element of the reporting \u2013 not any suggestion that the use of Signal at all for this purpose raised national security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, William Martin, communications director to the vice president, said, \u201cThe Vice President\u2019s first priority is always making sure that the President\u2019s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations. Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration\u2019s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill instantly reacted with outrage, with at least one senior member signaling that he planned to press senior intelligence officials when they appear before Congress at a previously scheduled hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on national security threats on Wednesday. (The same officials, including Ratcliffe, will also appear before a Senate panel on Tuesday.)\n\n\u201cI am horrified by reports that our most senior national security officials, including the heads of multiple agencies, shared sensitive and almost certainly classified information via a commercial messaging application, including imminent war plans,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes, Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, citing the \u201ccalamitous risks of transmitting classified information across unclassified systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf true, these actions are a brazen violation of laws and regulations that exist to protect national security, including the safety of Americans serving in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nSome of the participants in the text chain have in the past railed against the use of nongovernment platforms to conduct sensitive official business.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton put some of the highest, most sensitive intelligence information on her private server because maybe she thinks she\u2019s above the law,\u201d then-Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said at a town hall event in Iowa in 2016. \u201cOr maybe she just wanted the convenience of being able to read this stuff on her Blackberry. This is unacceptable. This is a disqualifier.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Alayna Treene, Josh Campbell, Alex Marquardt, Manu Raju, Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed reporting."

            "full_content": "Trump\u2019s congressional leaders don\u2019t see eye to eye on much. Photo: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nAfter the debacle over Senate passage of a spending bill earlier this month, it\u2019s abundantly clear that congressional Democrats do not have the power to get in the way of Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive 2025 plans. The administration and its own congressional allies now plan to bundle most of his legislative agenda in a budget-reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered, meaning that so long as Republicans stick together, Democrats literally do not have the power to stop it. So far, fear of and loyalty to Trump have kept the GOP in harness on key House and Senate votes.\n\nSo why are the House and Senate moving so slowly toward enactment of that \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d Trump has endorsed? Here\u2019s the problem: The arithmetic of enacting Trump\u2019s tax and spending must-haves without market-terrifying new budget deficits is devilishly difficult, and many small but bright-red devils lurk in the details. The president is famously uninterested in details, so his vague \u201cget it done\u201d injunctions to Republicans on the Hill have not kept them from serious disagreements on those details. The road ahead is long: The House and Senate have passed separate and very different budget resolutions (the blueprint that outlines the numbers and key assumptions behind them) that must be reconciled, and once they are, the House and Senate must pass the same reconciliation bill to send to Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nHere are some of the major issues still dividing them after countless meetings.\n\n.\n\nCongressional budget rules prohibit reconciliation bills that increase the federal budget deficit beyond a ten-year \u201cwindow.\u201d That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s tax cuts in 2017 were designed to expire at the end of 2025. Extending them before year\u2019s end (and adding on tax cuts Trump promised during the 2024 campaign) is the biggest deficit-booster in the whole GOP package this year, and is what\u2019s forcing unpopular domestic-spending cuts. But Senate Republicans, with some private encouragement from the White House, want to make these tax cuts permanent, which would add roughly $4 trillion to the amount of offsetting budget cuts needed to make the arithmetic work out.\n\nSince, if anything, the GOP\u2019s senators are less interested than their House colleagues in deep cuts to popular programs like Medicaid, they came up with a convenient trick: a way of \u201cscoring\u201d tax cuts that makes extending them \u201cfree\u201d from a budget point of view, even though they were very deliberately \u201cscored\u201d as expiring this year when they were enacted.\n\nHouse Republicans didn\u2019t buy this idea in the budget blueprint they passed last month. And deficit-sensitive financial markets (not to mention the Federal Reserve Board) aren\u2019t likely to be fooled, either. Trump will probably have to insist on this crucially important scam if it is to be incorporated in the budget blueprint and the reconciliation bill, and there will definitely be a backlash in the real world that could make it problematic.\n\n.\n\nThe House budget resolution assumes $880 billion in cuts to programs under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee, in which Medicaid looms large. The Senate Budget Committee includes nothing like that level of cuts. House Speaker Mike Johnson has argued that Republicans won\u2019t cut Medicaid benefits, but would go after that familiar phantom menace: \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d As Congress gets closer to the detailed provisions of a reconciliation bill, how cuts will affect actual Medicaid benefits will become clearer and more controversial. And while many Senate Republicans and House members from marginal districts are reluctant to cut Medicaid, the powerful deficit hawks of the House Freedom Caucus are avid for such cuts. Something has to give.\n\n.\n\nCurrent estimates are that the federal government will reach the limit of its borrowing authority (a.k.a. the \u201cdebt limit\u201d) at some point between July and October of this year. A vote to increase or suspend the debt limit is always controversial, particularly for fiscal hawks, some of whom are proud of never having backed such a step. The public isn\u2019t crazy about authorizing new public debt either, although support for the kind of budget cuts or tax increases necessary to reduce existing debt is limited as well.\n\nAnticipating that his agenda would breach the debt limit, Trump abruptly demanded that a suspension or even an abolition of the debt limit be included in the stopgap spending measure Congress was struggling to enact last December. Trump wanted, you see, for this measure to be enacted before he took office, so that Joe Biden would be forced to sign it and receive the blame. But House Republicans rebelled and the bill required to avoid a Christmas government shutdown did not include the debt provision. So now it needs to happen on Trump\u2019s watch.\n\nThe obvious thing to do is to nestle a debt-limit increase or suspension into the giant reconciliation bill that every Republican will be expected to support as a matter of fealty to the 47th president, and indeed, the House-passed budget resolution provided for that measure. But the Senate\u2019s didn\u2019t, and there remains some nervousness that a few House Freedom Caucus debt warriors won\u2019t ultimately go along, threatening the entire Trump agenda. If Republicans decided to drop it from reconciliation, then they will have to risk the possibility of Senate Democrats filibustering it if it comes up as regular legislation.\n\n.\n\nOne complication that represents a completely unprecedented problem is that even as congressional Republicans crawl toward enacting the major fiscal legislation of 2025, Trump\u2019s minions at DOGE (via \u201cefficiency measures\u201d) and OMB (via plans for impoundment of appropriated funds) are racing ahead with unilateral spending cuts in defiance of congressional prerogatives. Whatever they think privately about this fiscal banditry, congressional Republicans have publicly either praised Elon Musk\u2019s and Russell Vought\u2019s power grabs, or fallen silent. On the one hand, it may be politically useful for GOP elected officials to let Trump and his sidekicks take the blame for some of the more unpopular parts of his agenda. On the other, Musk and Vought cannot give the president tax cuts or direct cuts in entitlement benefits (though they can screw up the administration of programs like Social Security, as DOGE is doing energetically).\n\nWith House and Senate Republicans having enough trouble coordinating their actions with each other, taking full account of what Team Trump is doing without them, even as Trump himself declines to give them detailed instructions on legislation, could make life a living hell for Mike Johnson\u2019s and John Thune\u2019s troops. Democrats may not have the power to stop the Trump locomotive, but they can definitely call attention to all the dysfunction and the damage it is causing."

            "full_content": "CNN staffers feel executive Adam Levine got a raw deal when he was stripped of responsibilities on Friday, only two months after taking one \"for the team\" during a high-profile defamation trial.\n\nLevine, who was CNN\u2019s senior vice president of Washington newsgathering and is now SVP Investigative and Washington News served as CNN\u2019s corporate representative in January during the two-week trial that saw the network settle punitive damages after a jury found it committed defamation against U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young. Levine was the only CNN employee to sit in the Panama City, Florida courtroom for the entire trial, which was seen as an uncomfortable situation for the since-relegated executive.\n\n\"He always takes one for the team\u2026 now this,\" the current staffer told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Adam is one of the smartest editorial leaders and hardest workers at CNN. He has been a true leader during some tumultuous times these last few years,\" they added.\n\nJURY FINDS CNN COMMITTED DEFAMATION AGAINST NAVY VETERAN, SETTLEMENT REACHED ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\nCNN announced changes to its politics unit on Friday. The moves, which were first reported by Status and confirmed by Fox News Digital, include Levine losing supervision of the majority of political coverage from Washington to overseeing only two smaller units.\n\nThe staffer, who said \"many of us\" inside the D.C. bureau feel Levine deserves better, added that there is no animosity toward new SVP Editorial Strategy and News Phil Rucker, who will assume many of Levine\u2019s responsibilities after joining CNN from the Washington Post earlier this year. The CNN employees simply feel Levine is being treated unfairly.\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen him make so many sacrifices for the good of CNN,\" the staffer said, adding that Levine is \"brilliant\" and \"deserves much respect.\"\n\nCNN has given no indication the restructuring is related to the defamation trial.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJanuary\u2019s defamation trial saw a six-person jury rule that CNN defamed Young and was responsible for punitive damages after he successfully alleged the network smeared him by implying he illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan on the \"black market\" during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021.\n\nAs the jury was gearing up to determine punitive damages, 14th Judicial Circuit Court Judge William S. Henry announced that Young and CNN had reached a settlement for the amount that would be awarded to the Navy veteran.\n\nCNN DEFAMATION TRIAL: LOSING CASE EXPECTED BUT STILL A BAD BRUISE FOR THE NETWORK, INSIDER SAYS\n\nThe settlement amount was not disclosed. The settlement announcement came after an expert witness suggested $150 million was a fair amount to punish CNN. During the explosive trial, Levine testified that an on-air apology CNN offered to Young was only issued for legal purposes.\n\n\"We felt in order to resolve the legal discussion at hand, a correction was due, or at least our legal department felt that way, I should say,\" Levine said.\n\nLevine acknowledged that the apology was made in hopes for the network to quash the \"potential for a lawsuit\" by Young, but spent several minutes dodging questions about whether CNN thought Young's concern was \"reasonable\" enough to issue the apology.\n\n\"This was a decision made for legal reasons, and the correction was issued at the direction of our legal department,\" Levine said. \"So, CNN thinks that the decision by the legal department was the right one for the company based on them being our legal department.\"\n\nCNN DEFAMATION JUROR WOULD HAVE AWARDED NAVY VETERAN \u2018UP TO $100 MILLION\u2019 BEFORE SETTLEMENT WAS REACHED\n\nYoung himself believes Levine probably \"expected better\" from CNN after being put in such a tough spot.\n\n\"I imagine he probably feels slighted considering the amount of fire he took for CNN during my trial,\" Young told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"He had to sit there on the witness stand, across from the jury and testify under oath that CNN did nothing wrong, and as their corporate representative he stands behind their story and conduct. He was also put in the impossible position of retracting CNN's apology to me and admitting it was only a legal maneuver to try to mitigate damages,\" Young continued. \"My impression was that Levine was simply toeing CNN's unbelievable narrative during my trial, and he probably expected better treatment for his loyalty, even though his effort to mitigate failed miserably.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital\u2019s Joseph A.

Photo: Christian Klindt Soelbeck/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s expansionist dreams have become a hallmark of his second term. The president continues to advocate for the annexation of Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal despite the strong opposition of the involved citizens and their leaders.\n\nThe administration has announced its plans to send a delegation to Greenland in the coming days, which will include Trump\u2019s national security adviser Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Second Lady Usha Vance. According to the New York Times, Vance is set to make a number of cultural stops, including attending a national dogsled race, while Waltz and Wright are expected to visit a U.S. military base.\n\nIn the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq, outgoing Greenland prime minister Mute Egede blasted the scheduled trip as\ufeff \u201chighly aggressive,\u201d labeling it a clear attempt by the United States to flex its power as Trump threatens to take over the island. \u201cWhat is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,\u201d Egede said, per CNN. \u201cHis mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump\u2019s mission \u2014 and the pressure will increase.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is poised to succeed Egede as prime minister, also rejected Trump\u2019s calls to annex Greenland. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be Americans. No, we don\u2019t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders, and we want our own independence in the future,\u201d Nielsen said, per The Guardian. \u201cAnd we want to build our own country by ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe issue has even united the five political parties in Greenland\u2019s parliament with the leaders issuing a joint statement against Greenland becoming part of the United States. \u201cWe \u2014 all party chairmen \u2014 cannot accept the repeated statements on annexation and control of Greenland,\u201d they said. \u201cWe, as party chairmen, find this conduct unacceptable to friends and allies in a defense alliance.\u201d Residents of Greenland also appear opposed to the administration\u2019s threats of annexation. A January poll found that 85 percent of Greenlanders are against the island becoming a part of the United States with only 6 percent of respondents in favor, according to Reuters.\n\nVance\u2019s visit comes as her husband, Vice-President J.D. Vance, has echoed Trump\u2019s position on Greenland while escalating tensions with Denmark, which controls the territory. In a Fox News interview, Vance accused Denmark of not being a \u201cgood ally\u201d and suggested that controlling Greenland was a matter of national security. \u201cSo you have to ask yourself: How are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security?\u201d the vice-president said, per the Associated Press. \u201cIf that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn\u2019t care about what the Europeans scream at us.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s focus on Greenland dates back to his first term, when he floated the idea of buying the island from Denmark. In January, the president paired his announcement of Ken Howery as his nominee to serve as U.S. ambassador to Denmark with a blunt call for annexation. \u201cFor purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social."

Vance and his best friend and boss, Donald Trump, do not march in lockstep.\n\nIn a jaw-dropping report today from The Atlantic, editor Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that earlier this month he was added to a private Signal chat group with senior Trump officials called \u201cHouthi PC small group.\u201d The members appeared to include Tulsi Gabbard, Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance, and senior representatives across various government agencies. They had gathered to debate the merits of doing some bombing in Yemen. (They then did the bombing, which was when Goldberg realized the group chat was real.)\n\nApart from everything that\u2019s notable about that, also J.D. Vance disagreed with Trump in the group chat. The person who appeared to be Vance wrote that delaying bombing in Yemen might be best:\n\nI am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There\u2019s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\n\nFor ten days now, the U.S. has stepped up bombing Yemen, with the stated goals of preventing further attacks in shipping lanes in the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. (We have low-key been at war with the region since January, 2024; President Biden had also bombed lots of people.) Vance\u2019s point was that, while the U.S. does ship plenty of material through those lanes, it is a small percentage of our total intake, compared to Europe at large. \u201c3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real risk that the public doesn\u2019t understand this or why it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just hate bailing Europe out again,\u201d he added to the person who appeared to be Pete Hegseth, the secretary of Defense.\n\nHegseth agreed that Europe sucks. \u201cI fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It\u2019s PATHETIC,\u201d Hegseth wrote. But, he pointed out, America was the only power that could get it done. A few days ago, Hegseth committed a second Navy carrier group to the region. Bombings will continue until Americans understand we\u2019re doing it for them, not those idiots in Europe."

Photo: Thomas Peipert/AP Photo\n\nBetween bullying America\u2019s allies, harassing federal judges, and acting as an amateur Tesla salesman, Donald Trump has a lot on his plate. But the president took a break from his busy schedule to complain about a portrait of him that\u2019s been hanging in the Colorado State Capitol for five years.\n\nIn a Sunday night Truth Social post, Trump said his portrait in the Colorado State Capitol \u201cwas purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.\u201d\n\nTrump said that the same artist painted Barack Obama and \u201che looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst.\u201d\n\nThe president then attacked the state\u2019s governor, while asking that he do him a favor and take the portrait down. Trump claimed that \u201cmany people from Colorado have called and written to complain,\u201d so \u201cI am speaking on their behalf to the Radical Left Governor, Jared Polis, who is extremely weak on Crime \u2026 to take it down. Jared should be ashamed of himself!\u201d\n\nTrump followed up by posting his two official White House portraits, presumably because he\u2019d prefer that we picture him either smiling and eight years younger, or giving \u201cmenacing AI mug shot\u201d vibes.\n\nTrump did not explain why he\u2019s raising this issue now. Nor did he provide any evidence that people have complained about the painting, or that the artist, Sarah Boardman, \u201cpurposely distorted\u201d his image. The Trump portrait project was already underway when Governor Polis assumed office in January 2019, and it initially didn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d be giving into Trump\u2019s demand. A Polis spokesperson told The Hill:\n\nGov. Polis was surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork. The State Capitol was completed in 1901, and features Rose Onyx and White Yule Marble mined in Colorado, and includes portraits of former Presidents and former governors. We appreciate the President and everyone\u2019s interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience.\n\nBut later in the day the AP reported that the painting is coming down:\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump portrait to be taken down at Colorado Capitol after president claimed it was \"distorted.\" \u2014 Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) March 24, 2025\n\nWhile this certainly isn\u2019t the most flattering portrait, it seems everyone involved was actually trying to treat Trump like a normal president. The effort to add Trump to the state Capitol\u2019s Gallery of Presidents was led and approved by Republican state officials, as 9 News Denver reported:\n\nRepublican-led efforts to get Trump\u2019s painting hung on the Colorado Capitol wall began in the summer of 2018. Republican State Sen. Kevin Grantham raised $10,000 in a few hours on GoFundMe for the portrait.\n\nThe painting, which was approved by Colorado Republicans, was put up in August 2019 at an event hosted by the Colorado Senate Republicans and artist Sarah A. Boardman. The unveiling event was described as nonpartisan in a Facebook post.\n\nNothing on the Colorado-based artist\u2019s website or Facebook page is partisan. And while Trump accused Boardman of making him look much worse than his predecessors, her portraits of Barack Obama and George W. Bush are also a tad jowly:\n\nPresident Obama, 20 x 24 inches, oil on canvas. This was a commission by the State of Denver, and hangs in the State Capitol Building, Rotunda (3rd floor) Gallery of Presidents. Posted by Sarah A. Boardman, Portraits on Thursday, April 5, 2012\n\nThe speeches at the unveiling of Trump\u2019s portrait on August 1, 2019, emphasized unity and bipartisanship. Boardman said she was striving to make Trump look \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy portrait of President Trump has been called thoughtful, non-confrontational, not angry, not happy, not mad, not tweeting,\u201d she said, drawing chuckles from the audience.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason for that is because in today\u2019s environment it\u2019s all very up front. But in five, 10, 15, 20 years, he will be another president on the wall with his own historical background and he needs to look neutral,\u201d she continued.\n\nIronically, during the same event, the Republican state senator who spearheaded the portrait project, Kevin Grantham, said that regardless of political party, the unveiling \u201creminds us of the ideals we hold so dear as Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2019, there are still nations across this globe that are led by those who rule simply by the force and fear they command. Leaders that do not allow dissent and do not allow critique,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether this portrait bring a smile or a scowl to your face, remember that you have the right to do so because this is the United States of America.\u201d\n\nWell, that America was nice while it lasted!\n\nThis post has been updated."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to put on hold a federal judge\u2019s ruling reinstating thousands of probationary federal employees who were fired as part of the government\u2019s efforts to quickly downsize its workforce.\n\nThe emergency appeal is the administration\u2019s latest attempt to get the nation\u2019s highest court to intervene on its behalf as lower courts frustrate \u2013 even on a temporary basis \u2013 key parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term agenda.\n\nIn the case at hand, a federal judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month that required half a dozen federal agencies to \u201cimmediately\u201d offer over 16,000 probationary employees their jobs back.\n\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s extraordinarily overbroad remedy is now inflicting ongoing, irreparable harm on the Executive Branch that warrants this Court\u2019s urgent intervention,\u201d acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers.\n\nHarris went on to say that the ruling from US District Judge William Alsup \u201chas compelled the government to embark on the massive administrative undertaking of reinstating, and onboarding to full duty status, thousands of terminated employees in the span of a few days.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s request comes as the federal appeals court based in San Francisco is considering a similar emergency appeal from the administration. That appeal was filed on March 14.\n\n\u201cEvery additional day the injunction remains in effect is a day that six executive agencies are effectively under the district court\u2019s receivership, necessitating immediate relief from this Court,\u201d Harris argued.\n\nAlsup\u2019s ruling was one of the rare wins for federal labor groups challenging the administration\u2019s efforts to cull its workforce. Though other federal judges declined to stop a wave of firings in the opening weeks of Trump\u2019s second term, Alsup said he was making his decision because he believed the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.\n\n\u201cEach agency had (and still has) discretion to hire and fire its own employees. Here, the agencies were directed by OPM to fire all probationary employees, and they executed that directive. To staunch the irreparable harms to organizational plaintiffs caused by OPM unlawfully slashing other agency\u2019s staff required immediately reinstating those employees,\u201d Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by labor unions and others challenging OPM\u2019s role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.\n\nThe Trump administration has been targeting probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While they generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can if the action stemmed from \u201cpartisan political reasons\u201d or \u201cmarriage status.\u201d\n\nHarris told the high court that \u201csome\u201d of the fired probationary employees have filed complaints with the Office of Special Counsel and argued that Alsup\u2019s ruling ran headfirst into the administrative avenues set up by Congress to address such terminations.\n\n\u201cDeclaring open season on challenges to federal personnel management is especially unsound because Congress has created an entirely different framework for resolving legal challenges to the terminations of federal employees,\u201d she wrote, adding that allowing the unions \u201cto head straight to district court and raise claims that the affected federal employees themselves cannot raise would upend that entire process.\u201d\n\nNorm Eisen, representing the plaintiffs as part of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, said the court will uphold Alsup\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration illegally terminated tens of thousands of federal employees, as duly noted by Judge Alsup,\u201d Eisen said in a statement. \u201cThe administration\u2019s efforts to block relief have so far failed and now they are turning to the Supreme Court \u2013 baselessly.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comment."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 Congress returns Monday from a weeklong recess as the fallout continues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's move to help Republicans advance a controversial spending bill earlier this month to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nAs lawmakers left Washington following many weeks in session, a recess that Democrats initially hoped would be marked by a show of force against the Trump administration and Republican control of Washington was punctuated by handwringing over the party's direction \u2014 and questions about its leadership.\n\nDemocrats remained mum as they left Washington in the aftermath of the tense funding fight. And at town halls from Colorado to California, Democrats sidestepped questions about Schumer's decision and his leadership of the upper chamber more broadly, previewing a messy return to Washington as the party contends with its divisions.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, dodged a question about Schumer being replaced as leader last week, before pivoting to former President Joe Biden and urging that \"it's important for people to know, you know, when it's time to go.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) walks in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol on March 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images\n\n\"We're going to have conversations I'm sure in the foreseeable future about all the Democratic leadership,\" Bennet said at a town hall in Golden, Colorado.\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland became the first Democratic lawmaker to openly call for new Senate leadership at a town hall last week, saying that though he respects Schumer and his long tenure in Washington, \"it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward.\" Rep. Delia Ramirez followed suit at a town hall in Chicago last week. And progressive youth groups joined in on the criticism, urging Schumer in a letter obtained by CBS News to \"fight for us or step aside.\"\n\nStill, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who initially opted not to comment when asked whether he was confident in Schumer's leadership, weighed in with support for Schumer last week. And Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi echoed the confidence in Schumer's leadership, though she delivered a stinging rebuke.\n\n\"I myself don't give away anything for nothing,\" Pelosi said. \"And I think that's what happened the other day.\"\n\nSchumer had initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded after the House passed the measure in a narrow vote that came as a surprise to some. But a day later, Schumer reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage.\n\nThe New York Democrat has stood by his decision, while arguing that he remains the \"best leader for the Senate.\" He told \"CBS Mornings\" last week that as bad as the founding bill was, \"a shutdown is 10 times worse.\" On Sunday, he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he's not stepping down.\n\nThe backlash against Schumer has come as Democrats contend with the party's direction and approach more broadly after the 2024 elections delivered bruising defeats up and down the ballot.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, shifted the blame away from Schumer, saying on CNN last week that although \"no one is in the caucus\" is more critical of the minority leader than he is, \"it's not Schumer\u2026 it's the Democratic party.\"\n\nLater in the week, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez held a rally in Las Vegas. In an interview with CBS News at the rally, the Vermont independent said the \"Democratic party has not been the kind of party we need to represent the working class of this country in so many ways.\"\n\n\"There is no reason why we have massive income and wealth inequality, why we're the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,\" Sanders added.\n\nAcross a number of town halls last week, constituents turned the focus from possible threats to Medicaid under GOP control of Washington to criticism of the Democratic Party itself.\n\nDuring a town hall held by Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego in Arizona last week, one constituent questioned the party's overall messaging strategy, suggesting they should get \"dirtier\" with their approach against Republicans.\n\n\"They fight dirtier and we are not willing to get in the mud with them,\" the constituent said. \"Maybe it's time we start getting a little bit dirtier with our messaging.\"\n\nand contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map that was used in the 2024 elections and includes two majority-Black districts.\n\nThe dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the recrafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.\n\nIt was unclear following arguments whether the high court was inclined to preserve Louisiana's map for use in future elections. New district lines are drawn after every Census.\n\nThe justices have in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities \u2014 mostly Southern \u2014 with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.\n\nBut in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.\n\nThe latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.\n\n\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting.\n\nThe dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"\n\nThe case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's six congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.\n\nThat initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.\n\nThe judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its six districts had to be majority-Black.\n\nThe plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.\n\nIt did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.\n\nShortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nA divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.\n\n\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"\n\nThe first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.\n\nIn filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nBut as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.\n\nThe state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.\n\n\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"\n\nBut during the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned how the high court is supposed to reconcile the state's acknowledgement that it took race into consideration to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act with the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\"How do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role [in our laws]?\" he asked.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts also highlighted the shape of District 6, which he said runs from one corner of the state to another, \"picking up Black populations as it goes along.\"\n\nBut several of the liberal justices appeared to support Louisiana's argument that it was motivated by politics when it drew the lines of District 6, and decided to draw its own map to protect incumbent lawmakers rather than continue with litigation and risk the district court implementing its own voting lines.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan said state lawmakers had good reason to create a second majority-minor district, given the lower court's order, and implemented a map that reflected its political considerations.\n\n\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room\" when drawing voting boundaries, she said.\n\nIn their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.\n\nThey also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.\n\n\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"\n\nNo other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and his view was not raised during the arguments. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.\n\nSarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.\n\n\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.\n\nOn the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's six House seats.\n\nDistrict 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"\n\nThey also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.\n\n\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.\n\nA decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June."

            "full_content": "London CNN \u2014\n\nMoya O\u2019Sullivan looked in her cabinets, and saw a problem: her cream cheese, toothpaste, mouthwash, whiskey and soft drinks were all American. They had to go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not buying Philadelphia (cream) cheese anymore,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan tells CNN. \u201cNo more Oreos either.\u201d Oral-B and Listerine have been replaced in her bathroom closet, while Jack Daniel\u2019s and Coca-Cola have been banished from her drinks cabinet.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan, 29, teaches history and English to pupils in Kilkenny, southern Ireland. But by changing her shopping list, she\u2019s hoping to school the 77 million Americans who voted to elect President Donald Trump to a second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to me to see that half of America would choose (Trump),\u201d she says.\n\nSlipping into a voice more commonly heard in a classroom, she adds: \u201cThe Americans didn\u2019t learn their lesson the first time. There unfortunately do need to be consequences.\u201d\n\nAs the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with the European Union intensifies, a ripple of reciprocal, economic nationalism is percolating across Europe; and O\u2019Sullivan is part of a small but dedicated group hoping to hurt the United States with their wallets.\n\nJames Blackledge and Moya O\u2019Sullivan are avoiding American products, hoping to send a message across the Atlantic. James Blackledge/Moya O\u2019Sullivan\n\nTrump has said that as of April 2, a slew of new tariffs will be announced on goods coming to the US from all over the globe as part of his package of reciprocal tariffs. The EU is primed to unleash countermeasures of its own, including higher tariffs on American whiskey, motorcycles, beer, poultry, beef, and produce such as soybeans, tomatoes and raspberries.\n\nBut protesting the Trump administration is a tougher sell in Europe than it was eight years ago. Europe\u2019s leaders have taken great pains to build bridges with Trump, eager to avoid the brunt of his tariffs regime, or guide him towards acceptable outcomes in Ukraine and Gaza. And there\u2019s fatigue in the air. \u201cMany people are just a bit exhausted this time around,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan concedes.\n\n\u201cThe first time (Trump\u2019s election) happened, people were outraged, and they thought they could fight back against it and win,\u201d says Zoe Gardner, a spokesperson for the UK-based protest group Stop Trump Coalition. Now, \u201cpeople feel much more beaten down,\u201d she tells CNN. \u201cPeople feel less confident in their ability to oppose this.\u201d\n\nDo boycotts work?\n\nJames Blackledge, a 33-year-old postman in Bristol, England, has made sacrifices too. Like O\u2019Sullivan, he\u2019s turned to a locally-made \u2013 if more expensive \u2013 alternative to Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a mayo monster,\u201d he admits, but he\u2019s stopped buying Hellmann\u2019s and started making his own: \u201cI\u2019ve got a little blender, it\u2019s quite easy to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to get a coffee from McDonald\u2019s every now and then, which I don\u2019t do,\u201d he adds. Sierra Nevada beers are down the drain too. And he\u2019s not alone. \u201cA lot of my friends, who I\u2019ve mentioned this to, say they\u2019ve been doing it already for a while,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d already stopped (buying US products) when Trump was elected.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Sullivan and Blackledge aren\u2019t screaming into a void; their anger is shared by many on message boards and forums, and both have exchanged ideas online about how to make their points.\n\nA price tag marked with a small black star in a Danish supermarket, indicating that the products are EU-produced. Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd the hunger to fight back against American corporations is evident. Denmark\u2019s largest retailer , the Salling Group, introduced black, star-shaped stickers to supermarket labels earlier this month that indicate whether a product was made in Europe. Trump\u2019s threats to annex Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, have particularly angered Danes.\n\n\u201cWe have recently received a number of inquiries from customers who want to buy groceries from European brands,\u201d Salling Group chief executive Anders Hagh wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cOur stores will continue to have brands on the shelves from all over the world, and it will always be up to customers to choose.\u201d\n\nA Swedish Facebook group calling for people to boycott American goods has 81,000 members; a Danish equivalent has 90,000. Every hour, people ask whether their dog food, soda, cheese or chocolate is connected to the US and look for alternatives.\n\nIt is too early in Trump\u2019s administration to tell whether these efforts will impact the exports of American-made staples to Europe. The early economic protests across Europe are ad-hoc and haven\u2019t taken hold among a significant segment of the population, but the looming threat of new tariffs has hardened the resolve of some groups and organizations to buy EU-produced items over American versions .\n\nPrevious, more widespread economic boycotts in Europe, like recent campaigns to avoid companies with ties to Russia and Israel in the wake of their offensives in Ukraine and Gaza, have recruited willing disciples and claim success in prompting some companies to cut their ties with those countries, but deciphering their economic impact is difficult.\n\n\u201cInternational conflicts often provoke boycott calls targeted at a foreign adversary, but whether consumers actually participate has been an enduring puzzle,\u201d researchers at the University of Virginia wrote in a 2016 study. Their work did indeed find that in the US, consumers \u201creduced their purchases of French-sounding supermarket brands\u201d in the wake of a dispute between Washington and Paris over the war in Iraq.\n\nAnother study, which analyzed boycott movements in the US between 1990 and 2005, found that these efforts can impact companies\u2019 reputation even if they don\u2019t hurt their bottom line.\n\nBut whether or not it takes hold, O\u2019Sullivan is undeterred when it comes to Trump. \u201cWe vote with our money \u2026 Even if it makes no difference, I just don\u2019t want my money going to support his economy.\u201d\n\nTargeting Tesla\n\nTrump remains broadly unpopular in Europe, and polling suggests his election win has hurt the continent\u2019s sentiment towards America. But the huge demonstrations that greeted the president on his travels to the continent in his first term have been replaced by piecemeal protests more visible in kitchen cabinets than on city sidewalks.\n\nIn London, a gigantic demonstration gripped the city on the eve of the president\u2019s visit in 2018; around 250,000 people showed up, according to organizers, while an orange-hued, 20-foot tall \u201cTrump Baby\u201d balloon, depicting the president clutching a mobile phone and sporting a giant diaper, sailed in the skies overhead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether the same numbers would come out of one event this time,\u201d admits Gardner, of the Stop Trump Coalition, which organized that protest and has re-formed since Trump\u2019s re-election to shepherd British opposition to the administration.\n\nInstead, demonstrators are trying to get creative. Protests have been organized outside Tesla showrooms in the UK, to oppose owner Elon Musk\u2019s involvement in the administration. But fewer than 20 people showed up to one event on Saturday in Leeds, northern England, according to photos published by organizers, illustrating the struggle to mobilize Brits so far in Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nA massive protest clogged London's streets when Trump visited in 2018. But organizers admit it would be difficult to attract a similarly large crowd this time. Yves Herman/Reuters\n\nSales of Tesla have declined in Europe since Trump took charge \u2013 Tesla registered just 9,913 new units in January across the continent, down from 18,121 last January, according to automotive analysis firm JATO \u2013 though the group noted that the upcoming release of its updated Model Y would likely help sales rebound.\n\nTrump is set to visit the UK on a second state visit soon; this time, the invitation from King Charles III was gleefully unfurled by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, in the White House, and was met with tacit acceptance back home.\n\nBut outbursts in Washington are awakening anger in Europe. \u201cThat meeting (with Volodymyr Zelensky) in the Oval Office was a real flashpoint of disgust, and people felt like they needed to do something,\u201d notes Gardner, who says Trump\u2019s furious tirade against the Ukrainian president prompted a surge in emails and calls to the anti-Trump group.\n\nThe next day, the right-leaning Daily Mail tabloid led its front page on calls to \u201cStop the state visit for \u2018bully\u2019 Trump\u201d \u2013 a surprising rallying cry for a paper that is more sympathetic to his brand of politics than most British outlets.\n\nGardner has supported economic boycotts on US goods, and says she no longer shops on Amazon, though she acknowledged that she organizes protests with fellow anti-Trump activists on WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by US tech giant Meta. \u201cThere are contradictions in this, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a worthwhile thing to do,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd there is one more tool always available to Trump\u2019s critics on the continent: provocation. \u201cGive us back the Statue of Liberty,\u201d Raphael Glucksmann, a French member of the European Parliament who represents the small left-wing party Place Publique, said during a rally at the weekend. \u201cIt was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty. The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone,\u201d he said later on X. \u201cAnd if the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.\u201d"

Trump rescinded the order against Paul Weiss last week after the firm struck a deal with the president. David Laufman, a former head of the DOJ\u2019s counterintelligence section who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, described the move as \u201can authoritarian plan to silence and punish the legal profession\u201d that would have triggered swift intervention.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s chilling the very sector of society that stands between Trump and tyranny,\u201d said a former federal prosecutor and senior lawyer at a law firm that has sued the administration.\n\nLegal experts accused Trump of hypocrisy, noting that his own lawyers have violated Rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure, which bars lawyers from making false or frivolous claims in court, when falsely saying Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance will travel to Greenland this week along with two other administration officials as Trump ramps up calls for U.S. ownership of the Danish territory.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress is eyeing an April deadline to pass Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar agenda, which includes extending his 2017 tax cuts and a debt ceiling increase.\n\nIn an unusual case before the Supreme Court today, civil rights groups are in a tentative alliance with Republican officials to defend a Louisiana congressional map that includes two majority Black districts.\n\nWildfires burn in the Carolinas\n\nWildfires feeding on dry woodlands that were damaged by Hurricane Helene last year have together burned thousands of acres in North Carolina and South Carolina over the weekend. Despite possible rain in the region today, federal forecasters warn that fire weather could return this week.\n\nA trio of fires is burning in Polk County, in the western part of North Carolina. The Black Cover Fire was more than 2,000 acres as of Sunday afternoon and 0% contained, while evacuations were ordered for some residents in the area, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Deep Woods Fire nearby has burned more than 2,500 acres and was 0% contained. And the Fish Hook Fire has burned 199 acres and was 50% contained. In South Carolina, a fire is burning in Table Rock State Park, in the northern part of the state.

            "full_content": "The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will hear oral arguments Monday on whether a lower court can properly address the Trump administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan nationals via a 1798 wartime law.\n\nThe administration asked for a stay pending appeal shortly after an initial March 15 order was issued, calling it a \"massive, unauthorized imposition on the Executive\u2019s authority to remove dangerous aliens who pose threats to the American people.\"\n\nThe Trump administration had attempted to invoke a 1798 wartime authority to deport Venezuelan nationals , including alleged members of the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA), for a period of 14 days.\n\nCOURT ORDER HALTING DEPORTATION FLIGHTS \u2018UNCONSTITUTIONALLY IMPEDES\u2019 EXECUTIVE BRANCH, TRUMP ALLIES ARGUE\n\nLast week, Obama-appointed, D.C.-based Judge James Boasberg issued an order to immediately halt any planned deportations of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador. A plane carrying hundreds of U.S. migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed under the law, arrived in El Salvador hours later despite the order.\n\nBoasberg held a Monday evening fact-finding hearing, where he ordered the Trump administration to submit more information on the flights, including information on how planes departed the U.S. that were carrying any people who were deported \"solely on the basis\" of that proclamation, how many individuals were on each plane, where the planes landed and what time each plane took off from the U.S., and from where.\n\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS FEDERAL JUDGE IT MIGHT INVOKE STATE SECRETS ACT ON HIGH-PROFILE DEPORTATION CASE\n\nBoasberg imposed a Tuesday noon deadline to submit the information and also ordered the parties to appear in court again on Friday.\n\nIn a reply brief submitted to the D.C. Circuit on Wednesday, the government said \"the district court is continuing to attempt to pry sensitive information from the Government. All of the district court\u2019s orders should be stayed, and the Executive Branch\u2019s standing as a coequal branch of Government should be respected.\"\n\nThe Trump administration called the additional requests \"intrusive inquiries that could hamper negotiations in the future.\"\n\nThe government repeatedly failed to comply with the order to submit additional information, citing national security issues. Boasberg then said the government could submit the information under seal by Thursday.\n\nJUDICIAL HALT OF DEPORTATION FLIGHTS PUTS US FOREIGN POLICY AT RISK, CAREER STATE DEPT OFFICIAL CLAIMS\n\nIn a Thursday evening order, Boasberg slammed the administration after it missed his deadline, saying it \"again evaded its obligations\" to submit the requested information.\n\nBoasberg wrote in his order that the government had, instead, sent a six-paragraph declaration from a regional ICE office director in Harlingen, Texas, which notified the court that Cabinet secretaries are \"actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets [act] privileges over the other facts requested by the Court\u2019s order.\"\n\nBoasberg called the submission \"woefully insufficient.\"\n\nJudges Karen Henderson, Patricia Millett and Justin Walker will preside over the Monday oral arguments. Two of the three judges were nominated by Republican presidents, with Henderson appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 and Walker by Trump in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMillett was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013.\n\nFox News Digital's Breanne Deppisch and David Spunt contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Denton in 2016. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: AP Images\n\nIf \u00e9minences grises like Graydon Carter embody the glory days of New York print media in the 1980s and \u201990s, Nick Denton is perhaps the prime avatar of the city\u2019s freewheeling early digital media era. Denton founded Gawker Media in 2002, and oversaw its expansion into a profitable mini-media empire over the next decade. At its height, the company employed a raft of now-name-brand journalists, and its rambunctious flagship site was mandatory reading for the city\u2019s elites and creative underclass. It all came crashing down in baroque fashion in 2016, when Hulk Hogan \u2014 backed by a long-aggrieved Peter Thiel \u2014 sued Gawker.com out of existence.\n\nDenton has kept a generally low profile since then, but recently he has popped his head back into the fray. On his X feed, he has been sounding off on what he sees as an inevitable decline in the dollar, and a corresponding rise in China\u2019s fortunes. He is backing up his pessimism on America\u2019s near-term prospects by selling his SoHo apartment, once a new-media mecca and party hub, and moving to Hungary, where he has family roots, with his husband and two children. I spoke with Denton in a wide-ranging conversation about why he was \u201cashamed\u201d of Gawker by the end, why he\u2019s so bearish on America right now, and what his new life in Budapest will look like.\n\nYou\u2019re leaving New York \u2014 that\u2019s big. You\u2019ve been here for 23 years, I think?\n\nActually, we went away for Trump One.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize that.\n\nSo I guess unlike a lot of people who say \u201cIf he wins, we\u2019re leaving \u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re one of the few who mean it.\n\nI think my timing has actually been almost perfect. I left in December 2016. I obviously had some special circumstances there because of my opponent in the legal battle over Gawker, who is now pretty much one of the most powerful men in the States \u2014 Trump\u2019s biggest Silicon Valley backer, Peter Thiel. And then I guess this time I\u2019ve been a little slower off the mark. It\u2019s only \u2014 what, two months into Trump Two?\n\nAn interior of Denton\u2019s apartment, which went on sale last week. Photo: Courtesy the subject\n\nSo you really can\u2019t abide living in America while Trump is president?\n\nI\u2019m actually not as anti-Trump as some people. I don\u2019t think that what\u2019s going on now is all down to Trump. This is a lot of chickens from a lot of administrations coming to roost. It\u2019s pretty much the culmination of 25 years of delayed decisions and delayed reform. I\u2019m a former financial journalist. I was with the Financial Times and the Economist, and I don\u2019t see any way for equilibrium to be restored without a dollar devaluation. The dollar should not be six reais to the dollar; it should probably be about three or four reais, which is what it was 20 years ago.\n\nThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve been tweeting quite a bit about. Tell me a little more about where you see things going, financially speaking.\n\nWell, to my mind, the last significant correction was 2000 and the dot-com crash. That was a true purge of the system. It was certainly a purge of excess and enthusiasm for the internet, but I always remained enthusiastic about the internet. And I was always convinced that it was real, despite the disillusionment of 2001, 2002, 2003. I guess it was three or four years before it came back with Flickr and other companies like that. So I still remained a believer, but it was definitely a purge of the excess and the speculative excesses of Cisco being an incredibly highly valued company. I don\u2019t know whether you remember that time?\n\nSure, Pets.com and so forth.\n\nIt was even crazier than the AI-driven boom and the Big Seven. And it was purged. I\u2019m a market guy. I believe in the cycles, and the cycles have to be allowed to cycle. And that was the last time, to my mind, that that was the case. Every single correction since then has been met very quickly with reinflation of the economy, as if the American political system cannot abide any significant or sustained decline in the S&P. Everything is so wrapped up in stock-market valuations. Every single administration \u2014 its credibility depends on stock-market appreciation. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen since then, not even in 2008, a true purge of the system.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying there\u2019s artificially inflated stuff in the market that should be purged and hasn\u2019t been?\n\nYes. Correct.\n\nAnd now it might be happening?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I kind of doubt it. Scott Bessent talks about the economy being brittle, needing a \u201cdetox\u201d period. Things get ahead of themselves and then you need to restore equilibrium. But they\u2019re pursuing it through this kind of slapdash, haphazard austerity that Musk is in charge of, which doesn\u2019t feel to me like it has a broad base of political support.\n\nIt obviously has support among the tech right, but the tech right is just a small part of the Trump coalition. And I don\u2019t believe that the hillbillies are into this, and I don\u2019t believe that the Mar-a-Lago crowd are into this at all. And ultimately, I don\u2019t believe that Trump will be into this, even if he is attached to Musk at the hip. Did you see Tara Palmeri\u2019s reporting about how they are avoiding even polling Musk\u2019s numbers? They\u2019re actually suppressing the data, because if the data came out, it would be devastating for the administration and certainly for the Trump-Musk axis. My theory, and Michael Wolff\u2019s working theory, and anybody who\u2019s followed Trump through the years, in politics and outside of politics \u2014 is that eventually Trump dumps everybody. If someone is weighing him down politically, ultimately, even if he behaves like he\u2019s Lil\u2019 X\u2019s grandfather, even if he is the father that Musk never had, when it comes down to it, Trump will choose himself over his allies. Musk is not the only force within the administration \u2014 there\u2019s a triangle, and Vance represents a significant part of the coalition. And Trump himself represents, I guess, the boomer, Mar-a-Lago crowd that are definitely deeply into the S&P. Even a 10 percent correction for them is enough to turn those Mar-a-Lago parties into wakes.\n\nBut are you saying that some version of what Musk is doing, perhaps a less haphazard version, would actually be a good idea? Because that\u2019s what Bessent seems to be getting at. Most mainstream economists think the economy was running decently well before Trump got in. With flaws, sure, but not ones that necessitate this kind of drastic shake-up.\n\nAmerica\u2019s got $30 trillion worth of debt to insure over the next few years, both to roll over existing debt and to finance new debt with the level of budget deficits. The economy is clearly out of equilibrium. Did you see those stats for agricultural trade?\n\nI haven\u2019t, no.\n\nEven if you think America\u2019s manufacturing sector is weak, and maybe there\u2019s a structural deficit there \u2014 that America in the long term will not be such an important manufacturing power, that it\u2019s already lagging two to one behind China, that Tesla sales are lagging two to one behind BYD sales, and that if you projected forward with pretty conservative assumptions, you get to BYD at 10X Tesla sales by 2030 \u2014 the optimistic view then is that America\u2019s a very important oil-producing power, and actually, in the fracking industry, it\u2019s basically turned around the decline in its oil production, and that\u2019s definitely an area in which America is world-leading. And you think, okay, even if the manufacturing isn\u2019t going to come back then, raw materials, energy, metals, agricultural commodities \u2014 that\u2019s enough to sustain an economy, together with American soft power, dollar supremacy, and, well, I guess they used to think AI supremacy.\n\nBut I don\u2019t see how equilibrium is restored without a significant devaluation in the dollar. Maybe America should be thinking about its farmers, who are extremely efficient, world-class farmers who are basically crippled by this high exchange rate. They would benefit enormously from a devaluation.\n\nAnd then Trump was signaling that the dollar would be allowed to decline or that there\u2019d be some Mar-a-Lago accord with a debt renegotiation combined with a reset of the dollar, in I guess what they hoped would be an orderly fashion. I question whether it\u2019s going to truly be orderly with this administration.\n\nNot much of what they do is orderly.\n\nIt\u2019s a very delicate operation to do a debt restructure. This is like brain surgery conducted by three drunken surgeons who are all fighting with each other at the same time, and they can\u2019t decide whether to use a chain saw or a scalpel.\n\nAmerica has some amazing companies. Its logistics system is incredible. There are giant warehouses and a highway network that make England, where I am now, look kind of rinky-dink and inefficient. Warehouses at highway intersections alone explain \u2014 was it an eighth of the GDP gap between the U.S. and the U.K.? So just simple scale and having one gigantic continental market is a huge, huge deal. And that\u2019s why I came to America in the first place. It wasn\u2019t necessarily the towns or the people, just that it\u2019s the biggest place, and it\u2019s the first place where you can get to scale if you\u2019re starting a new business. So it is naturally the place that an entrepreneur goes, because the future has happened first in America.\n\nWe will see whether that remains the case. But regardless, even just to bring agricultural trade into balance, a significant devaluation is needed. And then I started thinking about how we were wanting to go back to Europe, and then I\u2019m looking at all this from a European perspective and thinking, well, our dollar assets are highly valued, and in Europe, that money goes a very, very, very long way. And maybe now, before things get a little too crazy, maybe now is the time to rebalance my portfolio.\n\nHow much of your bearishness on America\u2019s future led to your decision? You\u2019ve got roots in Hungary, but you also think it\u2019s financially advantageous to leave now?\n\nI don\u2019t think you can really distinguish one from the other. We have a house in the Buda Hills that we\u2019re moving into. And the kids \u2014 we\u2019re trying to choose between two schools for them to go to. And obviously, in Hungary, you barely even have to think about money. I don\u2019t really want to say this in front of Hungarian friends, because for them it\u2019s kind of expensive, but coming from America \u2026 You see it on TikTok, the American tourists arriving in some place, marveling at how low the rents are, whether it\u2019s Medell\u00edn or Lisbon or \u2014\n\nYeah, I was just in Mexico City. It was crazy that way.\n\nYou live like a king. I feel like anyone who goes to a country like Mexico or Colombia or Brazil or Hungary feels like they take not one but two steps up the social ladder. And so there\u2019s basically a powerful economic force which is attracting people to those cities, particularly if that\u2019s where you\u2019re from. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m from \u2014 H-town.\n\nH-town. It\u2019s a slightly different place, I imagine, than it was, with the political system being what it is. What do you think about that? Are you an Orb\u00e1n guy?\n\nI\u2019m not an Orb\u00e1n guy, but I knew him back in the day.\n\nReally?\n\nUh-huh. I was a Financial Times correspondent in Budapest in \u201989 when he was a young radical. He was, I think, the first to just out-and-out call for Russians to go home, and it was, \u201cOh my God, did he just say that?\u201d In retrospect, it\u2019s obvious that they should go home, and everybody\u2019s going home now.\n\nHe\u2019s a bit more pro-Russian these days, I think.\n\nLook, he\u2019s playing all the superpowers. So yes, he wants cheap oil and gas from Russia. Europe needs cheap oil and gas from Russia if it\u2019s going to compete industrially. Yes, he has some domestic political reasons to be allied with Trump, because he plays the anti-Soros, anti-woke card himself. But the hard fact of Hungary is that it has a gigantic BYD factory, 500,000 cars a year coming out of that thing, and the giant CATL factory. And half the Chinese trade finance for Europe, for the E.U., passes through Hungary. So yeah, I think in the end, he\u2019s going to be \u2014 and maybe Europe as a whole is going to be \u2014 in the Chinese zone. Not the Russian zone, not the American zone, but the Chinese zone.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve followed European politics at all. The administration\u2019s quite circumspect when it comes to China. But they love to bully small countries. They love to bully Canada, they love to bully Denmark. Even Rubio joined in on the abuse of Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign affairs minister, and one of the last Atlanticists in Europe. That was foreign-policy malpractice.\n\nOh, it\u2019s all malpractice.\n\nYou\u2019re attacking your best friends, your best allies in Europe. I mean, it\u2019s absurd. Little Denmark has done nothing but be a loyal American ally. I think that was the one that did it for me. Like, really, Denmark? You can\u2019t even say that Denmark is part of this civilizational suicide that Vance sees taking place in Europe, because actually they\u2019ve addressed their migration crisis and the political fallout from it more forcefully than any other country in Europe. The far right has been utterly defanged in Denmark.\n\nAll of their policies have basically been stolen by the mainstream parties, and immigration is no longer a poisonous political issue. And then you had the Vance speech, and there was that frankly disgusting insult where he couldn\u2019t even remember that England and France had sent troops in support of America\u2019s idiotic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq out of loyalty. Because people actually did care. They did care about 9/11. They felt like it was an attack on the whole West. I\u2019m getting worked up now.\n\nIt\u2019s the only time Article 5 has been invoked.\n\nMy dad was an Atlanticist, and I was an Atlanticist, I was a man of the West, but there are no men of the West left in Europe now. There are European nationalists, yes. There are people who are circumspect because they know that at least temporarily they depend on the American nuclear umbrella. But Europe is out. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to be Poland that leads it or France. Do you follow Donald Tusk? That great line he has \u2014 how come 500 million Europeans are begging 300 million Americans for help in dealing with 100 million Russians who can\u2019t even deal with 40 million Ukrainians? He\u2019s my hero. Donald Tusk for president. He was president of Europe before; he should be again.\n\nSometimes I think that actually \u201989 was only a partial revolution, where half of Europe was liberated from external occupation. And actually that occupation \u2014 in some ways it was easier to spot, because there were full-on tanks and an uprising, like in \u201956, the uprising in Hungary \u2014 suppressed by gunfire and tanks. Whereas the American domination of Europe was rather more insidious and subtle and has left the western part of the continent infantilized. It can\u2019t even imagine what life is like in charge of its own destiny, after 80 years of America basically being the security provider. To that extent, the American right advance is totally correct. Europe does need to stand up and take more responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe Chinese have described Trump as the great nation-builder. He is the great nation-builder. He\u2019s the great nation-builder of Canada, the great nation-builder of Mexico, and the great nation-builder of Europe. So thank you very much.\n\nThough the last 80 years have been pretty decent for Western Europe compared to the previous 80 years, and that was largely due to the American umbrella of security. So it worked until it didn\u2019t.\n\n\ufeffThere was clearly a point in it. And I moved over to the States to seek my fortune. I didn\u2019t establish my companies in Europe. I use European software developers, and I use Europe as a base for a town. But Silicon Valley was the place where the future was being invented. Now it seems like China might be the place where the future is being invented.\n\nHow does this shake out in the near term?\n\n\ufeffI think there\u2019s going to be a classic political struggle between the capitalist class and the competitive producers in tradable sectors and companies with significant international business. And that is the real underlying political battle, and not between the Democrats and the Republicans, but actually between those interested in the strong dollar and those who aren\u2019t interested in a strong dollar, who actually need the dollar to be at a more realistic level in order for them to be able to compete.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be watching it all from 4,000 miles away.\n\n\ufeffI\u2019ll be coming back on visits and hopefully it won\u2019t be quite so expensive to visit New York. New York actually could do quite well because it\u2019s become excruciatingly expensive for people to visit.\n\nHow do you feel about leaving the city? Has it lost the thing that attracted you to it in the first place?\n\n\ufeffI was attracted first and foremost by the Valley. The Financial Times wanted me to go to New York, and I didn\u2019t want to go to New York. I took like a 30 percent pay cut to go to Silicon Valley because I was obsessed with the internet and I just knew it was going to be a huge deal and I had to get myself into it. I had to go to the epicenter. And Steve Jobs was my hero. And he wasn\u2019t really a Valley figure, but people like Vannevar Bush \u2014 20th-century American technologists, they were my heroes. And frankly, Peter Thiel was one of my heroes. He totally was. Gay guy. I guess it wasn\u2019t completely clear back then that he was gay, but a gay guy, libertarian, trying to free money from the malign control of government. These were the people.\n\nAnd now I look at it and I see seven monopolies. Seven rather slow-moving monopolies that are now \u2014 suddenly it seems, although it\u2019s been building for a while \u2014 in competition as an ecosystem. They are in competition with another ecosystem, the Chinese technology ecosystem. You\u2019ve seen those charts where it shows these giant bubbles of American market cap and the companies in these tiny little dots of European companies, and they laugh at us. The Europoors.\n\nI look at that and I question the size of those bubbles. And maybe those bubbles are, metaphorically, bubbles \u2014 that Silicon Valley is massively overvalued and that the DeepSeek drop exploded in an instant the idea of American AI supremacy. It was a subtle dagger in the heart of Silicon Valley. You barely even notice the knife going in it was so subtle. But the end result of it is you have OpenAI, which was the greatest start-up of this phase, now going to lobby the U.S. government to restrict DeepSeek access because it can\u2019t compete with a company that is at least nearly as good and offering its services at a fraction of the cost, in the classic Chinese fashion. Just as they did in cars, just as they did in drones, just as they are doing in robots. So if you ask me what is not what it once was, or what does not seem to be the draw that it once was? I would say above all it\u2019s Silicon Valley.\n\nIn Europe, manufacturing actually does count, and the economy is probably on a more sound footing and there\u2019s less financialization. The health care is kind of affordable, and it costs half as much, and Europeans live five years longer. So just in terms of outcomes, the health-care system, the education system, it\u2019s leaner. Europe has tons and tons of problems, but having had a 25-year-long bubble is not one of them. Europe has had austerity on and off pretty much since 2008. The austerity has only now ended, and the austerity in the U.S. has only now begun.\n\nSo it\u2019s a lack of dynamism among the top dogs of American technology. Things have become sclerotic.\n\n\ufeffThe VCs say it themselves. Absolutely nothing that I\u2019m saying has not been said by Palmer Luckey or Marc Andreessen, a bunch of right-wing tech guys. They are actually the most powerful critics of Silicon Valley. I actually don\u2019t really understand why people don\u2019t see that. I guess the left is a complete distraction. They\u2019re so easily dismissed. They know nothing, and they come at it with so many prejudices that they can\u2019t see anything clearly at all. But when Palmer Luckey talks about Apple, when Palmer Luckey talks about how easily Apple could be shut down with the stroke of a pen by Xi Jinping \u2014 all it would take would be just to nationalize the factories, declare them to be strategic or whatever. And Apple was supposed to be trying to diversify its supply chain to Vietnam and India and has totally failed in that. It\u2019s failed to produce a car. It\u2019s failed to produce a Vision Pro at an acceptable price and basically left that entire future open to Xiaomi and probably a dozen other Chinese companies that we haven\u2019t heard of.\n\nSo in terms of the States, that\u2019s what I\u2019m most negative about \u2014 that Silicon Valley companies became monopolies. It\u2019s sort of the ideology of Peter Thiel: Don\u2019t compete. That\u2019s pretty much the core philosophy of Zero to One. Competition is for losers. Go find yourself a monopoly and have a good life with enough money to afford a bolt-hole in New Zealand in case it all goes wrong.\n\nHow do you think about Gawker and the way that all ended?\n\n\ufeffI\u2019m not going to say Gawker was perfect. It was a relief when it could finally be put out of its misery. It dragged down the other sites. I was embarrassed by it at the end. It basically fell into the same trap as Musk and Rogan are falling into now, where they\u2019re paying way too much attention to their audience. And that feedback loop can drive people crazy.\n\nYou\u2019ve posted a lot lately about people being driven insane by the internet, by social media, et cetera. Whether it\u2019s Musk or Rogan or, as you put it, Gawker staffers in a certain era.\n\n\ufeff2012 to 2015.\n\nSo what was it about those years?\n\n\ufeffI took a little bit of a break in 2011 for personal reasons. And then I came back and it was like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Seriously. Not for the guys writing Gizmodo or Lifehacker \u2014 they were the same as they\u2019d ever been. But I just felt like I absolutely could not connect with the Gawker writers. I thought it was a generational change. There had been a bunch of new people hired, a lot of them from Ivy League schools, whereas the early Gawker writers had been misfits, unemployable in most other places. The later Gawker writers were credentialed. And there\u2019s a pipeline from Ivy League gender studies into Jezebel. That\u2019s pretty much one of the only jobs that you could do if you were a gender-studies major.\n\nAnd there was something more than that. They seemed somehow lobotomized. I would get frustrated, not able to understand where they were coming from. What motivates you? Seriously, what drives you, what motivates you, what are you passionate about? And it was like talking to a bunch of robots. And these are smart people. I hated Gawker. I was not reading it. And I fired half the staff in an afternoon. Thank God, thank God. Because I was ashamed. I was just ashamed.\n\nI assume what you\u2019re saying about the staffers, partly, is that things had become political, had become left wing.\n\n\ufeffI think it had become homogenous. I was designing and redesigning the comment system to allow for some diversity of opinion. I was writing essays about intellectual diversity way before its time. Hey, this stuff is better if people debate it. I came up through the Oxford tutorial system in which you are expected to be able to argue either side of an argument. You\u2019re supposed to be able to switch over and put yourself in the position of another perspective. I\u2019ve always found that very useful. I find it very useful now in making investment decisions and trying to work out whether Tesla really is going down or not \u2014 trying to steelman the case. I respect Elon Musk. Elon Musk was one of my heroes. Our son\u2019s middle name is Elon.\n\nWow.\n\n\ufeffI mean, not specifically for him.\n\nOh, okay.\n\n\ufeffWe liked the sound of the name. And it was absolutely not a problem that the world\u2019s most successful man, achiever of reusable rockets that have revolutionized the cost of space travel, the electric car, and global internet in the ether \u2014 to have done one of those things would be a major achievement. And I think he\u2019s serious about being the first leader of the Mars colony. I think he\u2019s absolutely dead serious about that. And I think that would be the absolute best outcome.\n\nI would prefer a different leader, personally. I just want to put that on the record.\n\n\ufeffMaybe. But there is nobody else presenting themselves. I would prefer for there to be somebody. Columbus wasn\u2019t a good guy. None of these people are good guys. They\u2019ve usually lost in some way back on their home continents or home planets. And exploration \u2014 exit \u2014 is their only option. That\u2019s how progress happens. The crazy ones leave. The crazy ones left Europe, and you got all our crazies. This one I apologize for: You got the Scots-Irish too. You\u2019ve got the hillbillies who were so toxic, so pernicious \u2014 I think the word they used at the time \u2014 that the Quakers in Pennsylvania and the gentry in Virginia pushed them up into the hills.\n\nWe\u2019re finally paying that price with J.D. Vance.\n\n\ufeffJ.D. Vance is the revenge of the hillbillies. J.D. Vance is getting revenge for that betrayal. There are many things I think America should be thanking Europe for. I did a little Twitter essay on this. Basically all the things that we gave you, all the talents, the patience that we gave you, the loyalty that we gave you, the fact that we don\u2019t pull our money out of Treasuries right now as any rational investor would. But the one thing I would like to apologize for is the hillbillies. We gave you the hillbillies, and now you\u2019re paying the price, because the hillbillies are at the core of MAGA.\n\nTo go back to Gawker for a second \u2014 were you actually glad when the ax came down in 2016?\n\n\ufeffI was glad when Univision said they didn\u2019t want it. I was glad that it had a good clean end.\n\nAnd not some kind of bastardization that\u2019s happened with some other sites. Though it did relaunch later, I suppose.\n\nIt did come back in some bastard form. But I think it was a sufficient interval that that was clearly another thing. But yeah, I agreed with Peter Thiel\u2019s criticisms.\n\nYou recently posted that Thiel was \u201cright, as usual,\u201d in this case about Democrats.\n\nWell, I would like to know about his positions right now. First, I want to know why he\u2019s so quiet when he ought to be at his point of maximum power. I\u2019m super-curious about his attitude toward Vance, while Vance is busy destroying the Atlantic alliance, and Palantir depends on the Atlantic alliance for a large portion of its contracts. I\u2019m very curious as to how Peter Thiel thinks about the abuse of America\u2019s most loyal allies in Europe.\n\nAre you nostalgic for the previous era of Gawker? The Wild West era, which is when I started reading it in the mid-aughts?\n\nI mean, it was fresh. It was fun. It was a \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say a breath, it was a blast of fresh air.\n\nThere was energy behind it, there was novelty behind it.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s the first time in eight, ten or maybe even longer \u2014 12 years that I\u2019ve felt sufficiently free and sufficiently \u2026 I guess angry about the vandalism and the wanton destruction of the western alliance that the words just come out.\n\nYeah. You\u2019ve been fairly quiet the last few years.\n\n\ufeffEight years.\n\nYeah, so why now?\n\nIt just happened. Seriously. I was on Twitter \u2014 I never stopped being on X \u2026\n\nThis is how every bad story starts. \u201cI was on Twitter \u2026\u201d\n\n\ufeffI was on X and I guess I can\u2019t remember exactly which one it was, whether it was Denmark or whether it was Poland. I mean, everybody was upset about Ukraine and I guess I wasn\u2019t any more upset than anybody else was. Denmark definitely got to me. I love Denmark. Denmark is kind of like a model country as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nI\u2019m with you.\n\n\ufeffIf you do talk shit about it, that says something about you. It says much more about you than it does about Denmark. I have these little weird obsessions. Like, I love Singapore.\n\nYou\u2019re a fan of Lee Kuan Yew, I recall.\n\n\ufeffYeah. I think he\u2019s the greatest statesman of the 20th century. Deng Xiaoping is probably the second greatest statesman of the 20th century.\n\nYou like the benevolent authoritarians?\n\n\ufeffI like countries with rising GDP. That\u2019s what I like. I like rising GDP.\n\nFair enough.\n\n\ufeffI like prosperous countries in which people can bring up kids and rely on an excellent state education system and get good health care. Where the country just gets better and better every single year, every single decade, every single generation. So the track record of Singapore deserves respect.\n\nSure, though GDP is a measure that people often point to as an illustration of how great the U.S. is doing, even when health care, cost of living, life expectancy isn\u2019t so great.\n\n\ufeffI\u2019m much more skeptical of American GDP numbers than of other countries\u2019 GDP numbers. And it seems like the administration has begun the process of a reevaluation of American GDP numbers \u2014 they are themselves saying, \u201cOh, hey, you shouldn\u2019t really be counting any of the government spending.\u201d Then half of health care is completely dysfunctional, so subtract 10 percent of GDP for that. And while you\u2019re at it, subtract the 3 percent of GDP that basically goes on litigation, and maybe the 6 percent that goes on broker fees on real estate, and the 7 percent on IPO fees, and the billion dollars a year on scaffolding in New York, which is completely unnecessary, and $120,000 that I paid for some pathetic legal dispute that actually should have been resolved for a thousand dollars. So all of that counts toward GDP, but it absolutely does not count toward well-being.\n\nI get the sense you\u2019re excited to be sharing these ideas after some time in the wilderness.\n\n\ufeffPart of it is that I\u2019m on my way out. I don\u2019t have to think about, Oh, maybe you need to sell to Silicon Valley, about Silicon Valley being the acquirer, the ultimate acquirer of everything. Silicon Valley exerts a huge, huge amount of power. And when you no longer are looking for money from Silicon Valley in any way, that is actually extremely liberating.\n\nTo end where we began, you\u2019re putting your apartment on the market. How do you feel about that? It seems like the end of an era.\n\n\ufeffI was just thinking if there was a physical manifestation of the digital-media era, it was that.\n\nDenton\u2019s kitchen. Photo: Courtesy the subject\n\nLook, for everything there is a cycle. It was a great bachelor pad and party pad with an independent entrance \u2014 doorman building, but independent entrance opposite Balthazar. So you\u2019d have parties and they wouldn\u2019t bother the neighbors and you never even saw your neighbors. It was awesome. And then it had a period as a refuge during the pandemic. I\u2019m sorry to say this, but we loved the pandemic, because we were in the apartment, and Crosby Street was completely deserted. And we loved the apartment. And you could hear the birds tweeting and I could sunbathe out on the fire escape and it was like being the last man in the city. I guess everybody else had gone off to their country houses or whatever.\n\nBut it felt like you\u2019re in the absolute middle of the bustle \u2014 the epicenter of downtown, the coolest district, the best location in the coolest district in the whole of the United States. That\u2019s how I felt. And you could retreat up the stairs into the apartment. There\u2019s double-pane glass in the bedrooms, and it\u2019s completely silent. So you\u2019re basically in the thick of things, in the fray and at the same time, just a few steps away \u2014 peace. Like a total haven.\n\nAnd it was a family apartment for us. The kids had their first two, three years there, rushing to the windows to watch the fire engines going back to the fire station over on Lafayette Street, and the ambulances and the police cars. Some kids in the country might be obsessed with horses or animals or whatever, but our kids are completely vehicle-obsessed. I\u2019m showing them pictures of trams in Budapest and cogwheel railways and things basically to console them, to provide some kind of replacement for basically the vehicle extravaganza that they could see from the windows of that apartment.\n\nWell, they can marvel at BYD cars now.\n\n\ufeffMy husband Derrence wants a G-Wagon. He wants a full suburban life in a G-Wagon: garden, own house, no neighbors, all that kind of stuff.\n\nBut bringing all of this together with the economics: The apartment has been a safe haven for us as a family during COVID and after, but as an investment, I think a lot of the smart money is out of the market. I think a lot of people are like me, that basically they\u2019ve sold down a significant portion of their U.S. stocks. I saw Chamath from the All-In podcast said that he was short Wall Street, long Main Street.\n\nA lot of people have taken this up. Jamie Dimon just sold a huge chunk of his JPMorgan stock, and I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t get more notice. So you\u2019ve got a lot of these people sitting on a lot of cash and there isn\u2019t anywhere really very obvious to put it. They can\u2019t, for political reasons, put it in China. Gold is already at $3,000. What other markets are attractive? I think people are going to be buying land, they\u2019re going to be buying prime apartments. They\u2019re going to be seeking refuge, finding safe haven in the real.\n\nSo I\u2019m looking at this from a euro perspective. I want euros, so I want to get a sale done promptly. I don\u2019t want this hanging around through rounds and rounds of tariff wars and devaluation, speculation and all that kind of stuff. I hedge myself some, so I\u2019m not totally exposed to the dollar. But I feel like now is actually probably quite a good time to sell. We put it on, deliberately, probably about a million dollars below where it ought to be. Basically that\u2019s a low price as a lure for, \u201cHey, come and look.\u201d But I\u2019m expecting that it\u2019s going to get bid up into probably the low fours at least.\n\nWhat are you actually going to be doing in Hungary, if anything, professionally? Or is it just family life?\n\n\ufeffThe only site I ever wrote for among the Gawker sites was Valleywag, which was kind of gossipy financial. My specialty is financial gossip, not sexual gossip. I\u2019m not that interested in sexual gossip, but I love financial gossip. Give me more and more and more of it. I did a book on the Barings derivatives scandal and the collapse of England\u2019s oldest merchant bank. That\u2019s why I went to Singapore for the first time. I\u2019m a psycho-historian. I love all this stuff. So when AI came along \u2014 first of all, Claude, and then I, switched to DeepSeek, and now I\u2019m using Deep Research \u2014 I\u2019ve tried them all. I think I\u2019m pretty good at it, at getting answers out. And so I do scenario planning, I do timelines, and then I set the timelines off against each other.\n\nI was a huge Asimov Foundation fan along with Paul Krugman, Elon Musk, and God knows who else. And the core of that is, can you predict the future? I guess his idea was mathematically, and I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s really possible. But you can certainly predict the future by playing out a story, writing a story of the future and judging how credible it is, or writing two different stories of the future.\n\nWill Elon Musk make it? Will he pull Tesla out of this death spiral? Can the Optimus compete with Unitree\u2019s latest? Is he going to show up to the big human-robot race in Beijing next month, which is going to be kind of like the test, just as much as the N\u00fcrburgring is a test of the speed of the SU7 Ultra versus the Tesla S Plaid. So you can use the AI to play out these scenarios and then, depending on what stories you get out, you can trade. And I have been trading. Just last week, I did a whole extensive timeline game for the F-35. At what point do these cancellations in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, put the F-35 program into a death spiral? And I\u2019m not the only one. There\u2019s a lot of people using AI to do this kind of thing.\n\nSo you\u2019re a futurist AI speculator trader?\n\n\ufeffPretty much.\n\nThat\u2019s a growing industry, they tell me.\n\n\ufeffI think it is. I think all these things are merging. The short sellers have always been journalists as much as they\u2019ve been traders. They do a trade and they put out a story. And so I don\u2019t see why it can\u2019t work the other way around.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "A U.S. Navy F-35 performs during the Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach, California in 2022. Photo: Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Getty Images\n\nNot so long ago, the F-35 fighter jet was the hottest ticket in the international arms market. Though it had suffered teething pains in development, going over budget by 50 percent in its first decade, Lockheed Martin\u2019s Lightning II glowed up into a remarkably capable weapons platform. Stealthy, supersonic, and able to both dogfight and strike targets on the ground, it\u2019s arguably the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S. arsenal and undeniably the most sought-after. As nation after nation held competitions to choose their next frontline fighter, the F-35 came in and trounced its rivals time and again. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a competition that it entered in Europe that it didn\u2019t win,\u201d says Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cAnywhere Lockheed Martin pitched the F-35, it wound up getting chosen.\u201d Today, some 18 years after its first flight, more than 1,000 F-35s are in operation in 20 countries.\n\nBut then, earlier this month, something happened. One after another, nations that had signed up for the F-35 started voicing qualms. On March 13, Portugal\u2019s defense minister said that the country would cancel plans to buy the plane. Then Canada\u2019s prime minister said it would reconsider its purchase. Germany, too, is said to be wavering in its commitment to the jet.\n\nNothing had changed about the plane\u2019s performance. It\u2019s just that, in the eyes of some international customers, the F-35 can\u2019t fully be trusted anymore because of who is the commander-in-chief. Donald Trump has an affinity for authoritarianism, has exhibited poor treatment of NATO (whose Article 5 obligates collective defense), and, in particular, has threatened to annex Greenland and Canada.\n\n\u201cCanada is one of our closest allies, and they have fought with us. They have died with us,\u201d says Cynthia Cook, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd to have the new president of the United States cast doubt on their independence is really viewed as a challenging pill to swallow. It\u2019s making the U.S. be seen as a less reliable ally.\u201d\n\nThe long-term effects of America\u2019s heel turn might not just be deleterious for the F-35 program but for the $238 billion U.S. weapons-export industry as a whole, including the recently announced Boeing F-47 next-generation fighter, which could enter service in the 2030s. If the \u201carsenal of democracy\u201d no longer stands on the side of democracies, what is it good for?\n\nTo understand why the F-35 is suddenly in trouble, the first thing you need to know is that a state-of-the-art fighter jet isn\u2019t just a physical airframe. It\u2019s both hardware and software, a whole suite of networked systems that requires software patches and data in order to work effectively. It\u2019s a bit like a smartphone: If you don\u2019t update the software, it gradually works less and less well and eventually bricks.\n\nThe F-35 has to depend on software because of the environment it will fight in. Even though the plane is stealthy, meaning hard to detect by conventional radar, it is not invisible and will not survive long in a modern air-defense environment unless it can track and assess enemy radars and countermeasures. To do that, it needs to constantly update its assessment of the threat environment. That information is stored inside a software package called the mission data file, or MDF. The software is updated by a civilian unit located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida called the F-35 Partner Support Complex, whose website explains that nations deploying the F-35 \u201care not allowed to conduct independent test operations\u201d outside the U.S. and that \u201cU.S. citizens perform specific functions in order to protect critical U.S. technology.\u201d\n\nIn other words, any one nation that flies the F-35 is wholly dependent on the U.S. to keep the planes functioning properly. When the program launched, this provision rankled some allies, but it didn\u2019t prove to be a deal-breaker because it was inconceivable at the time that the U.S. would ever be anything other than a trusted ally. (Israel, presciently, insisted on retaining control of the F-35\u2019s software and today operates the aircraft with considerably more autonomy.)\n\nBuying planes that they don\u2019t fully control now looks like an incredibly poor decision. Since Trump took office, Europe\u2019s trust in its ally has withered as the U.S. has pivoted from democracy toward autocracy, increasingly aligned with Europe\u2019s most dangerous adversary, Russia. As the legendary aviation journalist Bill Sweetman writes, \u201cA hypothetical: A crisis is emerging, and U.S. strategy and policy differs from that of a partner nation; the U.S. is not going to intervene militarily at any likely threshold. The pressure point is simple: The door code at Eglin is changed. The partner nation\u2019s people can\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\nEffectively, the F-35 is bricked.\n\nThe delicacy of the situation that Europe now finds itself in goes far beyond the F-35 or any of the other major weapons systems that it is heavily dependent on the U.S. to maintain and operate, like the U.K.\u2019s nuclear-weapons program. It\u2019s that the whole defense edifice, from top to bottom, has been designed with a deep level of interdependence baked in. \u201cOne of the strengths of the U.S. defense industrial cooperation is we\u2019re able to incorporate the best offerings from our allies and partners from their technological advances,\u201d Cook says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that our adversaries like Russia and China can envy but not replicate.\u201d\n\nThe idea that the U.S. would just walk away from a global security system that it has spent the better part of a century building and nurturing, and which undergirds the country\u2019s global power, is nearly incomprehensible. For Europeans, it\u2019s a bit like coming home and finding your husband in bed with the au pair. The swiftness and profundity of the betrayal is so enraging that a lifetime of commitment can vanish in an instant.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been born, all I\u2019ve ever known was a U.S. alliance,\u201d says Thomas Withington, a white-haired associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, Britain\u2019s venerable defense think tank. \u201cOccasionally, there\u2019s been good-natured criticism on both sides of the Atlantic. But nobody has ever envisaged a world in which the U.S. and Europe are not very strong security partners. And what\u2019s shocking to me now is that I have a number of friends \u2014 mainly French but German and Italian as well \u2014 who were quite strong Atlanticists but have totally changed their position in the last two weeks.\n\n\u201cI was having a drink with a colleague last week, and he said that he remembered vividly how in the wake of 9/11, the U.S. declared Article 5 and pretty much all allied nations around the world stepped up. And he said, \u2018God forbid if that happens again, because we would never assist America in any future wars.\u2019 He was very adamant: Europe must not come to U.S. aid in the future. The U.S. is on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust is hard to win, and it\u2019s really easy to lose,\u201d Barrie says. \u201cEven if this is a four-year blip in terms of the transatlantic relationship, it\u2019s going to take a bit of time to move back toward a more balanced position.\u201d\n\nFor now, even if Trump\u2019s most ominous pronouncements turn out to be mere bluster, Europe has been forced to confront how exposed it is. With remarkable speed, it has pivoted to the consensus that it needs to achieve self-reliance as quickly as it can, and that means replacing U.S. weapons and capabilities with those of a more dependable origin. With a friendly neighbor locked in an interminable and grinding bloodbath, the sense of urgency is real.\n\nAs for the U.S., it is hard to see how it is going to come out ahead in this realignment. Trump often talks about rebuilding American manufacturing and restoring American military power around the world, but by torpedoing allies\u2019 trust in us, he has profoundly undermined the strategic capabilities of the U.S. military and tied an anchor around the defense industry, which last year reached a record-breaking $318 billion in overseas sales.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. defense industry lives off exports,\u201d says Withington. \u201cAnd anything that that reduces that will have a serious effect \u2014 and not only on the defense companies themselves but all of the businesses around them geographically. Think about all of the businesses that support the F-35 line in Fort Worth, everything from sandwich joints to real-estate agents and Uber drivers. There\u2019s a whole ecosystem that\u2019s developed. I saw what happened when the U.K.\u2019s defense industry had to retool post\u2013Cold War. Towns that were dependent on it just died.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a winner in all this, it\u2019s Vladimir Putin. \u201cIf you were to sit down with a blank sheet of paper and say, \u2018What are the things, both in terms of domestic and international policy, that an American leader could do that would best suit Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s long-range strategic goals and visions?,\u2019 it looks a lot like the last 70 days,\u201d says Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nAnother big beneficiary is European weapons-makers. Amid a planned surge in regional defense spending, French president Emmanuel Macron is pushing the Dassault Rafale as an alternative to the F-35, and Airbus is doing the same with the Eurofighter Typhoon. Sweden\u2019s Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter jet, has seen its share price double since Trump took office, and German arms titan Rheinmetall has also doubled its stock value since last year. \u201cIf you\u2019re a European defense aerospace manufacturer,\u201d says Barrie, \u201csomebody else is doing your marketing work for you at the moment, and that\u2019s the U.S.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

MS-13 deportations, particularly of leaders, who are a priority for Salvadoran officials, and Trump officials agreed, according to a US official.\n\nBut bringing MS-13 leaders to face charges in the US has been a top priority for the Justice Department, and the transfer is a major loss of potential intelligence for investigators who helped track down L\u00f3pez-Larios for his arrest in Mexico last year, current and former officials say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historical loss,\u201d says a former federal agent who spent years working on MS-13 and other gang cases. \u201cHe was a potential high-level source. And he doesn\u2019t get to face US justice.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios was arrested last year and charged by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn with directing the transnational gang\u2019s activities in the US, El Salvador, Mexico, and other countries.\n\nHe was flown a week ago Saturday to Central America as part of a broader deal under which El Salvador accepted 238 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua held by the US, along with 22 other MS-13 members, according to court documents and US officials briefed on the matter.\n\nThis notice released by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows Cesar Humberto Lopez-Larios. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nIn the US, the flights have become the subject of an intense legal and political fight over whether the Trump administration violated an order from a federal judge who had ordered deportations under the Alien Enemies Act halted even as planes carrying deportees were en route to Central America. The White House and allies have accused US District Judge James Boasberg of intruding on Trump\u2019s executive powers and aiding terrorists.\n\nIn San Salvador, Bukele, whose crackdown on gang violence has buoyed his popularity, is touting the intelligence value of L\u00f3pez-Larios, one of the so-called Twelve Apostles of the Devil, the gang\u2019s top leadership group.\n\nUS prosecutors allege that top gang leaders negotiated deals with the Bukele government to reduce the number of public murders, thereby creating the impression of lower murder rates, in exchange for facilitating the gang\u2019s operations, according to a 2022 indictment filed in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios\u2019s attorney, the Salvadoran Justice and Foreign Relations ministries, and the president\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios was a key capture of Task Force Vulcan, formed in the first Trump term and continued by the Biden administration, which has been elevated under Attorney General Pam Bondi to operate from her office and given broader authority.\n\nGiven his leadership seniority, sources believe L\u00f3pez-Larios could provide a window into not only the gang\u2019s operations in Mexico and the US, but deals made with government officials that have helped gang members avoid US prosecution.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback On GPS: Trump vs the courts 05:55 - Source: CNN On GPS: Trump vs the courts 05:55\n\nL\u00f3pez-Larios was awaiting trial in Brooklyn on charges including material support to terrorists and narco-terrorism conspiracy when US Attorney John Durham asked a judge this month to dismiss the charges, citing \u201csensitive and important foreign policy considerations.\u201d Durham, in a letter to the judge overseeing the case, said the US was allowing El Salvador to first pursue prosecution against L\u00f3pez-Larios. (The judge dismissed the case without prejudice.)\n\nThe Brooklyn US Attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nThe former agent who worked on MS-13 investigations says Bukele and Salvadoran officials have resisted extraditing gang members to the US and investigators believe that at least part of the reason Salvadoran officials wanted L\u00f3pez-Larios and other MS-13 members back was to ensure they didn\u2019t cooperate with US investigations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to make sure we won\u2019t get the evidence from someone who can corroborate that he has been cooperating with a terrorist organization,\u201d the former agent said.\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors describe the sophisticated leadership structure that allowed the Twelve Apostles of the Devil members, including L\u00f3pez-Larios, to oversee a vast territory stretching from Long Island, New York, to southern California to Central America. Leaders greenlit murders, directed drug trafficking and weapons smuggling networks, prosecutors say.\n\nAnd they entered into deals with successive Salvadoran governments, extracting better treatment for gang members in prison in exchange for reducing public violence to aid election campaigns, according to the 2020 federal indictment of top MS-13 leaders including L\u00f3pez-Larios filed in Brooklyn.\n\nThis includes the government of Bukele, which has formed close ties with conservative figures, including private military contractor Erik Prince and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Bukele, who became president in 2019 and won reelection last year, celebrated this weekend\u2019s gang deportees\u2019 arrival at the country\u2019s notorious prison called CECOT. He posted a social media video set to dramatic music showing handcuffed prisoners, including L\u00f3pez-Larios, being roughly marched from aircraft to buses and then to the prison facility.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump said he didn\u2019t sign controversial proclamation. The Federal Register shows one with his signature 03:15 - Source: CNN Trump said he didn\u2019t sign controversial proclamation. The Federal Register shows one with his signature 03:15\n\nIn one such deal negotiated between top MS-13 leaders and Bukele government officials, gang leaders \u201cnegotiated with high-level government officials for financial benefits, control of territory, less restrictive prison conditions\u201d to enable MS-13 leaders to keep controlling gang operations, according to a separate 2022 Brooklyn indictment of MS-13 leaders. Gang leaders also \u201cdemanded that the government of El Salvador refuse to extradite MS-13 leaders,\u201d to the US for prosecution, the indictment says.\n\n\u201cIn exchange, MS-13 leaders agreed to reduce the number of public murders in El Salvador, which politically benefitted the government of El Salvador, by creating the perception that the government was reducing the murder rate. When in fact, MS-13 leaders continued to authorize murders where the victims\u2019 bodies were buried or otherwise hidden,\u201d the 2022 indictment says. Gang leaders also agreed to use their influence to direct gang members and their families to support Nuevas Ideas, Bukele\u2019s political party in legislative elections, the indictment says.\n\nAfter elections in 2021, Bukele\u2019s party won a legislative supermajority and promptly ousted the country\u2019s attorney general, who had endorsed extraditions of MS-13 gang leaders to the US, and members of the Salvadoran Supreme Court, according to the 2022 indictment of MS-13 gang leaders filed in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions against two Bukele government officials who the U.S. alleged were involved in negotiating deals that included financial incentives for MS-13 and another group known as the 18th Street Gang in exchange for reduced violence. \u201cIn addition to Salvadoran government financial allocations in 2020, the gangs also received privileges for gang leadership incarcerated in Salvadoran prisons, such as the provision of mobile phones and prostitutes,\u201d the Treasury Department said at the time.\n\nBukele didn\u2019t mention L\u00f3pez-Larios by name but said in a social media post that one of the deportees was \u201ca member of the criminal organization\u2019s highest structure.\u201d He added that \u201cthis will help us finalize intelligence gathering and go after the last remnants of MS-13.\u201d\n\nSaturday night flights\n\nThree government planes carried deportees on March 15, two carrying alleged Tren the Aragua gang members whose deportation was authorized by Trump\u2019s invocation of a 1798 law mostly used in wartime called the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe two planes carrying the Tren de Aragua gang members were already in the air and, according to Justice Department court filings, in international airspace when US District Judge James Boasberg issued to halt the deportations. As a result, government lawyers say, Boasberg\u2019s order that the planes turn around and return to the US didn\u2019t apply.\n\nJustice Department lawyers have cited national security reasons for refusing to disclose more about the third flight that carried the MS-13 members. They also say the plane carrying the MS-13 members was carrying deportees under a separate authority not covered by Boasberg\u2019s order to ground the planes.\n\nBukele, for his part, appeared to relish his role in the controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s defiance of Boasberg\u2019s order.\n\nHe reposted on social media a newspaper headline on the judge\u2019s order with a laughing emoji and a comment: \u201cOopsie\u2026 Too late.\u201d"

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY -- Former U.S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died Sunday.\n\nShe was 49.\n\nLove's family posted news of her death on Love's X account.\n\nShe had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University\u2019s brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment.\n\nLove died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement posted by the family.\n\n\u201cWith grateful hearts filled to overflowing for the profound influence of Mia on our lives, we want you to know that she passed away peacefully,\u201d her family said. \u201cWe are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences.\"\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox referred to Love as a \u201ctrue friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer legacy of service inspired all who knew her,\u201d Cox said in a statement. \u201cWe pray for her family and mourn with them.\u201d\n\nLove entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, a growing community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. She later became the city\u2019s mayor.\n\nIn 2012, Love narrowly lost a bid for the House against the Democratic incumbent, former Rep. Jim Matheson, in a district that covers a string of Salt Lake City suburbs.\n\nShe ran again two years later and defeated first-time candidate Doug Owens by about 7,500 votes.\n\nLove didn\u2019t emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who had suggested that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman couldn\u2019t win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.\n\nShe was briefly considered a rising star within the GOP and she kept her distance from Donald Trump, who was unpopular with many Utah voters, while he was running for president ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2016, facing reelection and following the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump made lewd comments about groping women, Love skipped the Republican National Convention and released a statement saying definitively that she would not vote for Trump. She instead endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP race, but he dropped out months later.\n\nWhile seeking a third term in 2018, Love tried to separate herself Trump on trade and immigration while still backing her party's positions on tax cuts. Despite Republican voters outnumbering Democrats by a nearly three-to-one margin in her district, though, she lost by fewer than 700 votes to former Salt Lake City Mayor Ben McAdams, a Democrat.\n\nTrump called out Love by name in a news conference the morning after she lost, where he also bashed other Republicans who didn\u2019t fully embrace him.\n\n\u201cMia Love gave me no love, and she lost,\u201d Trump said. \u201cToo bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\u201d\n\nAfter her loss, Love served as a political commentator on CNN and as a fellow at the University of Sydney.\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s election in November, Love said she was \u201cOK with the outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Trump says a lot of inconsiderate things that are unfortunate and impossible to defend. However, his policies have a high probability of benefiting all Americans,\u201d Love wrote in a social media post."

In the midst of a celebration of her life and an avalanche of happy memories, Mia quietly slipped the bands of mortality and, as her words and vision always did, soared heavenward. We are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences.\u201d\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox called Love \u201ca true trailblazer and visionary leader,\u201d in a post about her death.\n\n\u201cAbby and I are heartbroken by the passing of our dear friend Mia Love. A true trailblazer and visionary leader, Mia inspired countless Utahns through her courage, grace, and unwavering belief in the American dream. Her legacy leaves a lasting, positive impact on our state. We will miss her deeply,\u201d Cox said.\n\nIn May, Love appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d to explain her 2022 diagnosis with glioblastoma brain cancer, or GBM. People diagnosed with GBM typically have just a year-and-a-half to two years to live, with only a 10% chance of survival after five years, according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nLove told Tapper she began receiving immunotherapy every three weeks since August 2023 as part of a clinical trial at The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University. Love discussed her hopeful outlook despite her then-prognosis of 10-15 months to live \u2013 which she surpassed \u2013 and how her Mormon faith has helped her persevere.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a cure in my faith and in science,\u201d she said. \u201cFunny thing is, my patriarchal blessing said you will have a long and prosperous life, a rich and rewarding life, so long as you decide to remain in public service.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Love later joined CNN as a political commentator and was a rotating guest on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d"
