            "full_content": "LISBON, Portugal (AP) \u2014 Portugal slid back into more political uncertainty Wednesday after its third government fell in as many years when Prime Minister Luis Montenegro lost a confidence vote in Parliament.\n\nThe demise of the minority government marks the worst spell of political instability in 50 years of Portuguese democracy.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what led up to the vote, and what is next for the European Union country of 10.6 million people:\n\nHow did Lisbon\u2019s center-right government fall?\n\nMontenegro submitted himself to the confidence vote after he was accused of a potential conflict of interest regarding a family law firm. It recently emerged that the firm was receiving payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government.\n\nMontenegro, who took power less than a year ago, held the confidence vote to \u201cdispel uncertainty.\u201d Instead, opposition parties teamed up to topple him.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nPortuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who as head of state oversees the transition of power between governments led by prime ministers, is holding talks with the parties that make up the Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nOnce those talks are done, the president is expected to formally dissolve the chamber in accordance with constitutional procedures and announce new elections. Many political observers expect to ballot to be set for May.\n\nMontenegro, who has denied wrongdoing, said he will try to regain his post by running again in the snap election.\n\nBut he faces hurdles other than the opinion of voters. Opposition parties have demanded more detailed explanations from the conservative leader, and the Socialist Party wants a parliamentary inquiry that would dog the government for months.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nAs a NATO member, Portugal is in need of strong leadership to help handle the diplomatic crisis unleashed by the United States, which is wavering after decades of solid support for Europe.\n\nThe Portuguese administration is also in the process of investing more than 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in EU development funds as it looks to retool its economy.\n\nWhat about the far right?\n\nPortugal has not been immune to the wave of far-right gains across Europe. Chega (Enough), a radical right populist party, finished third in last year\u2019s election in its best ever result after it successfully tapped into voters\u2019 frustration with mainstream politics.\n\nAntonio Costa Pinto of the Lisbon University Social Sciences Institute said that Chega could aspire to play kingmaker.\n\n\u201cPortuguese democracy has been marked by a minority center-right government that has made a key point of not making alliances with the radical right party, and this will also be at stake on these elections,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cNot that there is a prediction for the radical right to rise greatly. But at what point will the center-right party, which is in a significant crisis, break this barrier on the radical right? We don\u2019t know. Basically everything is wide open.\u201d\n\nWhy so much instability?\n\nPortugal hasn\u2019t experienced such political instability since it adopted a democratic system in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which ended a four-decade dictatorship.\n\nOnce considered a model of level-headed governance, Portugal has seen its politics fragment, leading to fragile administrations. Back-to-back minority governments have been unable to forge lasting alliances with parties in opposition and have fallen well short of finishing their four-year terms.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Costa, Montenegro\u2019s predecessor, stunned the nation when he suddenly resigned as prime minister in 2023 after a member of his staff came under investigation for corruption. Although he was not directly targeted by investigators, Costa immediately stepped down in an act of political responsibility that has earned him praise. He has since become president of the European Council.\n\nSome citizens are growing tired of the instability.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling that this idea of having early elections is becoming common and people start to think it is normal. But it is not normal,\u201d said Francisco Ribeiro, a 63-year-old plumber. \u201cPoliticians are appearing increasingly as people less honest and this confuses people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.

            "full_content": "Spotify announced earlier this year that it paid out a record $10 billion-plus to the music industry in 2024, bringing its total to nearly $60 billion since its inception in 2006. The company \u2014 the world\u2019s largest paid music-subscription service by a wide margin \u2014 maintains that it pays out 70% of every dollar it generates to the music industry, a generous percentage for any business.\n\nIn further details released today in Spotify\u2019s annual \u201cLoud & Clear\u201d music economics report, the company notes that in 2024, nearly 1,500 artists generated over $1 million in royalties from Spotify alone (part of an estimated $4 million-plus across all of those artists\u2019 recorded-music revenue sources) and that in 2024, independent artists and labels collectively generated more than $5 billion from the service.\n\nIt stresses that in the decade from 2014 to 2024, Spotify\u2019s yearly payouts to the music industry increased tenfold, from $1 billion to over $10 billion, and especially that \u201cThere are more artists making more money on Spotify than ever before.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d the report continues, \u201cthe number of artists generating royalties at every threshold on this site \u2014 from $1,000 to $10 million per year \u2014 has at least tripled since 2017. Ten years ago, the top artist on Spotify generated just over $5 million. Today, there are over 200 artists who have passed that threshold.\u201d\n\nAll of which is great news. However, there are many devils in the details.\n\nIt must be noted that Spotify, like most streaming services, pays rights-holders \u2014 usually a label and music publisher \u2014 which then distribute the money to artists and songwriters after taking their percentage and distributing other percentages to other interested parties, such as producers, music distributors, etc. So any notion that each of those 1,500 artists is pocketing $1 million a year (or more) from Spotify, let alone all streaming services, is wildly inaccurate.\n\nSignificantly, Spotify says that over the last two years, $4.5 billion of that total $20 billion-plus went to music-publishing rights holders \u2013 who represent songwriters (and follow a similar royalty-distribution model). It also states that its music-publishing payout \u201chit a new peak in 2024, seeing double-digit-percentage growth compared to 2023,\u201d adding that \u201cSongwriters \u2013 through their publishers, performing rights organizations, and collecting societies \u2013 are generating record-breaking revenues driven by streaming services.\u201d\n\nWhile those statements may be true, it is important to note that songwriters remain at the bottom of the streaming economy: According to a 2024 report from from London-based marketing intelligence and consulting firm MIDIA Research, the approximately $.004 generated per stream is divided thus: the recording side (including the label, distributor and artist) gets 56%; the streaming service gets 30%; and the publishing side (including the publisher, the performing rights organization \u2014 such as ASCAP or BMI \u2014 and the songwriter) gets just 14%.\n\nOf that 14%, the songwriter gets 68%, the publisher 17% and the PRO 15%, the report states. But those numbers don\u2019t take into account the fact that most hit songs these days have between 3 and 12 writers splitting that 68% of the 14% of that $.004, and that they have managers and possibly other interested parties earning a percentage of their share. The human brain can\u2019t even comprehend the infinitesimal amount the creators of most songs earn per stream.\n\nIt is also important to note that this discrepancy was not instituted by Spotify or any streaming service: Although recorded-music rates are negotiated between streaming services and rights-holders (and renewal periods are usually a time of contention), publishing rates are determined by the Copyright Royalty Board, via an outdated process that the publishing industry has long criticized.\n\nIn recent years, songwriting and publishing streaming rates have been rising: For the 2023-2027 period, the CRB increased the rate paid to songwriters and music publishers by 23% \u2014 to 15.35% of a streaming service\u2019s U.S. revenue. But Spotify recently came under fierce criticism from the music industry \u2014 not to mention a lawsuit \u2014 for its recent music-audiobooks bundle, which Billboard estimated will decrease the amount of royalties paid to music companies by $150 million over the next year.\n\nThat sleight of hand may have delighted shareholders, but was a major loss for music creators. And although Universal and Warner Music, two of the world\u2019s largest music companies, were able to claw back some percentages in their recent licensing negotiations with Spotify, neither party has specified what those new rates are.\n\nWe\u2019re not trying to rain on anyone\u2019s parade \u2014 streaming, led by Spotify, saved the music industry after a 15-year spiral that literally cut its total value in half. And as streaming has grown, so has the money it pays to creators: According to \u201cLoud & Clear,\u201d over the past decade, the 100,000th-ranked artist on Spotify (based on royalties generated) has seen their royalties multiply by over 10 times, from less than $600 in 2014 to almost $6,000 in 2024. Even the 10,000th-ranked artist has seen their royalties increase almost 4 times \u2013 from $34,000 to $131,000.\n\nAll of which is great news. But streaming\u2019s payment system, devised back when it generated so little money that the difference between 13% and 15% was almost irrelevant, is in dire need of revision. There is no shortage of ideas and proposals for a new system, but those who make decisions need to think first about the people who create the \u201cproduct\u201d \u2014 the music \u2014 that this entire business is built upon, before they think of the shareholders who profit from it."

Spinal Tap II follows the band as they reunite after a 15-year break for one final concert, according to a synopsis from the producers.\n\nSpinal Tap II: The End Continues will get a wide theatrical release on Sept. 12, and has Reiner returning in the onscreen role of documentarian Martin \u201cMarty\u201d DiBergi, in addition to cameos by Elton John, Paul McCartney, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood.\n\n\u201cWe feel privileged for the opportunity to work with Rob Reiner and the brilliant minds behind the original This Is Spinal Tap, and to be part of a film that has resonated with so many,\u201d Andrew Karpen, CEO of Bleecker Street, and Kent Sanderson, president of Bleecker Street, said in a joint statement. \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap isn\u2019t just a movie \u2014 it\u2019s a cultural touchstone that pioneered the mockumentary genre and left an indelible mark on both film and music. Returning to this world through Spinal Tap II is an extraordinary chance to celebrate its legacy while creating something fresh for both new and devoted audiences,\u201d they added.\n\nThe cast for the sequel includes Paul Shaffer, Fran Drescher, Don Lake, John Michael Higgins, Nina Conti, Griffin Matthews, Kerry Godliman and Chris Addison. Bleecker Street also plans a U.S. theatrical release this summer for the restored edition of This Is Spinal Tap, to be followed by digital and streaming play.\n\nSpinal Tap II is produced by Reiner, Michele Reiner and Matthew George and financed by Castle Rock Entertainment. Derrick J. Rossi, Hernan Narea, Jonathan Fuhrman and Christopher H.

Some teams need to do more than others to get into a good position for an at-large bid, but better to win the tournament and erase all doubt.\n\nOne nice thing about these conference tournaments in particular is that all games will be at neutral sites. That means any game against a team in the top 50 is a Quad 1 game. Also, the committee likes to see that teams can win off of their home floors. After all, the NCAA Tournament is not played on home courts.\n\nThe conference tournament draw is important for bubble teams. You want games that can help you, but they need to be winnable games. You'd have to have to beat Auburn or Duke, for example, just to get any help at all.\n\nSix bubble teams are in action today. They are all opening round games in their conference tournaments.

The Tar Heels need quality wins, and the first chance at one would be in the ACC Tournament semifinal against Duke. It would have been far better to be on the other half of the bracket to play Clemson or Louisville. Of course, UNC lost to both of those teams already.\n\nvs. Colorado, 3 p.m. | ESPN+\n\nThe Mountaineers are the highest-ranked team still on the bubble and should be OK if they can avoid a bad loss ... but this game provides an opportunity for a bad loss. A win gives them a date with top seed Houston.\n\nvs Iowa, 6 p.m. | Peacock\n\nAt 17-14 overall and 11-14 vs. the top three quadrants, Ohio State needs multiple wins in the Big Ten Tournament to have a realistic shot at the Big Dance. The Buckeyes' draw has them facing Illinois if they beat Iowa, then Maryland after that. It is hard to be optimistic for Ohio State if it doesn't get a shot at the Terrapins.\n\nvs. Kansas State, 7 p.m. | ESPN+\n\nThe Bears are 17-13 entering Big 12 Tournament action and need at least one win to give themselves a chance.

The wins over Missouri and Texas to end the regular season were a big boost, and a win over the Bulldogs should be enough to hear their name called on Sunday.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIncoming heavy rain from an atmospheric river-fueled storm that slammed into the West Coast early Wednesday is threatening mudslides and debris flows in Southern California and has already prompted evacuations in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all this storm is capable of \u2014 its reach and impacts will only get more extreme as the week continues.\n\nThe cross-country storm will strengthen into an unusually intense March powerhouse by the end of the week and will put millions at risk of wildfires, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, powerful wind gusts and blizzard conditions.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect each day:\n\nWednesday: Storm soaks West Coast, brings debris flow threat to Southern California\n\nRain began in the Pacific Northwest and showers dotted Northern California well before sunrise as the storm pushed onto the West Coast. Soaking rain and mountain snow began in the afternoon in Northern California and will spread south.\n\nHeavy rain will reach Southern California later in the evening and ramp up the threat of flooding overnight and into Thursday.\n\nA level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, including areas scorched by the Palisades and Eaton fires, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The storm\u2019s relatively quick pace could help limit widespread flooding in California, but recently burned areas remain at a higher risk for flooding and debris flows.\n\n\u201cAnyone in or near those (burned) areas should be completing pre-storm preparations today before the heavy rains begin tonight,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Wednesday.\n\nAt the direction of Gov. Gavin Newsom, state agencies have deployed more than 400 personnel to prepare to respond to the storm.\n\nEvacuation orders are in effect for about 120 homes deemed to be \u201cvulnerable properties,\u201d mostly near the Palisades burn scar, as well as a handful of people in the Hurst fire area, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson said.\n\nOfficials issued additional evacuation orders Wednesday for more than 1,700 people in and near Sierra Madre\u2019s Eaton Fire burn scar, according to the fire department.\n\nEvacuation warnings were issued for other parts of Los Angeles County Tuesday due to the risk of debris flows from the Palisades, Eaton, Franklin and Kenneth burn scars, according to the county\u2019s emergency alert service. Warnings were also issued for parts of San Bernardino County Tuesday and Orange County Wednesday.\n\nWarnings urge people in and near these burned areas to prepare to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice while orders are a command to evacuate immediately.\n\nSierra Madre, California, residents load sandbags into a vehicle on Tuesday, in advance of heavy rain this week. Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images\n\nA span of the Pacific Coast Highway closed from eastern Malibu to just east of Will Rogers Beach beginning noon Wednesday due to the risk of debris flows and flooding.\n\nHeavy snow and strong winds will also make travel very difficult or impossible in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, especially by Wednesday night.\n\nMeanwhile, some Northern California counties have warned that fallen debris could impact evening commutes. Santa Clara firefighters responded to reports of downed power lines, branches and trees, the fire department said Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAs the storm knocked down power lines, more than 42,000 homes and businesses across California were without power Wednesday evening, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nThursday: Snow, rain and wind expand over the West\n\nThe storm will push east, with rain and snow spreading into more of the West and reaching much of the Rockies by the evening.\n\nPlaces in the mountains could see half a foot or more of snow, with a few inches also falling at lower elevations and potentially in some valleys.\n\nBy late afternoon, widespread strong winds will begin from Nevada and Arizona to the Rockies with wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph possible \u2013 especially in mountainous terrain \u2013 as the storm starts to strengthen. These wind gusts, combined with rain and snow, could create hazardous travel conditions.\n\nGusty winds will also impact the Plains ahead of the storm and ramp up a widespread fire threat, especially from the late afternoon onward. More than 800 miles of the central US, from western Texas through Nebraska, are under a level 2 of 3 fire weather risk, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Any spark could turn into a wind-driven blaze in these conditions.\n\nWet weather will continue in California and the Pacific Northwest for much of the day, easing up over time. The snow in California\u2019s highest elevations will be the slowest to end, with multiple feet falling in the peaks of the Sierra Nevada by the time the storm moves on.\n\nA few feet of additional snow will help the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which is hovering at 81% of normal, according to data from California\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. Snowmelt from a robust snowpack is critical for filling reservoirs that feed the state\u2019s water supply during the dry season, which typically stretches from May to September.\n\nFriday: The storm intensifies, dangerous severe thunderstorms begin\n\nThe storm will strengthen quickly and become quite intense while it tracks into the Plains, setting up a repeat of last week\u2019s severe thunderstorm threat, widespread strong winds and increased fire danger.\n\nStrong winds that could disrupt travel and damage power lines will whip across the central US, turning from breezy in the morning to fierce by the day\u2019s end.\n\nWidespread gusts of 40 to 50 mph are likely by late afternoon, with stronger gusts past 65 mph possible from New Mexico and Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas. The winds will increase fire danger in eastern New Mexico and the Southern Plains to the extreme. Dozens of fires flared up in Texas last week under similar conditions.\n\nSevere thunderstorms will roar to life by the late afternoon in the Mississippi Valley as the powerful storm\u2019s potent cold front clashes with a surge of warm, moist air from the Gulf.\n\nThe thunderstorms will become more ferocious and expand by the late evening to pound potentially more than 900 miles of the Mississippi Valley \u2013 from Louisiana to Minnesota \u2013 into the overnight hours.\n\nCNN Weather\n\n\u201cA fast-moving storm system may support numerous severe storms capable of very strong wind gusts, strong tornadoes, and large hail,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center warned Wednesday night.\n\nA level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from Mississippi through much of Illinois, according to the center. Thunderstorms in this area could unleash wind gusts stronger than 75 mph \u2013 equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane. Strong tornadoes \u2013 rated EF2 or higher \u2013 are also possible.\n\nThese hazards will take on another layer of danger once it\u2019s dark and difficult to see: Nighttime tornadoes are nearly twice as likely to be deadly as those occurring during the day, a 2022 study found.\n\nSaturday: Severe thunderstorms, blizzard conditions hit the eastern US\n\nThe intense cross-country storm will expand into more of the eastern US with severe thunderstorms and blizzard conditions.\n\nSevere thunderstorms could be ongoing in the early morning, especially in parts of the Ohio Valley.\n\nSome of these storms could become less intense by the afternoon but the threat won\u2019t end there \u2013 another round of dangerous storms will surge to life in the afternoon along the Gulf Coast and in the Southeast.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nDamaging wind gusts, very large hail and strong tornadoes will all be possible. These storms will also dump heavy rain that could cause flash flooding, especially from Mississippi to northern Georgia and north into Kentucky.\n\nSnow, ice, rain and strong winds will slam the north-central US starting in the earliest hours of Saturday morning. The combination could cause periods of blizzard conditions \u2013 blowing snow that makes it difficult or impossible to see more than a few feet.\n\nLast week\u2019s storm created a blizzard that shut down highways, stranded vehicles and caused crashes across multiple states.\n\nThe storm\u2019s widespread, powerful winds will ease up over the Plains through Saturday and move farther east.\n\nSunday will likely be a wet and stormy day for much of the East Coast. Some severe thunderstorms with strong winds will persist through Sunday but will likely be less intense than Friday and Saturday\u2019s storms.\n\nCNN\u2019s Stephanie Elam and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 82.55 points, or 0.2%, to settle at 41,350.93.\n\nThough the tech sector is off more than 3% week to date, the cohort bounced on Wednesday to lead the S&P 500 higher. Nvidia gained 6.4%, and AMD added more than 4%. Meta Platforms advanced 2% and Tesla jumped more than 7%.\n\nThe consumer price index, a broad measure of costs across the U.S. economy, increased 0.2% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.8%. This was lower than the respective Dow Jones estimates for 0.3% and 2.9%. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% on the month and 3.1% for the past 12 months, both below expectations.\n\n\"This reading is going to be a little dilutive to this stagflation narrative, and it is going to restore to some extent policy flexibility from the Fed,\" said Dave Grecsek, managing director in investment strategy and research at Aspiriant Wealth Management. \"If this inflation number was higher, you'd have some of these concerns weighing much more heavily, like the Fed would not be in a position to respond if the economy continues to weaken.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs took effect on Wednesday, and Canada said it will impose 25% retaliatory duties on more than $20 billion worth of U.S. goods. The European Union also responded swiftly, pledging to impose counter-tariffs on 26 billion euros, or $28.33 billion, worth of U.S. imports beginning in April.\n\nStocks have been under pressure as traders fear the escalating tensions could trigger a U.S. recession. Part of the reason for the recent sell-off has been concern that Trump's volatile trade policy would raise inflation and slow growth, otherwise known as stagflation.\n\nThis week alone, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq have all dropped roughly 3%. The S&P 500 briefly dipped into correction territory on Tuesday, down 10% from a record set in February. Over the past month, the S&P 500 has lost more than 7%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have shed 6.8% and 10.2%, respectively.\n\n\"We're not surprised the market's pulled down. Obviously, U.S. equity markets have been exceptionally strong over the last two years. It's right to expect a correction,\" Grecsek added. \"But I think once we get through this \u2014 we're in the very early events of these key fiscal policy changes \u2014 there's better news to come.\""

            "full_content": "US envoy in Qatar for talks on extending fragile Gaza ceasefire\n\n1 day ago Share Save Yolande Knell Middle East correspondent Reporting from Jerusalem Share Save\n\nBBC Markets in Khan Younis in southern Gaza are reporting some food shortages after Israel blocked deliveries 10 days ago\n\nThe White House's envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in Qatar to join indirect talks between Israel and Hamas on extending the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. This week, negotiators from both sides have begun meeting mediators for the first time since President Donald Trump took office on 20 January. The 42-day first phase of the Gaza deal and temporary truce came into effect on the eve of his inauguration. That first phase ultimately saw Hamas return 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others - in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel \u2013 as well as five living Thai hostages. It ended on 1 March. Israel now hopes the US can advance a plan for a two-month truce extension, which would start with the release of about half of the living hostages still held. Hamas has so far rejected that, demanding immediate talks on the second phase in the original ceasefire agreement, which would end the war and lead to a full Israeli troop withdrawal. However, it stated that it was approaching the ongoing discussions in Doha with \"full responsibility and positivity\".\n\nEPA US envoy Steve Witkoff helped to broker the ceasefire deal in January\n\nMariam Abu Mukhimer said she wanted an end to the war after 17 months\n\nThe US has never confirmed it, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 2 March that Witkoff had proposed a temporary extension of the ceasefire until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover. According to this plan, which Netanyahu said Israel had accepted, half of the hostages would be released together at the outset, and the other half at the end. The PM suggested Witkoff had \"even defined his proposal as a corridor for negotiations on the second stage. Israel is ready for this.\" It is believed that Hamas is still holding up to 24 living hostages in Gaza and the remains of 35 others. An American-Israeli soldier, 21-year-old Edan Alexander, is among those said to be alive. There are also the bodies of four other American citizens. Hamas has accused Israel of reneging on the original ceasefire deal. Despite pressure from regional mediators - Qatar and Egypt - as well as the US, it is thought unlikely that the armed group will give up many of the hostages without a full end to fighting in Gaza. It sees them as its major bargaining chips in talks.\n\nEPA Some hostages' relatives are camping near the Israeli defence ministry in Tel Aviv to push for a deal that would see them all released\n\nFor the relatives and supporters of Israelis held captive, these are desperate times. Since Saturday, some have been camping outside the defence ministry in Tel Aviv to demand an immediate Gaza ceasefire deal that would free everyone in captivity. \"How can I start processing our personal tragedy when the national trauma is not yet over?\" said Ofri Bibas, the sister of Yarden Bibas, at the protest on Monday evening. The recent exchanges with Hamas led to the release of her brother and the return of the bodies of her sister-in-law, Shiri, and two young nephews, Ariel and Kfir, who were killed in Gaza. \"I have 59 brothers and sisters who are in hell,\" Ofri continued - referring to the total remaining number of hostages. \"We received Yarden alive, but Shiri and the children could have been saved. By Passover, everyone must be home, and the only way to bring everyone back is to end the war. Now.\" A poll for Israel's Channel 13 TV indicates that half of Israelis believe that the US president is more concerned about the fate of the hostages than Netanyahu. Asked which of the two they thought was more concerned, 50% of respondents said Trump, 29% Netanyahu, and the rest were not sure. Far-right allies of the prime minister have threatened to collapse his governing coalition if fighting does not resume in Gaza to achieve its war goal of crushing Hamas.\n\nArafat Hana said his son, Omar, was killed in an Israeli air strike while walking to a camp where they had previously stayed\n\nUp to now, both Israel and Hamas have largely refrained from returning to all-out hostilities in the Palestinian territory. However, recently, Israel has carried out daily strikes. On Tuesday, four men were killed in Wadi Gaza, which is also known as the Netzarim Corridor \u2013 an area from which Israeli forces withdrew as part of the Gaza ceasefire terms. The Israeli military said its air force had targeted \"several terrorists engaged in suspicious activity posing a threat to [Israeli] troops\". Speaking to the BBC in Gaza City, the father of one of those killed, Arafat Hana, said his son, Omar, had done nothing wrong. He said he was with neighbours walking to a displaced people's camp where they had previously stayed to retrieve belongings. \"They were innocent. They were just going to get mattresses and other things. They weren't carrying rockets!\" said Umm Tareq Obaid, who lived near the men.\n\nPalestinians queue outside a bakery in Khan Younis; several other bakeries in the city have had to close due to shortages of cooking gas"

            "full_content": "Decoding the Ukraine ceasefire plan line by line\n\n1 day ago Share Save Tom Bateman State Department Correspondent Reporting from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Share Save\n\n'All of this now hinges on Vladimir Putin's response'\n\nHours of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday ended with a joint US-Ukraine statement backing an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia. Trump administration officials see this as a major breakthrough towards the foreign policy goals of a leader who campaigned on a promise to end the war. For Ukraine, the joint announcement amounts to a critical reprieve for President Volodymyr Zelensky after a humiliating attack in the Oval Office a fortnight ago by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance. For Moscow, it shifts the onus to them, while the war itself intensifies. But so far only one side in the war - the one dependent on the Americans - has signed up. And the proposal is only eight paragraphs long, with meagre details beyond the desire to rapidly press ahead. So does it make a ceasefire plausible? And if so, can it end the war after Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago in a just and sustainable way, and on terms that keep the region and the world safe?\n\nStatement: \"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\" Analysis: The key word here is \"immediate,\" which doesn't leave any doubt: Trump wants the guns to fall silent now. His sense of urgency, however, has often led to concerns in Europe. Many fear that rushing the desired outcome without first working out the terms takes the military pressure off Moscow as the invading power and could lead to a truce being exploited. They argue it empowers the occupying force. The fear is of ultimately leading Ukraine into an effective surrender. The theory is that Russia - the bigger, more populous and militarily more self-sufficient power - could use a truce without first establishing concessions to consolidate its forces, string out a negotiation process and wait to see what happens politically for Trump during his term while it holds on to everything it seized; and even then try to take more ground, building on its current occupation and potentially using a fracture in the Western alliance to threaten more of Europe. The process of negotiating terms before a ceasefire in conflicts can be important to ensure the sides convert current military threats into meaningful strategic gains. Zelensky has previously tried to persuade the Americans that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted, evidenced by the fact he broke the European-backed Minsk agreements after seizing Ukrainian territory in 2014. Trump dismisses these concerns, saying there will be security for Ukraine, but without saying how this will be assured. He has said Putin will be deterred and is in a difficult position with \"no choice\" but to make a deal for reasons that \"only I know\". Rubio said on Tuesday the US delegation had substantive discussions with the Ukrainians on a permanent end to the war, including \"what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long-term security and prosperity\", but again didn't elaborate.\n\nWatch: Rubio on how US wants Ukraine-Russia negotiations to work\n\nStatement: \"The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\" Analysis: This is the big win for Zelensky in this agreement and sees US weapons supplies being delivered at a rate of around $2bn (\u00a31.5bn)-worth a month, restored. Critically, it also means Washington will once again share its intelligence data and satellite pictures with Kyiv, which helps it target Russian positions. The White House said it suspended this aid because it felt Zelensky wasn't \"committed\" to Trump's peace plan. The Ukrainian leader had tried to voice his concerns based on some of the reasons above when he was ejected from the Oval Office. His reservations are likely being set aside while he welcomes the agreement in this form - a necessary price to pay to restore US security assistance.\n\nStatement: \"Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security. The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.\" Analysis: This paragraph is confusing because it's unclear whether it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and the US on establishing any security guarantees for Ukraine, or if it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to permanently end the war once a ceasefire is under way. If it is the former, it appears to suggest that Washington and Kyiv will hammer out any decisions on how to back up Ukraine's security and deter Russian breaches of a truce, and the US will then discuss these with Moscow. But it is all a far cry from the kind of security guarantee Zelensky ultimately wanted, which was membership of Nato, which Trump has said won't happen - a major long-term concession to Moscow's demands. The paragraph also contains a vague and lukewarm reference to the idea of European peacekeepers, which have been pitched by the UK and France, with the line attributed only to the Ukrainian delegation. It's notable that the US appears not to be putting its name to this part after Moscow categorically rejected the idea."

            "full_content": "When the new league year begins at 4:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the Jets will release quarterback Aaron Rodgers. He\u2019ll officially become a free agent, for the first time in his 20-year NFL career.\n\nSo what will happen next?\n\nNobody knows, at this point. It\u2019s widely believed to be a two-team race between the Steelers and the Giants. If Rodgers\u2019s goal is to cap his career in the postseason, it shouldn\u2019t be a question.\n\nAs of Tuesday, it became obvious that the sticking point for Rodgers and the Steelers is money. They need each other. The gap suggests Rodgers believes the Steelers need Rodgers more than Rodgers needs the Steelers \u2014 and the Steelers believe Rodgers needs the Steelers more than the Steelers need Rodgers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vikings could be lurking. Which could become a boom-or-bust proposition for Minnesota in 2025. The last time the Vikings embraced a former Packers and Jets quarterback, it went well. They made it to the NFC Championship with Brett Favre, where they outplayed (but lost to) the Saints. (Contributing factors included Adrian Peterson\u2019s fumbles, the bounty on Favre, his ill-advised, Favre-being-Favre, cross-body throw when the team was in range for a potential game-winning field goal, an inexplicable too-many-men-in-the-huddle penalty after a timeout that made the potential game-winning field goal five yards longer, and the inherently unfair overtime rules that allowed a team to win the toss, take the ball, convert a couple of first downs, and walk off as the winner with a three-pointer).\n\nThe dynamics will change if/when any of the three teams decide to punt on Rodgers and address their veteran-quarterback needs elsewhere. That\u2019s the risk Rodgers takes by taking time to make a decision. If the Vikings add, for example, Jameis Winston, they\u2019ll be out. If the Giants or Steelers sign Russell Wilson, they\u2019ll be out. And Rodgers, as it relates to having maximum options and in turn maximum leverage, could be (to use the technical terminology) shit out of luck.\n\nThe football world came to a standstill in 2012, when Peyton Manning was contemplating his options. Rodgers currently doesn\u2019t have that kind of cachet. He had two subpar years with the Jets. And he has been more underwhelming than overwheling in the postseason for a lot longer than that.\n\nNot long ago, it looked as if he had only one option for 2025 \u2014 the Giants. Once the Vikings and Steelers address their obvious needs at the position, it could be back to signing with the Giants or waiting for a starter on a short-list contender to suffer a season-ending injury. Whenever that might be. If it even happens."

            "full_content": "BRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union and Canada hit back Wednesday at President Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs with levies of their own on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. products, including bourbon and motorcycles, while warning of further retaliation. The European Union unveiled a two-stage response that will target up to $28 billion in U.S. exports. Canada announced 25 percent tariffs on $20.7 billion.\n\nThe U.S. decision to raise tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 percent took effect Wednesday \u2014 the latest salvo in Trump\u2019s campaign to reshape America\u2019s trading relationship with the world.\n\nEuropean leaders for months warned that they would retaliate swiftly against new U.S. tariffs, even as they emphasized that a trade war would hurt both sides and tried to negotiate an off-ramp with the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a deal elusive, the European Commission, the E.U.\u2019s executive branch, said it will reimpose tariffs dating to Trump\u2019s first term on April 1. After consultations, leaders said, the commission will target an additional $19 billion in products by mid-April.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe deeply regret this measure,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday. \u201cJobs are at stake, prices up, nobody needs that.\u201d She and other leaders said they remained ready to negotiate.\n\nCanadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government is matching Trump\u2019s increased tariffs on steel and aluminum \u201cdollar for dollar.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian tariffs, set to start at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, will hit steel products worth roughly $8.7 billion, aluminum products worth $2.08 billion and other products worth $9.85 billion. LeBlanc said the U.S. tariffs were unfairly targeting Canada\u2019s important steel and aluminum industry and creating \u201cdisruption and disorder\u201d for consumers in both countries. Canada was the top steel supplier to the United States last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe levies also disturbed U.S. trade relations with other countries. In Brazil, officials reacted to steel tariffs with anger. The United States is the largest foreign market for Brazilian steel. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, speaking at a car factory in southeastern Brazil, said he wouldn\u2019t be intimidated.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Trump keeps yelling, because I\u2019ve learned not to be frightened of an ugly face,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSpeak calmly with me, speak with respect to me.\u201d\n\nBut Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said Wednesday that his country was not ready to retaliate. He said the Brazilian steel sector does not compete with the American steel industry but collaborates with it, and Brazil will try to negotiate a way out of the impasse. Later, the Lula administration said it might complain to the World Trade Organization. \u201cThe Brazilian government laments the decision taken by the American government,\u201d the administration said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Korea, Japan and Australia, security allies that sell significant volumes of steel and aluminum to the United States, held out hope for exemptions from the tariffs, though Trump has insisted there will be none. All were granted carve-outs from Trump\u2019s tariffs in 2018; none retaliated Wednesday.\n\nE.U. officials said their countermeasures would be designed for maximum political pressure. They hoped they would give the 27-nation bloc leverage to reach a deal.\n\nThe sides have been here before. When Trump imposed tariffs on the European Union during his first term, its leaders responded with levies on industries based in the home states of Republican leaders, such as bourbon from Kentucky, represented by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and iconic American products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi\u2019s jeans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose tariffs were suspended after negotiations with the Biden administration. But that suspension will now be allowed to expire April 1.\n\nE.U. leaders will consult with member states and industry leaders on additional tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe European Commission published a 99-page list of U.S. goods that could be hit, including chewing gum, soybeans, home appliances, beef, poultry and alcoholic beverages. Some tariffs could again target the home states of Republican leaders, such as Louisiana, represented by House Speaker Mike Johnson. There is also a focus on goods that can be secured from other countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to hit the U.S. in important sectors for them, where it does not cost us much,\u201d said a senior E.U. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Another goal, the official said, is to prompt American businesses to convey to the Trump administration that \u201cthis is a bad idea.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean leaders have long made clear that they would prefer to negotiate and persuade Trump to forgo tariffs. Their two-step approach, and the nearly three weeks before it starts, appears to allow time for that.\n\nThe disruption is \u201cavoidable if the U.S. administration accepts our extended hand and works with us to strike a deal,\u201d E.U. Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said.\n\nOfficials in Europe, like other U.S. trading partners, have tried to strike a delicate balance between launching countermeasures to deter further U.S. tariffs and containing harm to their economies. They have struggled to engage with a U.S. administration that has at times fluctuated between threats and backpedaling \u2014 and to gauge whom to lobby in the administration, diplomats say.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts said Europe will have to be prepared for escalation.\n\n\u201cThis is only the first act. We\u2019ll have to see how all of this develops,\u201d said Ignacio Garc\u00eda Bercero, a former European Commission trade official. \u201cThere\u2019s so much unpredictability these days.\u201d The administration has pledged more tariffs on a broader range of imports from U.S. trading partners that could start in April.\n\nThe United States is Europe\u2019s largest export market. Key European economies were already dealing with sluggish growth. Now businesses are bracing for the prospect of a protracted trade war.\n\nGermany, the bloc\u2019s leading exporter to the United States, would be particularly vulnerable, with some of the biggest anticipated effects on the car and pharmaceutical industries. Industry leaders have also warned that a U.S.-China trade war could have spillover impact on Europe: China could divert cheap goods to the continent, unwelcome competition for businesses.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe European Union has been preparing for U.S. tariffs. At bloc headquarters in Brussels, a group dubbed the \u201cTrump task force\u201d has been strategizing for Trump\u2019s return since last year and focusing on preparing for trade scenarios.\n\nYet Sefcovic, who visited Washington recently, said this week that the Trump administration \u201cdid not seem to be engaging\u201d with European overtures to negotiate. \u201cWe jointly identified the few areas that would allow us to move forward by fostering a mutual benefit,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut in the end, one hand cannot clap.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Astronomers have identified four exoplanets orbiting Barnard\u2019s Star, a red dwarf star just 6 light-years away from Earth.\n\nNo, really, this time it\u2019s for real! We have to emphasize this because astronomers have been \u201cdiscovering\u201d exoplanets orbiting Barnard\u2019s Star\u2014and then discovering they were wrong\u2014for a century. \u201cExoplanet\u201d is the technical term for planet-like bodies beyond our solar system, but some scholars use \u201cplanet\u201d for simplicity.\n\nNow, however, an international research team has confirmed the existence of Barnard b, a previously identified exoplanet orbiting Barnard\u2019s Star. They also found evidence of three additional exoplanets, which had been tentatively identified in the same earlier study\u2014enough to confirm one as a bona fide planet. As detailed in a study published Tuesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the research sets a new record in humanity\u2019s hunt for exoplanets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting find \u2014 Barnard\u2019s Star is our cosmic neighbor, and yet we know so little about it,\u201d Ritvik Basant, first author of the study, said in an NSF NOIRLab statement. He and his colleagues used a planet-hunting instrument mounted on the Gemini North telescope called MAROON-X. Exoplanets exert a gravitational force on the star they orbit, which makes the star wobble; MAROON-X can detect this wobble in the star\u2019s light, allowing astronomers to extrapolate the presence of one or more orbiting exoplanets, as well as their mass.\n\nApplying this technique over a span of three years, the team identified four sub-Earth exoplanets orbiting Barnard\u2019s Star, a red dwarf and the nearest solo star (as opposed to a stellar system) to Earth. Sub-Earth exoplanets have less mass than Earth does, and red dwarfs are small, cool stars that appear orange-ish. As mentioned earlier, all four exoplanets had been previously detected with varying degrees of confidence by a 2024 study, bolstering the researchers\u2019 confidence in their recent findings.\n\nFurthermore, the team was able to classify one of their \u201cplanet candidates\u201d as a bona fide or true exoplanet by integrating their MAROON-X data with observations from the 2024 study, which used the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile.\n\n\u201cWe observed at different times of night on different days. They\u2019re in Chile; we\u2019re in Hawai\u2018i. Our teams didn\u2019t coordinate with each other at all,\u201d added Basant, who is also a PhD student in the University of Chicago\u2019s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. \u201cThat gives us a lot of assurance that these aren\u2019t phantoms in the data.\u201d\n\nThe four exoplanets orbit Barnard\u2019s Star so closely that their years last only a few Earth days. They are probably rocky and, given their proximity to the star, uninhabitable. In fact, the 2024 study estimates Barnard b\u2019s surface temperature to be a balmy 257 degrees Fahrenheit (125 degrees Celsius).\n\nOne of the exoplanets has the smallest mass ever detected using the wobble method, officially (and boringly) known as the radial velocity technique. This new record paves the way for more precise exoplanet hunting than ever before.\n\nExoplanet hunters are particularly interested in rocky planets within habitable zones, the ideal distance from a star to sustain liquid water. Why? Because water is a prerequisite for life\u2014and maybe not just our own."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump needs Senate Democrats\u2019 votes to keep the government funded and open this week. But the group is still agonizing over whether to use this rare point of congressional leverage to extract concessions from Republicans and risk taking blame for a government shutdown. Some argue that voting for a bill to fund the government through September, which the House passed 217-213 on Tuesday, would empower Trump to dismantle more of the federal government. Others contend that a shutdown would hurt federal workers and the government even more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a choice between two terrible alternatives,\u201d said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) on Wednesday.\n\nSenate Democrats are under pressure from grassroots liberals to join House Democrats in withholding their votes. Activists want Democrats to negotiate language in funding bills that explicitly bar Elon Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service from impounding any congressionally mandated funds, in a bid to slow the Trump administration\u2019s unilateral layoffs and cuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is really the only significant point of leverage the congressional Democrats have this year,\u201d said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the grassroots liberal group Indivisible. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to me that any Democrat would be like, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s vote for it.\u2019 Have some respect for yourself.\u201d\n\nBut some Democrats think they must surrender that leverage to avoid what could be a chaotic and politically risky shutdown. Republicans need at least seven Democrats to pass their funding bill through the Senate on Friday night to avoid a midnight shutdown, if all Republicans vote for it. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, said this week that he is opposed.\n\nIf Democrats shut down the government to demand guardrails around Musk, they risk taking the blame for further burdening federal workers and stopping core government services \u2014 the very things for which they are criticizing Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about the economy teetering on [the edge of] a recession, [imagine what] would happen if you shut the government down,\u201d Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pennsylvania) told reporters.\n\nHe is the only Democrat who has publicly said he will vote for the bill, calling a vote against it a vote for \u201cchaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that we\u2019ve got leverage,\u201d said Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colorado), who said he had not decided how he would vote. \u201cI feel that we have the responsibility to deal with a difficult situation.\u201d\n\nDemocrats need to defend the spending authority that the framers gave Congress, Hickenlooper said. \u201cWe have to respect the balance of power that our Constitution describes,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you start throwing out the Constitution, who knows what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nCongress has regularly come to the brink of government shutdowns in recent years, but Sen. Chris Coons (D-Delaware), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, suggested the stakes were higher this time. \u201cA series of federal courts have made it clear that, in their view, President Trump is acting illegally and not respecting the appropriations role of Congress,\u201d Coons said. \u201cThat puts us in a different place than we\u2019ve been in my 15 years\u201d in the Senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) has declined to say whether he will advise members to vote against the bill. \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait and see what the House does first,\u201d he said Tuesday afternoon, shortly before the House passed the bill.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) praised Schumer for letting a robust discussion play out during Senate Democrats\u2019 luncheon. \u201cVery candid, lot of different points of view,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Schumer\u2019s neutral position has alienated others in the conference, according to two people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private discussions. Some Democratic senators are \u201cfurious\u201d at Schumer for not having a strategy and message to counter the House Republican bill, according to one Democratic Senate aide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s private gathering, some Democratic senators argued that voting for the bill would set a terrible precedent as Trump and Musk work to dismantle parts of the federal government, according to one person familiar with the frustrations with Schumer and another with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nOthers argued that allowing the government to shut down would hurt federal workers and give Trump and Musk a freer hand to shutter federal agencies. Government workers are classified as \u201cnonessential\u201d or \u201cessential\u201d ahead of a shutdown, and some Democrats fear that a shutdown could allow DOGE \u2014 which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 to more easily cut those deemed nonessential.\n\nSenators heard midway through the meeting that Education Department offices would be closed Wednesday as Trump prepares to lay off half the agency\u2019s staff, Kaine said, underscoring how Trump has worked to bypass Congress and its power of the purse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaine declined to say how he will vote but suggested he would have a hard time backing the bill.\n\n\u201cWhy would I give to the Article II branch the power to rewrite all the budgetary decisions I make?\u201d Kaine said, referencing the executive branch. \u201cI just cannot see my way to doing that.\u201d\n\nIf Senate Democrats provide the votes, they are likely to face an enraged grass roots next week at town halls during their congressional recess. Those liberal voters are aghast as the Trump administration continues to overrule congressional appropriations, firing federal workers and canceling funds.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is dumb enough to vote for this is sure as hell going to own the consequences,\u201d said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-California), a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Huffman urged Senate Democrats to oppose the bill because doing otherwise would give legitimacy to Trump and Musk\u2019s efforts to slash government spending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis bill is a permission slip to do so much destruction that will take us years and years to undo,\u201d he said. \u201cShame on any Democrat who even thinks about voting for it.\u201d\n\nJust one House Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, joined Republicans to pass the funding bill on Tuesday. The bill trims spending from fiscal 2024 by $13 billion in nondefense spending. The bill would reduce funding for international peacekeeping, mental health and substance abuse treatment, workforce training programs, and National Institutes of Health research, among other programs.\n\nLevin said the base would be \u201cfurious\u201d if Senate Democrats vote for the funding bill and its \u201cMAGA goodies\u201d without negotiating some guardrails on DOGE.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom how distanced they\u2019d need to be from their own constituents\u201d to approve the bill, he added.\n\nOther outside groups are hitting the same note.\n\n\u201cUntil Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Republicans stand down and stop holding people\u2019s money hostage, there is no reason whatsoever for Democratic lawmakers to help them,\u201d Britt Jacovich, a spokeswoman for MoveOn, said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are already trading blame for a potential shutdown.\n\nRepublicans \u201cwanted control of the House and the Senate,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut) said. \u201cThey knew that would mean working across the aisle, and they haven\u2019t made any attempt to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is their bill,\u201d Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Georgia) said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a government shutdown, they\u2019re in control of the House, the Senate and the White House. It\u2019s their shutdown.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans are using a more partisan strategy toward keeping the government open than they did during Trump\u2019s first term, when Trump invited Schumer to the White House to negotiate over cheeseburgers. (The 2018 sit-down did not prevent a brief government shutdown, the first of two during Trump\u2019s first term.)\n\nRepublicans blamed Democrats for not striking a deal with them to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year during the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get caught up because of the failure of the Senate and the House to do appropriations last year,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. (Democrats controlled the Senate last year, while Republicans controlled the House.)\n\nA shutdown \u201cwill be entirely of the Democrats\u2019 making if it happens,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters."
