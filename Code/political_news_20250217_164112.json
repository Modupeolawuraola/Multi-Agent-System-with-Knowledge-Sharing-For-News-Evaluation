            "full_content": "BUKAVU, Congo (AP) \u2014 Rwanda-backed rebels have occupied a second major city in mineral-rich eastern Congo, the government said Sunday, as M23 rebels confirmed they were in the city to restore order after it was abandoned by Congolese forces.\n\nThe Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes the M23, said in a statement that its fighters \u201cdecided to assist the population of Bukavu\u201d in addressing its security challenges under the \u201cold regime\u201d in the city of 1.3 million people.\n\n\u201cOur forces have been working to restore the security for the people and their property, much to the satisfaction of the entire population,\u201d alliance spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement.\n\nThe rebels saw little resistance from government forces against the unprecedented expansion of their reach after years of fighting. Congo\u2019s government vowed to restore order in Bukavu but there was no sign of soldiers. Many were seen fleeing on Saturday alongside thousands of civilians.\n\nThe M23 are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo\u2019s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that\u2019s critical for much of the world\u2019s technology. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the United Nations experts.\n\nThe fighting has displaced more than 6 million people in the region, creating the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.\n\nRebels vow to \u2018clean up\u2019 disorder\n\nBernard Maheshe Byamungu, one of the M23 leaders who has been sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council for rights abuses, stood in front of the South Kivu governor\u2019s office in Bukavu and told residents they have been living in a \u201cjungle.\u201d\n\nM23 rebels enter the centre of east Congo\u2019s second-largest city, Bukavu, and take control of the South Kivu province administrative office, Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025.

It\u2019s cowardice,\u201d Byamungu added.\n\nFears of regional escalation\n\nUnlike in 2012, when the M23 briefly seized Goma and withdrew after international pressure, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.\n\nThe fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. The M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group.\n\nRwanda says the militia group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies it.\n\nBut the new face of the M23 in the region \u2014 Corneille Nangaa \u2014 is not Tutsi, giving the group \u201ca new, more diverse, Congolese face, as M23 has always been seen as a Rwanda-backed armed group defending Tutsi minorities,\u201d according to Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol.\n\nCongo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi, whose government on Saturday asserted that Bukavu remained under its control, has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict.\n\nCongo\u2019s forces were being supported in Goma by troops from South Africa and in Bukavu by troops from Burundi. But Burundi\u2019s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest on social media his country would not retaliate in the fighting.\n\nThe conflict was high on the African Union summit\u2019s agenda in Ethiopia over the weekend, with U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warning it risked spiraling into a regional conflagration.\n\nStill, African leaders and the international community have been reluctant to take decisive action against M23 or Rwanda, which has one of Africa\u2019s most powerful militaries. Most continue to call for a ceasefire and a dialogue between Congo and the rebels.\n\nM23 rebels guard outside the South Kivu province administrative office, at the centre of east Congo\u2019s second-largest city, Bukavu, Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025.

            "full_content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 At least nine people have died in the most recent round of harsh weather to pummel the U.S., including eight people in Kentucky who died as creeks swelled from heavy rain and water covered roads.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that hundreds of people stranded by flooding had to be rescued. President Donald Trump approved the state\u2019s request for a disaster declaration, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts throughout the state.\n\nBeshear said most of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water.\n\n\u201cSo folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the search and rescue phase, and I am very proud of all the Kentuckians that are out there responding, putting their lives on the line.\u201d\n\nBeshear said there have been 1,000 rescues across the state since the storms began Saturday. The storms knocked out power to about 39,000 homes, but Beshear warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase outages.\n\nParts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\n\u201cThe effects will continue for awhile, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,\u201d Oravec said Sunday.\n\nIn Alabama, the weather service in Birmingham said it had confirmed an EF-1 tornado touched down overnight in Hale County. Storms there and elsewhere in the state destroyed or damaged a handful of mobile homes, downed trees and toppled power lines, but no injuries were immediately reported. Extensive damage to downtown roofs and buildings was reported in the northern city of Tuscumbia, with authorities asking people to avoid the area, according to WAFF-TV and other local media.\n\nA state of emergency was declared for parts of Obion County, Tennessee, after a levee failed on Saturday, flooding the small community of Rives, home to around 300 people in the western part of the state. \u201cThere will be mandatory evacuations in effect for the residents in Rives due to the rising water, no electricity, and freezing temperatures creating a life-threatening situation,\u201d Mayor Steve Carr said in a statement Sunday.\n\nIn Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell.\n\nDangerously cold wind chill temperatures as low as 50 degrees below zero (minus 45.6) were expected in most of North Dakota, which remained under an \u201cextreme cold warning\u201d along with parts of Montana and large swaths of South Dakota and Minnesota, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nKentucky faces severe flooding\n\nWater submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia late Saturday into Sunday. Both states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas.\n\nThe mother and child were swept away Saturday night in Kentucky\u2019s Bonnieville community, Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, county Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. There were a total of four deaths in Hart County, Beshear said.\n\nThe Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it had closed its emergency department and transferred all patients to two other hospitals in the region due to a nearby river flooding.\n\nPhotos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff\u2019s office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides.\n\nHigh winds brought down trees and power poles across Albermarle County, Virginia. The Charlottesville Police Department said Sunday on social media that officers\u2019 response times could be delayed due to \u201can overwhelming number of weather-related calls for service.\u201d Police urged residents to stay off the roads.\n\nPower outages were reported along much of the Eastern Seaboard, from New York south to Georgia.\n\nIn West Virginia, 13 southern counties were under a state of emergency for flooding and some areas were cut off to vehicle traffic Sunday. Several volunteer fire departments dealt with flooding in their own buildings while answering rescue and evacuation calls.\n\nRockies, Midwest, Northeast hit with snow storms, Polar Vortex on the way\n\nIce and snow made road travel treacherous in large swaths of Michigan, which remained under a winter weather advisory until Monday afternoon. Michigan State Police reported 114 crashes Sunday around the Detroit area since snow started falling Saturday.\n\n\u201cFortunately, most were one-car spin outs and there were no serious injuries,\u201d Michigan State Police said on X. \u201cA majority of them were caused by drivers just going too fast or following too close.\u201d\n\nAuthorities in Colorado reported eight people were killed in fatal vehicle crashes since Valentine\u2019s Day and warned drivers to be cautious as the weather made driving more difficult. The causes of the fatal crashes weren\u2019t immediately known.\n\nAlso in Colorado, three state patrol cruisers that had pulled over along roadsides were struck by other vehicles, including one on Sunday where a trooper had stopped as officials prepared to close a road because of ice. In each case the troopers were out of their cruisers at the time and were uninjured.\n\nMeteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \u201clife-threatening cold\u201d in the northern Plains on Monday and Tuesday mornings. It said northeastern Montana could see temperatures as low as 45 degrees below zero (-42.7 degrees Celsius) and wind chills down to 60 below (-51 degrees Celsius).\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for numerous areas of the Rocky Mountains stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with the danger rated highest in Utah.\n\n__\n\nSophia Tareen in Chicago, Nadia Lathan in Austin, Texas, John Raby in Cross Lanes, West Virginia, Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump will ask the Supreme Court to allow him to fire the head of a government ethics watchdog agency in the first appeal from his litigious second term to reach the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nAt the center of the appeal is Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel and whom Trump fired this month despite protections enacted by Congress that require an administration to show cause before dismissing someone from the post before their five-year term has ended.\n\nA federal district court temporarily blocked Dellinger\u2019s dismissal while it considers his case, and the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit late Saturday declined to overrule that decision. The Justice Department prepared its appeal to the Supreme Court within hours of that decision.\n\nThe Justice Department described the district court\u2019s ruling as an \u201cunprecedented assault on the separation of powers,\u201d according to a copy of the appeal obtained by CNN.\n\n\u201cUntil now, as far as we are aware, no court in American history has wielded an injunction to force the president to retain an agency head whom the president believes should not be entrusted with executive power and to prevent the president from relying on his preferred replacement,\u201d the administration asserts in its appeal.\n\nOn the one hand, the case carries enormous significance. It is the first appeal of what will likely be many to reach the high court challenging Trump\u2019s whirlwind of executive actions as he has sought to consolidate power in the executive branch during the opening weeks of his second term. In other contexts, several conservative Supreme Court justices have indicated they might support Trump\u2019s broader goal of having greater control over executive branch employees.\n\nBut on the other hand, the preliminary posture of the case presents a major challenge to the Department of Justice. Temporary restraining orders like the one issued in this case generally are not appealable. They are usually put in place for a few weeks at most to give lower courts time to review the legal arguments presented by both sides.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court rejects the Trump administration at this stage, the court will almost certainly get another crack at it in a few months. It is at least possible that some of the justices will write short opinions explaining their position on the broader merits questions at issue in Dellinger\u2019s case. Either way, the Supreme Court could move relatively quickly on the emergency appeal, likely providing some indication about how it will handle the request early this week.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel \u2014 which is distinct from the special counsels appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations \u2014 handles allegations of whistleblower retaliation and is an independent agency created by Congress.\n\nIn a 2-1 decision on Saturday night, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit said the temporary order allowing Dellinger to temporarily remain in the post was not appealable. Reviewing such an order, the court said, \u201cwould be inconsistent with governing legal standards and ill-advised.\u201d\n\nGranting a stay of a temporary restraining order, the court ruled, \u201cwould set a problematic precedent. If we were to accept the proposition that a party\u2019s bare assertion of \u2018extraordinary harm\u2019 for fourteen days can render a TRO appealable, many litigants subject to TROs would be encouraged to appeal them and to seek a stay.\u201d\n\nTwo Biden appointees, Circuit Judges J. Michelle Childs and Florence Pan, voted to dismiss the Trump administration\u2019s request for a stay. US Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump nominee, said he would have granted the government\u2019s request.\n\nDellinger\u2019s lawsuit is one of at least three brought by officials fired by Trump that test a president\u2019s power to oust heads of independent agencies.\n\nThe lawsuits rely in part on a 1935 Supreme Court precedent, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, that allowed Congress to include for-cause protections for members on independent federal agency boards. Several conservative justices have signaled an uneasiness with the decision in recent years, and the Department of Justice under Trump has said it believes the protections are unconstitutional.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with new developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

European leaders have also not been asked to join the discussions, and are due to meet instead on Monday in Paris at a summit hastily arranged by the French president, as fears grow the continent is being locked out of negotiations. The separate meetings follow a turbulent week where Washington has signalled a drastic change in its approach to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe White House's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed he was travelling to Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening for the first face-to-face talks between the US and Russia towards ending the conflict. US President Donald Trump revealed on Sunday that Witkoff had met with Putin already \"for a very extended period, like about three hours\". Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer and friend of Trump, was in Moscow this week to secure the release of a US teacher imprisoned on charges of marijuana possession. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz are also set to meet Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia, less than a week after Trump held a phone call with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. The call on Wednesday brought to an end a three-year freeze on direct contact between Moscow and Washington. Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out accepting a peace deal negotiated without Ukraine, telling US television network NBC on Sunday that he would \"never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never\". Ukraine end game: What each side wants from a peace deal\n\nUS mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing Witkoff said US officials were speaking separately with Ukrainian officials and that Ukraine was \"part of the talks\" - but he did not indicate whether he expected Kyiv to be present in Saudi Arabia. Trump told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday that he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks, though he did not say how. He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine. Asked by the BBC when he believed any peace negotiations could bear fruit and end the fighting, Trump said only that \"we're working to get it done\" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies.\n\nReuters The US President said his envoy Witkoff had already met with Putin earlier in the week\n\nMeanwhile, Rubio downplayed the Saudi Arabia talks, saying one meeting would not solve the war and that a formal negotiating process - that would mediate between Ukraine, Russia and third parties - had not yet been set up. He told CBS News, however, that the next few days would determine if Putin was serious about achieving peace. It is against this backdrop that a group of European leaders - including the UK's Keir Starmer, Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte, Germany's chancellor Olaf Scholz and the European Commission's Ursula von der Leyen - will meet in Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron will hold an informal meeting in the afternoon on Ukraine and European security. Ahead of the summit, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by \"putting our own troops on the ground if necessary\". Writing in the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, the prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine \"is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future\". US Ukraine envoy Kellog had earlier dismissed concerns over Europe not being invited to Saudi Arabia, arguing previous negotiations had failed due to the involvement of too many parties. \"It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,\" he said on Saturday.\n\nWatch: Trump's motorcade drives lap of Daytona 500 racetrack"

On Saturday night, he received perfect scores on four of his dunks, becoming just the fourth player to ever receive four 50s. The others were LaVine (2016), Gordon (2020) and Derrick Jones Jr. (2020).\n\n\"I was extremely honored to be a part of this weekend,\" McClung told reporters after the win. \"I genuinely love this contest, and [I'm] just very appreciative.\"\n\nBut while the Dunk Contest has become the McClung Show, LaVine and Gordon put on a performance for the ages back in 2016.\n\nLaVine was the defending champion after winning it in 2015, and was the favorite to repeat. But Gordon brought the heat, forcing a pair of dunk-offs to decide it. The event even had controversy, as Gordon's final dunk of the night surprisingly received just a 47 from the judges.\n\nLaVine left no doubt on his final dunk, hitting a between-the-legs jam from the free-throw line to seal his second consecutive victory.\n\nIt wouldn't be the last time Gordon was a controversial runner-up\u2014he also finished second in 2020 behind Jones.\n\nAs for LaVine, he's one of just five NBA players to ever go back-to-back, alongside McClung, Nate Robinson (2009-10), Jason Richardson (2002-03) and Michael Jordan (1987-88). His return to challenge the modern king of the contest, McClung, would be appointment viewing."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture last week issued a conditional license for an avian flu vaccine for use in chickens, amid an outbreak ravaging poultry flocks, contributing to the sky-high price of eggs.\n\nZoetis, the manufacturer behind the vaccine, announced the conditional approval Friday, saying in a news release its scientists had begun updating its existing avian flu vaccine in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the administration and with Congress, and we\u2019re very excited today to get the licensure for (the vaccine) in poultry, which we think will be a tool that we will help support the government as they deem necessary,\u201d Zoetis CEO Kristin Peck told CNBC on Friday.\n\nThe conditional license was granted based on the \u201cthe demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy,\u201d Zoetis said. A conditional license can generally be used to address an emergency situation or special circumstance, the company noted, and is issued for a set period of time.\n\nThe company has previously developed vaccines for avian flu, including one used by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to protect California condors in 2023, Zoetis said, noting, \u201cThe decision to vaccinate commercial poultry flocks rests solely with national regulatory authorities in consultation with their local poultry sector,\u201d the company\u2019s news release said.\n\nCNN reached out to the USDA for comment Sunday.\n\nWhile other countries already vaccinate chickens against bird flu, the US approach has long been focused on eradicating the virus, mainly through culling flocks of birds when a case is identified. Historically, vaccination has been thought to carry a number of complications, including making it difficult to detect the virus in inoculated birds and trade concerns.\n\nBut the strategy may be shifting as bird flu spreads to other types of animals, like cattle, and becomes more difficult to contain: Over the last 30 days, 146 flocks have been confirmed to have avian flu, affecting more than 20.5 million birds, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, part of the USDA. More than 150 million birds have been affected since the current outbreak began in 2022.\n\nAbout 70 bird flu infections have been confirmed in people in the US since March 2024, and an older person in Louisiana died last year. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, has said the risk to the public remains low, though those who work on farms with infected animals or who have backyard poultry flocks are at a higher risk of infection.\n\nDirector of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett is preparing, along with Secretary of Agriculture Brook Rollins, to present a plan to President Donald Trump to combat bird flu, including options that would sidestep the need to kill chickens, he told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is have better ways with biosecurity and medication and so on\u201d to avoid killing chickens, Hassett said. \u201cAnd so having a smart perimeter is what we\u2019re working on, and we\u2019re finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Americans can continue to expect high prices for eggs this year due to the ongoing avian flu outbreak and inflation, according to new estimates.\n\nEgg prices are estimated to increase about 20% in 2025, compared to about 2.2% for food prices in general, according to the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s price outlook. Beef, coffee and orange juice are among groceries with higher prices, but eggs are uniquely affected by the aggressive strain of avian flu, which has strained supply.\n\nCNN\u2019s Aileen Graef, Jen Christensen, Brenda Goodman and Jamie Gumbrecht contributed to this report."

Upon arrival, the officers found the victim at a nearby parking lot waiting with her father, the affidavit stated.\n\nThe victim, who has been in a months-long relationship with Armstrong per the document, told police she saw a text message from another woman on his phone, leading to a verbal argument. The victim told police that Armstrong, 56, had been drinking, and became irate during the argument, demanding the apartment keys, which she gave him, the affidavit read.\n\nAt that point, while on the phone with another person, Armstrong picked up a pistol, walked around the kitchen island and struck the victim on the right side of her face with the gun, the document stated. Per the document, Armstrong then loaded the gun with a full magazine and said \"I am going to shoot you.\"\n\nThe victim told police she then left the apartment and walked to the 7-Eleven on the corner of Ross Avenue and North Griffin Street to wait for family to arrive, the affidavit read. Responding officers reported seeing a mark on the victim's right cheek, per the document.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, officers spoke to a witness who said they had seen Armstrong drinking and swearing at the victim.\n\nThe affidavit stated that officers knocked on the apartment door and took Armstrong into custody without incident. Officers found the pistol under the couch where Armstrong stated he was sleeping with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber, the document said.\n\nPer the affidavit, the victim and Armstrong had been in an \"intimate/cohabitating relationship since September of 2024.\" The document also stated that before Saturday's offense, there had been multiple instances of family violence \u2014 including an incident where the victim said Armstrong strangled her \u2014 that were not reported to police because she did not want to get Armstrong \"into any trouble or cause him to lose his job.\"\n\nAccording to jail records, Armstrong was booked into jail shortly before 7:30 a.m. Saturday on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. His bond was set at $35,000, jail records showed. Armstrong has since posted bond.\n\nWFAA reached out to the Dallas Mavericks and Armstrong for comment.\n\nArmstrong's attorney, Larry Taylor, responded with the following statement on Sunday night:\n\n\"We are in the preliminary stages of conducting our own independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding yesterday's incident involving my client Darrell Armstrong.\n\nMr. Armstrong has been an upstanding member of the Dallas community during his playing days and as a coach.\n\nWe will have more to say about this incident in the coming days.\"\n\nThe Mavericks sent WFAA the following statement Sunday afternoon:\n\n\"The Dallas Mavericks are aware of an incident involving a member of our staff and are gathering all relevant information surrounding the incident. We take this matter seriously. The employee has been placed on administrative suspension pending the outcome of legal proceedings. This matter is currently under review by the appropriate legal authorities. Due to this fact, we will allow the legal process to run its course and we will refrain from further comment while proceedings are ongoing.\"\n\nArmstrong is in the midst of his 10th season as an assistant coach after joining the Mavs during the 2008-2009 NBA season. Prior to starting his coaching career, Armstrong played in the NBA for 14 seasons, spending time with Orlando, New Orleans, Indiana, New Jersey and Dallas. The former basketball player earned the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man Award and Most Improved Player Award in 1999.\n\nIn 2004, Armstrong was traded from New Orleans to the Mavericks and played 114 games, even appearing with the team in the 2006 NBA Finals."

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend, as recently hired employees who review the safety of food ingredients, medical devices and other products were fired.\n\nProbationary employees across the FDA received notices Saturday evening that their jobs were being eliminated, according to three FDA staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe total number of positions eliminated was not clear Sunday, but the firings appeared to focus on employees in the agency\u2019s centers for food, medical devices and tobacco products \u2014 which includes oversight of electronic cigarettes. It was not clear whether FDA employees who review drugs were exempted.\n\nOn Friday, some officials expected the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to fire 5,200 probationary employees across its agencies, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting. HHS oversees NIH, FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among other things.\n\nPeople who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity on Friday said the number of probationary employees to be laid off at the CDC would total nearly 1,300. But as of early Sunday afternoon, about 700 people had received notices, according to three people who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They said none of the CDC layoffs affected the young doctors and researchers who track diseases in what\u2019s known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service.\n\nThe FDA is headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington and employs nearly 20,000 people. It\u2019s long been a target of newly sworn-in health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who last year accused the agency of waging a \u201cwar on public health\u201d for not approving unproven treatments such as psychedelics, stem cells and chelation therapy.\n\nKennedy also has called for eliminating thousands of chemicals and colorings from U.S. foods. But the cuts at FDA include staffers responsible for reviewing the safety of new food additives and ingredients, according to an FDA staffer familiar with the firings.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday afternoon.\n\nNearly half of the FDA\u2019s $6.9 billion budget comes from fees paid by companies the agency regulates, including drug and medical device makers, which allows the agency to hire extra scientists to swiftly review products. Eliminating those positions will not reduce government spending.\n\nA former FDA official said cutting recent hires could backfire, eliminating staffers who tend to be younger and have more up-to-date technical skills. The FDA\u2019s workforce skews toward older workers who have spent one or two decades at the agency, and the Government Accountability Office noted in 2022 that the FDA \u201chas historically faced challenges in recruiting and retaining\u201d staff due to better money in the private sector.\n\n\u201cYou want to bring in new blood,\u201d said Peter Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner under President George W. Bush. \u201cYou want people with new ideas, greater enthusiasm and the latest thinking in terms of technology.\u201d\n\nMitch Zeller, former FDA director for tobacco, said the firings are a way to \u201cdemoralize and undermine the spirit of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe combined effect of what they\u2019re trying to do is going to destroy the ability to recruit and retain talent,\u201d Zeller said.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s inspection force has been particularly strained in recent years after a wave of departures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of the agency\u2019s current inspectors are recent hires. It was not immediately clear whether those employees were exempted.\n\nFDA inspectors are responsible for overseeing thousands of food, drug, tobacco and medical device facilities worldwide, though the AP reported last year that the agency faced a backlog of roughly 2,000 uninspected drug facilities that hadn\u2019t been visited since before the pandemic.\n\nThe agency\u2019s inspection force have also been criticized for not moving faster to catch recent problems involving infant formula, baby food and eyedrops.\n\n___\n\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "full_content": "Captain America: Brave New World is looking presidential after all as Marvel Studios attempts to reboot the franchise with an entirely new cast\n\nThe year\u2019s first tentpole is reporting a four-day domestic opening of $100 million over the long Valentine\u2019s Day/Presidents Day weekend, including $88.4 million for the three days. Numbers should shift again on Sunday, but either way, it is coming in ahead of expectations.\n\nGlobally, it\u2019s starting off with $192.4 million after launching to $92.4 million internationally.\n\nThe movie scored one of the top domestic openings for the Presidents Day holiday and the biggest opening of 2025 to date. That\u2019s no small feat considering that many critics dissed the movie. Nor were some moviegoers impressed \u2014 Brave New World received a B- CinemaScore from audiences, the worst grade given to any title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nNot all viewers feel the same, of course. Brave New World boasts a pleasing 80 percent audience ranking on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe movie\u2019s over-performance underscores the pent-up demand for a big event pic. It also underscores the value of appealing to a ethnically diverse cast, as well as kids and parents, who loved the film, according to PostTrak. This gives Captain America the advantage of playing as a family film. In terms of the ethnic breakdown, Black moviegoers (23 percent) over-indexed by a large degree. Caucasians made up 35 percent of ticket buyers, followed by Latinos (23 percent), Asians (10 percent) and Native American/Other, per exit polling service PostTrak. The gender split was 62 percent male and 48 percent female; another sign that it is playing to a broader audience than just fanboys, who can often represent as much as 70 percent of ticket buyers.\n\nIt\u2019s back to the basics when it comes to the new movie, which sees Anthony Mackie\u2018s Sam Wilson take up the mantle of Captain America, the hero previously played by Chris Evans. Costing around $180 million to produce before marketing, the movie stays away from sci-fi elements and the multiverse and has been described by Marvel boss Kevin Feige as a \u201crelatively grounded action film,\u201d akin to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the 2014 film that starred Evans and introduced Mackie to the MCU (put another way, no multiverse).\n\nDirected by Julius Onah, Brave New World also stars Harrison Ford as newly elected U.S. President Thaddeus \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross, who wants to bring Captain America aboard in an official military position. But before Wilson can make a decision, he uncovers a nefarious global plot that includes facing off with Ross when the president unexpectedly transforms into the Red Hulk. Danny Ramirez also stars, portraying Joaquin Torres/Falcon, alongside Liv Tyler, Tim Blake Nelson and Rosa Salazar.\n\nThe film scored the fourth-biggest Presidents Day four-day launch behind three other Marvel pics; 2018\u2019s Black Panther ($242.2 million), which shattered records for director Ryan Coogler and Marvel/Disney in becoming the first Hollywood tentpole to feature a virtually all-Black cast; Ryan Reynolds\u2019 maverick and groundbreaking 2016 film Deadpool ($152.2 million) and 2023\u2019s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ($120 million), not adjusted for inflation.\n\nCaptain America\u2018s performance is good news for Marvel, which had to take serious stock of its strategy and future after several films faltered, culminating with The Marvels. The studio is in a far better place now thanks to the stunning success of Deadpool & Wolverine, which became the top-grossing R-rated pic of all time after earning north of $1.3 billion globally in the summer of 2024. The studio is hoping for a solid swing with Captain America, which faced its share of challenges in getting to the big screen, but that will depend on its staying power.\n\nComing in at No. 2 in North America is Paddington in Peru, the third installment in StudioCanal\u2019s beloved franchise (Columbia Pictures/Sony is distributing the threequel domestically).\n\nPaddington 3 is reporting an estimated four-day launch of $16 million, including north of $13 million for the three days. It boasts a 94 percent critics\u2019 score on Rotten Tomatoes and an A CinemaScore from audiences. It has already earned $115.8 million internationally, including $19 million from Sony-distributed markets for a global cume of more than $131 million through Sunday, if not north of $140 million.\n\nThe $90 million film was developed and fully financed by StudioCanal, which is also a partner on Miramax, Universal and Working Title\u2019s Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, the long-awaited fourth and final installment in the series, headlined by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. (Miramax financed and produced).\n\nBridget Jones went straight to Universal\u2019s streaming service Peacock in the U.S. in a Valentine\u2019s gift to existing subscribers and in a bid to lure new subs. It is, however, getting a theatrical release overseas, where it opened to an impressive $35.5 million (Universal is handling the pic in most markets).\n\nAmong holdovers, Universal and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s Dog Man continued to bark away, earning $12.5 million over the four-day holiday for a domestic tally of $69.6 million through its third weekend.\n\nSpyglass\u2019 Valentine\u2019s Day-themed slasher pic Heart Eyes enjoyed a major boost in its second weekend thanks to the holiday, grossing an estimated $11.1 million for the four days for a domestic tally of $22.6 million through Monday against a modest $18 million budget. Sony\u2019s Screen Gems is distributing the film.\n\nThe Chinese-language animated blockbuster Ze Zha 2 \u2014 which has earned north of $1.1 billion overseas\u2014 opened in six theaters in the U.S. It rounded out the top five with a stellar four-day gross of $8.3 million.\n\nAt the awards box office, Searchlight\u2019s Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet crossed the $70 million mark domestically in another notable milestone after crossing $100 million in worldwide ticket sales last week. In the coming days, the biopic is expected to become Searchlight\u2019s fifth-biggest film ever, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nEstimates could shift by Monday morning."

            "full_content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Even as he\u2019s vowed to push the United States ahead in artificial intelligence research, President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to alter federal government contracts with chipmakers and slap new tariffs on the semiconductor industry may put new speed bumps in front of the tech industry.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has said he would place tariffs on foreign production of computer chips and semiconductors in order to return chip manufacturing to the U.S. The president and Republican lawmakers have also threatened to end the CHIPS and Science Act, a sweeping Biden administration-era law that also sought to boost domestic production.\n\nBut economic experts have warned that Trump\u2019s dual-pronged approach could slow, or potentially harm, the administration\u2019s goal of ensuring that the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in artificial intelligence research.\n\nSaikat Chaudhuri, an expert on corporate growth and innovation at U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, called Trump\u2019s derision of the CHIPS Act surprising because one of the biggest bottlenecks for the advancement of AI has been chip production. Most countries, Chaudhuri said, are trying to encourage chip production and the import of chips at favorable rates.\n\n\u201cWe have seen what the shortage has done in everything from AI to even cars,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the pandemic, cars had to do with fewer or less powerful chips in order to just deal with the supply constraints.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration helped shepherd in the law following supply disruptions that occurred after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 when a shortage of chips stalled factory assembly lines and fueled inflation \u2014 threatened to plunge the U.S. economy into recession. When pushing for the investment, lawmakers also said they were concerned about efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production.\n\nIn this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, Taiwan\u2019s President Lai Ching-te speaks at a press conference after a security meeting about U.S. President Trump\u2019s tariffs on trade partners and semiconductors at the Presidential office in Taipei, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025.

That funding helped to draw in private capital and would enable the U.S. to produce 30% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips, up from 0% when the Biden-Harris administration succeeded Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nThe administration promised tens of billions of dollars to support the construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness. In August, the Commerce Department pledged to provide up to $6.6 billion so that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. could expand the facilities it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the most advanced microchips are produced domestically for the first time.\n\nBut Trump has said he believes that companies entering into those contracts with the federal government, such as TSMC, \u201cdidn\u2019t need money\u201d in order to prioritize chipmaking in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they\u2019re not going to want to pay at 25, 50 or even 100% tax,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTSMC held board meetings for the first time in the U.S. last week. Trump has signaled that if companies want to avoid tariffs they have to build their plants in the U.S. \u2014 without help from the government. Taiwan also dispatched two senior economic affairs officials to Washington to meet with the Trump administration in a bid to potentially fend off a 100% tariff Trump has threatened to impose on chips.\n\nIf the Trump administration does levy tariffs, Chaudhuri said, one immediate concern is that prices of goods that use semiconductors and chips will rise because the higher costs associated with tariffs are typically passed to consumers.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s your smartphone, whether it\u2019s your gaming device, whether it\u2019s your smart fridge \u2014 probably also your smart features of your car \u2014 anything and everything we use nowadays has a chip in it,\u201d he said. \u201cFor consumers, it\u2019s going to be rather painful. Manufacturers are not going to be able to absorb that.\u201d\n\nEven tech giants such as Nvidia will eventually feel the pain of tariffs, he said, despite their margins being high enough to absorb costs at the moment.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all going to be affected by this negatively,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see anybody benefiting from this except for those countries who jump on the bandwagon competitively and say, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re going to introduce something like the CHIPS Act.\u2019\u201d\n\nBroadly based tariffs would be a shot in the foot of the U.S. economy, said Brett House, a professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School. Tariffs would not only raise the costs for businesses and households across the board, he said \u2014 for the U.S. AI sector, they would massively increase the costs of one of their most important inputs: high-powered chips from abroad.\n\n\u201cIf you cut off, repeal or threaten the CHIPS Act at the same time as you\u2019re putting in broadly based tariffs on imports of AI and other computer technology, you would be hamstringing the industry acutely,\u201d House said.\n\nSuch tariffs would reduce the capacity to create a domestic chip building sector, sending a signal for future investments that the policy outlook is uncertain, he said. That would in turn put a chilling effect on new allocations of capital to the industry in the U.S. while making more expensive the existing flow of imported chips.\n\n\u201cAmerican technological industrial leadership has always been supported by maintaining openness to global markets and to immigration and labor flows,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd shutting that openness down has never been a recipe for American success.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak and Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report."
