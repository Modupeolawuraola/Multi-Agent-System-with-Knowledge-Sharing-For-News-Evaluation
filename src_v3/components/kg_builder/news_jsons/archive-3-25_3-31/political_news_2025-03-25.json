            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday seeking to boost proof of citizenship requirements for voter registration, which critics say could disenfranchise poor and older voters who don\u2019t have easy access to citizenship documents like passports or birth certificates.\n\nRepublican state lawmakers have long sought to require such documents for voter registration, but a major hurdle has been a Supreme Court ruling mandating that states accept, at least for federal elections, the generic voter registration form offered by the US Election Assistance Commission, which currently does not require documents proving citizenship.\n\nTrump\u2019s order directs the EAC to add the requirement and to withhold election funding from states that don\u2019t enforce the requirement for voters who use the federal form to register. The EAC is currently made up of two Democratic and two Republican appointees.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Election Assistance Commission is carefully reviewing the President\u2019s Executive Order and determining the next steps in enhancing the integrity of voter registration and state and federal elections,\u201d EAC Chairman Donald Palmer said in a statement. \u201cWe also anticipate consulting with state and local election officials.\u201d\n\nThe order also instructs the Department of Homeland Security to work with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to review state voter rolls in an effort to identify foreign nationals on the rolls, and to turn over that list to the state and local officials tasked with managing elections.\n\nThe directive is likely to raise alarm bells among voting rights advocates who have argued that DHS immigration databases are not equipped for vetting voter rolls without proper guardrails, as they pose a risk of identifying naturalized citizens for purges.\n\nThe order facilitates potentially sweeping changes to election practices long sought by conservatives while capitalizing on Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. The impact of the order won\u2019t be fully clear until it is implemented, and parts of it could be challenged in court.\n\nElections are run by state and local officials, with the federal government playing only a limited role. But Trump\u2019s order uses a number of tools, including the threat of withholding federal funding, to push changes to election policies that Republicans say will make elections more secure. Their opponents counter such changes create needless hurdles for legitimate voters.\n\nIn a blog post, Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, called Trump\u2019s order \u201can executive power grab\u201d with the potential to disenfranchise millions of voters. \u201cThe aim here is voter suppression pure and simple,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s executive order is unlawful. It would prevent eligible Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote,\u201d Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump administration is weaponizing the federal government and trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe order was welcomed by conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation. \u201cPresident Trump is finally taking the action long needed to put the resources of federal agencies like the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to work helping states, instead of trying to hinder their efforts to reform our election process,\u201d said Hans von Spakovsky, manager of Heritage\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative.\n\nThe order also makes it easier for states to access such federal databases for their own list maintenance activities.\n\nTrump is also ordering his attorney general to take \u201cenforcement action\u201d against states that accept mail ballots that arrive after Election Day. Roughly 20 states, including some battleground states, currently do so, and the practice was the target of GOP litigation in the lead-up to the 2024 election, even as many of those states require a postmark confirming the ballots were in the mail by Election Day.\n\nCNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we explore the latest way congressional Republicans are showing their loyalty to President Donald Trump: targeting the judiciary. Plus, Steve Kornacki writes that next week\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court race will test whether Democrats can maintain their Trump-era edge in off-year elections.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nRepublican escalate their efforts to rein in the courts amid rulings that have halted Trump\u2019s agenda\n\nRepublican lawmakers are ramping up their attacks on the judiciary \u2014 and rushing to demonstrate they are in lockstep with President Donald Trump \u2014 amid court rulings that have blocked his agenda.\n\nFeeling pressure on that front from his right flank, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Tuesday floated the possibility of Congress eliminating some federal courts, Scott Wong, Melanie Zanona and Rebecca Kaplan report.\n\n\u201cWe do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts and all these other things,\u201d Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cBut desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.\u201d\n\nJohnson, a former constitutional attorney, later clarified that he was making a point about Congress\u2019 \u201cbroad authority\u201d over the \u201ccreation, maintenance and the governance\u201d of the courts. Article III of the Constitution established the Supreme Court but gave Congress the power to \u201cordain and establish\u201d lower federal courts.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who plans to hold a hearing focused on district judges next week, said he\u2019s speaking with GOP appropriators about what he called \u201clegislative remedies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got money, spending, the appropriations process to help try to address some of this,\u201d Jordan said, without adding further details.\n\nWhile these comments may fire up the MAGA base, Republicans are a long way from making good on them. It\u2019s far from clear that enough members of their caucus would support defunding courts in the House, where the party holds a narrow majority. And then there\u2019s the issue of the Senate, where the 60-vote threshold comes into play and Republicans control 53 seats.\n\nThe same issues would also arise if Republicans pursued impeachment of judges such as District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump\u2019s using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. (The bar for conviction is even higher in the Senate, at 67 votes.)\n\nHouse GOP leaders are pursuing one potential off-ramp for a vote that would be less politically precarious: Johnson backed a bill from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that would seek to limit district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, the sort of rulings that have hampered Trump from fully enacting his plans on issues from deportation to federal agency cuts.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said the chamber would vote on the bill next week, and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he\u2019d introduce similar legislation in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have a major malfunction in our federal judiciary, and practically every week another judge casts aside the tradition of restraint from the bench and opts to be the Trump resistance in robes,\u201d Issa told NBC News.\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court election will test a key Democratic advantage\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nNext week\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court election will reveal if what has been a Trump-era advantage for Democrats has endured despite the party\u2019s defeat in November.\n\nThis is the type of contest in which Democrats have been excelling of late \u2014 one that\u2019s oddly timed, for a lower-profile office and expected to be marked by modest overall turnout. Under these conditions, any differences in motivation and intensity between the two parties\u2019 bases are magnified. And that has netted out to the benefit of Democrats, who rely increasingly on a set of highly educated and higher-income voters who have been the most politically engaged in the Trump era.\n\nJust consider Wisconsin\u2019s recent history. Despite being nominally nonpartisan, Supreme Court elections are shaped by unmistakably partisan contours. And, compared to four high-turnout general election races, the last Supreme Court election, also held in the spring, stands out as the lone blowout.\n\nThis has been the trend not just in Wisconsin but throughout the country, one that seemed to accelerate following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Between the summer of 2022 and the fall of 2024, 15 special elections for House seats were held. Democrats swept the three that were heavily contested by both parties and posted some eye-popping gains in others that were assumed to be noncompetitive.\n\nThe disproportionately high activation of more educated and affluent voters played a key role. In a February 2024 House special election for a Long Island-based district in New York, for example, turnout in areas with the highest concentration of white voters with college degrees tracked 15-20 points higher than in areas with the lowest concentration.\n\nThis was also evident in the 2023 Supreme Court election in Wisconsin that the Democratic-favored candidate won. In that race, turnout was disproportionately high in Dane County, home to the University of Wisconsin and the highest share of white voters with college degrees in the state.\n\nDane County has become a massive vote bank for Democrats in the state, and one they are increasingly reliant upon as Republicans have built strength in rural and small-town Wisconsin. And in the 2023 court election, it punched above its weight. Not only did the Democratic-favored candidate win Dane by 64 points, the county also accounted for just over 13% of all votes cast statewide. By comparison, in last year\u2019s presidential race, it made up only 10.7% of the statewide vote pool.\n\nMore broadly, if you combine all of the counties in Wisconsin where the share of white voters with college degrees exceeds the statewide average, they accounted for just under 38% of total turnout in the 2023 Supreme Court race, compared to 34.7% in last year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nThe problem for Democrats, of course, is that their pronounced edge in off-year and special elections didn\u2019t translate into victory last November, when the electorate was much larger. This reflects a role reversal for the two parties. Until recently, Democrats enjoyed an advantage with less-engaged voters and the general view was that an expanded electorate would favor them. But in 2024, it was Trump who won support from voters who don\u2019t typically participate in nonpresidential elections, many of them younger and nonwhite.\n\nThat dynamic will be put to the test next Tuesday. If the upscale end of the Democratic coalition is still intensely and atypically engaged in Trump\u2019s second term, it will be apparent in the results \u2014 and will serve as a signal of what may lie in ahead in similar lower-turnout races this year and next.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\ude28 Special election fears: Republican leaders have grown privately alarmed about the massive fundraising disparity their candidate, Randy Fine, faces in a special House election in a deep-red Florida district and have swooped in at the eleventh hour to help resuscitate his campaign.

Former U.S. diplomat gives insight\n\nWashington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.\n\n\n\nThe White House previously said the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"\n\nBut the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.\n\nThe vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.\n\n\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"\n\n\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"\n\nVance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"\n\nMr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.\n\nHeather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"\n\nConley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\""

            "full_content": "Team speed. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nVarious theories are kicking around to explain the speed and lack of caution surrounding the initial blizzard of executive actions in the second Trump administration. The most conventional is simply that having four years to mull what happened in his first term, Trump and his top advisers came prepared to hit the ground running. That may account for developments like the early start on Cabinet nominations, but there have been plenty of second-term presidencies that did not begin with breaking every norm constraining executive powers, so something else is clearly going on.\n\nOne very plausible explanation is that both Trump and Russell Vought, the OMB director at the wheel of the executive branch, are very invested in a tremendous expansion of presidential powers at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of the federal government. Moving ahead rapidly with executive orders, funding \u201cfreezes,\u201d and plans for presidential impoundments made a lot of sense as part of a very deliberate power grab.\n\nThen, even more obviously, there\u2019s the truly unanticipated X-factor in Trump 2.0: Elon Musk and his DOGE initiative, which was apparently put together on the fly at some point between Election Day and Inauguration Day with about as much preparation as might normally be associated with a Tesla joyride in the country. Musk is famously deploying the same shock-and-awe tactics he used in earlier corporate takeovers, based on the Silicon Valley motto of \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d He has indeed done that, with the chortling glee of a toddler overturning a Lego structure. So perhaps he\u2019s running wild, beyond the control of the congressional leaders and the Cabinet whose authority he has usurped. Or maybe Musk and Vought together have joined forces to hit the disruption accelerator.\n\nBut at some point it must occur to the more thoughtful minds of Team Trump \u2014 Susie Wiles, anybody? \u2014 that the politics of this onslaught of chaotic activism is a bit backward. For generations, conservatives have come to Washington, D.C., clutching an agenda of limited government and tax cuts. By and large, the former goal, which requires cuts in highly popular federal programs and deflationary reductions in federal employment and contracting, is tough politically; it\u2019s the broccoli on the plate, allegedly good for you but unpalatable without hollandaise sauce. Tax cuts supply the tasty dessert. Serving up dessert first is the best way to encourage broccoli consumption. That\u2019s the lesson of George W. Bush\u2019s successful push for tax cuts and then budget cuts in the early 2000s. The strategy was known as \u201cstarving the beast\u201d (as anti-tax guru Grover Norquist put it): Deny \u201cthe welfare state\u201d (the early 2000s term for the \u201cdeep state\u201d) the resources to expand its programs and services and budget cuts would flow naturally and with less public angst.\n\nThat\u2019s not how Team Trump is proceeding. And in fact, on top of all the pain and paralysis Trump and Musk are causing throughout the federal government, the administration is insisting on moving fast with another unpleasant agenda item: widespread tariffs, which both economists and the public believe will reignite inflation \u2014 the very issue that most clearly led to the 2024 election result \u2014 and could even induce the ultimate hell of stagflation, a shrinking economy with spiraling prices.\n\nSo why is the administration and its party insisting on front-loading so many politically hazardous actions? The most likely answer is that they believe they are living on borrowed time and have to smash the deep state and then grab the tax cuts made possible by budget cuts before the American people react in ways that might quickly reduce their power. For many years now, it\u2019s been clear that an agenda of cutting programs like Medicare and Medicaid (and perhaps even Social Security via the indirect method of disabling its administration) and shutting down major agencies like the Department of Education in order to finance tax cuts for the rich was not a big crowd-pleaser. So upon taking office, the leaders of Trump 2.0 had a distinct choice: Build up their political capital carefully with popular steps that would give them the credibility to take less popular steps later, or move fast and get what they wanted while they can. It does make a certain logic, and not just for political neophytes like Musk or stone anti-government Christian national ideologues like Vought, but for the 78-year-old narcissist serving in his final public-sector job.\n\nIn an interview with Ezra Klein, conservative wonk Santi Ruiz explained the psychology as reflected in DOGE\u2019s modus operandi:\n\n[W]hen you talk to people in and around DOGE, you hear the debt come up over and over again \u2014 that if we don\u2019t take this one opportunity now, while the window is open before the midterms, before public opinion naturally swings back and we lose the House, there\u2019s a green field to run into to try and cut, cut, cut. And this will never happen any other time.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong instinct here that this is our one shot. So if we\u2019re going to err on one side, we have to err on the side of cutting too much\u2026.\n\n[T]hat\u2019s very much the instinct: The Dems are going to stop us. They\u2019re going to come in, and we\u2019re going to do crazy oversight in the House in a year and a half. Public opinion will just change over time because cutting things is unpopular.\n\nFrom that perspective, which may be shared more broadly within Team Trump than we realize, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the polls show, or how more rational Republican politicians focused on their own futures want, or whether the whole revolution is doomed to eventual defeat. It\u2019s all carpe diem, baby, and let tomorrow take care of itself. That\u2019s certainly cold comfort for us innocent bystanders, who are fated to be collateral damage in somebody else\u2019s war on government."

            "full_content": "Michael Waltz and Pete Hegseth, chat buddies. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThere are many different ways to explain Donald Trump\u2019s improbable rise to the presidency in 2016, ranging from mere fatigue with Democratic governance to a vast revolt against a bipartisan Establishment pushing globalization. But all accounts would converge on one important detail: He would not have won his incredibly narrow Electoral College victory had not Hillary Clinton\u2019s reputation been battered by many months of criticism over her use of personal email to handle sensitive official business. \u201cHillary\u2019s emails\u201d and the interminable drumbeat over them from both conservative and mainstream media damaged perceptions of her trustworthiness and also generated crucial headlines late in the campaign, obscuring what looked to be a fatal Trump scandal associated with the Access Hollywood tapes.\n\nGiven this history, along with the paranoia characteristic of national-security types generally and MAGA people specifically, you\u2019d think secure comms on any discussions remotely related to national security would be a categorical imperative for any Trump administration. But you\u2019d think wrong, given the incredibly sloppy handling of high-level discussions over plans to attack Houthis in Yemen that came to light because Team Trump brought the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, into its group chat on Signal.\n\nMost of the uproar over this bizarre incident has focused on national-security adviser Michael Waltz, who accidentally added Goldberg\u2019s name and phone number to the chat, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who discussed operational details of the attacks outside of secure channels. But the entire group of Cabinet-level officials chatting away in Goldberg\u2019s silent presence are guilty of inadequate security precautions. Many of them, in fact, were very outspoken about the terrible misconduct involved in Clinton\u2019s emails (along with others involving the Obama and Biden administrations) back in the day, as CNN reminded us in delicious detail:\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host; White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller; national security adviser Mike Waltz; and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have all made public comments in the past attacking officials under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for allegedly being sloppy with sensitive government information.\n\nMuch of that criticism has revolved around Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State under President Obama \u2026\n\n[Marco] Rubio, identified by Goldberg in the chat as \u201cMAR,\u201d repeatedly attacked Clinton over the issue in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 tweeting about it at least a dozen times.\n\nIn an August 2015 Fox News interview, Rubio noted that classified information should only be viewed in a secure room to protect it from unauthorized access or surveillance.\n\n\u201cYou most certainly know you shouldn\u2019t be talking about it or passing it on in an email, particularly to a private server like the one she had. What they did is reckless \u2014 it\u2019s complete recklessness and incompetence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a fair description of what we have in the current case. But Rubio\u2019s far from the only hypocrite here:\n\nIn a November 2016 Fox News appearance, Hegseth called Clinton\u2019s use of the email server, \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have gone to jail for 1/100th of what \u2014 even 1/1,000th of what Hillary Clinton did \u2026\u201d\n\nWaltz, who invited the Atlantic journalist to the group chat, similarly tweeted his outrage that the Department of Justice did not pursue charges against Clinton for her private messages.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing,\u201d Waltz tweeted in June 2023.\n\nThere are additional quotes sternly condemning insecure comms and leaks to the press from Stephen Miller and Tulsi Gabbard, both apparent participants in the Houthi group chat. Indeed, the air in Washington is full of the soft clucking of chickens coming home to roost. Clinton certainly appreciated the irony:\n\n\ud83d\udc40 You have got to be kidding me.https://t.co/IhhvFvw6DG pic.twitter.com/bnNG4dGSpI \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 24, 2025\n\nBut Team Trump could at least mitigate the damage by admitting its errors and moving on. Instead, it is shooting the messenger who drew attention to its incompetence, as Axios reports:\n\nHegseth, who briefly spoke to reporters after landing in Hawaii Monday, lashed out at Goldberg for The Atlantic\u2019s history of publishing negative stories about President Trump.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called \u2018journalist\u2019 who\u2019s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again,\u201d Hegseth said, attacking Goldberg\u2019s reporting on the Russia investigation and allegations that Trump called fallen veterans \u201csuckers and losers.\u201d\n\nAsked why details of the operation were shared on Signal, an encrypted messaging app available to the public, Hegseth denied that part of Goldberg\u2019s reporting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans. And that\u2019s all I have to say about that,\u201d the former Fox News host said.\n\nGoldberg later responded to Hegseth on MSNBC, alleging that the texts he withheld included \u201cprecise details\u201d of the attack on the Houthis \u2014 including the specific time, specific targets and sequencing of the operation.\n\nPerhaps even more to the point, Hegseth\u2019s claims that Goldberg is a fake journalist motivated mainly by animus to Trump makes the idiocy of including him in any sort of Cabinet-level discussion even clearer.\n\nThese people screwed up royally, and they should come clean about their collective responsibility for sloppy communications management and stop lashing out at media for reporting it. A retroactive apology to Clinton is probably too much to ask for, but she will have the satisfaction of watching Trump\u2019s high command cut themselves with the same knife they used to strike her down.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Summary The Trump administration is using limited evidence like tattoos and deleted photos to detain and deport migrants.\n\nSome deported Venezuelans have said they were wrongly suspected due to their tattoos.\n\nPalestinian activist and legal permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil was detained without criminal charges for alleged pro-Hamas activities.\n\nDr. Rasha Alawieh was deported to Lebanon after photos of Hezbollah leaders were found on her phone.\n\nImmigration attorneys argue these actions reflect a deterioration of migrant civil liberties and due process.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nTattoos. Pro-Hamas flyers. Deleted photos.\n\nThese are just a few of the pieces of evidence that the Trump administration has cited in its legal efforts to detain and deport migrants from the United States in high-profile actions the past few weeks.\n\nThe evidence has been cited in efforts to send over 200 Venezuelan men to prison in El Salvador for alleged gang membership, to detain a pro-Palestinian activist and green card holder without charging him with any crime, and to deport a doctor with a visa to Lebanon.\n\nPeople in immigration court already face a lower standard of due process in proceedings, but the Trump administration\u2019s moves reflect a stark deterioration of migrant civil liberties even further, immigration attorneys said.\n\n\u201cIn this instance under the Trump administration, what we\u2019re seeing is yes, allegations using flimsy evidence paired with no meaningful opportunity to refute that evidence in any kind of proceeding before any kind of decision-maker,\u201d said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration non-profit group. \u201cThat\u2019s really what makes this different.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s quick pace of detention and deportation has similarly disoriented attorneys.\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019re hit with a different decision, and we just don\u2019t know how to make sense of it,\u201d Veronica Cardenas, the former assistant chief counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, told CNN last week. \u201cUs immigration lawyers are really experiencing the lack of due process circumventing immigration courts, and so it\u2019s been a very difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed back against critics who raised concerns about immigrants\u2019 legal rights.\n\n\u201cDue process? What was Laken Riley\u2019s due process?\u201d border czar Tom Homan said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d referring to the nursing student who was killed by an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela. \u201cWhat were all these young women that were killed and raped by members of (Tren de Aragua) \u2013 what was their due process?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some of the evidence being cited in the cases and what attorneys and family members of the migrants have said about its relevance.\n\nA closer look at the tattoo evidence\n\nThe Trump administration deported over 230 Venezuelans earlier this month, sending them to prison in El Salvador for alleged gang membership. But some have said they were wrongly suspected due to their tattoos.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety last year identified an assortment of tattoos connected to Tren de Aragua, many relatively common: stars on the shoulder, royal crowns, firearms, trains, dice, roses, tigers and jaguars. A photo collage of the tattoos even includes a Nike \u201cJumpman\u201d logo and Michael Jordan\u2019s number 23 jersey number as an identifier of gang membership.\n\nJos\u00e9 Daniel Simancas Rodr\u00edguez, who spent 15 days in detention at Guantanamo Bay before being deported back to Venezuela, told CNN that US authorities had suspected him because of his tattoos and because he was from the gang\u2019s original stomping grounds in Maracay. He denies being in the gang.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Trump administration related to its deportation efforts tells the story of \u201cJ.G.G.,\u201d a non-citizen from Venezuela and tattoo artist who has requested asylum. J.G.G. has several tattoos on his leg, and that ink that made him the target of deportation efforts, according to the suit.\n\nThe ACLU said that J.G.G. has two tattoos \u2013 a rose and skull on his leg as well as an eye with a clock in it \u2013 and neither are associated with Tren de Aragua.\n\n\u201cDuring an interview with ICE, he was detained because the officer erroneously suspected that J.G.G. was a Tren de Aragua member on account of his tattoos,\u201d the suit states.\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, the co-founder and president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, is representing a Venezuelan asylum seeker who they say was abruptly removed to El Salvador.\n\n\u201cHe came here seeking protection, seeking asylum, and because of his tattoos \u2013 which are the type of tattoos you would see on any person hanging out in a coffee shop in (Los Angeles) \u2013 because of those tattoos, he\u2019s in a labor prison in El Salvador known for human rights abuse,\u201d Toczylowski said.\n\nTrump admin defends deportations\n\nThe deportations stem from President Donald Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, an obscure 18th century law that has only been invoked three times in US history, all during major military conflicts.\n\nDetentions and deportations that occur under the measure do not go through the immigration court system, which provides immigrants the chance to seek relief and make their case to stay in the country.\n\nThe US recently designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, and officials have claimed the country is under \u201cinvasion\u201d by the gang to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. CNN previously reported that more than half of the 261 migrants expelled to El Salvador were done under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe administration has not publicly identified those removed to El Salvador, or presented evidence that the deported Venezuelans belong to Tren de Aragua. CNN has not been able to confirm whether any of the deported migrants identified in this story have any affiliation to the gang.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to reveal operational details about a counter terrorism operation,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week. She added that ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents had \u201cgreat evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were 100% confident in the individuals that were sent home on these flights and in the president\u2019s executive authority to do that,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nThe administration has argued in court the migrants sent to El Salvador were \u201ccarefully vetted\u201d through investigative techniques and a review of information to ensure they were members of Tren de Aragua, according to a court declaration submitted last week from an agency official.\n\nRobert Cerna, acting field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, argued that the agency \u201cdid not simply rely on social media posts, photographs of the alien displaying gang-related hand gestures, or tattoos alone.\u201d\n\nICE also looked at previous criminal convictions, testimonies and interviews with known Tren de Aragua members, according to the filing.\n\n\u201cMembers of TdA pose an extraordinary threat to the American public. TdA members are involved in illicit activity to invoke fear and supremacy in neighborhoods and with the general population,\u201d the filing states.\n\nThe flyers and \u2018misrepresentation\u2019 evidence\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist, was arrested by immigration officers nearly three weeks ago outside of his apartment on the campus of Columbia University. A legal permanent US resident and green card holder, he played a central role in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on the Ivy League campus last year.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio ordered Khalil\u2019s detention, relying on an obscure section of US law which gives him wide authority to revoke a person\u2019s immigration status if their \u201cactivities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d to the country.\n\nLeavitt, the White House press secretary, accused Khalil of organizing protests that \u201cdistributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas,\u201d a claim his attorneys have denied. During the briefing, she said she had a copy of the flyer but did not present it.\n\nKhalil has not been charged with any crime since he has been detained.\n\nKhalil described himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d in a letter dictated to his attorneys from inside the ICE detention facility. \u201cMy arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza,\u201d Khalil said.\n\nIn a court filing Sunday, the Trump administration said that his deportation is justified because Khalil did not reveal his previous work at the Syria office of the British Embassy in Beirut or his membership in United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in his application to become a permanent US resident.\n\nKhalil \u201csought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud of willful misrepresentation of a material fact,\u201d the US government wrote.\n\nKhalil was an unpaid intern with UNRWA in 2023, but was never on staff, spokesperson Juliette Touma told CNN.\n\nHis defense attorneys argue the new justification to deport him is weak and doesn\u2019t \u201ccure the obvious taint of retaliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that the initial charges are unsustainable,\u201d attorney Baher Azmy told CNN. \u201cSo, they\u2019re going with a theory that they must think is more legally defensible.\u201d\n\nThe deleted photos\n\nDr. Rasha Alawieh, 34, was deported last week from Boston to her native Lebanon after federal agents found photos of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran\u2019s supreme leader on her cell phone, a court filing by the Trump administration said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why federal officers were examining her phone.\n\n\u201cIn explaining why these multiple photos were deleted by her one to two days before she arrived at Logan Airport, Dr. Alawieh stated that she did not want to give authorities the perception that she supports Hezbollah and the Ayatollah politically or militarily,\u201d the court filing reads, per CNN affiliate WCVB.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Former Homeland Security lawyer responds to Donald Trump's immigration crackdown 03:37 - Source: CNN Former Homeland Security lawyer responds to Donald Trump's immigration crackdown 03:37\n\nAlawieh, who attended Nasrallah\u2019s funeral in Lebanon, described him as a highly regarded religious leader and told them she follows his religious and spiritual techniques but not his politics, a source familiar with the case told CNN.\n\n\u201cAlawieh openly admitted to this to CBP officers, as well as her support of Nasrallah,\u201d a spokesperson for the DHS said in a statement. Alawieh also acknowledged to immigration officers Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, a source familiar with the case told CNN.\n\nAlawieh\u2019s attorney, Stephanie Marzouk, who told the court all Alawieh\u2019s other attorneys had withdrawn from the case, spoke briefly to reporters last week outside a federal courthouse in Boston.\n\n\u201cOur client is in Lebanon, and we\u2019re not going to stop fighting to get her back in the US to see her patients, and we\u2019re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law,\u201d she said.\n\nThe groundwork to deport these people did not just begin with Trump. DHS has a long history of using \u201cflimsy or unsubstantiated\u201d allegations to deport people in the immigration system, said Gupta, the American Immigration Council policy director.\n\n\u201cThis is the most egregious final step in what has been many years of devolving due process in the immigration system,\u201d she said."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty Images\n\nThere is a growing rallying cry in the city\u2019s mayoral race: D.R.E.A.M., or in other words, \u201cDon\u2019t Rank Eric or Andrew for Mayor.\u201d\n\nProgressive groups and candidates are urging voters ahead of the June Democratic primary to fill out their ranked-choice ballot without Andrew Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams, with the goal of ultimately ensuring neither man receives the necessary votes to become the presumptive mayor.\n\nOne of the first groups to promote the idea was United Auto Workers Region 9A, which represents union members in the city. In December, its political council announced its unranked slate of endorsed candidates in the mayoral race: Comptroller Brad Lander, Queens state senator Jessica Ramos, and Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. It also included a clear warning to members: Don\u2019t rank Adams. In February, with Cuomo\u2019s entry into the race all but assured, the union revised its guidance to include the former governor, writing that members are \u201cunited behind our D.R.E.A.M.\u201d\n\nBrandon Mancilla, the director of UAW Region 9A, says the decision against ranking the two men was an easy one. \u201cMayor Adams, over the last three to four years as mayor of the city, we\u2019ve seen a lot of cuts, a lot of misplaced priorities, taking a knee to whatever Donald Trump wants, essentially just not running the city,\u201d Mancilla says. \u201cThat has been a red line for our members.\u201d\n\nAs for Cuomo, Mancilla cited his lack of apparent support for a UAW strike at upstate General Motors auto plants when he was governor, saying Cuomo has never made an appearance at any of their picket lines. \u201cAt this point, the UAW has gotten President Biden to show up to the picket line right during last year\u2019s strike, and, in 2019, Cuomo refused to do that in a state that is very proud of its union density and being a pro-union state,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we don\u2019t think he has working class people\u2019s needs in mind. He\u2019s running to empower himself and that\u2019s basically something that our members don\u2019t want to go back to.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, another D.R.E.A.M. campaign was taking form. New Yorkers for a Better New York Today launched dreamfornyc.com in February after months of planning, featuring hats and shirts with the slogan and backed by a social media campaign targeting Cuomo\u2019s record. And now the issue is coming up at campaign events and forums across the city, with more candidates officially joining the D.R.E.A.M. team.\n\n\u201cI wholeheartedly support this approach and I\u2019ve said ever since we launched our campaign in late October that I would only be critiquing disgraced New York executives, whether past or present,\u201d says Mamdani.\n\nShortly after Cuomo joined the race, Ramos shared a video on social media criticizing his handling of the pandemic and urging voters to embrace D.R.E.A.M. \u201cWe don\u2019t need City Hall to be a refuge for scandal-ridden men,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Cuomo campaign, so far, appears unfazed by the strategy. \u201cOur city is in crisis \u2014 a crisis of affordability, of quality of life and of leadership, and in this race, Governor Cuomo, and Governor Cuomo alone, is the only proven, tested leader to tackle these issues head on and who voters know can get the job done. New Yorkers aren\u2019t stupid: these are serious times that demand a serious Mayor, not performance art from defund the police, DSA-extremist and anti-Israel activists,\u201d Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the campaign, said in a statement.\n\nWith Cuomo currently leading in the polls and the moderate lane of the field growing with the recent entry of City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, candidates in the progressive bloc appear ready to wield ranked-choice voting to their advantage. It\u2019s a marked change from 2021, when candidates largely eschewed strategic approaches to the race, such as backing each other in case the other was eliminated as votes were tabulated. The lone exception was a late-stage joint endorsement between Andrew Yang and Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, who each vowed to rank the other second and urged their voters to do the same. Garcia was runner-up to Adams.\n\n\u201cHad Maya Wiley and Kathryn Garcia cross-endorsed each other a month out from the election, one of them very likely would be mayor today and we wouldn\u2019t have a mayor who had sold us out to Donald Trump for a pardon for his crimes,\u201d says Lander.\n\nThat\u2019s why progressives are hoping this time will be different. \u201cThat\u2019s where the D.R.E.A.M. strategy is really helpful and very smart,\u201d says Ana Maria Archila, co-director of the New York Working Families Party. \u201cIt helps guide voters, gives them clear direction about what not to do. Obviously, the other element is making sure that we guide voters about what to do.\u201d\n\nMamdani, who has been second behind Cuomo in recent polls, is open to joint endorsements. \u201cI have told other candidates and campaigns directly from the very beginning of this race that I am interested in cross-endorsements as we get closer to Election Day because we must turn the page on this failed leadership and we must utilize every single tool at our disposal to ensure that all of our supporters understand that where they have five options, they should use them, and that none of them should be Eric Adams or Andrew Cuomo,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Brooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie said he\u2019s not opposed to cross-endorsements down the line, he said each campaign must present a case to voters that stands in strong contrast to the records of Cuomo and Adams. \u201cI\u2019m excited about what ranked-choice voting provides for voters. I think it gives people the opportunity to express their preferences in a way that they might not have had in the past and I do think that it allows for candidates to focus on presenting what their vision for the city is, and I feel good about our ability to do that in this field,\u201d he says.\n\nThis is the sort of collaboration the UAW was ultimately hoping for when it dreamed up D.R.E.A.M. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet to see the cross-endorsements and that kind of thing, but we\u2019ve been very clear also with the candidates we\u2019ve endorsed that that\u2019s what we would like to see,\u201d Mancilla says. \u201cWe would like to see them get to the point that they\u2019re also endorsing each other. \u2018If I\u2019m number one on your ballot, here\u2019s who I believe should be number two.\u2019 Because in the end, that\u2019s the way that progressive labor voices are going to be able to come out on top, instead of letting the field get divvied up.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article previously misstated when DreamforNYC started its campaign.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Photo: Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n\nThe general consensus is that this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament has been a huge bummer so far. This is, the thinking goes, primarily because it has lacked the driving force of the best tournaments of the past: upsets. There is no Saint Peter\u2019s this year, no Fairleigh Dickinson, no Northwestern State. In fact, there is not a single mid-major team \u2014 defined as a team that plays outside the Power Five conferences \u2014 remaining in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s tournament. The favorites keep winning; the established powers remain entrenched. Some have attempted to blame NIL (\u201cname, image, and likeness\u201d rules) or the transfer portal for this, mainly because people try to blame NIL and the transfer portal for everything. The more likely culprit is simply the fickle nature of the tournament itself. Some years, it gives you everything you want; some years, it doesn\u2019t. The chaos \u2014 or unpredictable lack thereof \u2014 is its defining feature. Besides, those people are wrong about NIL and the transfer portal anyway; they\u2019re actually college basketball\u2019s saving grace.\n\nBut there is an upside to the lack of upsets: a riveting set of Sweet 16 games. It turns out that when the favorites (mostly) win, it makes for some outstanding Godzilla vs. Mothra matchups in the later rounds. Six of the top 25 winningest coaches of all time remain in the tournament. The biggest, best teams in men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball are all still remaining. And now they get to take each other out. Even without the upsets, this tournament always delivers.\n\nStill, unless you\u2019re an alumnus of one of the remaining 16 schools or possess gambling-related loyalties, it\u2019s not easy to figure out where you should direct your affections. So, as is tradition, I\u2019ve put together a harmless, just-playing-around \u2014 please do not sic your school\u2019s sub-Reddits on me \u2014 ranking of the teams and schools by likability, a hopefully helpful Guide to the Otherwise Unaffiliated.\n\n(Note: This is for the men\u2019s tournament; the women\u2019s Sweet 16 will be set by Tuesday morning, and I\u2019ll put my picks in the comments of this post on Wednesday. Free content!)\n\n1. Maryland\n\nIt remains so strange, even in an age of expansion, even in a world where UCLA and Rutgers play conference games against each other, that Maryland is in the Big Ten. This is probably the best Maryland team since they joined the conference 11 years ago, and definitely the most Maryland edition: Three starters are from the Old Line State, and the starting lineup has become known as the \u201cCrab Five,\u201d which is a fantastic nickname. They are led by freshman Derik Queen, a pending first-round draft pick who is a joy to watch and is responsible for the single best moment of the men\u2019s tournament so far:\n\nMARYLAND MADNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nTERPS WIN IT! pic.twitter.com/NO0UozXVyj \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) March 24, 2025\n\nYeah, fine: He probably traveled, but if the referees declined to call it because \u201cit looked so cool,\u201d I would have a hard time blaming them.\n\nNotable alumnus: Larry David (really).\n\n2. Michigan State\n\nIf you do not like the turn that college basketball has taken toward professionalism; if NIL irks you; if you hate that players can transfer at will; if you wish it were 1998 again: Well, Michigan State is absolutely your team. Longtime coach Tom Izzo (No. 23 on that winningest coaches list) has steadfastly avoided the quick-fix solutions that have gained widespread acceptance throughout the rest of the sports, focusing instead on consistency and familiarity: He\u2019ll take a less talented team if they\u2019re willing to stick around and play the way he wants them to. This is an outdated notion in college sports, to say the least, but Izzo has made it work this year with what is one of his most enjoyable teams to watch. (He has said it might be his favorite team he\u2019s ever coached, which is high praise indeed.) Your tolerance for older white men sticking stubbornly to their mores and norms of the past may vary, but this is a fun team, and you almost have to admire Izzo for being the last guy tilting at the windmill.\n\nNotable alumnus: Gretchen Whitmer.\n\n3. Houston\n\nBefore coach Kelvin Sampson arrived in 2014, Houston hadn\u2019t won a single NCAA Tournament game in 30 years, not since the mid-\u201980s glory days. He has turned the team into college basketball\u2019s most consistently outstanding team, one that has dominated every league it has played in, making a huge jump from the American Conference to the Big 12 without missing a beat. Houston regularly does this without many All-Americans or future NBA draft picks, which is the sort of thing that would seem impossible in today\u2019s game. Sampson was fired by Indiana in 2008 for recruiting violations that are not only no longer illegal but are so commonplace now that any coach who didn\u2019t commit them would be fired for incompetence. At Houston, he has become perhaps the best college-basketball coach in the country.\n\nNotable alumnus: Dennis Quaid.\n\n4. Purdue\n\nAnother team that represents consistency and straightforward competence, Purdue lost two-time National Player of the Year Zach Edey and barely missed a step. The main reason for their steadiness is point guard Braden Smith, this year\u2019s Big Ten Player of the Year and the kind of star that can exist in college basketball but rarely at the pro level. He\u2019s short (well, six feet, which is basketball short), he\u2019s white, he\u2019s slow, he has a completely ridiculous beard. He\u2019s also unstoppable, to the point that an opposing coach this year said the only player who was harder to deal with was Stephen Curry. That\u2019s, uh, probably not Smith\u2019s future career path, but no one should be surprised if he\u2019s absolutely infuriating you as an opposing player in the NBA for the next decade.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jim Gaffigan.\n\n5. Michigan\n\nMichigan basketball fans are slightly less insane than Michigan football fans, which still means you wouldn\u2019t want to get stuck in a corner with any of them at a party. They\u2019re one of the happier success stories in college basketball, a team that fired a beloved but slightly deranged famous alum in Juwan Howard and replaced him with Dusty May, the man who took Florida Atlantic to the Final Four and who instantly turned Michigan into a winner again. Their biggest asset is Yale transfer Danny Wolf, a seven-foot former Team Israel player who, I\u2019ve argued, looks like Saturday Night Live\u2019s James Austin Johnson if the comedian\u2019s limbs were all cartoonishly extended to meet a much larger frame. Michigan\u2019s fans make it nearly impossible to cheer for them at much of anything, but as far as their teams go, this is one of the more likable ones.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jonathan Chait.\n\n6. Brigham Young\n\nLook out: The Mormons are good! Part of the reason for this is that, uh, most of their star players are not actually Mormons, including future NBA draft pick Egor Demin. (It should be noted that, according to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, there are currently 5,101 Mormons in Russia. Demin is not one of them.) BYU has boosted its recruiting game in recent years thanks to some free-spending Mormons (really) and a former NBA coach who is now in charge, to the point that the top overall recruit in the 2025 class, AJ Dybantsa, signed with the school for next season. This is just the start of the BYU sports renaissance. Pretty impressive for a college that bans premarital sex, alcohol, and caffeine. You\u2019ve got to have a pretty impressive NIL budget to overcome that.\n\nNotable alumnus: Mitt Romney, obviously.\n\n7. Tennessee\n\nA slow, plodding, brilliant defensive team, Tennessee gets points for notching some truly dramatic wins this season and for Zakai Zeigler, their five-foot-nine point guard who is essentially impossible to deal with. They lose points for wearing the ugliest shade of orange imaginable; I\u2019m not sure what you mix with actual orange to get that color, but I bet if you put it on your plants, it will help them grow faster.\n\nNotable alumnus: Dave Ramsey.\n\n8. Texas Tech\n\nThere\u2019s always one or two mostly nondescript teams to make the Sweet 16, and Texas Tech is often one of them. (They actually made the national championship game a few years ago, under Chris Beard, whom we\u2019ll be talking about in a bit.) They are led by All-American JT Toppin, who, contrary to popular belief, is not in fact the brother of former Knick and current Pacer Obi Toppin (or Obi\u2019s brother Jacob, also a former Knick). The most interesting thing about Texas Tech is that their best player is not related to a mid-tier NBA player. That about sums them up.\n\nNotable alumnus: John Denver.\n\n9. Arizona\n\nHere\u2019s one undeniable truth about Arizona: This is the last time you won\u2019t have heard of anyone on their team. That\u2019s because their top recruit next year is Bryce James, LeBron\u2019s other basketball-playing son who has already committed to the Wildcats. He\u2019s widely considered a better player than Bronny (though, while almost no one has noticed, Bronny has started making some very steady improvements). It is to LeBron\u2019s credit that he never refers to either of them as \u201cPrince.\u201d\n\nNotable alumnus: Kourtney Kardashian.\n\n10. Alabama\n\nNo team better represents the sudden SEC dominance of college basketball \u2014 14 teams from that conference made the tournament this year, an all-time record \u2014 better than Alabama, a football-obsessed institution that has never really cared about basketball but has so much money lying around that they went ahead and just spent their way to a great team anyway. There\u2019s nothing specifically wrong with that, and while Alabama has been inconsistent, they can score like crazy and can be a blast to watch when they\u2019re clicking. Still: They could win the national championship and only 30\u201340 percent of their football fan base would likely even notice.\n\nNotable alumnus: Joe Scarborough.\n\n11. Arkansas\n\nRun out of Kentucky\u2019s infamously insane fan base despite winning a national championship and putting together an endless string of top recruiting classes, Hall of Fame coach John Calipari retreated to SEC rival Arkansas. He got off to a miserable start this year, and his hiring had the makings of an expensive disaster before he turned things around to make the tournament, then beat Rick Pitino and reach the Sweet 16 as a ten-seed (the lowest one left). This isn\u2019t the most inspiring team, and Calipari is hardly some plucky underdog. But anyone who ever left a job vowing revenge on your former co-workers \u2014 I\u2019ll show them \u2014 can\u2019t help but feel some solidarity with Calipari. Even if he has to live in Arkansas.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jerry Jones.\n\n12. Kentucky\n\nThe Wildcats replaced Calipari with Mark Pope, a former Kentucky star (he won a national championship under Pitino) who instantly charmed the fan base in a way Calipari never could. He has been showered with love the way Calipari once was, but they\u2019ll turn on Pope like they turn on everyone; that\u2019s how it works here. I\u2019ll confess to being grouchier about Kentucky than is probably fair, since they eliminated my beloved Illini in the Round of 32, which is not their fault but of course totally is. Unfortunately, Arkansas and Kentucky are on opposite sides of the bracket, which means the nuclear explosion that would result from an elimination battle between Calipari and his old team could only happen in a theoretical national championship game.\n\nNotable alumnus: Ashley Judd.\n\n13. Duke\n\nThat Duke \u2014 the most hated team in college basketball for several decades now, without any particularly close competitors \u2014 is as high on this list as they are speaks to the loathsomeness of those below them. But it also should be said: This isn\u2019t that hateable a Duke team, relatively speaking. Coach K is gone. There are three future NBA stars on the Blue Devils, all of whom have more interesting games than, say, Steve Wojciechowski ever did. Cooper Flagg is going to be the No. 1 overall pick, an amazing thing to say about someone from Maine, and he\u2019s actually pretty fun to watch. I mean, sure, it\u2019s still Duke; all the bile currently building up in your gullet is entirely justified. But this is not a vintage throw-a-brick-through-your-TV iteration. If you find yourself almost kinda-sorta liking them, don\u2019t worry: No one has to know.\n\nNotable alumnus: Stephen Miller.\n\n14. Mississippi\n\nWe now reach the Dastardly Coaches portion of our list with the first of the the Three Assheads, all from the Southeastern Conference. Mississippi\u2019s coach is Chris Beard, who, back in 2022, was the coaching profession\u2019s rising star, having just been hired at Texas, his alma mater. In December of that year, he was arrested on a felony domestic-violence charge. His then-fianc\u00e9e said he had \u201cchoked me, bit me, bruises all over my leg, throwing me around, and going nuts,\u201d accusations police said were consistent with the physical evidence. Texas fired him, but after the woman eventually declined to press charges, Beard rebuilt his career at Mississippi, whose athletic director, in a shockingly credulous article at ESPN over the weekend, said, \u201cBeing very candid, the situation that unfolded there [in Texas] certainly allowed us to get our name in [to hire him].\u201d (The piece, bizarrely, focuses on a student outreach event Beard did at an Ole Miss sorority.) Beard\u2019s success in Oxford has surely allowed him to launder his reputation into a better job than this one, which basically makes him the \u2026 I dunno, Corey Lewandowski of college basketball? Uh, go Rebs?\n\nNotable alumnus: John Grisham.\n\n15. Florida\n\nTime for Asshead No. 2. That would be coach Todd Golden, a wunderkind hired out of San Francisco at the age of 36 to run one of the SEC\u2019s top programs. The first couple of seasons were a bit middling, but there was optimism heading into his third season until last November, when, according to a blockbuster report in the student-run Independent Florida Alligator, he was accused by an \u201cundefined\u201d number of women, most of them students, of sexual harassment and stalking, including sending \u201cunsolicited photos of his genitalia\u201d to students. After a Title IX investigation by the school \u2014 and, it should be noted, a start to the season that was one of the best in Florida basketball history \u2014 the university dropped any disciplinary actions against Golden, saying it could not verify that any of the accusations \u201coccurred within a university program or activity.\u201d (None of the women have changed their stories, and the Alligator has stood behind its story.) Every game Florida wins, they get closer to the Final Four, and the more questions about this Golden faces. With two more Florida wins, those allegations become the story of this Final Four.\n\nNotable alumnus: Jesse Palmer.\n\n16. Auburn\n\nAuburn head coach Bruce Pearl is living proof of the theorem that if shameless and relentless for long enough, even the most vainglorious scoundrel can paint himself as respectable. Pearl has been one of college sports\u2019 most notorious con men for decades now \u2014 he has been blackballed from the sport twice \u2014 and he keeps popping back up, like a penny laced with anthrax. He has one of his best teams ever in this Auburn team, the No. 1 overall seed, albeit one that struggled a bit down the stretch. Pearl is, plainly, a terrible person \u2014 there has never been a less surprising MAGA coach, and I can\u2019t think of a more apt metaphor for what it feels like to be an American in 2025 than watching him raise a national championship trophy over his head in San Antonio next month. My stomach is turning just thinking about it.\n\nNotable alumnus: Kay Ivey.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that all five of Maryland\u2019s starting lineup hailed from the state."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSeveral top Trump administration officials are facing scrutiny for sending detailed operational plans and other likely highly classified information about US military strikes on Yemen to a group chat on a messaging app that inadvertently included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nThe mistake amounts to an unprecedented breach of security by some of President Donald Trump\u2019s most senior national security officials and raises questions about whether they violated the Espionage Act, which makes it illegal to mishandle national defense information.\n\nNormally, discussions of this nature occur in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF), a highly secure area to discuss classified information.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council told CNN the messages appeared to be authentic. When asked about the report, Trump told reporters on Monday in the Roosevelt room, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\nA CNN KFile review uncovered multiple instances in which officials, believed by Goldberg to have joined the group chat, previously criticized others for how they handled classified information and materials.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host; White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller; national security adviser Mike Waltz; and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have all made public comments in the past attacking officials under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for allegedly being sloppy with sensitive government information. CNN reached out to the officials\u2019 agencies for comment.\n\nMuch of that criticism has revolved around Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State under President Obama.\n\nRubio, identified by Goldberg in the chat as \u201cMAR,\u201d repeatedly attacked Clinton over the issue in 2015 and 2016 \u2013 tweeting about it at least a dozen times.\n\n\u201cNobody is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton \u2013 even though she thinks she is,\u201d he said on Fox News in January 2016.\n\nIn an August 2015 Fox News interview, Rubio noted that classified information should only be viewed in a secure room to protect it from unauthorized access or surveillance.\n\n\u201cYou most certainly know you shouldn\u2019t be talking about it or passing it on in an email, particularly to a private server like the one she had. What they did is reckless \u2013 it\u2019s complete recklessness and incompetence.\u201d\n\nIn a November 2016 Fox News appearance, Hegseth called Clinton\u2019s use of the email server, \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have gone to jail for 1/100th of what \u2013 even 1/1,000th of what Hillary Clinton did.\u201d\n\nIn September 2017, Hegseth criticized Clinton\u2019s use of the server on Fox News, calling her \u201csuch a corrupt politician,\u201d and her actions \u201creckless.\u201d\n\nWaltz, who invited The Atlantic journalist to the group chat, similarly tweeted his outrage that the Department of Justice did not pursue charges against Clinton for her private messages.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing,\u201d Waltz tweeted in June 2023.\n\nEarlier that week, Waltz lamented, \u201cHow is it Hillary Clinton can delete 33,000 government emails on a private server yet President Trump gets indicted for having documents he could declassify?\u201d\n\nAnd in a Fox News interview in May 2024, Waltz said of Biden\u2019s mishandling of classified documents, \u201cAll of those things are a crime, he should be charged at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen those classified documents that were sitting in Biden\u2019s garage and his basement \u2013 highly classified, highly relevant to what\u2019s going on in the world today, with very, very sensitive sources,\u201d he added.\n\nIn August 2022, Miller tweeted, \u201cOne point that doesn\u2019t get made enough about Hillary\u2019s unsecured server illegally used to conduct state business (obviously created to hide the Clintons\u2019 corrupt pay-for-play): foreign adversaries could easily hack classified ops & intel in real time from other side of the globe.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s email scandal is not the only example. In a late 2012 appearance on Fox News, Hegseth criticized sharing classified information with journalists and filmmakers in a segment regarding how the Obama administration shared intelligence to the filmmakers of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d a 2012 film that depicts the CIA\u2019s decadelong hunt for Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nHegseth responded, \u201cIf we\u2019re sharing intelligence with filmmakers in addition to it being leaked to the New York Times, and we\u2019re releasing movies to affect political elections based on that intelligence, that\u2019s an absolute bright line of something we shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d was released in mid-December 2012 \u2013 a month after the 2012 presidential election.\n\nAnother national security official Goldberg believes was on the chain, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tweeted on March 14, denouncing leaking information to journalists.\n\n\u201cAny unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such.\u201d The tweet came one day after the group chat began and one day before the US military strikes in Yemen occurred.\n\nGabbard recently pulled security clearances from current and former Biden administration officials and barred access to classified information briefings. The move, made at Trump\u2019s direction, was seen as retaliation for Biden revoking security clearance from Trump amidst his administration\u2019s mishandling of classified documents."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nTop Justice Department officials told a federal judge on Monday that the Trump administration is invoking the state secrets privilege to avoid giving him information about deportation flights from earlier this month that are at the center of a legal dispute over whether the government flouted his judicial commands.\n\n\u201cThe Court has all of the facts it needs to address the compliance issues before it,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top DOJ officials wrote in a filing to US District Judge James Boasberg. \u201cFurther intrusions on the Executive Branch would present dangerous and wholly unwarranted separation-of-powers harms with respect to diplomatic and national security concerns that the Court lacks competence to address.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe information sought by the Court is subject to the state secrets privilege because disclosure would pose reasonable danger to national security and foreign affairs,\u201d the officials wrote in the 10-page filing.\n\nBoasberg is seeking the information to determine whether the government violated a pair of temporary restraining orders he issued on March 15 that temporarily blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport individuals the administration has accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe judge had ordered any flights containing noncitizens being deported pursuant to Trump\u2019s directive to turn around immediately, but it quickly emerged that the administration appeared to have violated his command by allowing two deportation flights to continue the evening of March 15.\n\nIncluded in the Monday evening filing were declarations from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem who said that disclosing the information sought by Boasberg would harm US national security or foreign relations.\n\n\u201cIt is critical to bear in mind that removal operations can be (as they are here) counterterrorism operations. If foreign partners believed that any relevant details could be revealed to third parties, those foreign partners would be less likely to work with the United States in the future,\u201d Rubio said in his declaration. \u201cThat impairs the foreign relations and diplomatic capabilities of the United States and threatens significant harm to the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nAmong the questions Boasberg wanted the Justice Department to answer are ones concerning the exact timing of when the two planes took off from US soil and left US airspace that day, as well as the specific times individuals deported under Trump\u2019s proclamation were transferred out of US custody that day.\n\nHe told the government last week that it could submit the information under seal or invoke the privilege, though he said if DOJ decides to shield the information, he \u201cis obligated to \u2018determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the filings submitted Monday to Boasberg, the department pushed back strongly on the judge\u2019s continued inquiry into whether the administration violated his orders, saying, \u201cNo more information is needed to resolve any legal issue in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether the planes carried one TdA terrorist or a thousand or whether the planes made one stop or ten simply has no bearing on any relevant legal issue,\u201d the officials wrote. \u201cThe need for additional information here is not merely \u2018dubious,\u2019 \u2026 or \u2018trivial,\u2019 \u2026 it is non-existent. The Executive Branch violated no valid order through its actions, and the Court has all it needs to evaluate compliance.\u201d"
