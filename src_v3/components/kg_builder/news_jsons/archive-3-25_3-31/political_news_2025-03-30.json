            "full_content": "Tonight, the Voice of America is silent. The storied broadcaster was launched in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda, but two weeks ago president Donald Trump usurped Congress' authority and signed an executive order effectively shutting down the taxpayer funded broadcaster for what the White House calls \"radical propaganda.\" Friday, a federal judge put any further actions by the administration on hold. Over the decades VOA has projected American values globally, and for hundreds of millions it was the place to find fact-based news about America and the world in their own languages. It all came crashing down in a single day.\n\nSteve Herman: When I heard that 1,300 of my colleagues had been suspended immediately with pay in an email saying that they couldn't do any more work, couldn't go into the building, I knew at that point the Voice of America was gonna die very quickly.\n\nSteve Herman is chief national correspondent for Voice of America and perhaps its best-known journalist. Americans may not recognize him since VOA is prohibited by law from broadcasting in the United States.\n\nSteve Herman: People say, \"Oh, international broadcasting, it's archaic, it's obsolete.\" Why are the Chinese spending so much money and, and broadcasting in dozens of languages over radio and setting up all these TV services? You know, are they wasting their money? I don't think so. VOA is probably the best bang for our buck that we have in terms of public diplomacy.\n\nAfter joining VOA in 2002 as a Tokyo-based foreign correspondent, Herman spent the next 15 years covering the globe for America's flagship international broadcaster before landing at the White House in 2017. He told us he decided to take the job as a federal employee because of VOA's charter, which requires accurate, objective reporting and sets a firewall to protect the editorial independence of its reporters from political meddling.\n\nSteve Herman 60 Minutes\n\nSteve Herman: I've met people, even in North Korea, who have said, when they first started listening to it and they heard it's from the United States, that it must be propaganda. Because that's what their broadcasters do. And then they heard us talking about America, warts and all. And they also heard us reporting about their own country, and telling them things that they could verify with their own eyes, that their own media wasn't telling them. And a light bulb goes off when they realize what it is like with the media in the United States. That you can criticize your own government, have opposition politicians on the air. That doesn't happen everywhere in the world.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Our mandate was never to present the administration's story. Our mandate was always to present America's story.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara is VOA's White House bureau chief. A native of Indonesia, she started working for VOA in its Indonesian service in 2003. Growing up under the dictatorship of President Suharto, she understands the value of VOA.\n\nBill Whitaker: What's the size of the audience?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: All around the world, it is 360 million weekly unduplicated.\n\nBill Whitaker: Listening and watching VOA?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Multi-platform television, radio, digital, social media.\n\nAnd 86% of its worldwide audience tell pollsters they find VOA trustworthy. Two weeks ago, those millions of viewers and listeners were getting daily news in 49 languages.\n\nTurn on VOA today, you get this... on a loop.\n\nSteve Herman: Bill, you and I have both been in a lotta countries. And if you're in a country and all of a sudden television or radio switches from regular programming to music, you know something's up.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what do you think that says to your listeners and viewers?\n\nSteve Herman: I think it would make them wonder, \"What the hell is going on in the United States?\n\nThe Voice of America spoke its first words during World War II, beaming German language broadcasts into Nazi Germany to counter Hitler's propaganda machine. During the Cold War it expanded in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and China to challenge communist disinformation with straight-forward reporting on American life and politics \u2013 our highs and lows, an approach President John F. Kennedy praised at VOA's 20th anniversary.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy: We compete with other means of communication, of those who are our adversaries who tell only the good stories. But the things that go bad in America, you must tell that also.\n\nWith bipartisan support, VOA grew to spread American news and values across the globe.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan: My fellow Americans and fellow citizens of the world, this is Ronald Reagan, President of the United States, speaking to you live from the broadcast studios of the Voice of America in Washington, D.C.\n\nVOA told the Chinese people about the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and the deadly COVID outbreak in Wuhan when their own government wouldn't. It beamed reports into Iran about the democracy protests in 2009, it told the people of North Korea about their government's gulags and Russians about atrocities in Ukraine. VOA has been supported by every president since 1942 \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2026 all but one.\n\nPresident Trump: If you heard what's coming out of the Voice of America, it's disgusting. What things they say are disgusting toward our country.\n\nThat was President Trump in 2020. He complained VOA's coverage of the COVID epidemic parroted Chinese propaganda. Two weeks ago, the White House released a statement called \"The Voice of Radical America\" listing a dozen specific grievances, like VOA reports on white privilege, transgender migrants and Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nKari Lake: They've got national security risks inside this agency. The rot is so bad it's like having a rotten fish and trying to find the little portion you can eat. It's, it's unsalvageable right now.\n\nIn February, President Trump installed Kari Lake of Arizona, a former TV anchor who lost two statewide political races, as senior advisor at the Agency for Global Media, the entity that oversees VOA and its sister services covering Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Cuba. She says they've grown too large.\n\nKari Lake: We are going to be slimming this agency down, way down, it's going on a Ozempic diet.\n\nVOA's budget is $267 million a year. Lake is now moving to implement President Trump's executive order to eliminate the broadcaster to the \"maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\"\n\nWe asked Lake for an interview to discuss her findings and plans for VOA. She declined, responding: \"I won't do an interview with a disreputable news outlet like 60 Minutes.\"\n\nThe president has a well-known animus toward the press, but he seems to hold special disdain for Voice of America. Under his administrations, Steve Herman has been investigated twice for his copious social media posts, including this link to a critic of the dismantling of USAID, which one senior administration official suggested was treasonous.\n\nBill Whitaker: What do you say to people who would say that your Twitter activity, your social media activity, as foreign service officer, technically part of the government, that perhaps you shouldn't be criticizing the president?\n\nSteve Herman: I wasn't criticizing the president. I wasn't criticizing his policies. I was quoting people who didn't like those policies. But I also put out what the president says, verbatim. I put out links to the president's executive orders. Does that mean that I'm supporting or praising those statements or policies? No. And I think any reasonable observer understands that.\n\nOn the 12th of this month, Patsy Widakuswara \u2013 working her White House beat \u2013 asked the prime minister of Ireland a question President Trump found impertinent.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara 60 Minutes\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: What about the president's plan to expel Palestinians out of Gaza? Are you discussing that with him and giving him your position?\n\nPresident Trump: Nobody's expelling any Palestinians. I don't know... Who are you with?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: I'm with Voice of America, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: Oh, no wonder. Voice of America.\n\nBill Whitaker: So when the President turns around and says, \"Who are you with,\" what'd you think?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Honestly, my heart sank a little bit.\n\nTwo days later the president signed that executive order all but eliminating VOA. In following days, Kari Lake suspended hundreds of journalists, banned them from the building, and halted transmissions overseas. For the first time in 83 years, the Voice of America was silenced.\n\nBill Whitaker: You think your question had anything to do with that?\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: I think it's impossible for me to know the answer to that question. This is happening to all federal agencies. Honestly, when I was at the Oval Office, it was-- it was just my reporter's instinct and I wasn't thinking about anything else. It was just...\n\nBill Whitaker: Just doing your job.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: Two world leaders in front of me. What am I going to do if not ask the questions?\n\nSteve Herman questions whether the president's executive action is legal.\n\nSteve Herman: There are those who want to make the Voice of America the voice of the president. Now, that's not up to the executive branch of government. That's up to the Congress. We're following the laws that Congress passed.\n\nRepublican Congresswoman Young Kim of California is a South Korean immigrant, a Trump supporter, and a longtime champion of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.\n\nRep. Young Kim 60 Minutes\n\nRep. Young Kim: I encourage President Trump to reconsider his executive order.\n\nKim is one of the only Republican members of Congress to challenge the administration on VOA.\n\nRep. Young Kim: When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies, they're gonna, they are not gonna hear the truth. Why are we ceding our soft power that helps us to stay as a free world leader. We're just playing right into Xi Jinping's hands.\n\nBill Whitaker: Since President Trump's executive order, media in China and Russia have been celebrating.\n\nRep. Young Kim: Oh yeah. [laughs] I'm not surprised.\n\nBill Whitaker: Does that concern you?\n\nRep. Young Kim: That concerns me because we're losing that information war.\n\nBill Whitaker: So we pulled back. Who fills the void?\n\nRep. Young Kim: China. Ayatollahs. Kim Jong Uns. Dictators. And we're not there to counter that disinformation.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara is lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to resuscitate VOA, but she fears the damage has already been done.\n\nPatsy Widakuswara: If they bring back everybody next week, what kind of newsroom would that be? How can we continue to report without fear or favor with this hanging over us? Would we only have to report on things that pleases the President? It's not something that I signed up for.\n\nProduced by Jack Weingart and Graham Messick. Broadcast associate, Mariah Johnson. Edited by Matthew Lev."

            "full_content": "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Jodey Arrington, Republican of Texas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, Texas Congressman Jodey Arrington, who joins us this morning from New Orleans. Mr. Chairman, great to see you. Thanks for joining us. In the last month, the Dow has lost 5.14% of its value, the NASDAQ 8%, the S&P 6.2%. Consumer confidence, as you probably are aware, has dipped a bit in the last couple of months. How do you account for all of this?\n\nREP. JODEY ARRINGTON: Well, good morning to you Major. First of all, core inflation is down. Mortgage rates are down just a little bit. Food and gas prices are down. So you're going to have fluctuations in in the financial markets, but we're seeing that the fundamentals are already having an impact on the cost of living, which I think should be job number one of this President, but you've got the tariffs, which I think are critical for our long term prosperity to have that reset, have that Fair and reciprocal trade dynamic that doesn't exist today. So transitioning from the last four years to a new administration with a new economic policy agenda is going to have some adjustments that go with it, and- but I think at the end of the day, you're going to have better prospects for growth. You're going to bring down the prices and you're going to have better prospects for our future, including reducing the debt to GDP, which, as the budget chairman, I can tell you, is completely unsustainable at this point and could bankrupt our country.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, one of the top tariff advisers to the president, Peter Navarro, said this morning that tariffs are tax cuts. Are they?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: Well, in the long run, I think having an unfair trade dynamic at the current point is suppressing growth. It's suppressing wages and suppressing job creation, so it has an adverse impact on our economy. There's no way, Major, to reset the trade dynamic that we've allowed to persist in an unfair way for so long without some disruption. The President has been very transparent about it, and he deployed the same tactics. Now, back in his first administration, successfully, we brought China and others to the table. We had a reset. We had new purchase agreements, we had structural reforms, and we benefited. We had better trade activity, we had better economic activity. And overall, wages grew and life in the American economy, and the quality of life for our fellow Americans was better, so that transition has to happen, and the only person I've seen in my life and experience in politics with the political courage to do it has been President Trump, and I support him 100%.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: When you think about the budget and the process by which to finance tax cuts, either the existing ones or new ones, you're going to count on tariff revenue, are you not?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: Well, I think we should count on reducing spending that is runaway, bankrupting levels of spending at $2 trillion in annual deficits that will double in the next 10 years. Half of that $2 trillion is interest on the debt that will more than double in the next 10 years. So, we have a spending problem. That deficit spending is driving World War levels of debt and will bankrupt the country. So, I think we should offset the tax cuts with spending reductions and bend that debt to GDP. The revenue from tariffs could do two things, accelerate the reduction of deficit to GDP and do what the President has said he wants to happen in this America First agenda put our nation on a path to balance, but it can also provide tariff relief like he did in the first administration for farmers in West Texas, for example, with the market facilitation payments that took the sting out of the fallout from the early stages of the trade battles, before we had the reset for reciprocal trade. So, I think those are better uses of tariff revenue, but I think we've got to bring down spending. If we don't, then I don't know how much longer we have before, as Ray Dalio says, we're going to have an economic heart attack, and it will undermine everything.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: Let's talk about spending for a second. As you know, Mr. Chairman, Medicaid is projected to increase 5.2% each year for the next 10 years. House Republicans have voted for $880 billion in cuts over 10 years. You and I both know you don't have to argue with me about it, that it would be a reduction of the future growth, not a pure cut, but if you lose a service as a Medicaid recipient, that's probably a distinction without a difference. Can you say that when this all gets done, alterations to Medicaid will not change the way people access that program and the health services they receive from it?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: Major, I'll do better. I think if we don't make these changes, this program and the federal budget in general is not sustainable, because we're allowing states and local organizations to siphon hundreds of billions of dollars away from the Medicaid beneficiary and the Medicaid program. We also this is the one means tested program that doesn't have work requirements for able-bodied adults. We also have a Medicaid program because of the Obamacare expansion and the expansion population of able-bodied adults, where the federal government provides 90 cents on every dollar match for that population, but the preponderance of Medicaid beneficiaries, the blind, the disabled, the poor, the sickest among our fellow citizens, get about 60% to 65% So all of the healthcare system is oriented around the 90% the able bodied adults, and they're not providing the same access, which is to the- to the traditional Medicaid, which is why the outcomes are going down. So, there is a lot of ways to reorient the system, to make it more efficient, to root out waste and fraud, and it's well over the $800 billion. It's common sense, straightforward, and you don't have to touch a dime of the benefits.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, very quickly, the President told NBC he \"couldn't care less if foreign automakers raised prices.\" Do you care?\n\nREP. ARRINGTON: What I care about is that our workers and manufacturers in this country are competing head-to-head with China and every other competitor country that we allow their mark their products to come in our markets, open and free, and they don't, they tax our products, and it's hurting our workers. It's hurting our economic output, and we need a reset, and so there's no way to get to that dynamic, that reciprocal trade arrangement, without the tough negotiation tactics of President Trump. He was successful in the first term. We didn't create economic chaos. We didn't even have much of inflation. In fact, the economy was roaring. We had more jobs, more people out of poverty. That's what's going to happen. And I support the president, and he has to prove that he is committed to this, and I believe he is, and I think that's important if we're going to get to the other side of this.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: House Committee- Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington of Texas. Thanks very much, sir. I appreciate it."

            "full_content": "Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers Union, praised President Trump's move to impose tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S., while noting that \"tariffs aren't the total solution.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers,\" Fain told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview that aired Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\n\nMr. Trump announced the 25% tariffs last week, which he said will take effect on April 2, escalating his administration's effort to boost domestic manufacturers through aggressive trade measures. Fain, who leads the 400,000-member union that went on a 46-day strike in 2023, called the tariffs a \"motivator,\" noting that \"we have to fix the broken trade laws.\" And he urged that if jobs are going to be brought back to the U.S., they need to be \"good paying union jobs that set standards.\"\n\n\"The big part of this that gets left out a lot of times is, if they're going to bring jobs back here, you know, they need to be life sustaining jobs where people can make a good wage, a living wage, have adequate health care and have a retirement security and not have to work seven days a week or multiple jobs, just to scrape to get by, paycheck to paycheck,\" Fain said.\n\nAsked whether he has assurances from the Trump administration, Fain said \"that is the conversation we're having.\"\n\n\"Every time we speak, we talk about bringing jobs back, about bringing the manufacturing base back in this country,\" Fain said. \"But you know, it doesn't do any good if they're going to locate them in places and they're not going to have the opportunity to have a union, you know. And so naturally, we have concerns.\"\n\nFain pointed to the U.S.' manufacturing history over the last 30 years, noting that tens of thousands of manufacturing facilities have left under \"unfair trade laws.\" He agreed with a sentiment shared by Trump officials that auto manufacturing plants have untapped capacity that would allow production to be shifted back to the U.S.\n\n\"We have excess capacity. They could bring work back in very short order,\" Fain said. \"In a situation where they need to build a new plant, yeah, that's going to take a couple years, but there is plenty of opportunity for these companies to do the right thing and bring work back here overnight, just as quick as they shifted out of here.\"\n\nThe UAW president reiterated that \"tariffs are a tool in the toolbox\" and \"not the end-all solution,\" saying \"we have to fix the broken trade system.\"\n\n\"But the way tariffs work, I mean, it's a motivator, because there's going to be a penalty for everything the companies ship in here,\" Fain added. \"And I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.\"\n\nFain argued that companies don't have to \"raise the price of vehicles a penny with these tariffs,\" while criticizing Wall Street for its stance on the issue.\n\n\"All this crying about the effects of tariffs, I find it interesting, because to me, this is just Wall Street,\" Fain said. \"Now that Wall Street's upset about it, it's an issue. Where was Wall Street when all these manufacturing facilities have been leaving the country in the last 30 years?\"\n\nAutomakers' stocks have tumbled since Mr. Trump's tariff announcement, with even U.S. automakers feeling the brunt because supply chains are spread throughout North America. On Friday alone, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%.\n\nMeanwhile, 55% of Americans say the administration is too focused on tariffs, while 64% say it's not focused enough on lowering prices, according to a CBS News poll released Sunday.\n\nThe UAW endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris over Mr. Trump in July. He told CBS News of the endorsement and more recent support for the tariffs that \"there's been no change in where we stand politically as a union.\"\n\n\"We have expectations. Endorsements are earned,\" Fain said, while noting that the union isn't partisan. \"We expect, no matter what party someone comes from, to stand up for what we believe in. So just because we find common ground on tariffs or on trade doesn't mean that everything else goes out the window.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Fain also slammed an executive order the president signed last week to stop or slow down collective bargaining with agencies that have national security responsibilities, calling it \"despicable,\" and saying some of the union's members have been detained. He added that \"free speech is under attack, unions are under attack.\"\n\nIn August 2024, the UAW filed federal labor charges against Mr. Trump and Elon Musk accusing the duo of trying to \"intimidate and threaten\" workers during an interview on the latter's social media platform X."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has blitzed its way through federal agencies over the last two months, spawning dozens of lawsuits in its effort to shrink the federal government.\n\nAs judges take a closer look at how DOGE is operating, and what authority it exercises across the federal bureaucracy, among the many questions they\u2019re asking is whether DOGE is actually a government agency itself.\n\nThe answer to that question, pedantic as it may sound, could have major ramifications, including whether DOGE is subject to public records laws and other statutes that require some oversight of executive branch activity.\n\nThe laws could pose a check on what Musk can do with his government-slashing project \u2014 both by granting access to what\u2019s happening behind the scenes, and by giving legal challengers tools to potentially reverse some of his most drastic actions.\n\nIf DOGE is determined to be a government entity that wields \u201csubstantial authority independently of the President,\u201d the public can seek the release of some of its internal records under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe Trump administration is saying in court that federal agencies, rather than Musk\u2019s DOGE initiatives, are what\u2019s driving the cuts. That\u2019s quite different from the dramatic, braggadocios, chain saw-waving picture Musk and President Donald Trump have painted in the public arena.\n\nIt\u2019s also different from what government whistleblowers have described witnessing as their agencies get slashed and burned.\n\nAfter retrofitting DOGE onto a preexisting government information technology office known as the US Digital Service, or USDS, the administration dispersed DOGE operatives inside a variety of government agency headquarters across Washington.\n\nNow, in a number of lawsuits, the administration is claiming that DOGE has very little centralized organization or power, that its leaders are merely advisers, and that some of the operatives embedded across the federal bureaucracy are now directly employed by the agencies they\u2019re overhauling.\n\nDeclarations in court from multiple government officials claim that Musk has no formal position at DOGE, and no power of his own to execute his vision for shrinking the government. They say his role is just to give counsel to the president.\n\nThe Justice Department is leaning on that argument to try to convince courts that they should not order discovery, including the production of internal documents and even depositions. Several judges appear skeptical, often pointing to public reporting and contradictory statements by government officials in other cases. But the administration has, in some cases, found a more receptive audience at the appellate level.\n\n\u201cThere is this unusual disjunction between what Musk and his minions are actually doing, and what the administration is saying they\u2019re doing\u201d in court filings, said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. \u201cThe key question is: Do courts have to accept that description on paper, which could be bogus, or can they peer through to the underlying reality?\u201d\n\nElon Musk shows off a shirt that says \"DOGE\" as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House on March 9, 2025. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe recent tactics have backfired in some cases, as judges have concluded the new explanations about DOGE\u2019s approach raise more questions than they answer \u2014 and thus could warrant more discovery.\n\nBut the administration has taken aggressive steps to get higher courts to intervene in the fundamental disputes about what DOGE is and, in some cases, secured appellate orders pausing the judges\u2019 decisions.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, suggested in a recent Fox News interview that the legal setbacks were the result of \u201cbias\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe DC Circuit is notorious for having a very far-left bias,\u201d Musk said, while describing the judges as having a close relationship with the nongovernmental organizations being targeted in DOGE cuts. \u201cDoes that seem like a system that lacks corruption? It sounds corrupt to me.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s really in charge?\n\nAmong the greatest checks on DOGE\u2019s power within the government is the Constitution\u2019s appointment clause, which requires that certain government leaders receive Senate confirmation. The Supreme Court has interpreted the clause to cover officials exercising \u201csignificant authority.\u201d\n\nSome legal challenges allege this clause, along with separation of powers principles, is being violated as Musk and his agents are allegedly calling the shots when it comes to sweeping layoffs, major funding freezes and the mass cancellation of government contracts.\n\nOne of the groups challenging DOGE\u2019s authority revealed in court filings this month that a grant cancellation letter the group received was, according to its metadata, written by a DOGE affiliate, rather than the high-ranking Department of Education official who signed it.\n\nA worker removes the US Agency for International Development sign on its headquarters on February 7, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nThe claim that the Constitution prohibits Musk from ordering agencies to make drastic changes to their operations has already persuaded a federal judge in Maryland to limit DOGE\u2019s involvement in the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development. But Musk and DOGE\u2019s access to USAID was restored last week by the 4th US Circuit of Appeals, which embraced the administration\u2019s arguments that Musk has been playing the role of presidential adviser and that USAID\u2019s disassembly had the backing of the agency\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn another lawsuit attacking Musk\u2019s influence, brought by Democratic state attorneys general, the administration successfully appealed the discovery order of a DC federal judge that would have required the government to answer specific questions and turn over documents shedding light on Musk\u2019s role. The US DC Circuit\u2019s brief, unsigned order indicated the judge, Tanya Chutkan, could not allow discovery before ruling on Trump\u2019s legal arguments for why the lawsuit should be dismissed.\n\n\u2018Legal gaslighting\u2019\n\nThe administration\u2019s filings with DC\u2019s federal appeals court describe Musk as a White House adviser with no authority of his own who is entitled to broad protections of executive privilege because of the counsel he is giving to the president.\n\nThe White House last month identified Amy Gleason as the acting administrator of USDS, after judges and reporters dogged the administration for weeks about who was occupying the role.\n\nThis still from video shows Amy Gleason. From What's the Fix?!/YouTube\n\nIn a case in which a watchdog group secured a court order requiring the quick release of internal documents from DOGE, the administration asked Judge Casey Cooper to reexamine his conclusion that DOGE, as it exists in USDS, was likely covered by the Freedom of Information Act and pointed to court declarations from Gleason arguing that USDS has \u201climited responsibilities\u201d that are \u201cpurely advisory.\u201d\n\nWhile USDS has 79 direct employees and 10 others detailed from other agencies, there is \u201cno formal front office or organizational chart reflecting\u201d USDS\u2019 \u201ccurrent composition,\u201d Gleason said in a court declaration this month.\n\nCooper is taking a closer look at whether the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, applies to DOGE, but has said some of Gleason\u2019s assertions raised their own \u201cfactual disputes\u201d that could warrant more discovery.\n\nA claim by Gleason that Musk does not work for USDS was \u201ccontradicted\u201d by Trump and Musk\u2019s own statements, Cooper wrote in an opinion this month, and he pointed to news reports of orders from the president that Cabinet secretaries cooperate with DOGE on staffing issues.\n\nThe watchdog group behind the FOIA litigation has taken up Cooper\u2019s invitation for discovery, seeking depositions of Gleason and of Steve Davis, a longtime Musk adviser now involved with DOGE, as well as other internal information about its work.\n\nThe group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW), noted in its Thursday discovery request that lawyers for Musk told a judge last week, in a case concerning his company X, that he was too busy to sit for a deposition because the White House had put him \u201cin charge of Establishing and implementing\u201d DOGE.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 representations to this Court that Mr. Musk is not running DOGE are tantamount to legal gaslighting,\u201d CREW said.\n\nDo other laws limit DOGE\u2019s activity?\n\nWhile Gleason was explaining in the FOIA case her \u201cfull-time\u201d role at USDS, a separate case revealed she is simultaneously serving as a consultant at the Department of Health and Human Services to implement DOGE\u2019s agenda there. The case, one of several challenging DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive government data, hinges on the Privacy Act, which limits who within the government can access troves of confidential data collected about the American public.\n\nIn the data case, Judge John Bates has OK\u2019d four depositions, while green-lighting other discovery requests from the challengers.\n\nThe Justice Department argued this month that Bates should reconsider that order because the administration had switched gears in how some DOGE affiliates were being deployed. At the agencies covered in the case, some DOGE representatives are now serving as direct employees, rather than just being temporarily detailed from DOGE, the administration said.\n\nThis new setup, the Justice Department argued, meant that Bates no longer needed to look under the hood at how DOGE was operating.\n\nBut Bates rejected that rationale and questioned whom those \u201cdirect hire\u201d employees truly answered to: those above them at DOGE or at the agencies they\u2019re also working for.\n\nThe challengers in the case will get to show the judge \u2014 and the public \u2014 what the discovery has shown to be the answer in a court filing due April 8."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nJon Ossoff, the nation\u2019s most endangered Senate Democrat, sees a path for reelection in a state President Donald Trump won in 2024 and at a time when Democrats are suffering rock-bottom approval ratings.\n\nHe plans to go all out against Trump.\n\n\u201cI have never seen opposition energy like this \u2014 from dyed-in-the-wool Democrats to moderate Republicans,\u201d Ossoff told CNN before making a rather bold prediction at a time when his party is still reeling from the fall elections.\n\n\u201cThe energy and opposition, I believe, is building toward a landslide victory in 2026,\u201d the Georgia Democrat said. \u201cA landslide victory for Democrats across the country.\u201d\n\nVulnerable senators in purple states often shift to the center ahead of reelection, seeking to spotlight how they work with the president of the opposite party as they court moderate and swing voters.\n\nBut Ossoff is making a starkly different and potentially riskier calculation: That swing voters will be alienated by Trump\u2019s dramatic push to expand his power, target his foes and dismantle the federal government \u2014 and that the 2026 elections will ultimately be determined by the party that can bring out its base. His thinking offers a fresh window into how a swing-state Democrat will try to navigate the politics of Trump in next year\u2019s midterms.\n\n\u201cI think the president is turning off swing voters by acting so recklessly \u2014 by abusing his power,\u201d said Ossoff, the lone Senate Democratic incumbent running in a state that Trump won in 2024.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with CNN last week, Ossoff doubled down on his contention that Trump is \u201cpoisoning democracy,\u201d defended his vote to block a GOP spending bill with a government shutdown looming and attacked senior Trump administration officials for their role in the now-infamous Signal chat before striking Houthis in Yemen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s reckless, he\u2019s unqualified. He should have resigned yesterday,\u201d Ossoff said of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. \u201cAny military officer who so recklessly handled or inadvertently disclosed this kind of information would lose their job, their security clearance and possibly face a court martial.\u201d\n\nDemocrats face a difficult path next year to win back the Senate, currently at a 53-47 GOP majority. Three incumbents have opted to retire, including in two battlegrounds of Michigan and New Hampshire, and they have limited pickup opportunities \u2014 with North Carolina and Maine at the top of the list. But the Georgia seat represents a pivotal pickup opportunity for Republicans \u2014 with tens of millions expected to be spent in the race.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is planning an aggressive push to knock off Ossoff, took umbrage with the senator\u2019s comments about Trump and the GOP \u2014 and took a shot at him over immigration, a sign of the Republican attack plan against the first-term Democrat.\n\n\u201cInstead of a working with President Trump to keep Georgia families safe, Ossoff is leading the fight against efforts to prevent tragedies like this,\u201d said Joanna Rodriguez, the NRSC spokeswoman, referring to a 21-year-old Honduran national who entered the US illegally in 2021 and was accused of murdering a woman earlier his month in the Atlanta suburbs. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful and Georgia deserves better.\u201d\n\nBut Ossoff is trying to navigate his own line on immigration. He broke with much of his party when he was one of a dozen Senate Democrats who voted earlier this year to enact the Laken Riley Act, a GOP law to require detention of undocumented migrants charged with certain crimes and named after the 22-year-old Georgia student who was killed last year.\n\nYet while he contends then-President Joe Biden\u2019s tougher border restrictions came \u201cfar too late,\u201d Ossoff is attacking Trump\u2019s deportation and detention policies as \u201cdraconian.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think the American people are turning against it,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s immigration orders.\n\nKemp eyes a run, Ossoff eyes MTG\n\nWhile Ossoff makes the case against Trump, the Republican field in Georgia\u2019s 2026 Senate race has yet to materialize.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp, who won reelection by more than 7 percentage points in 2022, just two years after Biden flipped the state blue, is being wooed by national Republicans to jump into the race.\n\nOssoff declined to weigh in on Kemp\u2019s prospects, but then turned his attention to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the MAGA firebrand and staunch Trump ally.\n\n\u201cWe will see who runs,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cIt may be the governor. President Trump has said that he would back Marjorie Taylor Green to run for United States Senate. I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s got the guts to do it. But she would be a disaster in the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nPressed on whether it might be difficult to defeat Kemp, Ossoff said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate about who\u2019s tougher. I\u2019m not going to get into the punditry in the horse race. I will be ready for anyone who challenges me for this seat.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans are also eyeing the seat. GOP Rep. Buddy Carter, a longtime veteran of Georgia politics, told CNN on Thursday he is looking at entering the race.\n\n\u201cI was with the governor yesterday. He\u2019s tied up right now,\u201d Carter said of Kemp. \u201cHis focus is on finishing up the [state legislative] session. They finish next Friday the 4th. After that, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make a decision. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he makes a decision, I\u2019ll make a decision,\u201d Carter said.\n\nBut Ossoff is wasting no time in trying to rally his base.\n\nAfter winning support from liberals for voting against a GOP spending bill earlier this month \u2014 and being accused by the NRSC for effectively threatening a damaging government shutdown \u2014 the young Democrat held a rally in Atlanta last weekend with a fiery rebuke of Trump, saying the president has launched a \u201cpower grab unprecedented in our history\u201d and is \u201ctrying to poison our democracy with fear and intimidation.\u201d\n\nAsked why he chose to make that argument in state that swung back to Trump, Ossoff didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s true, and because it\u2019s urgent and it requires us to push back,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Sarah Ferris contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer\n\nAmazon would like the world \u2014 and its investors \u2014 to know it\u2019s trying a few new things with generative AI. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about 1,000 different generative AI applications we\u2019ve either built or are in the process of building right now,\u201d said CEO Andy Jassy on an earnings call in February. Most of these will affect internal tools and processes, but regular customers might have noticed a few recent changes to the Amazon they see and use. In addition to its AI-summarized reviews, last month Amazon debuted Rufus, a chatbot alternative to search, on its site and apps. And last week, it started testing Interests, which turns descriptive requests \u2014 \u201cI am looking for feminine energy and aesthetic in home d\u00e9cor \u2026 under $100\u201d or \u201ctravel-friendly skin-care products from premium brands,\u201d to borrow Amazon\u2019s examples \u2014 into auto-updating widgets you can come back to and check.\n\nThese are all \u201cAI\u201d features in that they rely on LLM-based technology to summarize review text, to layer a chat interface on top of search, and to, as Amazon puts it, \u201cautomatically translate everyday language into queries and attributes that traditional search engines can process and turn into product recommendations.\u201d They\u2019re also responses to things going on outside Amazon that it would either like to co-opt or compete with. Automatic review summaries approximate SEO e-commerce publishing, in which review sites (and quasi-review sites) read and summarize Amazon users\u2019 feedback. As for AI-generated moodboarding, Amazon has long had an interest in Pinterest, which is a quiet but major force in online shopping, in part because it provides a way to organize Amazon\u2019s chaos. Maybe \u201cInterests\u201d captures some of that? Rufus, the most visible of the bunch, is both a \u201cchatbot, why not?\u201d AI-boom feature-add and a response to people using services like ChatGPT for shopping advice, which is a marginal but fast-growing trend.\n\nAt first glance, these are just slightly different ways to use Amazon, alternate paths to the same \u201cBuy Now\u201d\u2013button destination, and new enticements to spend money in basically the same way. But they also offer a way to see Amazon and to understand how strange its business has become.\n\nWhen Microsoft and Google first teased AI-powered search back in early 2023, their pitches were similar to Amazon\u2019s. With LLMs, you could submit queries in plain English and get plain English back. You could have a conversation of sorts with results to refine your search. You could get not just results but context for those results.\n\nThese AI interfaces were simple and clean. There were no ads, and while there was conversational text and the chatbots offered more than just links, the links were still at the center of the experience, and were sensibly selected and ordered. This all-new Google was, mostly, a lot like Google used to be; it was AI Google, sure, but more than that, it was unmonetized Google, which at least looked pretty appealing. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s new interfaces, while superficially novel, are most appealing for what they lack: disorienting layers of interface junk, abundant but redundant options, and, of course, all those ads.\n\nFor fairly obvious reasons that have now been borne out with extensive reporting, Google didn\u2019t end up replacing Search, one of the most popular and well-monetized products on the internet, with a stripped-down, ad-free AI alternative. Instead, it bolted AI-generated summaries to its results pages, a controversial half-measure that has so far amounted to more, not less, bloat. In the meantime, newer AI firms, for now content to lose money in a race for market share, have started adding basic search features to their core products. More recently, Google started testing AI Mode, which looks a lot like its 2023 demo but with a more capable underlying model. This demo too is clean and ad free, available first to paid users and now to anyone who wants to test it.\n\nThis would seem like less of a problem for Amazon, which we tend to think of as an e-commerce operation, but that\u2019s not quite right. Amazon\u2019s encroaching shabbiness is a consequence of its success in the advertising business; analysts expect Google\u2019s share of the search-advertising market to dip below 50 percent this year, in large part due to gains by Amazon, whose share is approaching 25 percent. Advertising isn\u2019t just a $50 billion business for the company \u2014 along with AWS, it\u2019s one of its most profitable businesses, squeezing massive amounts of money from (mostly) sellers and brands in exchange for visibility on Amazon\u2019s own properties. It\u2019s a pretty good business, provided you\u2019re in a position to unilaterally establish and control it.\n\nAmazon has, in this sense, a lot in common with Google, which is still struggling to resolve the tensions between its advertising business and its barely monetized AI products. Meanwhile, as Joanna Stern writes in The Wall Street Journal, one of the things money-losing AI search alternatives are pretty good at is basic product recommendations, and data from Adobe suggests that people are increasingly asking ChatGPT, and others, for buying advice. Rufus, like Google\u2019s early chat-search half-steps, isn\u2019t especially useful, except to draw attention to just how extractive and inefficient the Amazon experience has become.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn a Fox News segment last year on America\u2019s declining birth rate, former congressman Sean Duffy joked about how he would \u201close count\u201d of his nine kids, and urged viewers to follow his lead in having more children.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s good for country and society, it\u2019s to reproduce, to have kids,\u201d Duffy declared. \u201cThat shows that you\u2019re healthy, you\u2019re strong, and you\u2019re patriotic.\u201d\n\nNow, in his new position in President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet, Duffy is writing that philosophy into an unlikely area of federal policy: transportation funding.\n\nThe day after he was sworn in as Secretary of Transportation, Duffy issued a four-page memo to align the department\u2019s grants with what he described as \u201csound economic principles.\u201d One of his new directives: the department should give a \u201cpreference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average\u201d in programs and funding.\n\nThat move could end up disproportionately benefiting pro-Trump areas, according to a CNN analysis of Census and health data and other research charting the wide variations in birth and marriage rates around the US.\n\nDuffy\u2019s order \u2013 which was foreshadowed by his public warnings that a falling birth rate is a \u201ccrisis\u201d for the country \u2013 echoes rhetoric pushed by conservative activists and Trump allies like Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, who have long raised the alarm about the declining numbers of births and marriages.\n\nThe transportation policy would lead to new winners and losers: Fast-growing metros in Texas and Western states that are home to many young adults appear poised to take in more funding, while college towns with fewer people tying the knot and having kids could come up short.\n\n\u201cMaking babies has nothing to do with making roads,\u201d said Justin Elicker, the Democratic mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, which has among the lowest birth and marriage rates of mid-to-large size cities in the US. \u201cThis seems clearly designed to prioritize funding for red states.\u201d\n\nDuffy, a former congressman and reality TV star, has defended the policy as a reasonable investment strategy, at a time when the department\u2019s funding could face significant cuts under GOP budget proposals.\n\n\u201cWhen communities have kids and families, that\u2019s where you see growth,\u201d Duffy told reporters last month. \u201cWe want to invest in growth, and it\u2019s only one factor that we\u2019re going to consider as we look at where we put our money.\u201d\n\nElvis Presley impersonator Michael Conti officiates a wedding at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2023. By one measure, Las Vegas has by far the highest marriage rate in the US. Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nThe policy appears to be unprecedented, experts said. In 25 years of working in transportation planning and demography, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit that analyzes US demographic trends. But she noted that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more guidance that\u2019s needed before this could actually truly be implemented.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, for example, whether federal officials would examine rates at the state level in divvying up funds, or do so at the level of counties or cities. A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation declined to specify how the policy will work in action, or which data and calculations the department will use in determining rates.\n\nCalculating marriage rates in particular is not as simple as it seems. The most straightforward metric would look at the number of marriage licenses approved per resident in a county or state.\n\nBut by that measure, Las Vegas and Nevada have by far the highest rates in the country, thanks to the couples who flock to Sin City to tie the knot. Other areas that attract destination weddings, like Hawaii, also have elevated rates. If the DOT uses this way of calculating marriage rates, it could end up boosting plans for high-speed rail and other projects in Nevada: Officials in Las Vegas \u201cmight be really happy\u201d about Duffy\u2019s policy, Jarosz said.\n\nTo get a more accurate picture of marriage trends around the country, planners could instead use data from the US Census to estimate the rate of couples living in a community who married in recent years. But those kinds of statistics are not easily accessible for less populous areas of the country.\n\nAt the state level, data shows that states that voted for Trump tend to have higher birth and marriage rates than those that voted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, with places like South Dakota and Utah at the top.\n\nAbout 70% of the states Trump won were above the national birth rate average in 2023, compared to just 15% of the states Harris won, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Similarly, 70% of the states Trump won were above the national marriage rate in 2023, compared to 25% of the states Harris won, according to data from the Census\u2019 American Community Survey.\n\nAge plays a big role in explaining the wide variations in birth and marriage rates around the country, said Wendy Manning, a professor at Bowling Green State University and the co-director of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research. Areas that attract young adults who are starting new families have the highest rates of both, while communities that have more retirees and students have lower rates.\n\nReligion also factors in, in part because some studies have suggested Americans who describe themselves as strongly religious tend to have more children and marry at a younger age.\n\nAn analysis by the Urban Institute, a research organization, found that the DOT prioritizing high birth and marriage rate areas would mean more transportation funds going to higher-income areas and areas with larger White populations. It would also benefit suburban and exurban areas where almost all trips are made by car \u2013 potentially meaning more investment in highways instead of public transit.\n\nDuffy\u2019s policy suggests that \u201cthe administration\u2019s approach to funding projects has little to do with the actual benefits that those projects are providing, and a lot more with rewarding certain constituencies,\u201d said Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the institute and a co-author of the study.\n\nA DOT spokesperson said in a statement responding to criticism of the policy that \u201cfamilies and children are the foundation to a strong society, and by investing in them, we invest in the strength and future of our country.\u201d\n\nCurrently, most DOT funding is distributed to state governments based on formulas that take into account state population, fuel taxes paid by residents, and other factors. Other DOT programs dole out funds through a competitive process of grant applications from state or local governments for specific projects.\n\nBeyond using birth and marriage rates in determining funding, Duffy has also worked more broadly to reorient the department\u2019s funding to follow the Trump administration\u2019s political goals. He\u2019s threatened to pull funding to New York City\u2019s transit system, criticized California\u2019s high-speed rail project, and ordered a review of efforts to build bike lanes, electric vehicle chargers, and other green infrastructure.\n\nPotholes are seen on a street in Midland, Texas. Transportation infrastructure in Midland, which has high birth and marriage rates, has struggled to keep up with a booming population. Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe big winners of Duffy\u2019s birth and marriage rate policy could include places like Midland, Texas, which has had one of the top birth rates in the country of any city with at least 100,000 people in recent years, according to census data. Trump won Midland County with 80% of the vote in 2024.\n\nThe city, located in Texas\u2019 Permian Basin, has seen a population boom in recent decades as young people have flocked there for jobs in the oil industry. While Midland has enjoyed economic benefits from the growth, its road network is \u201cbuilt for a city with a much smaller population,\u201d Mayor Lori Blong, a Midland native and oil industry executive, said in an interview.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for 18-wheeler oil tankers to rattle through the center of town, which has contributed to Midland County having higher traffic fatality rates than most of the US. And drives across town that took less than 10 minutes when Blong was growing up can now take half an hour or more, she said.\n\nLast year, the City of Midland won an $8.6 million grant from the federal DOT to implement safety measures on a major street through the city. But officials could save more lives from traffic accidents if Midland received a higher rate of federal funds to pursue similar projects around the city, Blong said, describing herself as a strong supporter of Duffy\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a place where we have to have investment in our roadways to keep people safe,\u201d she said.\n\nNotably, counties and metro areas with large populations of college students tend to have lower birth and marriage rates. In New Haven, home to Yale University, officials are bracing for the potential impact of funding cuts, said Elicker, the mayor.\n\nIn recent years, the city has won federal grants to improve road safety, speed bus service across town, and start planning to redesign a highway that cuts through neighborhoods near the city\u2019s downtown, splitting communities apart. The highway project is dependent on future federal funding, and without it, major changes are unlikely to happen, Elicker said.\n\nElicker argued that federal transportation funds could help more people if they\u2019re used for projects in densely populated areas like his city, instead of less populous areas that have higher marriage and birth rates. He said the DOT policy felt like it was designed to punish areas that opposed Trump \u2013 about 80% of New Haven voters supported Harris.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about it,\u201d Elicker said. \u201cWe should be working together as a nation to address our aging infrastructure, instead of creating policies that prioritize some areas over others that aren\u2019t based on facts or actual need.\u201d\n\nCommuters walk through the snow in New Haven, Connecticut. The city, which has lower birth and marriage rates than the US as a whole, has received past federal grants for efforts to improve its bus service. Michelle McLoughlin/Reuters\n\nDuffy\u2019s policy comes as right-wing groups have advocated for allocating more funding based on birth and marriage rates. Brad Wilcox, a fellow at the conservative Institute for Family Studies, wrote that it was a sign that \u201ccabinet heads and other leaders in Trump 2.0 will be taking a range of creative steps to make good on the new administration\u2019s avowed commitment to make America more family friendly.\u201d\n\nSome key members of Trump\u2019s administration have long focused on declining birth rates, raising the alarm over what they have described as an existential crisis for the US. Vance warned last year that the US doesn\u2019t \u201chave enough families and children to continue as a nation.\u201d And Musk has argued that \u201cpopulation collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.\u201d\n\nBut Manning, the Bowling Green family researcher, suggested that if the administration\u2019s goal is to encourage more marriages and kids, it should focus on passing policies like subsidized childcare or paid family leave \u2013 not redistributing transportation funds.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t tell me the reason they\u2019re not having children or getting married is because they don\u2019t have a well-funded bus system,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to do with feeling uncertain about their future.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSharon Savoy, a 65-year-old retiree from just outside of Toronto, had planned a typical three-month stay at her vacation home in Miami earlier this month. But then she abruptly decided to put the trip on hold, and now she wonders when she\u2019ll ever go back to her second home.\n\n\u201cI should be there right now,\u201d Savoy told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to debate whether or not it\u2019s a good idea to go.\u201d\n\nSavoy is one of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who make their home in warmer parts of the United States during Canada\u2019s colder months. In fact, Canadians are the top foreign buyers of US properties \u2014 making up 13% of all home purchases in 2024, mostly concentrated in Florida and Arizona \u2014 according to a July report from the National Association of Realtors.\n\nBut as trade tensions grow between the two countries, many Canadians have taken the conflict to heart, loudly booing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at sporting events and boycotting US-made products. Some Canadian snowbirds are reconsidering their lives in the United States altogether. US-based Realtors in Arizona and Florida told CNN they are fielding calls from Canadians looking to sell their homes, and recent data shows Canadian tourism to the United States has slowed to a trickle.\n\nStephen Fine, the president of Snowbird Advisor, a Canadian company that provides real estate, legal and insurance guidance to Canadians who travel south for the winter, said many of his company\u2019s members feel \u201cangry, upset, disappointed and frustrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cA number of them are considering alternative destinations to the US next year. Some want to sell their US properties,\u201d Fine said.\n\nSavoy said that although she loves her Miami home, she is putting off a visit to show solidarity with her fellow Canadians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in these snowbird groups where people have been saying we shouldn\u2019t be spending money in the US,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my country to feel like I\u2019m betraying them during this threatening time.\u201d\n\nEconomic fallout from tariffs\n\nA drop-off in Canadian tourism could bruise the US tourism industry.\n\nCanada is the top source of international visitors to the United States, according to the US Travel Association. A hypothetical 10% reduction in Canadian travel could mean $2.1 billion in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\n\nThere are already signs of a slowdown: Canadian residents made 13% fewer trips by air to the United States in February and 23% fewer trips by car, compared to a year ago, according to Statistics Canada, Canada\u2019s national statistical office.\n\nFlight reservations from Canada to the United States have plummeted by more than 70% every month from March through the end of September, according to OAG, a travel data provider.\n\nShare Ross, a Realtor based in southeast Florida, said she\u2019s recently seen a sharp uptick in Canadians listing their Florida homes for sale.\n\n\u201cSome of the clients I have been dealing with want to sell at any cost, even at a loss,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRental properties have also experienced a steep decline in demand this year, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian market for rentals is just done,\u201d said Ross. \u201cI usually get a few people from various provinces looking for homes to rent. I didn\u2019t have any this season.\u201d\n\nA growing exodus of Canadians from Florida could strain the state\u2019s already troubled housing market. Florida currently has a record number of homes for sale as homeowners face skyrocketing insurance premiums and a growing risk of hurricane-induced flooding fueled by climate change.\n\nTariffs to be placed on Canada and other U.S. trading partners may significantly impact Florida's tourism industry. STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP\n\nThe drop-off in travel from Canada to the United States comes amid a bubbling tit-for-tat trade squabble between the two nations. The latest blow came this past week: US President Donald Trump said he would place a 25% tariff on all auto imports, which Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called a \u201cdirect attack\u201d in violation of US trade agreements with Canada.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration officially placed a 25% tariff on most of the other imports from Canada and Mexico. The president also ramped up threats to annex Canada and make it the 51st state. Canada responded by announcing retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American goods, though the trade war threatens to plunge Canada\u2019s economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner,\u201d Carney said Thursday, adding that Canada would look to shift to trading more with other countries.\n\nTo sell or not to sell?\n\nMiles Zimbaluk, an Arizona-based Realtor who offers cross-border real estate guidance for Canadians looking to buy and sell US property, said he believes politics isn\u2019t the only thing motivating more Canadians to list their properties for sale.\n\nZimbaluk said a weakened Canadian dollar has factored into some snowbirds\u2019 decision-making process. Last month, the Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2003, meaning that everyday goods like groceries and gas have become significantly more expensive for Canadians. It also means that Canadians stand to make a profit by moving their money from the United States to Canada.\n\n\u201cThere are people cashing in now and taking that dollar back to Canada and converting it back to Canadian dollars,\u201d Zimbaluk said. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen a big uptick in people wanting to sell their homes for a lot of different reasons right now.\u201d\n\nSavoy, the Toronto-based retiree, said she isn\u2019t quite ready to put her Miami home up for sale.\n\n\u201cI enjoy my life there. Miami has some great nightlife and beautiful beaches. It\u2019s got everything you need, and I\u2019ve never had any issues,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if things continue to get worse, I will be selling my home in the USA. Not because I\u2019m afraid of being there, but because, why would I want to do business there?\u201d"

            "full_content": "The minimum wage in Florida is under attack \u2013 and this time in a very dishonest way.\n\nAfter years of purposeful inaction by state lawmakers, Florida voters took matters into their own hands five years ago by passing a constitutional amendment that raised the minimum wage in the state. The voter initiative increased the then-paltry minimum wage of $8.65 per hour for nontipped workers, by putting it on a schedule of yearly increases that tops out at $15 an hour by Sept. 30, 2026.\n\nThis year, the graduated minimum wage is $13 an hour in Florida.\n\nThe constitutional amendment passed despite a well-funded opposition led by several business groups, including the Associated Builders and Contractors of Florida, the Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Farm Bureau, the Florida Home Builders Association and the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t sit well with the Republican-led state legislature, either. GOP lawmakers apparently have decided to disregard the state\u2019s constitution and the will of the voters expressed through that referendum. It took them five years to find a new way to circumvent the voters' wishes. What they\u2019ve come up with is a real doozy.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nA new Florida bill would let employers pay below minimum wage\n\nA bill (SB 676) working through the Florida Legislature this session rewrites labor laws in the state to allow workers to voluntarily request to get paid less than the minimum wage.\n\nYes, I know. It sounds crazy.\n\nWho goes into a job asking to be underpaid? Or hopes to get a job that makes an instant pay cut sound like an exciting new opportunity?\n\nI guess the conversation will go something like this: \u201cGood news! You\u2019re hired. Now, just sign here on the line that says you have agreed to participate in our floor-sweeping apprenticeship opportunity at $7.25 an hour.\n\n\u201cIf you do well there, you\u2019ll be eligible for a french fries work-based learning opportunity as soon as you complete your restroom internship.\u201d\n\nUnder this bill, reclassifying low-wage jobs as internships, apprenticeships or work-based learning opportunities would allow employers to sidestep the state\u2019s minimum wage law by hiring workers willing to sign away their absolute right to a minimum salary.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor in the Senate, Jonathan Martin, R-Fort Myers, tried to make this Dickensian dystopia sound like a noble gesture by calling it \u201ctrading pay for a marketable skill.\u201d\n\nBy Martin\u2019s reckoning, Florida is full of people who don\u2019t deserve to be paid a day\u2019s pay for a day\u2019s work.\n\nThe bill doesn\u2019t define what a \u201cskill\u201d is. There\u2019s also no definition in state law that defines an \u201cinternship.\u201d\n\nTellingly, the bill purposefully allows the subminimum pay to apply to workers of all ages \u2013 not just teenagers. And it is being forwarded despite clear language in the Fair Labor Standards Act and Florida case law that employees can\u2019t waive their rights to minimum pay.\n\nWe need fair wages. This is the opposite.\n\nIn the end, this bill is just a legally flawed gift to businesses looking to cut labor costs at the expense of their poorest, unskilled workers.\n\n\u201cIf we think that $13 an hour is what a bag boy at a grocery store should be making in rural Florida, then I think we have a misconception of either what\u2019s reasonable or we\u2019re not relating that to the cost of goods and services anymore,\u201d Martin said.\n\nReality check: A living wage in Florida for an adult with no children is $23.41 an hour, according to MIT\u2019s Living Wage Calculator. And there are about 1.5 million Floridians working in jobs that pay less than $15 per hour, according to data compiled by the Florida Policy Institute.\n\nThe problem in Florida isn\u2019t that wages are too high and corporate profits are too low.\n\nThis bill is a monumental step in the wrong direction. It lends a hand to those who need it least at the expense of those who are most in need.\n\nHere\u2019s how Jackson Oberlink, the legislative director for the social justice group Florida For All, put it.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, no worker truly opts out of fair wages. There is zero protections in this bill against coercion, fraud, or employer intimidation, meaning bad actors can and will exploit it,\u201d Oberlink told lawmakers at a committee meeting earlier this month.\n\n\u201cUnder this bill,\" he added, \"a fast-food worker, a grocery store cashier or a construction apprentice could suddenly find themselves reclassified as an intern and making far less than the legal minimum wage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this bill becomes law, it won\u2019t just hurt individual workers. It will drive down wages across entire industries as more and more businesses push workers into these bogus exemptions to cut costs,\u201d Oberlink said.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re asking for is fair pay for a hard day\u2019s work without loopholes, without carve-outs and without games,\u201d he said.\n\nIs that too much to ask? We\u2019ll soon find out.\n\nFrank Cerabino is a news columnist with The Palm Beach Post, where this column originally published. He can be reached at fcerabino@gannett.com"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump is using the power of the federal government to intimidate or neuter potential sources of opposition to him: The legal establishment, academia and prominent cultural institutions, the media, the judiciary, the Democratic Party, Congress and independent government oversight.\n\nThe unprecedented breadth of the actions Trump and his allies inside the government have taken against his perceived political and ideological opponents in his first two months back in office is stunning \u2013 both in the president\u2019s willingness to test the limits of his powers and the extent to which his foes have struggled to respond or even bent to his will.\n\nThrough executive orders, his bully pulpit and lieutenants in charge of the Justice Department and other Cabinet agencies, Trump\u2019s actions are paralyzing institutions that stand as pillars of America\u2019s independent civic society.\n\nWithin the legal establishment, at least two law firms Trump has a political vendetta against have chosen to cut a deal with him to avert his threats. In academia, universities like Columbia have agreed to sweeping demands that encroach on principles of academic freedom that date back centuries.\n\n\u201cThis White House\u2019s public, multi-pronged frontal assault on national institutions is unprecedented,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, the CNN presidential historian and senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs. \u201cInstitutions can be rebuilt, but political culture can be poisoned for a generation.\u201d\n\nThe sources of typical opposition for a president have been quieted \u2013 if not quashed altogether. Independent media organizations like the Associated Press are being shut out of access to the president in favor of pro-Trump outlets, while state-supported media is gutted and threatened with defunding.\n\nThe legislative branch has in many ways ceded its constitutional role as a check on the executive. Republicans in Congress have mostly been willing to give up control of federal spending to the Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 which has shut down agencies and programs mandated by Congress. And Democrats have flailed amid infighting over how they should oppose Trump.\n\nInside his administration, Trump has fired the inspectors general at more than a dozen federal agencies, as well as the head of the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nThe one source of sustained pushback to Trump\u2019s actions is the federal judiciary, where judges have repeatedly halted or reversed Trump\u2019s actions that they have ruled go beyond the legal limit. The judges who have stopped Trump have faced attacks from the president and his allies \u2013 with threats of impeachment or the elimination of courts that oppose him \u2013 and many of the injunctions being levied at the district court level may ultimately not survive a Supreme Court where Trump appointed one third of the justices in his first term.\n\nTrump has boasted about his effectiveness so far. At the White House on Wednesday, he gleefully said that he\u2019s been able to pressure law firms and colleges because the Biden administration\u2019s failures after he lost in 2020 allowed him to return to power and \u201cdo things that we could have never done if it were traditional.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see what we\u2019re doing with the colleges, and they\u2019re all bending and saying, \u2018Sir thank you very much we appreciate it,\u2019\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cAnd nobody can believe it \u2013 including law firms that have been so horrible, law firms that nobody would believe and they\u2019re just saying, \u201cWhere do I sign where do I sign?\u201d he continued. \u201cNobody can believe it. And there\u2019s more coming.\u201d\n\nLaw firms\u2019 dilemma: Sue or settle\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly lobbed attacks against the prosecutors who investigated and indicted him. Now that he\u2019s in office, he has gone a step further by kneecapping the law firms that have employed or defended those who investigated him.\n\nTrump has signed executive orders revoking security clearances, restricting access to federal buildings and severing federal ties with lawyers from at least five law firms: one that Hillary Clinton hired in 2016, one retained by special counsel Jack Smith and three that had previously employed lawyers who investigated him.\n\nThe onslaught has divided the targeted firms: Some are trying to fight in court while others are settling with Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s first two targets were Perkins Coie, the Democratic law firm that\u2019s long been in Trump\u2019s crosshairs for its role funding the 2016 Russia dossier, and Covington & Burling, where the White House suspended security clearances of lawyers representing former special counsel Jack Smith, now a private citizen.\n\nPerkins Coie tried to fight back, quickly filing a lawsuit and winning a temporary restraining order from US District Judge Beryl Howell, who issued a scathing ruling accusing the administration of undermining the integrity of the legal system, writing that the president cannot \u201cbring the federal government down on his political opponents \u2026 as he has done here.\u201d\n\nAnother law firm targeted by Trump took a different path. New York-based Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison was hit with an executive order in part because of the firm\u2019s former partner, Mark Pomerantz, who had investigated Trump in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nLast week, the firm struck a settlement with the administration agreeing to the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services to \u201csupport the Administration\u2019s initiatives,\u201d in exchange for rescinding the executive order.\n\nBrad Karp, the chairman of Paul Weiss, wrote in a letter to employees the executive order was an \u201cunprecedented threat\u201d that could have \u201cdestroyed our firm.\u201d The firm settled, he argued, because a legal fight was a no-win situation.\n\nSensing weakness, Trump has expanded his list of targeted firms. On Tuesday, he issued another executive order, this time taking aim at Jenner & Block, where Andrew Weissman, a top investigator in the FBI\u2019s 2016 Russia investigation, had once been a partner. And Thursday he added Wilmer Hale to his list, the former law firm of one-time special counsel Robert Mueller. Both firms filed lawsuits Friday to block Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nAnother potential target, Skadden Arps, proactively settled with Trump on Friday ahead of a possible executive order, pledging at least $100 million in pro-bono work.\n\nTrump also issued a memo last week to his attorney general, Pam Bondi, ordering her to review the conduct of law firms the administration considers to have filed \u201cfrivolous\u201d lawsuits against the United States, going back to his first term.\n\n\u201cAmerican law firms have always represented interests adverse to the US government, without worrying if there would be retribution or sanctions until now,\u201d said Cari Brunelle, the founder of a legal advisory firm that works with several large American law firms. \u201cIt\u2019s created just an incredible amount of fear.\u201d\n\nUniversities face dire funding threats\n\nThe Trump administration has turned the president\u2019s anger over pro-Palestinian campus protests and encampments into policy that\u2019s forced sweeping changes at Columbia University, considered the epicenter of the protests last year.\n\nThe Trump administration this month canceled $400 million in federal grants to Columbia over alleged \u201cinaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u201d Three agencies sent Columbia a letter demanding sweeping policy changes in order to regain access to the money.\n\nThe changes included implementing stricter rules for protests, banning masks, announcing a plan to hold student groups accountable, empowering law enforcement, and reviewing its Middle East studies programs and admissions.\n\n\u201cIt is, I think, the most serious intrusion into academic freedom, and the autonomy of universities,\u201d said Lee Bollinger, a First Amendment scholar and Columbia\u2019s president for more than two decades. (Naftali, the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, said that Nixon had wanted to crack down on universities over anti-war protests, but his aides stopped him.)\n\nStudent protesters gather inside their encampment on the Columbia University campus in April 2024 in New York. Stefan Jeremiah/AP/File\n\nLast week, Columbia agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands. The federal government responded positively but also said that it was \u201conly the first step in rehabilitating its relationship with the government.\u201d\n\nColumbia is hardly the only university in the government\u2019s crosshairs: The Department of Education is now investigating 60 colleges and universities for alleged violations \u201crelating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s immigration authorities have targeted a half-dozen foreign-born students and academics at Columbia and other top universities for deportation over their alleged roles in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nThe Trump administration has also pushed universities to align with the administration\u2019s stance on diversity programs and transgender women competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nPerhaps the most long-term threat to American universities is the Trump administration\u2019s desire to slash the grant funding that universities receive, which universities and scientists say could be devastating for research in America.\n\nIn addition to universities, Trump this week directed his government to scrutinize and threaten funding for the Smithsonian Institution to force federal museums to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from their exhibits.\n\nBanning and investigating the press\n\nTrump constantly attacked the reporters that covered him as \u201cfake news\u201d during his first term, and his rhetoric helped erode public confidence in the media.\n\nNow Trump\u2019s White House and several arms of the government are taking more direct aim at Trump\u2019s perceived opponents in the press.\n\nThe White House barred the Associated Press from the Oval Office, the White House press pool and other events because it objected to the news outlet\u2019s language. The White House singled out the AP because it continued to use the phrase \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d even though Trump renamed the body of water \u201cGulf of America.\u201d\n\nThe AP has sued the White House to regain its access.\n\nThe White House last month went a step further by taking control of which news outlets get access to the president in the press pool, adding pro-Trump outlets in place of the AP and others.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has launched investigations into several media companies \u2013 including CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its interview of Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last year. The FCC demanded CBS provide the transcript and raw footage of the interview. (The transcript, which the network published, showed CBS engaged in normal editing and not nefarious activity as Trump had alleged, CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter wrote).\n\n\u201cThis is a retaliatory move by the government against broadcasters whose content or coverage is perceived to be unfavorable,\u201d said Anna Gomez, one of two Democrats on the FCC.\n\nIn addition, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr quickly reversed eleventh-hour decisions from his Biden-era predecessor by reviving complaints that had been brought against local CBS, ABC and NBC stations \u2013 but not complaints against a Fox station. Carr has been unabashed about treating the historically independent agency as an extension of the Trump White House, including publicly touting \u201cDEI\u201d probes of NBC owner Comcast and ABC owner Disney.\n\nRep. James Comer speaks in front of posters of NPR headlines during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing at the US Capitol on March 26, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe FCC has also launched probes of NPR and PBS over the sponsorship practices of their member stations, and individual public radio stations over their reporting on immigration raids.\n\nIn Congress, Republicans have called for stripping federal funding of NPR and PBS \u2013 Trump said this week he would \u201clove to do that.\u201d And the Trump administration has already gutted Voice of America, the state-run media outlet that broadcasts around the world.\n\nMedia outlets have grappled with how to respond. ABC News settled a defamation lawsuit from Trump by pledging $15 million to a presidential foundation. The Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos \u2013 whose other companies receive government contracts \u2013 asserted control over the direction of the newspaper\u2019s opinion section last month, prompting resignations and a staff revolt.\n\nCBS\u2019s parent company, Paramount, agreed to a merger last year with Skydance that needs government sign-off. Paramount has reportedly considered settling a lawsuit from Trump against CBS over the 60 Minutes interview with Harris.\n\nCongress abdicates its power of the purse\n\nRepublicans in charge of both houses of Congress have largely stood back and supported the way Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE have taken over federal spending, raising little objection to the canceling of funds appropriated by Congress and destruction of agencies created via laws passed by the legislative branch.\n\nThe process of largely dismantling the US Agency for International Development and the Department of Education happened with little pushback from GOP lawmakers, even if the law requires Congress to play a role.\n\nAmbassador Samantha Power (C), former head of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), embraces fired employees and their supporters outside the agency's headquarters as former workers came to collect their personal belongings on February 27, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou can do a lot with just the use of executive authority, and I don\u2019t have any problem with the president aggressively using executive authority,\u201d House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole told CNN.\n\nIn response to mounting pressure from constituents, some lawmakers have privately raised concerns about the party\u2019s rhetoric towards federal workers, relying on backchannels with agency heads, while others have leveraged their personal connections in the administration to get certain federal programs impacting their districts turned back on. In closed-door meetings, they\u2019ve urged Musk to move his efforts to slash spending through Congress.\n\nBut the recent government funding process showed just how far Republicans were willing to go in abdicating their role over the power of the purse to the Trump administration. The bill that passed to keep the government open did not reflect the cuts the administration had made, which meant that Congress was no longer dictating the terms for which money was being spent.\n\nWhen given the room to speak anonymously, many Republicans are blunter about the way the Trump administration is bulldozing through institutional norms.\n\n\u201cIf this was a Democratic administration with the same things happening, people would be lit up about it,\u201d one GOP lawmaker told CNN. \u201cSo, I think we have to be careful about the precedent that they\u2019re setting.\u201d\n\nDemocrats involved in the process say Trump\u2019s spending moves violate the law.\n\n\u201cI absolutely believe that this administration is acting illegally and that we have a responsibility here in Congress to hold them accountable,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, told CNN. She joined with GOP Sen. Susan Collins to protest Trump not designating $3 billion in emergency funds approved by Congress from the spending bill.\n\nBut any Democratic hopes to use the spending process to slow Musk fizzled out, after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to back the spending bill rather than shut the government down to try to win concessions from the administration.\n\nDemocrats fear Trump\u2019s government will target them\n\nDemocrats are now completely out of power in Washington, still pointing fingers about the reasons they lost to Trump and trying to find a winning message to oppose him. They say they already see warning signs that Trump\u2019s Justice Department and Republicans in Congress could use their power to harm Democrats\u2019 political operations.\n\nEd Martin, interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia, has pushed for investigations into congressional Democrats, including reportedly seeking to present evidence to a grand jury over comments Schumer made about Supreme Court justices in 2020.\n\nDemocrats are also gearing up for a fight on the rules surrounding elections after a new executive order this week attempts to dramatically reshape how US elections are carried out. Democrats and voting rights experts this week denounced the executive order as a blatant power grab.\n\nTrump\u2019s order, which is likely to be challenged in court, seeks to use the withholding of federal funding and other threats of action to require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote \u2013 which critics say could disenfranchise millions of Americans \u2013 and to demand that states refuse to accept mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day. It also would allow federal officials to compare state voter rolls against federal databases in a search for unlawful voters, an exercise election experts say is likely to turn up false positives.\n\nMusk and congressional Republicans have also turned their attention to Democrats\u2019 powerhouse fundraising platform, ActBlue. Senior Republicans in Congress are urging Trump\u2019s Treasury Department to share with lawmakers reports of suspicious financial transactions related to ActBlue and calling for probes from Treasury and the FBI.\n\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy is urging the FCC to reconsider a decision last year that allowed billionaire Democratic megadonor George Soros to become the largest shareholder in Audacy and its empire of more than 200 radio stations.\n\nThe tactic by Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill to target progressive groups and law firms aligned with Democrats amounts to \u201cusing the levers of government to try and permanently destroy political opposition, which is what authoritarianism looks like,\u201d said one person close to Democratic fundraising circles.\n\nMike Davis, a former legal adviser to Trump and unapologetic evangelist for political retribution, forewarned during a recent appearance in Florida that there would be \u201csevere legal, political and financial consequences\u201d for many Democrats over the next four years. Reached by CNN, Davis held back on providing specifics of what\u2019s to come, but suggested Trump\u2019s early moves have made clear he intends to inflict pain on those he feels wronged him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn the other cheek,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd this is not the Trump 45 administration. They\u2019ve learned from their mistakes. Four years in office, four years in the wilderness, four years in lawfare.\u201d\n\nMichael Berry, a conservative lawyer serving as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s chief counsel, acknowledged recently an \u201cinternal tension\u201d over whether to \u201cfight fire with fire.\u201d Sharing a stage with Davis, Berry concluded, \u201cWe have to continue to take the high ground.\u201d\n\nDavis disagreed. \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make it right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes it even.\u201d\n\nJudges have been strongest counterbalance\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to stretch the limits of his executive authority have been repeatedly curtailed by the third branch of government: the judiciary.\n\nThere have been more than 100 lawsuits filed against the administration\u2019s executive actions in the first two months of Trump\u2019s presidency. They hit on all aspects of Trump\u2019s attempts to wield his power \u2013 from firing federal workers and slashing federal aid to deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and Trump\u2019s executive order to ban birthright citizenship.\n\nIn dozens of those cases, judges have temporarily blocked the Trump administration from taking action, so the cases can be litigated. Ultimately, much of Trump\u2019s efforts to bend US institutions to his will could come before the Supreme Court, where Trump\u2019s lawyers remain confident he will ultimately prevail in his use of executive power.\n\nBut many of the judges who have slowed Trump have come under professional and personal attack from both the president\u2019s allies and Trump himself on social media.\n\nSome Trump allies in Congress want to impeach the judges who oppose his policies, even though such an effort has no chance of succeeding. House Speaker Mike Johnson this week suggested Congress should consider eliminating district courts altogether, while there are several Republican bills to curtail nationwide injunctions.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg, the chief just of the federal court in Washington, DC, has been a top Trump target. Trump smeared Boasberg as a \u201cRadical Left Lunatic Judge\u201d and called for his impeachment on social media, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump\u2019s ire stems from Boasberg\u2019s ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration\u2019s use of a 1798 law for deportations. Boasberg has since pressed the administration to explain how it didn\u2019t defy his court order when it refused to turn two flights to El Salvador around earlier this month.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s possible violation of Boasberg\u2019s order has prompted fears that the White House will openly defy his \u2013 and other \u2013 court orders without facing repercussions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk over the last seven weeks about a constitutional crisis. People are throwing that term around,\u201d ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said at a hearing Boasberg held on the deportations. \u201cI think we are getting very close to it.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed, Devan Cole, Ray Sanchez and Brian Stelter contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File)\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump used contentiousness around transgender people's access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds. And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt\u2019s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board \u2014 particularly Trump\u2019s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies \u2014 along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president's spotlight is giving Monday's Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n\u201cWhat he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,\u201d said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. \u201cWe have to show him we won\u2019t go back.\u201d\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nTrump's actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women's spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort \u201cto reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land\u201d that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt's not just political gamesmanship. \u201cI think that whether or not that\u2019s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,\" Fordham\u2019s Murib said.\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election \u2014 55% \u2014 said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn\u2019t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris' voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it\u2019s been about right and about one-quarter said it\u2019s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump's and Republicans' positions have given them a political edge.\n\n\u201cThey are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\u201cPeople across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,\u201d said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s so small, it\u2019s relatively unknown,\u201d said Currah, who is transgender. \u201cAnd then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what\u2019s wrong with the left. You know: \u2018It\u2019s just too crazy. It\u2019s too woke.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n\u201cA lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,\u201d Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n\u201cThe Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,\" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women\u2019s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women\u2019s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience \u2026 to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,\u201d she said. But \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.
