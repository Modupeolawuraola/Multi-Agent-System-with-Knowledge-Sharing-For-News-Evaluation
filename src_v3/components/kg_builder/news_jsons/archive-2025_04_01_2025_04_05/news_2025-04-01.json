            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a deal with the law firm that employs former second gentleman Doug Emhoff, which the president said includes the firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, agreeing to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal services throughout his second term.\n\nIt\u2019s the third example of high-profile firms cutting deals with the White House as Trump has targeted firms that have done work with his perceived political enemies.\n\nWillkie\u2019s pro bono work in recent years has been especially attention-grabbing because it included a defamation win against Rudy Giuliani following his work for Trump after the 2020 election.\n\nThe firm represented two Georgia election workers Giuliani defamed by falsely claiming they switched votes against Trump while ballot counting. The free legal work the firm provided for the women amounted to tens of millions of dollars. After the firm chased Giuliani for a year to give up all his valuable property to compensate the women, Giuliani and the women reached an undisclosed settlement.\n\nEmhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, told Willkie\u2019s leadership he disagreed with their decision to seek a deal with the Trump administration, a person familiar with matter told CNN, telling the law firm they should fight this.\n\nTuesday afternoon, before the agreement was announced, Emhoff participated in an event at Georgetown Law School in his personal capacity where he addressed the matter.\n\n\u201cThe rule of law is under attack. Democracy is under attack. And so, all of us lawyers need to do what we can to push back on that,\u201d Emhoff told the students, the person familiar with the matter said. \u201cUs lawyers have always been on the frontlines, fighting for civil rights, for justice. \u2026 I love being a lawyer, this is what we do: We fight for people. We fight for what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThe firm brought Emhoff on board in January as a partner, saying he works out of both Los Angeles and New York and will focus on advising corporations and others especially in \u201cmatters with significant reputational concerns.\u201d Law firms Emhoff previously worked at before Harris became vice president haven\u2019t yet been caught in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s recent rash of deals with and policies against large American law firms.\n\nTrump said Tuesday the pro bono services would go toward services that he and Willkie support \u2014 assisting veterans, members of the military, Gold Star families, law enforcement and other public servants, combatting antisemitism and more broadly, \u201censuring fairness\u201d in the United States justice system, according to Trump\u2019s post on Truth Social. The president also said Willkie has affirmed its commitment to \u201cmerit-based\u201d hiring by not engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion measures and not discriminating against job candidates based on their political beliefs.\n\n\u201cWillkie Farr & Gallagher LLP proactively reached out to President Trump and his Administration, offering their decisive commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession,\u201d according to a statement from the White House included in Trump\u2019s Truth Social post.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, firm chairmen Thomas M. Cerabino and Matthew A. Feldman said the agreement \u201caddresses a $100 million pro bono commitment, access to legal representation to clients across a wide spectrum of viewpoints, and ensuring continued compliance with the law as it relates to our employment practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe substance of this agreement is consistent with our Firm\u2019s longstanding practices,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Firm remains committed to serving the needs of our clients, our employees, and the communities of which we are a part.\u201d\n\nTrump made a similar agreement with the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom last week. This comes as Trump has targeted law firms with executive actions limiting their ability to do business with the federal government, including Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which both have ties to former special counsel Robert Mueller. Those two firms have sued the administration to challenge Trump executive orders targeting them and their clients. The firms accused the government of using unconstitutional executive orders to punish or chill speech it doesn\u2019t like."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Tuesday and welcome to the first major Election Day of the year, with a critical state Supreme Court race in battleground Wisconsin that\u2019s drawn national attention, and two special elections in Florida for deep-red House seats, one of which in particular has made Republicans sweat.\n\nAfter diving into that Florida race yesterday, Steve Kornacki breaks down two key areas to watch in Wisconsin. Plus, our Capitol Hill team looks at how Republicans are bracing for President Donald Trump\u2019s big tariff announcement.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nTwo very different parts of Wisconsin to watch in the state Supreme Court election\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nWhile Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, Democrats and Republicans have both picked sides and are pouring fortunes into their efforts. As the votes are tallied tonight, the ability to claim political momentum amid the upheaval of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term will be on the line.\n\nWhat is being tested, though, is not so much whether large numbers of voters have changed their minds in the five months since the presidential election. When it comes to Trump himself, Wisconsin is an especially polarized state, with three straight presidential elections decided by less than 1 point. More likely, the outcome hinges on whether the pro-Trump side has become more engaged in an election like this than it has been up to this point.\n\nThis is a clear advantage that Democrats have carved out in the Trump era. In stand-alone elections for lower-profile offices, in which turnout is far lower than in races for president or even governor, they\u2019ve had the more motivated set of voters. This has been true in Wisconsin, where the Democratic-backed candidate won the most recent Supreme Court election in 2023 by 11 points. And it has been true nationally, where Democrats have posted a string of wins and overperformances in House special elections the last few years.\n\nThe energy isn\u2019t coming from all corners of the Democratic coalition. Instead, it is concentrated among a largely white set of voters with high levels of education, higher incomes and intensely anti-Trump views.\n\nThey are found in most abundance in college towns and metropolitan areas, but even in places where they are few in number, they\u2019ve been punching above their weight in lower-turnout elections.\n\nOn the flip side, Trump in his three campaigns has generated surge turnout and support from blue-collar, white voters, predominantly in rural and small-town areas. Many of those voters had been on the political sidelines before Trump came along, while others had been voting Democratic. They\u2019ve maintained strong loyalty to Trump but haven\u2019t been as interested in low-profile contests like state Supreme Court races.\n\nTwo particular parts of Wisconsin capture this dynamic starkly and will loom large Tuesday night.\n\nDane County is some of the most demographically fertile ground for Democrats anywhere in the country. Home to both the state capital and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, it has \u2014 by far \u2014 the highest concentration of college-educated adults in the state. It\u2019s also the fifth-wealthiest county in the state, and with nearly 600,000 residents, it\u2019s the second-most populous. And in lower-profile races like this one, its turnout levels have been the highest of any county.\n\nThen there\u2019s what\u2019s known locally as the \u201cDriftless Area,\u201d a largely rural and small-town swath that extends along and inland of the Mississippi River from the Iowa border to just south of the Twin City suburbs of St. Croix County. The name derives from a lack of glacial coverage tens of thousands of years ago, but politically, the Driftless Area is chock full of white, blue-collar voters who emerged in droves when Trump first ran for the White House in 2016. It is the cultural and political opposite of Dane County.\n\nNow consider what happened in the 2023 Supreme Court election. If we use last year\u2019s presidential race as a benchmark, turnout in Dane County for the 2023 court race was 66% as high. That\u2019s an astronomical sum given the office at stake. And the Democratic-aligned candidate won by 64 points, a much larger spread than Democratic presidential candidates typically enjoy in Dane.\n\nBy contrast, turnout in the 14 counties that make up the Driftless Area was only 51% of the presidential level, meaning that many of those voters who materialized for Trump simply didn\u2019t take part. And without them, the Democratic-backed candidate actually won the Driftless Area, a throwback to the pre-Trump era.\n\nThat encapsulates the challenge for Republicans in Tuesday\u2019s race: Have they found a way to reach pro-Trump voters in places like the Driftless Area and convince them that it\u2019s a test of their loyalty to the president?\n\nRead more: What to watch as Wisconsin and Florida host the first major elections of Trump\u2019s second term, by Adam Edelman, Bridget Bowman, Ben Kamisar and Kailani Koenig\n\nLive coverage: Follow along with live updates from tonight\u2019s elections on our live blog\n\nSome Republicans seek tariff exemptions and express concern over Trump trade war\n\nBy Sahil Kapur, Melanie Zanona and Zo\u00eb Richards\n\nSeveral congressional Republicans are publicly voicing concern over the potential for a prolonged trade war and its effect on American farmers as President Donald Trump prepares to announce a new wave of tariffs.\n\nTrump is expected to impose duties as early as Wednesday on imports from other countries in a move that could hit the agriculture community particularly hard. Several GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are seeking last-minute carveouts to blunt the impact of those tariffs.\n\nRep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, told NBC News that he has asked the White House to exempt certain goods that are important to the U.S. agricultural industry, such as fertilizer and peat moss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of pointed out the things that I\u2019m hoping\u201d will be excluded, he said. \u201cI talk with anybody who will listen to me. ... They\u2019ve been really good about input.\u201d\n\nThompson also said he hopes Congress won\u2019t need to bail out farmers with an emergency aid package, as it did during the first Trump administration. But, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be prepared to do that\u201d again if needed.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said exemptions for specific goods are likely to be needed.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can tell you right now is on potash,\u201d Grassley said when he was asked about Trump\u2019s tariffs. Citing the U.S.\u2019s reliance on Canada for much of its potash, Grassley said \u201cwe\u2019ll have to ask for\u201d an exemption.\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, indicated a divide between the farming and nonfarming communities.\n\nCole said farmers in his state \u201cexport a lot,\u201d so they have concerns about retaliatory tariffs. Those outside the agricultural community, however, are \u201cmostly in favor\u201d of the tariffs, which he said has prompted him to take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nThe Trump administration carried out mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, aiming to slash around 10,000 full-time jobs from the federal agencies long tasked with regulating food and drugs, and overseeing the nation\u2019s public health policies.\n\nAt least six federal agencies are offering workers a new \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d opportunity in the latest attempt by the Trump administration to slash the size of the U.S. government.\n\nThe U.S. government accidentally deported a man to El Salvador due to an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d landing him in a notorious mega-jail and leaving him stuck there in legal limbo.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City last year.\n\nNonprofit and Democratic groups filed legal challenges against Trump\u2019s new executive order aimed at overhauling federal elections.\n\nDemocratic officials in 23 states and Washington, D.C., sued the Trump administration over its decision to \u201cabruptly and arbitrarily\u201d terminate $11 billion in federal funds for Covid and other public health projects.\n\nThe administration cut funding to a host of Princeton University research projects, marking the latest Ivy League institution to see its federal backing reduced or revoked.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83e\udd37 Shrugged off: Trump told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker over the weekend that he is \u201cnot joking\u201d about wanting to seek a third term, which the Constitution prohibits.

Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn March, the government hastily released more than 2000 documents totaling approximately 80,000 pages. Most of what the government released was not new -- in fact, much of what attracted attention on social media and in news reports had long been in the public domain, except for minor redactions, such as the blacking out of personally-identifiable information of CIA sources or employees (names and addresses) that have now been disclosed.\n\nThe newly-declassified versions of these documents did not substantively change what is known about the central Warren Commission finding that Stone has called into question: that Oswald was the lone gunman.\n\nBut they did shed light on details of mid-20th century espionage that the CIA had fiercely fought to keep secret and that are treasure trove for historians and scholars.\n\nRepublican committee members on Tuesday pushed claims, also without evidence, about the investigations into JFK's death, repeatedly getting facts surrounding the probes wrong and even yielding their time to allow witnesses to freely talk about theories rather than asking questions.\n\nIn this May 20, 2024, file photo, Oliver Stone attends the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals in Cannes, France. Daniele Venturelli/WireImage via Getty Images, FILE\n\nWhile praising the Trump administration for the release of the JFK documents, they also pushed unfounded claims that not all information has been made publicly available, questioning whether the public would ever truly know what happened.\n\nDemocrats on the subcommittee sought to focus on what they referenced as the truth, dissuading their colleagues and witnesses from drifting into conspiracy theories while criticizing the rollout of the declassified documents.\n\nStone's film focused on the work of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who conducted an independent investigation of the assassination, resulting in his failed prosecution of New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw, who Garrison alleged was involved in a CIA conspiracy to kill the president.\n\nThe film was a commercial and critical success, grossing $205 million and winning two Academy Awards. It was credited with popularizing conspiracy theories of FBI and CIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination.\n\nThe film was credited by the Assassination Records Review Board as being at least partially responsible for the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. Stone testified before Congress in support of that bill. The act mandated the release of all documents related to the assassination by 2017, though that timeline was delayed several times.\n\nThe movie's release also coincided with an increased degree of public skepticism in the Warren Commission finding that Oswald acted alone.\n\nGallup polling as recent as 2023 has consistently shown that a majority of Americans has consistently believed more than one person was responsible for the assassination. The number believing the official conclusion of a lone gunman saw a sharp decline in the 1970s and 1980s, reaching an all-time low of 10% in 1992.\n\nABC News' Ely Brown contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough during the first Trump administration. Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photos\n\nThis is a pretty big week in American politics. On Tuesday we\u2019ll see the first special and off-year elections of the second Trump era, and on Wednesday Trump will impose a wide array of new tariffs (an event he calls Liberation Day). But a little-known decision could soon dwarf those important developments in long-term significance. Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough is set to decide whether Congress can treat $4.6 trillion in proposed tax cuts as \u201cfree\u201d from the point of view of the budget process. That\u2019s because she is the official referee of what passes muster for inclusion in a Senate budget-reconciliation bill, which cannot be filibustered. Indeed, there is an arcane procedure called a \u201cByrd bath\u201d (in honor of the late senator Robert Byrd, one of the chief architects of the budget process) through which MacDonough is empowered to rule particular proposed budget provisions in or out.\n\nAs it happens, Senate Republicans very much want to pull a fast one in how the budget bill is put together this year, as NBC News reported:\n\nExtending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in 2017, would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the official nonpartisan scorekeeper. That\u2019s under the \u201ccurrent law\u201d metric that has traditionally been used, as the tax cuts are slated to expire at the end of this year. But Senate Republicans want to use a different scoring method called the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline, which would assume that extending tax cuts costs $0 because they\u2019re already law \u2026\n\nIf the tactic is successful, it would upend long-standing precedent and change the accounting process for current and future lawmakers, with major policy stakes.\n\nThe \u201ctactic,\u201d as NBC calls it, is pretty fundamentally a lie. These tax cuts were initially made affordable under budget rules by utilization of an expiration date. Suddenly wishing away expiration dates makes revenue losses not earlier contemplated magically \u201cfree\u201d of any impact on budget deficits. As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explains, this approach creates a sort of perpetual-motion machine where costs are defined out of existence:\n\nA common excuse for using a current policy baseline \u2014 which assumes that all temporary policies are actually permanent \u2014 is that it better reflects the \u201creality\u201d of what will happen. However, this argument is nihilistic, ahistorical, and inaccurate.\n\nAssuming anything that is likely to happen will happen effectively assumes Congress has little autonomy or decision-making power and establishes a type of circular logic where any policy that lawmakers want to enact is assumed to be costless because it already reflects \u201creality.\u201d\n\nNihilistic or not, a whole lot depends on whether MacDonough goes along with the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d scam \u2014 not just the tax cuts themselves but the vast and painful budget cuts that Republicans will surely impose to offset them. $4.6 trillion in cuts would almost guarantee big reductions in Medicaid and possible Medicare spending along with massive reductions in the discretionary spending that keeps the federal government functioning, even at the reduced levels being contemplated by Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE. Such a course of action would very much expose the GOP to Democratic claims that its goal is to cut federal programs and services on which lower- and middle-class Americans rely in order to reward Trump\u2019s billionaire buddies and their businesses with tax cuts.\n\nIf, on the other hand, MacDonough does play ball with brand-new rules, it may make Senate Republicans momentarily happy, but it\u2019s unclear the fiscal hawks of the House Freedom Caucus will be willing to go along. And in the longer run, financial markets will see through the gambit, and eventually the Federal Reserve could impose monetary policies designed to offset the real deficit in ways that Trump and congressional Republicans could find very unpleasant.\n\nTheoretically, the Senate could overrule MacDonough or even fire her, though she is a respected nonpartisan figure who has worked under both Republican and Democratic majorities dating back to 2012. Ultimately, the same real-world arbiters of deficits and debt that may disregard \u201ccurrent policy\u201d scoring would look very dimly on an open GOP revolt against the budget rules and their referee.\n\nSo, yes, MacDonough\u2019s decision is likely to be fateful. At stake is nothing less than Donald Trump\u2019s whole legislative agenda."

Photo: El Salvador Presidency Handout/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nLast month, the Trump administration invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act to place hundreds of Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrants on deportation flights to El Salvador on allegations that they were criminals with extensive gang ties. Though James Boasberg, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued an order for the military flights to be halted as he weighed a legal challenge, the government has continued to transport migrants out of the country to be detained in CECOT, El Salvador\u2019s notorious maximum-security prison.\n\nBut several family members are contesting the allegations against their loved ones, saying they\u2019ve been deported based on faulty information and without due process. While the administration has doubled down on its deportation efforts, reports have emerged that the government is determining gang affiliation in part through an individual\u2019s tattoos or clothing, a clearly imperfect metric. Here, some of the migrants with no reported gang affiliation who have been sent to an uncertain fate.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia\n\nAs The Atlantic reported on March 31, the Trump administration acknowledged in court papers that it had wrongfully sent Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father, to an El Salvador prison despite his protected legal status. \u201cAlthough ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,\u201d the filing read.\n\nBut on April 4, a Maryland federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must make arrangements to return Abrego Garcia back to the United States, giving the government. According to CBS News, the government has until 11:59 p.m. on April 7 to comply with the order.\n\nAbrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador who fled gang violence and entered the United States in 2011 as a 16-year-old. An immigration judge later granted Abrego Garcia \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d status in 2019, which allowed him to stay in the country because he would face a possible risk to his life if he returned to El Salvador.\n\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told The Atlantic that Abrego Garcia has no criminal history and isn\u2019t a member of a gang, as alleged by the federal government. He said Abrego Garcia\u2019s only involvement with the law came in 2019 when he and three other men were detained by police in a Home Depot parking lot in Maryland:\n\nDuring questioning, one of the men told officers that Abrego Garcia was a gang member, but the man offered no proof and police said they didn\u2019t believe him, filings show. Police did not identify him as a gang member.\n\nAbrego Garcia was not charged with a crime, but he was handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the arrest to face deportation. In those proceedings, the government claimed that a reliable informant had identified him as a ranking member of MS-13. Abrego Garcia and his family hired an attorney and fought the government\u2019s attempt to deport him. He received \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d six months later, a protected status.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times reports that Abrego Garcia\u2019s family has filed a civil suit urging the government to withhold payments to El Salvador until Abrego Garcia is returned, but the administration\u2019s lawyers have argued that the courts don\u2019t have the jurisdiction to make that order. Vice-President J.D. Vance defended the administration\u2019s action in deporting Abrego Garcia, incorrectly claiming on social media that he was a \u201cconvicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.\u201d\n\nFranco Caraballo\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to Johanny S\u00e1nchez, the wife of Franco Caraballo, one of the many Venezuelan immigrants flown out of the country to El Salvador. According to S\u00e1nchez, her husband vanished from ICE\u2019s online detainee locator, and she later learned that he had been deported.\n\nS\u00e1nchez said her husband had kept up with his mandatory appointments with ICE as his asylum application was being processed, noting that he went to a February meeting at a Dallas office for the agency. She said Caraballo was not a member of Tren de Aragua and believes he could\u2019ve been profiled because of his numerous tattoos, including one of a clock marking their daughter\u2019s birthday.\n\n\u201cHe has lots of tattoos, but that\u2019s not a reason to discriminate against him,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nAndry Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Romero\n\nAttorneys for Andry Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, a makeup artist, have said their client was detained and later transported to El Salvador after arriving in the U.S. as an asylum seeker. The New Yorker reports that the 31-year-old, who is gay, fled Venezuela fearing persecution from the country\u2019s government and initially passed a preliminary screening but that officials focused on his tattoos during a physical examination.\n\nAndry denied belonging to any gang. The agent, who asked him about the tattoos, described his \u201cdemeanor during interview\u201d as \u201cuncooperative.\u201d A note was added to his file: \u201cUpon conducting a review of detainee Hernandez\u2019s tattoos it was found that detainee Hernandez has a crown on each one of his wrist. The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member.\u201d These crowns, according to the government, were \u201cdetermining factors to conclude reasonable suspicion.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez Romero was detained for several months and was due for a court appearance in March, but he was deported to El Salvador prior to his hearing. His attorneys have argued that his tattoos are not gang-related. \u201cThere is no evidence to believe that he is affiliated in any way with Tren de Aragua and Andry has consistently refuted those claims,\u201d his lawyers wrote, per the Times. \u201cHe fled Venezuela due to persecution for his political opinion and his sexual orientation and his tattoos have an obvious explanation that has nothing to do with a gang.\u201d\n\nMervin Jose Yamarte Fernandez\n\nFamily members of Mervin Jose Yamarte Fernandez recognized him in a video showing detainees being transported from a U.S. military flight to the maximum-security prison in El Salvador. He was arrested while working at his job at a Texas restaurant and removed from the country within a day\u2019s time.\n\nHis sister, Jare, told the Miami Herald that her brother joined her in Texas from their home country of Venezuela and that he has no criminal record. Unlike some of the others detained by the federal government, she said her brother has no tattoos owing to their family\u2019s religious upbringing. Though Yamarte Fernandez had moved to the United States in order to send money back home to his wife and child, the family had decided to self-deport because of the Trump administration\u2019s targeting of Venezuelan nationals.\n\n\u201cWe came to this country to work and do things right,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s painful that they blame my brother, and they portray him as a member of the Tren de Aragua. I don\u2019t accept the bad reputation created around my brother.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nSince Inauguration Day, party activists have been begging elected Democrats to \u201cdo something\u201d to interfere with Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. Senate Democrats had the chance on March 14. They, or at least the ten needed to short-circuit any potential filibuster, decided the \u201csomething\u201d involved had unacceptable consequences (a government shutdown they feared they would be blamed for triggering).\n\nThat left the minority party in Congress with no identifiable leverage point until at least the end of the fiscal year on September 30. Nearly everything else Team Trump wants to do legislatively is expected to be dumped into a budget-reconciliation bill that Democrats cannot filibuster or influence because it will be designed to pass on a strict party-line vote, with President Trump personally whipping the congressional GOP (just as he did earlier to pass the spending bill and a budget resolution).\n\nSo what\u2019s a congressional Democrat to do? Make a lot of noise, apparently. Some (e.g., Bernie Sanders and AOC in their \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour and Chris Murphy and Maxwell Frost in their Town Hall series) are hitting the road and getting away from Washington to rouse the party faithful directly. But another, New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker, chose to stay in the Senate and speak against Trump\u2019s agenda \u201cfor as long as I am physically able.\u201d Calling the occasion a \u201cmoral moment,\u201d Booker, who was not one of the Democrats who caved on the spending bill, took the floor at 7 p.m. Monday and managed to stick it out for over 24 hours. He broke one of those unbreakable records, the legendary Strom Thurmond filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (it\u2019s a nice irony that the old segregationist\u2019s landmark feat of endurance was surpassed by a Black senator!). Booker did not, technically, undertake a filibuster since he is not trying to stop a specific piece of legislation; he is instead trying to dramatize the scope and intensity of the threat that Trump, Elon Musk, and other presidential stooges pose to government as we know it and to democracy itself. Twenty-four hours does provide a lot of time to speak expansively, but the New York Times briefly summarized Booker\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cIn just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans\u2019 safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for \u2014 from our highest offices \u2014 a sense of common decency,\u201d Mr. Booker said in his speech. \u201cThese are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.\u201d\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s feed on X, his social media platform, was active late into the night, but it made no mention of Mr. Booker or his all-night speech. Neither did Mr. Trump\u2019s Truth Social feed.\n\nAs viewers followed along on Mr. Booker\u2019s official YouTube channel, he quoted from celebrated speeches by Representative John Lewis and Senator John McCain, both of whom have died. At one point, he spent around 30 minutes reading an account by a Canadian citizen, Jasmine Mooney, about her detention in the United States by immigration enforcement officers.\n\nBooker\u2019s McCain reference was part of an extended paean to endangered federal health-care services, notably Medicaid, as CNN reported:\n\nIn his remarks, Booker warned of potential cuts to Medicaid by congressional Republicans and the harm that would cause to his constituents and Americans across the country. \u2026\n\nAt one point, Booker invoked the late GOP Sen. John McCain, reflecting on McCain\u2019s pivotal health care vote in 2017, and drawing parallels to the current moment.\n\n\u201cIt is maddening in this country to create greater and greater health care crisis and for us not to solve it but to battle back and forth between trying to make incremental changes or to tear it all down with no plan to make it better, leaving more Americans suffering,\u201d Booker said.\n\nCory Booker is not a stranger to what even his many admirers acknowledge as publicity stunts. A memorable Booker attention-grabber occurred when, as a first-term city councilman in Newark, he moved into a tent in a parking lot outside a squalid housing project to attest to its deterioration and the city\u2019s indifference. He got results and eventually became mayor of the city before winning his first of three Senate elections in 2013. He hasn\u2019t always been successful, though, as reflected in his dismal 2020 presidential campaign that ended before the first contest in Iowa.\n\nAt 55, Booker is young enough to try again if he wishes. But for the moment, he\u2019s just another disempowered Democrat trying to placate angry constituents and activists who may have unrealistic ideas about what a minority party in a governing trifecta regime can actually do to throw sand in the gears of the Trump train. If talk can make them feel better, Booker has become the man with the plan\u2013every hour of the day and night, and every \u201cmoral moment.\u201d"

And since being apprehended at a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s, Mangione has gained a significant cult following.\n\nIn a statement, Mangione\u2019s defense attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, said that \u201cby seeking to murder Luigi Mangione, the Justice Department has moved from the dysfunctional to the barbaric.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump made heavy use of the federal death penalty during his first term, overseeing the execution of 13 people. Merrick Garland, the attorney general under President Biden, declared a moratorium on the federal death penalty, and Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 current federal death-row inmates. But Attorney General Bondi revoked the moratorium on her first day in office, after Trump signed an executive order directing the U.S. attorney general to once again seek the death penalty."

            "full_content": "Canadian signer Michael Bubl\u00e9 delivered a patriotic monologue on Sunday in which he declared his country is \u201cnot for sale\u201d and \u201cthe greatest nation on earth,\u201d an apparent response to President Donald Trump repeatedly suggesting that America could annex Canada.\n\nBubl\u00e9 made the remarks while hosting Canada\u2019s Juno Awards, an annual music event. He did not mention Trump by name or offer any explicit political endorsement or condemnation \u2013 notable given that Canada is heading for a general election on April 28 contested mostly between incumbent, unelected Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre. Both Poilievre and Carney are campaigning on the claim that Trump would prefer their opponent win the election, attempting to capitalize on growing anti-American sentiment in the country driven in part by Trump\u2019s \u201c51st state\u201d comments. Bubl\u00e9\u2019s comments were nonetheless interpreted as defiance against the idea of Canada losing its sovereign to its southern neighbor.\n\n\u201cYou guys know I\u2019m a hometown kid \u2013 I\u2019m a hometown kid who never left,\u201d Bubl\u00e9 told the audience, \u201cand as I stand here and I look out at my fellow artists \u2026 I\u2019m proud to be Canadian.\u201d\n\nBubl\u00e9 attempted to reference a line first popularized by American former First Lady Michelle Obama, asserting, \u201cwhen they go low, we get high,\u201d which he rapidly corrected. The singer never identified the \u201cthey\u201d he was challenging, but continued, \u201cwhen you love something, you show up for it, and we always will.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will, because we\u2019re formidable, because we\u2019re fearless, because we don\u2019t just acknowledge our differences, we embrace them,\u201d Bubl\u00e9 stated. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t just make us stronger, they make us a hell of lot more interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the greatest nation on earth and we are not for sale,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe current tensions between Washington and Ottawa began shortly after President Trump won his second term in office. At the time, Trump announced a plan to impose a 25-percent tariff on both Canada and Mexico in response to what he described as an out-of-control crime situation on the northern border and Canada\u2019s failure to stop drug and human trafficking hurting Americans.\n\n\u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\u201d Trump threatened in November. \u201cThis Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\u201d\n\nThe prime minister at the time, radical leftist Justin Trudeau, rapidly flew to Florida to discuss the situation with the president-elect. Trump ultimately delayed the tariffs and did not impose them on January 20, but joked that Trudeau was the \u201cgovernor\u201d of the \u201cstate\u201d of Canada, outraging Canadians and eventually dooming Trudeau\u2019s political career. After a decade in power, Trudeau announced in January he would resign, a move largely believed to be fueled by infighting in the Liberal Party over his poor showing with Trump.\n\n\u201cMany people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,\u201d Trump wrote on social media shortly after Trudeau announced his plan to resign.\n\nTrump has since resumed conversation with Carney, Trudeau\u2019s successor who took power in March after winning the leadership of the Liberal Party in an internal membership election. Trump and Carney most recently spoke on Friday in a phone call that Trump praised as \u201cextremely productive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe agree on many things, and we will be meeting immediately after Canada\u2019s upcoming Election to work on elements of Politics, Business, and all other factors, that will end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada,\u201d Trump wrote, apparently presuming Carney\u2019s electoral victory.\n\nTrump explicitly stated in an interview with Fox News this month that he would prefer Carney win to the conservative Poilievre.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal. And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe Conservative that\u2019s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don\u2019t know him, but he said negative things,\u201d Trump said of Poilievre. \u201cSo, when he says negative things, I couldn\u2019t care less. I think it\u2019s easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal. And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s stated preference for and politeness towards Carney, Canadian leftists have attempted to brand Poilievre as the pro-Trump options. Leftist celebrities, most prominently comedian Mike Myers, have embraced Carney.\n\nBubl\u00e9 has openly discussed politics in past interviews but not embraced any particular partisan identity. He was notably a guest on conservative television personality Glenn Beck\u2019s two programs \u2013 on CNN and Fox News \u2013 in the 2000s, though he did not offer any overt political commentary. Bubl\u00e9 has been a vocal supporter of gay rights, citing in past interviews members of his family who are gay, and once joked it was \u201csexist\u201d of him to refer to Santa Claus as \u201cbuddy\u201d in his version of the Christmas classic \u201cSanta Baby.\u201d\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Bubl\u00e9 described himself as listening \u201cto people like Richard Dawkins and Noam Chomsky on YouTube.\u201d\n\nIn several public instances, when asked about Trump personally, Bubl\u00e9 has offered neither praise nor explicit condemnation.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop the politicians or stupid, uneducated people from thinking and saying and doing stupid things, but I can make a stand, I can talk to you,\u201d he said in an interview with David magazine, \u201cand when I\u2019m with groups of friends or I\u2019m in public places or when I\u2019m with people who I think can use that sense of love and education, I can open my mouth and tell them how I feel. And one at a time, you can change the world like that.\u201d\n\nIn more recent comments in 2023, Bubl\u00e9 lamented that American media was \u201cvery conservative\u201d and the country was experiencing a \u201cgreat divide.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

            "full_content": "Photo: Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n\nFor all the Shohei Ohtani worship or Paul Skenes hype, nothing in baseball breaks through to the broader public like the possibility of a cheating scandal. Think steroids, Pete Rose betting on his own team, or the Astros\u2019 \u201cbanging scheme.\u201d Baseball is more amenable to cheating than some other sports, since it doesn\u2019t require \u2014 or at least rely upon \u2014 superior athleticism, thus making it easy to gain any sort of edge you can around the margins. And the sport feels uniquely vulnerable to the damage cheating can wreak, since fans still hold on to a romantic notion that baseball should be \u201cpure,\u201d despite the fact that it has never been free of rule-bending or outright deception.\n\nSo the minute I saw reports that the Yankees were using a \u201cnew\u201d kind of bat, and that they\u2019d used that bat to smash 12 homers and score 36 runs in a season-opening sweep over the Brewers, I knew we were in for it. When a sport is as steeped in lore as baseball is, innovation \u2014 whether it\u2019s medical, technological, or just analytical \u2014 will always initially be treated as scandalous. Even if it\u2019s not. If you\u2019ve glanced at the news, saw a headline or two, and thought, Those damn Yankees are cheating again, well, here\u2019s a quick FAQ to let you know what\u2019s going on.\n\nSo what are these bats, exactly?\n\nThey\u2019re not made of Vibranium or anything. They\u2019re regular wooden bats, made out of the same kind of trees as every other bat. The difference is their shape. The barrel, or \u201csweet spot\u201d \u2014 a.k.a. the place where hitters try to hit the ball \u2014 is simply larger. You know those plastic wiffle-ball bats you owned as a kid, the beginner\u2019s version of which had a comically large section in the middle that made it hard for any 3-year-old to swing and miss? These things? The Yankees\u2019 bats are a very scientific version of those, but adjusted for the Major Leagues.\n\nYes, the Yankees have a literal genius MIT Physicist, Lenny (who is the man), on payroll. He invented the \u201cTorpedo\u201d barrel. It brings more wood - and mass - to where you most often make contact as a hitter. The idea is to increase the number of \u201cbarrels\u201d and decrease misses. pic.twitter.com/CsC1wkAM9G \u2014 Kevin Smith (@KJS_4) March 29, 2025\n\nThe bats are essentially the invention of an MIT physicist named Aaron Leanhardt, who worked for the Yankees before becoming the Marlins\u2019 field coordinator during the offseason (Note: I am not personally sure what being a \u201cfield coordinator\u201d involves.) Leanhardt, in an interview with The Athletic\u2019s Brendan Kuty on Sunday, explained that \u201cit\u2019s just about making the bat as heavy and as fat as possible in the area where you\u2019re trying to do damage on the baseball.\u201d\n\nAre they legal?\n\nOne hundred percent. MLB rules simply say that \u201cbats cannot be more than 2.61 inches in diameter and 42 inches in length.\u201d There is no rule dictating that one part of the bat cannot be thicker than any other part.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t anyone think of this before?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear. Leanhardt wondered the same, saying in the Athletic interview it\u2019s \u201cthe nature of our business\u201d that it took so long to innovate. That\u2019s a very nice way of saying, \u201cBaseball people don\u2019t think a lot about bat design.\u201d It\u2019s also possible no one thought it was legal.\n\nIs there a cute nickname for the bats?\n\nOf course. They\u2019re known as \u201ctorpedo\u201d bats. This does make one think they will be particularly effective against submarine pitchers.\n\nAre they unfair? Are the Yankees cheating?\n\nFirst off, this weekend wasn\u2019t the first time the Yankees have used torpedo bats. They were in constant rotation throughout spring training, and shortstop Anthony Volpe even used one late in the 2024 regular season. Nobody noticed or cared. So why the uproar now? Because the Yankees went absolute apeshit over the opening weekend, bashing Brewers pitchers all over (and out of) Yankee Stadium, including poor former Yankee Nestor Cortes, who gave up homers on the first three pitchers he threw. Two of those homers came from new Yankees Paul Goldschmidt and Cody Bellinger, both of whom used the torpedo bats. Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Austin Wells also partook and also homered. (Aaron Judge is not a torpedo-bat user, which, it should be said, did not stop him from hitting four homers over the weekend.)\n\nThe Yankees are the only team with access to torpedo bats right now, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re proprietary or anything. The notion of maximizing the impact of hitting the ball with the barrel of the bat has been a part of bat design since there were bats. \u201cIf you were around the clubhouse, all 30 teams, you would see a guy or two that\u2019s adopting a bat that\u2019s kind of fashioned more specifically to their swing,\u201d Orioles batting coach Cody Asche said over the weekend. With the success the Yankees have had so far this season, you can be sure that more and more torpedo bats will start showing up throughout baseball. There is nothing untoward about it, except maybe the team wealth disparity on display: A nice thing about being one of the richest organizations in sports is that you can afford to put an MIT physicist on staff and see if he can big-brain you up something fancy.\n\nAre the bats really making much difference?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell. It should be said that Yankees hitters were already good before they used the bats (and of course their best hitter, Judge, isn\u2019t using them). Kevin Smith, a former ballplayer and now an equipment designer, pointed out that \u201cobviously, it\u2019s not going to make you an elite hitter if you aren\u2019t already (I tried). But for the best in the world, any slight advantage could be the difference.\u201d The Yankees hit those homers because they are good baseball players. But Leanhardt, who believes all of baseball will be using the bats in the next five years (which is the sort of thing the guy who invented them would probably say), posits that the bats themselves are all upside: \u201cUltimately, you\u2019re getting a fatter barrel, a heavier barrel at the sweet spot. So in some sense, you can have your cake and eat it here too. You can get some gains without actually making sacrifices.\u201d\n\nIs there any downside?\n\nYou might want to ask Giancarlo Stanton, who blamed \u201csome bat adjustments\u201d to the torn ligaments in his wrists that landed him on the injured list. Then again, Giancarlo Stanton is always on the injured list.\n\nIs this going to become a whole thing with the Yankees? Are people going to try to credit any success they have to the \u201cjuiced\u201d bats?\n\nProbably, but that won\u2019t make those people right. First off, everyone will be using the bats soon (except Judge, apparently), so it won\u2019t just be a Yankees thing. More to the point: There will be a stretch when the Yankees barely hit any homers for, like, a week, and everybody will forget all about this. The baseball season is very long, after all. But for a good juicy topic to kick things off \u2014 to get everybody dialed up for a pretend scandal \u2014 you couldn\u2019t ask for a better one. Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!"

            "full_content": "Photo: Fabio Lovino/HBO\n\nSaxon Ratliff, the protein-shake\u2013blending, muscle-bound bro at the center of the latest season of The White Lotus, is the man of our moment. Played with impish glee by Patrick Schwarzenegger, Saxon is the sort of young male we\u2019re supposed to care a lot about these days: scornful of political correctness, indifferent to what is happening outside his privileged bubble, definitely voted for Trump. If we could only figure out what makes Saxon tick, if we could only light up some part of his lizard brain that would compel him not to vote for Trump, then maybe everything would be all right. Discovering what Saxon and other young men want has become a veritable holy quest for the liberal press and political class, the skeleton key to saving the Republic. Unfortunately, Saxon\u2019s interests are limited to getting laid, pumping iron, and going to Duke.\n\nOr so it seems. It often feels like the show\u2019s creator, Mike White, is spinning his wheels in this third season, cycling through familiar critiques of the empty materialism of his wealthy and out-of-touch characters, who search for solace and meaning in all the wrong places: sex, money, lorazepam. Nevertheless, through the travails of Saxon, the show has struck upon some devastating psychological territory that shimmers just beneath the discussion of young men and their desires, most notably in a now-notorious scene in which a drug-addled Saxon gets a hand job from his little brother Lochlan during a threesome. This scene has largely been interpreted as the latest example of HBO shocking viewers with depictions of incest \u2014 a decadent society\u2019s last sexual taboo \u2014 a trick the network has played going back to the first episode of Game of Thrones. But Saxon\u2019s crisis is more significant than that, a glimpse of a larger conundrum for heterosexual males who, in this anti-woke era, are less beholden to women than ever.\n\nWhile Saxon hits on any woman in sight, women are just interchangeable ciphers in a campaign of sexual conquest \u2014 picking up chicks, Saxon tells Lochlan, is \u201ca numbers game.\u201d In fact, the person he is really trying to impress is Lochlan, a sensitive boy who is caught in a tug of war between Saxon and their soul-searching sister, Piper, who has come to Thailand to join a Buddhist seminary and escape the suffocating confines of her shallow family. In Saxon\u2019s universe, only men are truly worth wooing \u2014 male attention, male recognition, is the prize. The need for such validation naturally extends to his father, Timothy, a smug businessman in serious legal trouble who is Saxon\u2019s whole world. \u201cI\u2019ll always be seen by everyone as Timothy Ratliff\u2019s son, and I\u2019m okay with that, I am, as long as everything at work is going good,\u201d Saxon tells him. Women, in contrast, are the dark side, where manly fulfillment withers and dies.\n\nThe idea that women are an obstacle or a distraction is a hallmark of the so-called manosphere, which differs from the male-exclusive arenas of yore, such as the booze-soaked frat house or the smoky video-game den, in its emphasis on being physically fit and mentally sharp \u2014 on becoming your best self. (As Saxon states at one point, he doesn\u2019t take drugs, he is the drug.) The most viral video of 2025 so far involves an extremely jacked wellness influencer named Ashton Hall whose meticulous morning routine includes dipping his face in bowls of ice-cold bottled water and rubbing his cheeks with a banana peel. It is patently, purposefully absurd (the better to tweak the algorithm in its favor) yet also mesmerizing in its heavily ASMR-ed glory. There are many similar videos of chiseled men with torsos as sleek as dolphin skin attending to every facet of their appearance in barely furnished modern apartments. They are cultivating their inner lives as well, meditating in dimly lit rooms and using those beefy arms to jot down their thoughts in journals. All of this seems to be performed for consumption by other men. In a follow-up video, Hall encounters a group of male fans who are stoked to meet him in person and take selfies with him. (\u201cThat\u2019s crazy; thank you, bro!\u201d) The only woman we see is a faceless assistant who hands him his slippers and prepares eggs and bacon for him.\n\nThe absence of women is an explicit part of the pitch for the Bali Time Chamber, a White Lotus\u2013esque resort exclusively for men in a \u201chidden\u201d hilltop location where they can improve themselves and fulfill their potential. If you are a male of a certain age, it is likely that you have been served social-media ads for the resort that proclaim \u201cNo junk food, no women, no parties, and no alcohol\u201d over images of shirtless men gnawing Flinstones-size steaks, sparring with each other, dashing up steep inclines, and typing intently on their laptops. \u201cHundreds of successful businessmen, top-tier athletes, and self-development enthusiasts have already joined the community and completely changed their lives,\u201d the ad says.\n\nIt would be easy to mock these erotically charged videos as ways for straight guys to partake in the pleasures of gay camaraderie without acknowledging the sexual undercurrents \u2014 like a Troye Sivan\u2013ian utopia of male flesh except the participants are sucking bone marrow and spending an exorbitant amount of time lacing up their gym shoes. Surely that is a part of it. But there is also a sense that these are safe spaces for heterosexual men to preen and \u201coptimize\u201d and indulge without judgment from women, those harridans who make men feel bad about themselves for being men.\n\nIn a broadly sympathetic profile in The New Yorker of the bro podcasters who dominate the manosphere, young men are presented as being forced by censorious liberals and hectoring feminists into the sculpted arms of Joe Rogan and Hasan Piker. Here, they can finally be among like-minded people \u2014 \u201cthe contemporary don\u2019t-tread-on-me type who demands both the freedom to have gay friends and the freedom to use \u2018gay\u2019 as an insult,\u201d writes Andrew Marantz, as well as the resurrected epithets \u201cretarded\u201d and \u201cpussy.\u201d Or as Piker half-jokingly says, \u201cWe\u2019re just here to have fun. And also reach out to the young men out there who are lost \u2014 who feel anchorless, rudderless \u2014 by lifting some heavy weights.\u201d A producer for Piker\u2019s show, which is politically on the left, says the audience is 60 percent men, on the low side for such fare; the demographic tilt is usually 80 or 85 percent male.\n\nThe new predominantly male space is nowhere more evident than in Trump\u2019s Washington, where his administration is dismantling DEI programs that have allegedly recruited and promoted inferior women (among other historically oppressed people) at the cost of government aptitude and military lethality. The instantly infamous Signal group chat is a window into an executive branch proudly leeched of womanly influence, with the exception of an unidentified female intelligence officer, the practically silent DNI head Tulsi Gabbard, and chief of staff Susie Wiles, who cheers from the sidelines like a soccer mom as the boys bomb Yemen. Mostly, it\u2019s all men all the time, trading fist-bump and fire emoji, talking shit about those \u201cPATHETIC\u201d European freeloaders, and disagreeing with each other in a cagey \u201cmy good sir\u201d tone.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to suggest the American war machine would be any less destructive if a few more women had been included in the \u201cHouthi PC small group.\u201d Nor am I trying to censor what young men think or say \u2014 as a child of the 1990s, I can assure you that my pals and I used the P-word and the R-word and the G-word (pejorative) more times than Hasan Piker\u2019s posse ever has, and we did it way before those words accrued the rather ridiculous transgressive power they have today. But later we stopped using those words, not because we were forced to by our liberal overlords in the media and the university, or even merely because of shifting cultural norms, but because we grew up. And I would posit that a crucial component of that process was opening ourselves up to women \u2014 to their criticisms, their eye-rolling, their pity for our benighted, immature souls. It is so obvious that it shouldn\u2019t bear stating, but maybe these days it does: Self-discovery won\u2019t come from doing handstands on a barbell or masking your mouth with hostage tape before bedtime or receiving constant affirmation of your dumbest prejudices from your favorite parasocial podcasters, but from submitting your intimate self to the terrifying scrutiny of someone other \u2014 who, for straight men anyway, is more likely than not going to be a woman.\n\nThat a woman\u2019s perspective might be salutary dawns on Saxon only later in the show, when he develops a crush on a fellow guest, the bright-eyed Chelsea, who sees through him, predicting that in 30 years he will be another rich old man descending on Thailand to hunt for lissome young females. But The White Lotus suggests that this is not the true logical end point for those who live in the manosphere and abide by its diminishment of women, an ethos that brings the contemporary heterosexual man to some pretty interesting existential places. During the fateful threesome, the woman involved with the two brothers is a blur, as hazy as a long-forgotten memory. What is clear is the hand working at Saxon\u2019s crotch and the confused expression on his face \u2014 the moment when all this virtual jerking off becomes literal and the dream indistinguishable from the nightmare.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemocrats are sounding the alarm over a cluster of recent polls showing that the party\u2019s public image is more bruised and battered than at any point in decades.\n\nThose poor ratings from voters may signal long-term problems for the party if they persist through the 2028 presidential campaign. But the negative reviews probably won\u2019t have nearly as much impact on the upcoming elections in 2025 and 2026 as many analysts in both parties are anticipating.\n\nLooking across recent midterm elections, there\u2019s no evidence that such broad measures of party favorability have influenced the outcome in any consistent way. For instance, the Democrats\u2019 image in most polls was at least as favorable as (and sometimes more favorable than) the Republicans\u2019 in both 2010 and 2014 \u2014 and the GOP achieved historic landslides in those midterm elections anyway.\n\nThe best evidence shows that attitudes toward the incumbent president are now exerting far more influence on midterm election results than views about the party out of the White House. What\u2019s more, the historical record suggests the best way for the opposition party to raise its own standing is to weaken the president\u2019s position.\n\nThat means the Democrats\u2019 best chance to recover before 2026 likely depends less on their efforts to refurbish their own image than on their ability to crystallize public discontent with the actions by President Donald Trump and the Republicans who control both chambers of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic party having the lowest negative rating in 30 years has consequence, but midterm elections are about the status of the economy, direction of the country, and presidential approval,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Bill McInturff. \u201cTrump\u2019s job approval before the election will tell us a lot more about the outcome of 2026 than the rating of the Democratic party.\u201d\n\nThe White House gave a clear sign last week that it agreed when Trump forced an obviously reluctant Elise Stefanik to withdraw her nomination as UN ambassador for fear of losing either her seat or one of the vacant Republican-held Florida seats during special elections this year. Needless to say, for all the teeth-gnashing among Democrats, the White House would not have taken such an unusual step if it believed the other party\u2019s poor image rendered it unelectable in the months ahead.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 \u2018deep hole\u2019\n\nFor weeks, Democrats have been rattled by polls showing the party\u2019s public image has hit its lowest point in decades. A recent NBC poll (conducted by McInturff\u2019s firm, Public Opinion Strategies, and a Democratic partner) found just 27% of Americans viewed Democrats favorably, the lowest rating that poll has recorded for the party since 1990. The latest CNN/SRSS poll similarly found just 29% of adults holding a favorable view of the Democrats \u2014 also the lowest that survey (and earlier Gallup Polls) had found since 1992.\n\nOne reason Democrats\u2019 ratings have plummeted is that an unusually large share of the party\u2019s own voters are unhappy with it \u2014 a reflection of the widespread frustration that the party\u2019s national leadership has not formulated a more effective opposition to Trump. But the Democrats\u2019 decline also reflects brutally low ratings among independents.\n\nAttendees listen to speakers during the Michigan Democratic Party People\u2019s Town Hall in Warren Michigan, on March 29. Rebecca Cook/Reuters\n\nThese dismal readings have inevitably triggered end-is-near style warnings from many Democrats, particularly those who believe the party in recent years has tilted too far to the left. Democrats are \u201ctruly in a deep hole,\u201d Ruy Teixeira, a longtime Democratic analyst who has become an unremitting critic of the party, wrote recently. \u201cThe party\u2019s severe image, identification, governance, and geographic weaknesses cannot be remedied by mounting the (rhetorical) barricades against Trump and waiting for his administration to self-destruct.\u201d\n\nElection trends in the Trump era indeed offer Democrats plenty of reason for concern about their long-term trajectory. The party has become uncompetitive in what many strategists consider an unsustainably large number of states, and the 2024 presidential results showed substantial movement toward Trump among non-White men and younger White men, as well as some erosion among Latina women. If those geographic and demographic trends harden, Democrats will face an increasingly difficult climb to piece together majorities in the Senate or the Electoral College.\n\nBut history suggests the cries of imminent doom for Democrats significantly overstates the near-term risks the party faces from its weakened public image. In elections through this century, the public\u2019s view of the party outside of the White House has not been nearly as strong a predictor of the results in the midterms as their assessment of the performance of the president and his party.\n\nVoter choices in the midterm are \u201cmore a reaction to the party in the White House,\u201d said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. \u201cHow people feel about the out-party is probably not that important because if they are not happy with what is going on they are going to blame it on the president\u2019s party and the president, and they are going to vote against them. That\u2019s why the president\u2019s party almost always loses seats.\u201d Indeed, as I\u2019ve written, no president has defended unified control of the White House and Congress through a midterm election since 1978 \u2014 the longest such stretch in US history.\n\nAt times, the public\u2019s general attitudes toward the two parties have seemed to presage the midterm results. The clearest example was in 2006, when substantially more Americans in Gallup polling expressed a favorable view of the Democratic Party (52%) than the GOP (37%) \u2014 a result that foreshadowed big Democratic gains in both chambers on Election Day.\n\nThe relationship wasn\u2019t quite as direct, but in 2022, the fact that voters were also mostly negative on Republicans (especially after the Supreme Court decision rescinding the constitutional right to abortion) helped Democrats to contain their losses in House elections and gain ground in the Senate, despite the pervasive discontent with President Joe Biden\u2019s job performance.\n\nThe president\u2019s image matters more\n\nBut more often in midterm elections, the relative favorability of the two parties has not been a reliable indicator of the outcome.\n\nIn 2018, for instance, Republicans were viewed favorably by almost exactly as many voters as Democrats in polling by Gallup and NBC that fall, and by only slightly fewer voters than Democrats in CNN\u2019s survey closest to election day. Yet the GOP lost 41 House seats in the election.\n\nIn 2014, the Democrats\u2019 public image was considerably more positive than the Republicans\u2019 in polling that fall from Gallup and what was then the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. But in the election, Democrats lost 13 seats in the House and a crushing nine in the Senate.\n\nThe most dramatic divergence came in 2010. The Gallup and CNN polls that fall showed that the share of voters viewing each party favorably and unfavorably was almost identical; the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll actually put Democrats in a slightly stronger position. Yet on Election Day, Republicans gained six seats in the Senate and 63 in the House \u2014 the biggest mid-term gain for either party since 1938.\n\nThe common thread in these consecutive midterm routs was widespread discontent with the president. In Gallup polling, the approval rating for President Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014, and for Trump in 2018, all stood at just 42% to 45%, with most Americans disapproving of their performance.\n\nTo many analysts, those judgments about the incumbent president have become the crucial factor in shaping midterm elections. In exit polls, 85% to 90% of voters who disapprove of the president\u2019s performance now routinely vote against his party\u2019s candidates in House elections, with a comparable share of voters who approve backing his party.\n\nMany strategists believe there\u2019s little reason to expect that will change much in 2026, especially with Trump pursuing such a polarizing conservative agenda. \u201cWe are heading into a midterm where Republicans are very much the incumbent party, and if people aren\u2019t happy with what they are doing, and how the country is doing, I think that will matter more than almost anything else,\u201d said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with McInturff\u2019s.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 path back\n\nIf anything, recent elections strongly suggest that the fastest way for Democrats to rebuild their image is to coalesce public concern about Trump. At other recent points when either party has faced broad public disapproval, it has tended to recover less because of any dramatic changes it made than because voters soured on the other side. In the normal hydraulics of a two-party system, when one party falls, the other tends to rise.\n\nRepublicans, for instance, enjoyed a significant advantage in Gallup over Democrats in party image immediately after President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection in 2004. But amid discontent over the Iraq War and Bush\u2019s attempt to restructure Social Security, Democrats moved to their substantial lead by the fall of 2006.\n\nDemocrats likewise held a big lead in favorability immediately after Obama\u2019s victory in 2008. But amid frustration over the slow recovery from the financial crash of 2008, the bitter controversy over passage of the Affordable Care Act, and a steady decline in Obama\u2019s approval numbers, the parties moved to parity in Gallup polling by fall 2010 (though also with more Americans negative than positive on each). Republicans likewise faced a big deficit after Trump left office in 2021, but moved slightly ahead in favorability by 2022 amid the discontent with Biden (albeit with substantially more voters again negative than positive about each side).\n\nIn each case, the primary means that the party out of power used to redefine itself was opposition to the president\u2019s agenda. In 2010, Mitch McConnell, then the GOP Senate leader, famously said that the party\u2019s highest goal was to make Obama a one-term president.\n\nKen Spain, who served as communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2010, said discontent with Obama opened the door for voters to reconsider Republicans. \u201cRepublican favorability had cratered in 2008\u201d as Bush\u2019s second term ended, Spain said. But \u201cin the eyes of voters, Democrats took their eye off the ball \u2014 the economy. Within two years, Republican favorability had continued to inch upward, and by the time of the 2010 midterms, the party was once again viewed as a viable alternative.\u201d\n\nDan Sena, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during 2018, described virtually the same dynamic during Trump\u2019s first term. In the DCCC\u2019s private polling, \u201cGoing into January of \u201917, on every major issue you could think of we were losing to Trump,\u201d Sena said. \u201cThen by August, we had turned them all around.\u201d\n\nDemocrats improved their standing, he argued, initially by pushing back against Trump initiatives that proved unpopular with voters, particularly the tax cuts tilted to the affluent, and the GOP\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to repeal the ACA. \u201cIt is important to remember there\u2019s an arc to this, and it takes about six months historically for the resistance to take hold,\u201d Sena said.\n\nA weak public image is hardly without cost for Democrats. Party strategists worry that the low numbers among their own partisans could affect fundraising and the availability of volunteers. Discontent with Democrats likely would not prevent the party from gaining House seats in 2026 if most voters are negative on Trump, but it might reduce those gains, as the GOP\u2019s negative image did in 2022. And if these dismal assessments of the Democrats persist, they would likely represent a greater threat in the 2028 presidential race: The party viewed more favorably in Gallup polling has won every presidential race since 1996, except in 2016.\n\nBut, as Abramowitz noted, the party images in 2028 likely will be shaped less by today\u2019s sparring than by the public\u2019s reaction to their eventual presidential nominees (which may be why party favorability appears to better predict presidential election than midterm results). In the meantime, he believes there\u2019s little chance even Democratic voters frustrated with their leaders will sit out 2026 given their disgust at Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cDemocrats might not be happy with their party, but they still despise Trump,\u201d Abramowitz said.\n\nFighting more forcefully against Trump won\u2019t resolve all the Democrats\u2019 problems with voters. But fanning more doubts about the president may be the party\u2019s indispensable first step toward its own recovery."

            "full_content": "Judge James Boasberg at the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C., in 2023. Photo: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe Saturday that Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., was assigned the case challenging Donald Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, he was not dressed for the occasion. The case had been filed alongside an urgent motion to prevent the deportation of five people their lawyers feared would soon be disappeared to El Salvador. At an emergency hearing conducted on Zoom that evening, convened to figure out whether judicial intervention was needed to prevent any wrongful deportations, Boasberg had to apologize to everyone present. \u201cI went away for the weekend and brought with me neither a robe nor tie nor appropriate shirt, so thank you all for being appropriately attired and hope you will forgive my casual ones,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the end of the hearing, which was adjourned for about an hour so the government could figure out if any planes carrying migrants had departed, Boasberg made up his mind. \u201cI am prepared to rule,\u201d he said, before proceeding to issue a pair of orders preventing anyone covered by the proclamation from being deported. It was followed by this directive: \u201cAny plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.\u201d He left the details up to the government. \u201cHowever that\u2019s accomplished, whether turning around a plane or not embarking anyone on the plane or those people covered by this on the plane, I leave to you. But this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration didn\u2019t comply. And in the weeks since, Boasberg and the Justice Department have been in a standoff, with the judge demanding an explanation for why his orders weren\u2019t followed, and the government claiming that once the planes were in the air, there was nothing to be done. \u201cNo court has the power to compel the President to return them, and there is no sound basis to read the Court\u2019s minute order as requiring that unprecedented step,\u201d the department wrote last week. On Thursday, Boasberg will hold yet another hearing to get to the bottom of things and potentially determine if holding the government in contempt is warranted.\n\nHow Boasberg rules there, and how the administration responds, will be the first true test of whether the constitutional order that Trump has spent every day of his second term attacking will hold. At a moment when people the nation over are being abducted off the streets or receiving notice that their days here are numbered, without a semblance of even an opportunity to be heard, how Boasberg holds the government to our most basic shared commitments may yet set the tone for the next four years.\n\nTrump has called the judge a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d and an \u201cagitator,\u201d to name but a few descriptors the president has used in one of his many Truth Social posts complaining about judges who don\u2019t rule as he would like. Boasberg, who has kept a steady hand over every proceeding and ruling since, appears up for the challenge of judging the administration, applying the same rigor to the case that those who have watched him up close have seen in his more than 20 years as a judge.\n\nTo wit, in a recent ruling he threaded something of a legal needle. Rather than deciding whether courts have the authority to second-guess a president\u2019s invocation of a wartime statute that \u201clay dormant for 75 years\u201d following World War II, Boasberg \u2014 in a studious 37-page opinion that was rich with facts, law, history, and the judge\u2019s own reservations about \u201ca host of complicated legal issues\u201d \u2014 boosted Trump in ways that would shock House Speaker Mike Johnson, who all but threatened to defund the court where the judge sits. He fully affirmed that the law the president invoked, the Alien Enemies Act, is constitutional. He did not question that the president has the authority to detain people subject to the law or a proclamation Trump issued earlier this month invoking it. He also noted that none of his court orders thus far, which the Justice Department has fiercely contested and are now at the Supreme Court, prevented the administration from rapidly deporting people who were, in fact, members of Tren de Aragua, the transnational Venezuelan gang Trump targeted with his proclamation. Or that the government couldn\u2019t apprehend other noncitizens who may be subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation. His own orders, Boasberg added, don\u2019t even require a single person to be released.\n\nAfter reviewing the relevant precedents, Boasberg only had one objection: \u201cIt follows that summary deportation following close on the heels of the Government\u2019s informing an alien that he is subject to the Proclamation \u2014 without giving him the opportunity to consider whether to voluntarily self-deport or challenge the basis for the order \u2014 is unlawful.\u201d That\u2019s it.\n\nBoasberg has ordered the administration to explain whether his orders have been violated. In response, the government has done everything but cooperate: It has invoked the state-secrets privilege, essentially telling the judge that he\u2019s entitled to no additional information about the flights he ordered returned; has accused him of misconduct and wants him removed from the case; and has argued that a federal court has no power over how the president exercises his authority abroad. In the coming days, the Supreme Court will have a say on how Boasberg has been ruling and conducting himself in these proceedings so far. Implicit in the Court\u2019s judgment, because the issue is not directly before it, is how the weakest and least dangerous branch deals with the branch that wields executive power, controls the military, and has all the guns and the enforcement authority \u2014 and is headed by a president who appears ready to defy it.\n\nThe judges who work at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse, which is right across the Capitol, are not strangers to high-profile political disputes. Because of their proximity to power, they\u2019re accustomed to legal challenges related to presidential authority, government secrecy, the workings of federal agencies, and the relationship between the three branches of government. But over the past four years, another thing set them apart: Together, they handled more than a thousand prosecutions stemming from the January 6 insurrection \u2014 arraignments, bail hearings, trials, guilty pleas, sentencings, appeals, you name it.\n\nIn the midst of it all was Boasberg, whose perch as chief judge also gave him visibility into the grand-jury process \u2014 a highly secretive endeavor where sometimes witnesses resist subpoenas to testify and choose to litigate them. It was in this capacity that Boasberg ordered former vice-president Mike Pence to testify in the probe led by special counsel Jack Smith. \u201cThe bottom line is that conversations exhorting Pence to reject electors on January 6th are not protected,\u201d Boasberg wrote in his 2023 ruling. \u201cThere is no dispute in this case that Pence lacked the authority to reject certified electoral votes.\u201d Once Smith secured Trump\u2019s indictment, Boasberg and other judges stood watch in his own packed courtroom as the then-former president was read his charges and pleaded not guilty in front of a magistrate.\n\nA former homicide prosecutor, Boasberg received unanimous confirmation from the Senate when, in 2011, President Barack Obama elevated him from the local Washington court, where he had served for many years as an appointee of George W. Bush, to the federal district court. NBC News recently uncovered a grainy image of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Boasberg\u2019s friend and roommate at Yale Law School, when the two of them sat side-by-side during an investiture ceremony for Boasberg.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who issued an unusual statement noting that impeachment is not the appropriate course when the government disagrees with a judge\u2019s ruling, is also familiar with Boasberg\u2019s work. The chief has hired law clerks who have worked in the judge\u2019s chambers and also appointed him to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which reviews authorization requests for wiretaps and other sensitive methods of foreign-intelligence gathering. In this role, Boasberg oversaw efforts to reform the FBI\u2019s \u201csignificant errors and omissions\u201d related to former Trump adviser Carter Page.\n\nNo matter who you talk to in Washington legal circles, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anyone with anything bad to say about Boasberg, a native Washingtonian whose close associates call \u201cJeb\u201d and who, at six-foot-six, is said to cut an imposing figure. More than one person, lawyers and judges alike, have told me that they\u2019re glad that this and other Trump-related controversies have landed in his courtroom and not others\u2019. \u201cGiven his credibility across the spectrum,\u201d says one lawyer who practices regularly in the district and appeals courts in Washington, \u201che\u2019s better equipped to withstand these attacks than many would be.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge Boasberg is one of the finest judges in the United States, period,\u201d says retired circuit judge David Tatel, who served for nearly 30 years in the appeals court in Washington. \u201cI reviewed his work for years. Some of his decisions might be called conservative. Some of them might be called liberal. But they\u2019re all faithful applications of law to the facts before him.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some of his actions in recent years can be characterized as favorable to Trumpworld. To name but a few examples, Boasberg hasn\u2019t gone as harshly as other judges on people convicted over the Capitol riot, he took a hard stance against FBI lawyers involved in the Page affair, and he once rejected a lawsuit to force the IRS to make public Trump\u2019s tax records.\n\nBy happenstance, Boasberg was again thrust into the spotlight last week for drawing a case challenging the lawfulness of Signalgate \u2014 more specifically, to force the Trump administration to preserve every Signal message sent on the app while The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg was an unwitting witness to it all. The judge quickly ordered those messages preserved while the litigation plays out. Once again, Trump is none too pleased. \u201cHow disgraceful is it that \u2018Judge\u2019 James Boasberg has just been given a fourth \u2018Trump Case,\u2019 something which is, statistically, IMPOSSIBLE,\u201d the president wrote. As is with every case filed in the federal court in Washington, the case was assigned randomly.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a Georgetown law professor who has been keeping close track of a number of Trump-related controversies now pending before the Supreme Court, told me that the Venezuelan deportations case Boasberg is overseeing is a touchstone for the rule of law itself. \u201cThe Alien Enemy Act case is a flashpoint not only because the legal issues it presents so fundamentally implicate the rule of law in the most elementary sense, but because the Justice Department\u2019s behavior also poses a direct challenge to the ability of even the most principled, well-regarded federal judges to obtain compliance with their mandates,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how any other case could so centrally implicate where we are at this moment \u2014 and where we\u2019re going.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The intelligence community is the eyes and ears of the White House. Presidents only know what it tells them. The most up-to-date intelligence tells President Donald Trump that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Yet Trump continues to threaten war unless Iran agrees to give up the nuclear weapons program that Washington knows Tehran does not have.\n\nIn March, the new Trump administration received its first Annual Threat Assessment, which compiles insights from the intelligence community. Looking at Iran\u2019s domestic politics, the report says that, \u201cin the past year, there has been an erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public that has emboldened nuclear weapons advocates within Iran\u2019s decisionmaking apparatus.\u201d If true, this development is hardly surprising, given Iran\u2019s increasing vulnerability. The report notes \u201cthe degradation to [Iran\u2019s] proxies and air defenses during the Gaza conflict\u201d and the ouster of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who had been an Iranian ally.\n\nNonetheless, the report says that the intelligence community \u201ccontinue[s] to assess Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and that [Ayatollah] Khamenei has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.\u201d\n\nThe findings of the Annual Threat Assessment haven\u2019t had a moderating influence on Trump\u2019s rhetoric, which if anything has become only more bellicose. \u201cIf they don\u2019t make a deal, there will be bombing,\u201d he told NBC News Saturday evening. On March 7, a couple weeks before the Assessment was published, the president had told FOX Business, \u201cThere are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran.\u201d That same day, Trump told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re down to final strokes with Iran\u2026. Final moments. Can\u2019t let them have a nuclear weapon\u2026. Hopefully we can have a peace deal\u2026. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019d rather see a peace deal than the other, but the other will solve the problem.\"\n\nIn the FOX Business interview, Trump revealed that he had sent a letter to Khamenei warning that the alternative to diplomacy was war. Barak Ravid of Axios reported that the letter included a two-month deadline for striking a nuclear deal. \u201c[I]f Iran rejects Trump\u2019s outreach and doesn\u2019t negotiate, the chances of U.S. or Israeli military action against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities would dramatically increase,\u201d Ravid wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s threats are disproportionate to, and inconsistent with, the latest U.S. intelligence. And the Annual Threat Assessment is not the first report that has informed Washington that Iran likely isn\u2019t pursuing a nuclear weapon.\n\nA series of reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran was completely and consistently in compliance with its commitments under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)\u2014the Iran nuclear deal\u2014up until the time that Trump pulled out of it in May 2018.\n\nThe 2022 U.S. Department of Defense Nuclear Posture Review concluded that \u201cIran does not today possess a nuclear weapon and we currently believe it is not pursuing one.\u201d In 2023, then-CIA Director William Burns said that \u201c[t]o the best of our knowledge, we don\u2019t believe that the supreme leader in Iran has yet made a decision to resume the weaponization program.\u201d A year later, Burns said, \u201cNo, we do not see evidence today that the supreme leader has reversed the decision that he took at the end of 2003 to suspend the weaponization program\u2026 We don\u2019t see evidence today that such a decision [to build a bomb] has been made. We watch it very carefully.\u201d As recently as this February, even Trump said that, \u201cThere are many people at the top ranks of Iran that do not want to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nIran has resisted U.S. coercion to negotiate. In February, Khamenei pointed to America\u2019s not honoring the JCPOA and said, \u201cOne must not negotiate with a government like the US government. Negotiations with it is not wise, it is not intelligent, and is not honorable.\u201d The next month, Khamenei explained further, in a post on X, why Iran isn\u2019t willing to negotiate. \u201cThis same US president tore up the signed JCPOA agreement. How could we hold negotiations with US when we know they don\u2019t fulfill their commitments?\u201d\n\nPrior to Trump\u2019s threats, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had advocated for direct negotiations with the United States, and Khamenei had supported him. Now Pezeshkian insists that Iran \u201cwill not yield to foreign pressure.\u201d Earlier this month, Pezeshkian responded to U.S. threats by saying, \u201cthe language of threats and coercion is absolutely unacceptable\u2026 It is unacceptable for someone to come along and say, \u2018Don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that, or else.\u2019 I won\u2019t come to negotiate with you. Go do whatever the hell you want.\u201d\n\nStill, Iran has said that, though direct negotiations with the U.S. are impossible until \u201cthere is a change in the other side\u2019s approach towards\u201d Tehran, the \u201cway is open for indirect negotiations.\u201d Last week on Thursday, after Tehran sent its response to Trump\u2019s letter, Iran\u2019s foreign minister reiterated that, \"Our policy is still to not engage in direct negotiations while under maximum pressure and military threats, however, as it was the case in the past, indirect negotiations can continue.\u201d\n\nTrump, rather than lowering the rhetorical pressure, responded on Friday with one of his most ominous threats yet. While reiterating that his \u201cbig preference is that we work it out with Iran,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office that \u201cif we don\u2019t work it out, bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran.\u201d The next day, in the NBC News interview, he elaborated on what the \u201cvery bad things\u201d would be, threatening Iran with \u201cbombing the likes of which they have never seen before.\u201d\n\nThe open way to indirect negotiations may have recently become much rockier, and not just because of the president\u2019s harsh rhetoric. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz seemed to say that Iran would have to give up not only the nuclear weapons program that they don\u2019t have but the civilian nuclear program that they do. Waltz said that the U.S. is demanding \u201cfull dismantlement.\u201d Iran, Waltz said, \u201chas to give up its program\u201d and stop \u201cenrichment,\u201d seemingly meaning that Tehran must cease enriching uranium even for civilian purposes. \u201cThe full program,\u201d he said, \u201cgive it up or there will be consequences.\u201d Waltz added that Iran would also have to give up its \u201cstrategic missile program.\u201d\n\nIran is unlikely to negotiate the elimination of its missile program. Especially now, with the degradation of its front-line proxy defense, the missile program is a crucial part of Iran\u2019s defense strategy.\n\nThey are also unlikely to negotiate the elimination of their civilian nuclear program. Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which declares that \u201cNothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear how threatening Iran with war benefits the U.S. or the world. Iran was in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal that Trump tore up and even today signals some openness to reviving diplomacy. Tehran maintains that it has \u201cnever abandoned the negotiating table\u201d and is willing to discuss alleged military aspects of its civilian nuclear energy program. That should be enough, since, according to U.S. intelligence, Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapons program, and according to the NPT, it has the right to civilian nuclear energy.\n\nTrump campaigned against Forever Wars. In his inaugural address, he said his legacy would \u201cbe that of a peacemaker\u201d and that his success would be measured \u201cby the wars that we end \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, the wars we never get into.\u201d According to the Annual Threat Assessment, Iran presents no pressing need to break that promise mere months into Trump\u2019s second administration. The president says he wants to sign a deal with Iran, but so far, his extreme threats seem to be making that diplomatic goal more difficult to achieve."

            "full_content": "Fat And Unhappy: How \u201cBody Positivity\u201d Is Killing Us (and How to Save Yourself), by Tristan Justice and Gina Bontempo, Bombardier Books\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a book that will make you want to wait outside of Coca-Cola\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta with a few liters of soda to dump on an unexpecting executive\u2019s head, go no further: Fat And Unhappy: How \u201cBody Positivity\u201d Is Killing Us (and How to Save Yourself) is that book.\n\nTristan Justice, a reporter for the Federalist, draws on his work writing about the intersection of health, politics, and pop culture, and Gina Bontempo, a writer and mother, draws on her experience as a health and wellness coach to explain why it is so difficult to maintain a healthy weight in America. Together, they share an eye-opening account of how our government, corporations, and scientists colluded to declare what is healthy, unhealthy, and vice versa. But rather than tell readers to just give up and join the so-called body positivity movement, the authors lay out a path to health and healing that can be followed by anyone.\n\n\u201cOur industrialized food supply is killing us,\u201d they write, pointing out that more than 40 percent of the U.S. population is obese. Every person is responsible for his or her own choices, but in a system that sets individuals up for unhealthy lifestyles from childhood, there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around.\n\nSelf-proclaimed traditionalists catch a lot of flak for idealizing a return to the 1950s; Fat And Unhappy also throws cold water on the idea. The decade \u201csaw the invention of high-fructose corn syrup, vitamin-deficient powdered orange juice known as \u2018Tang,\u2019 and the near-religious takeover of the low-fat diet craze backed by public health authorities based on discredited science,\u201d Justice and Bontempo write. Our collective health has been on the decline ever since, not just because we\u2019re undernourished and overfed, but because we\u2019re a nation that moves, sleeps, and absorbs sunlight less than ever before.\n\nIn Justice and Bontempo\u2019s view, this isn\u2019t just a byproduct of industrialization. It\u2019s the result of what might be called a corporate conspiracy. Procter & Gamble, the Sugar Association, the list goes on\u2014these interests had products to push, and they used not only misleading advertisements but misleading science to push them. Some of the scientists most closely associated with this era of nutrition guidelines have mixed legacies today. Ancel Keys, who vilified fat but downplayed the negative effects of sugar, was one of the top nutrition experts as the U.S. moved toward industrialized food. (He even appeared on the cover of TIME in 1961.) \u201cResearchers who crossed Keys had their reputations attacked and their funding stripped,\u201d the authors write, comparing Keys to former NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and the results of his research to the damaging coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nKeys died in 2004, but the corporations that supported his research are still raking in cash and have \u201clargely escaped accountability for their role in shaping misguided nutritional guidelines,\u201d the authors write. Even today, prediabetics are told to cook with highly processed vegetable oil rather than with unrefined coconut oil, which naturally contains medium-chain triglycerides that can promote fat loss. Of course, losing weight is not just about looking better. Maintaining a healthy weight can save an individual from a lifetime of chronic illness and medical bills. Big Food and Big Pharma work together to create lifelong customers\u2014and they take seriously any threat to their order, including the possibility of a rogue Health and Human Services secretary like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. At his Senate confirmation hearing in late January, Kennedy uttered a line that sounded like it could have been pulled from this book: \u201cA healthy person has 1,000 dreams. A sick person has only one.\u201d\n\nJustice and Bontempo discuss politics very little, but the unspoken context of their book is the growing politicization of fitness. \u201cGetting fit is great\u2014but it could turn you into a rightwing jerk,\u201d read the title of a June piece published by a Guardian columnist. Kennedy\u2019s endorsement of President Donald Trump brought an entire army of crunchy moms over to the Republican side\u2014no small thing, if a recent report from the New York Times is to be believed. The health of future generations seems like something the left and the right can come together to support, but the food industry and pharmaceutical industry seem to find ways to coopt this vision nearly every time.\n\nJustice and Bontempo are far from the first authors to point out what\u2019s wrong with nutrition in America. They cite research from Nina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet; Robert H. Lustig, author of Metabolical: The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine; and Gary Taubes, author of Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It. Where they start to tread new ground is their reporting on \u201ctoxic\u201d body positivity, defining it as a movement that \u201cseeks to eliminate the emotional toll of obesity by demanding the rest of the country normalize and even glorify excess weight.\u201d Justice was even denied a press pass to attend Philly FatCon, a 2023 gathering of pro-fat activists including Joy Cox, author of Fat Girls in Black Bodies, and Sonalee Rashatwar, known online as \u201cThe Fat Sex Therapist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point of the conference was the promotion of far-left activism on social justice, and the organizers placed obesity at the center of it\u2026. None of the conference speakers on the all-women lineup built their profiles by raising the red flag on obesity. They all made money on raising the white one,\u201d Justice and Bontempo write.\n\nSo who\u2019s funding the body positivity movement? All it takes is a little digging to realize that when skincare brand Dove launches a \u201cCampaign for Size Freedom,\u201d it\u2019s actually acting in the interest of parent company Unilever, one of the top ice cream manufacturers in the United States. Companies like Dove act in tandem with fat-positive activists like Virgie Tovar to get the stamp of approval from this new social justice spinoff. Unfortunately, average Americans using social media unknowingly encounter this propaganda. They\u2019re bombarded with videos from dietitians funded by the food industry who recommend soda and packaged snacks but never restricting unhealthy foods. In fact, some of the influencers who dole out health \u201cadvice\u201d online refuse to even classify foods as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d because \u201cdiet culture, fatphobia, and systems of oppression have created false hierarchies of food\u201d (yes, this is a direct quote from a so-called nutritionist cited by Justice and Bontempo).\n\nYou can\u2019t discuss America\u2019s obesity problem without the mention of another \u201co\u201d word: Ozempic. Ozempic, Wegovy, semaglutide\u2014the injection goes by many names, and an estimated one in eight Americans have tried some form of the prescription drug, according to a May KFF Health Tracking poll. Opposition to Ozempic is creating some strange bedfellows. Fat-positive influencers proclaim that such drugs only feed into fatphobia. Junk food manufacturers worry they\u2019ll lose customers as Ozempic causes more Americans to lose their appetites. Opponents of Big Pharma point out that weight-loss injections can come with nasty side effects. Justice and Bontempo make it clear what side they come out on: \u201c[I]f there were ever a drug perfectly engineered to capitalize on obesity without actually solving the problem, it would be Ozempic\u2026. Most [patients] find they gain even more weight back once they\u2019re off the Ozempic regimen.\u201d\n\nFortunately, Justice and Bontempo don\u2019t leave readers without hope. In a rapid-fire series of chapters, they extol the virtues of nutrition, exercise, sleep, community, and even prayer for a healthy life. They embrace the \u201c90/10\u201d diet rule, which allows for flexibility and enjoyment. They stress that anyone can take control of his or her health at any point \u2013 but sadly, some damage cannot be undone.\n\n\u201cPeople who were once obese have a higher propensity for weight gain, and a study published in June 2023 shows obesity even causes permanent damage to brain metabolism. Children who are obese can expect to live five years fewer than their parents,\u201d Justice and Bontempo write. But there is hope for the next generation. If there is a main takeaway from Fat And Unhappy, it\u2019s that creating healthy patterns is far from impossible. Parents who want the best for their kids don\u2019t have to get PhDs in nutrition or run ultramarathons\u2014they can simply cook a meal for the family and enjoy it together.\n\nLike many worthwhile things in life, good parenting requires intentionality, whether that means resisting Big Tech by refusing to buy your child a smartphone or resisting Big Food by opting for fruits and veggies instead of prepackaged junk. Giving your children the gift of health just might be the greatest gift of all."
