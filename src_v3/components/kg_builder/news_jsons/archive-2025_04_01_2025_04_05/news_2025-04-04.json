            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping new tariffs are facing blowback from all corners \u2013 a market sell-off, foreign retaliation, anger from corporate America and skepticism from the Federal Reserve chairman and some allies in Congress. So far, the president is defiant in the face of the global turbulence.\n\nAfter a day and a half of mixed messages from Trump and top administration officials over whether the tariffs were the start of a negotiation or a more permanent change to US economic policy, Trump didn\u2019t use Friday to deliver clarity. He didn\u2019t venture out into the country to sell his plan from the floor of an American factory or to showcase a business or community that he believes will benefit from the tariffs.\n\nInstead, the president chose to begin his day on the golf course in Florida.\n\nThe financial markets were already falling by the time he left his Mar-a-Lago resort for a short ride to the Trump International Golf Club. He waved to onlookers as his presidential limousine rolled through the gates.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback JPMorgan executive says inflation and recession likely from tariffs 02:25 - Source: CNN JPMorgan executive says inflation and recession likely from tariffs 02:25\n\nWhile the president has traveled to Florida nearly every weekend since taking office, he chose to leave the White House a day earlier than normal, creating a split-screen of being on a golf course in one of the wealthiest enclaves in America as economic worries deepened.\n\nUS stocks plunged a second straight day after China said Friday it would impose 34% reciprocal tariffs on imports of US goods, a development that put a spotlight on just how much is outside of Trump\u2019s control as his economic team tries to pull off an unprecedented high-wire act after launching the most expansive and disruptive tariffs in more than a century. The Dow closed in correction, down more than 10% from its record high in December.\n\nA White House official said the president\u2019s \u201cfull attention\u201d was on the tariff policy Friday, noting he continued to send updates about conversations he had with foreign leaders. The official dismissed the suggestion that Trump was rattled by the market reaction, saying the president has long warned of short-term pain created by his tariff vision and America First agenda.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump said countries were already coming to him looking to make deals, suggesting he was open to negotiating with foreign leaders before the tariff deadline arrived Friday at midnight. But his message Friday morning sounded different.\n\n\u201cTo the many investors coming into the United States and investing massive amounts of money, my policies will never change,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media message posted shortly before he arrived at the golf course. \u201cThis is a great time to get rich, richer than ever before!!!\u201d\n\nMixed messages and market chaos\n\nThe fluid nature of Trump\u2019s own view of the purpose tied to his new tariffs threatened to upend an explicit effort by his top economic officials to deliver a unified message that the reciprocal tariffs would be implemented on April 9, period \u2013 despite the fact that Trump\u2019s own advisers were divided before the announcement over how far to go.\n\nBehind the scenes, it reflected the necessity of delivering certainty to a market consumed by anything but for nearly two weeks. The need for unity was stressed to allies and surrogates in talking points circulated on Capitol Hill on Thursday. But message discipline \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 didn\u2019t address the other looming threat made acutely real on Friday: retaliation.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear Rubio\u2019s response to 'crashing' markets after tariff news 01:26 - Source: CNN Hear Rubio\u2019s response to 'crashing' markets after tariff news 01:26\n\nWhile the president sent several messages throughout the day, an adviser said Trump was intentionally not speaking publicly or taking questions on camera as the trading markets remained opened on Friday. Even though the White House has kept up a strident defense of the tariff strategy, a rising sense of frustration and anger at the universal global reaction was troubling.\n\n\u201cThe president isn\u2019t guided by the market, but of course he watches it like everyone else,\u201d a Republican political adviser to Trump told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid discussing West Wing deliberations.\n\nOne person who spoke to Trump amid the market sell-off on Thursday described the president as largely sanguine about his plan, suggesting the tariffs were only one aspect of a broader economic policy that was still coming into shape. But another person who is in touch with the president said he is getting close to his threshold for withstanding drops in the market.\n\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on April 4, 2025. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMany outside allies of the president have been confused at the messaging surrounding the tariffs, which veered from calling them \u201creciprocal\u201d to pledging they would be \u201cgenerous\u201d to the eventual plan, which was a different calculation altogether.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t help they tariffed islands with no people and no exports,\u201d one ally to the president said.\n\nA central question was how much Trump was open to negotiating and how aware he was of the deep criticism. The White House fielded calls from business owners and industry lobbyists, but it was unclear how aware Trump was of the blowback and whether that would shape his posture in the days leading up to next week\u2019s second tariff deadline.\n\nA 10% tariff on all US imports will go into effect on Saturday, with even higher tariffs slated for April 9.\n\nTrump criticized Beijing for retaliating against his tariffs, claiming that China \u201cpanicked\u201d after Trump unveiled an additional 34% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the US, on top of a 20% tariff previously imposed with the goal of curbing fentanyl from China to the US.\n\nThe Trump administration has encouraged countries ensnared in the tariffs not to panic \u2013 but to pick up the phone. Trump has criticized those \u2013 like Canada and China \u2013 that have pledged to retaliate.\n\n\u201cChina played it wrong, they panicked - the one thing they cannot afford to do!\u201d Trump posted on truth social after Beijing unveiled 34% retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to the added tariff on Chinese imports that brings total charges to 54%.\n\nDespite adamance by senior trade hand Peter Navarro and Vice President JD Vance that the new tariffs represent a permanent reset in global trade, others in Trump\u2019s orbit have acknowledged the president\u2019s natural inclination to strike deals.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be the last country to try to negotiate with @realdonaldtrump,\u201d his son Eric posted on X. \u201cThe first to negotiate will win \u2013 the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life.\u201d\n\nSome countries are trying to get to the front of that line. Trump is actively negotiating with Vietnam, India, and Israel to negotiate bespoke trade deals ahead of the new tariff deadline, a senior advisor told CNN. Such discussions could provide an off-ramp for Trump \u2013 if the two sides reach agreement.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump said the general secretary of Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party, T\u00f4 L\u00e2m, reached out with a proposal to \u201ccut their tariffs down to zero\u201d if a mutual agreement can be struck.\n\nFlak from Powell, corporate America\n\nThe president on Friday also took the unusual step of trying to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, continuing a long-running critique of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\n\u201cHe is always \u2018late,\u2019 but he could now change his image, and quickly,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cCut interest rates, Jerome, and stop playing politics.\u201d\n\nPowell spoke at an event in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, where he said the central bank was taken aback by the scope of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWhile tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing Annual Conference in Arlington, Virginia, on April 4. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nCorporate America, meanwhile, is irate, according to conversations with a dozen chief executive officers.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been fielding angry calls from executives, some of whom are weighing whether to sue the administration over the tariffs \u2013 and the national emergency Trump has asserted justifies them. A stronger-than-expected jobs report on Friday, one executive told CNN, should be seen by a judge if there is litigation as further proof no such national emergency exists.\n\nCompanies have been reticent to attack the administration\u2019s policies in court or on the airwaves for fear of rhetorical attacks \u2013 or worse. When one company suggested privately to Trump officials that their proposed tariffs would simply raise prices on goods with no effect on their factory locations, the official suggested they would double the tariff to get the company to move.\n\nBessent is among the many Trump officials who had been advocating for a more nuanced approach to tariffs than what Trump unveiled, a policy that was immediately met with skepticism for how it was engineered.\n\nAfter the rollout \u2013 and a round of interview with major television networks \u2013 the newly minted Treasury secretary found himself in awkward company as he joined a reunion dinner at Caf\u00e9 Milano with most former Treasury secretaries \u2013 a bipartisan tradition going back decades. \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d according to sources, quickly became the subject of conversation, though the scheduling was unintentional.\n\nA second CEO close to the White House says the breadth and extremity of the president\u2019s tariff policy was shocking, especially considering how many companies have already adjusted their businesses to align with Trump\u2019s perceived policy goals.\n\n\u201cIt was his first administration that caused [manufacturers] to move from China to Vietnam,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re punishing them, too. There\u2019s no endgame.\u201d\n\nTrump trained his anger on China during his first term, leading many manufacturers like Nike, Gap, Levi\u2019s, and Dell to begin shifting operations to Vietnam, in order to save costs and set up shop in friendlier territories. But now Trump is hitting Vietnam with a 46% tariff, leaving many executives exasperated \u2013 and planning to raise prices rather than relocate yet again.\n\nIn the words of another executive: \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to make fewer shirts and sell them for more money.\u201d\n\nDespite objections from many within his Cabinet over unnecessarily angering allies and ratting global markets, Trump\u2019s views on tariffs are ossified \u2013 and amplified by his close counselor Navarro. Feedback from dissenters has fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s the president\u2019s view and it\u2019s not widely shared,\u201d said the executive close to the White House of Trump\u2019s commitment to lowering trade deficits. \u201cOn this issue, he seems immovable.\u201d\n\nOn Wall Street, group chats on messaging apps have lit up over how or whether to publicly speak out against a president who has shown a penchant for retribution. Other private sector executives are debating whether to hire a Trump-friendly lobbyist to try to seek an exemption from the policy.\n\nA desire to refocus on tax cuts\n\nAfter weeks of internal debate over the reciprocal tariffs \u2013 and frequent mention by the president of his love for the tool \u2013 many of his allies have grown weary of discussing them and feel it\u2019s time to turn attention to his tax plans.\n\nIn part, that is because they believe the tax cuts \u2013 particularly eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, both promises he made as a candidate \u2013 are easier to understand and more of a political winner than the tariffs, which are complicated and run the risk of raising prices.\n\nThat tax plan is still a work in progress on Capitol Hill, where narrow majorities and divergent policy views have already bubbled up during negotiations over the procedural mechanism that will be used to move it through the House and Senate on a partisan basis.\n\nBut the effort needed from Trump\u2019s economic team to both put in place historic tariffs and get a tax bill over the finish line also spilled into the internal scramble leading up to Trump\u2019s announcement as advisers grappled with whether to use some kind of universal baseline tariff or setting a country-by-country number that captured a measurement trade economists in both parties panned as nonsensical.\n\nOn Monday, Trump asked for the list that would form the basis of the Rose Garden chart he would hold up. Throughout, two of Trump\u2019s top advisors shuffled up and down Pennsylvania Avenue to negotiate with congressional Republicans over the pathways to their critical tax proposal.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who had successfully made the case for reciprocal tariffs to Trump for months, and Bessent, were also running point on the tax efforts. They provided little intel on tariffs to desperate Republicans on the Hill during their visits.\n\nBut in their absence, two of Trump\u2019s most strident tariff supporters \u2013 Navarro and Lutnick \u2013 helped shape where Trump would ultimately land.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Alayna Treene contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Happy Friday, newsletter readers! President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs (and the market reaction) are the story of the week, but a key step toward more of his domestic policy agenda is underway right now in the Senate \u2014 and our Congress team breaks down how it\u2019s spotlighting some divides in the GOP\u2019s narrow majorities. And ahead of this weekend\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Kristen Welker goes through the three key questions Trump and his administration face on the tariffs. Plus, we answer a reader question about Elon Musk\u2019s role in government.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Scott Bland\n\nGOP concerns about tax cut strategy and Medicaid loom over Senate budget\n\nBy Julie Tsirkin, Syedah Asghar, Sahil Kapur, and Frank Thorp V\n\nAs President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs grab headlines, Senate Republicans are moving through the procedural steps to set up Trump\u2019s tax plans and other major domestic spending priorities. But it\u2019s not going to be easy for them to agree on exactly what to do.\n\nSenate Republicans managed Thursday to advance their massive budget plan to debate, but not before an unexpected delay caused by some of their own who have concerns about their strategy on tax cuts and potential cuts to Medicaid.\n\nPrior to debate commencing on the measure Friday, the delay occurred as those Republicans met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to talk through their concerns.\n\nSome more centrist senators are worried about a budget change the party is using to slap a zero-dollar price tag on extending Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which are estimated by the official scorekeeper in Congress to cost $4.6 trillion over a decade.\n\nRepublicans are delaying a reckoning over the issue after they bypassed the Senate parliamentarian on the question of whether they can use a \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline to treat extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire this year, as costing nothing. But that means the move could be challenged later, and it could potentially blow up the bill if the parliamentarian rules against it \u2014 unless the Senate votes to overrule her, which some have likened to nuking the 60-vote filibuster rule.\n\nA handful of Republicans have concerns that they will be asked to do that later in the process.\n\nAnother senator, Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he has \u201ca big concern\u201d about the bill slashing Medicaid \u2014 and took his concerns directly to Trump in a phone call Thursday evening before the vote.\n\nTwenty-one percent \u201cof my state receives Medicaid \u2014 CHIP or Medicaid. So, I\u2019ve made clear I\u2019m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts. And I thought the president\u2019s assurance to me tonight was completely unequivocal,\u201d Hawley added, saying that assurance made him comfortable voting to begin the process.\n\nThat\u2019s easier said than done. The House-approved budget, which Trump endorsed, makes it mathematically impossible for Republicans to achieve their targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. Lawmakers say they want to cut waste and fraud, along with imposing a potential work requirement for Medicaid. Beyond that, they haven\u2019t identified ways to reduce spending.\n\nThree questions about Trump\u2019s tariffs\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping new tariffs have rattled the markets and raised new concerns about potential price hikes. While Trump campaigned on implementing tariffs, more questions remain as they take effect.\n\nFirst, how will the Trump administration explain the tariffs to the American public?\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what the plan is, what the strategy is,\u201d former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., told \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d on Thursday, later adding: \u201cThere are Republicans on the Hill who are wondering: Where are we going?\u201d\n\nAnother key question: What will the economic fallout look like?\n\nTrump warned that his trade policies would cause a \u201clittle disturbance\u201d in his speech to Congress last month. And we\u2019re already seeing markets rattled by the new tariffs, raising questions about the possibility of a national \u2014 or even global \u2014 recession.\n\nSome Republicans have indicated that the administration may need to rethink its policies if they result in an economic downturn.\n\n\u201cIf they make things better, they should want more; if it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told our Capitol Hill team on Wednesday.\n\nAnd lastly: When are Americans going to reap the benefits of this trade policy?\n\nTrump told me back in December that he \u201ccan\u2019t guarantee\u201d American families will not pay more, later adding that tariffs \u201care going to make us rich.\u201d\n\nThe president also said on Air Force One last night that it could take \u201ca year and a half to two years\u201d to ramp up American manufacturing. But the administration has yet to lay out exactly when everyday Americans will start to benefit from these tariffs.\n\nWe\u2019ll delve into these questions and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Sen. Jim Lankford, R-Okla., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nI also talked to our friends over at NBCU Academy about how I prepare for a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview.

            "full_content": "Photo: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nOne of the interpretations often heard about the 2024 elections is that the outcome represented a conservative \u201ccorrection\u201d for the progressive excesses of the Biden presidency. And indeed, it\u2019s possible to view much of American political history as a left-right oscillation in which one major party\u2019s dominance is countered by a reaction benefiting the other major party. Thus, for example, the Hoover administration\u2019s conservative ineffectiveness against the ravages of the Great Depression led to a New Deal revolution that was mitigated significantly by a bipartisan \u201cconservative coalition\u201d in Congress and eventually the Republican landslide of 1952.\n\nBut as should be abundantly clear by now, any hopes that Trump 2.0 would represent a mild and conservative \u201ccorrection\u201d of anything in living memory are hallucinatory. Indeed, it\u2019s as good a time as any to stop using the word \u201cconservative\u201d for this band of disruptive revolutionaries. Many of them believe America went crucially wrong not in 2021 (when Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his defeat failed) or in 2008 (when Barack Obama was elected president), or even in the 1960s, when America\u2019s \u201cfamily values\u201d were allegedly challenged if not destroyed, but instead near the beginning of the 20th century. That\u2019s why on the far right the original devil figures of the left in the MAGA version of history are Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, the \u201celitist\u201d progressives who seized permanent power for judges, bureaucrats, and globalists in pursuit of values like equality and social justice that were not part of the Founders\u2019 vision of this country.\n\nAs MSNBC\u2019s Ryan Teague Beckwith explains, much of Trump\u2019s actual agenda represents an effort to repeal the policies of the 20th century:\n\nThanks to Elon Musk and Russell Vought, we are getting a vivid demonstration that MAGA plans to demolish the \u201cdeep state\u201d are essentially an attack on the late-19th-century introduction of civil-service protections of public employees. The effort to purge DEI policies and programs from both the public and private sectors represent a conscious reversal of the civil-rights movement\u2019s premise that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow required affirmative action to create equal opportunity. And most obviously, the vast expansions of executive power being sought by Trump represent the belief that absolutely any means are justified to radically reverse the trajectory of American public policy prior to Trump\u2019s own accession to power.\n\nThere are a host of conservative intellectuals who have spilled many gallons of ink challenging the MAGA movement\u2019s claim to represent the conservative tradition or the Republican Party\u2019s heritage. But history aside, it\u2019s the smash-and-grab style of Trump 2.0 that is most alien to the temperament associated with many generations of conservative thinkers and activists. This is an administration (with the concurrence of its party) that has arrived like a thief in the night. It is seizing power and enemy turf with a speed and ruthlessness that suggest a determination to take steps that cannot be easily reversed by the very electorate that is supposed to have given Trump a virtually unlimited mandate. The initial phases of the mass-deportation program supervised by MAGA radical Stephen Miller all but courts the appearance of impropriety as masked secret policemen abduct people legally in this country. As former Republican U.S. senator John Danforth argued on the eve of Trump\u2019s rise to power, the very founder of Anglo-American conservatism, Edmund Burke, would have been appalled by the contemporary American right:\n\nThe essence of Burke\u2019s conservatism was his belief that political change should be gradual and not revolutionary and achieved through existing institutions. The result would be step-by-step change that would not be perfect in anyone\u2019s eyes, but it would be better than the tyranny of absolutism that had terrorized France. For Burke, the greatest threat to society wasn\u2019t some mistaken governmental policy but absolutists so certain of their own opinions that they would stop at nothing to force their opinions on the nation.\n\nIt\u2019s a distinctive trait of Trump 2.0 that its leading figures prefer to achieve change outside of \u201cexisting institutions,\u201d since the destruction of these institutions is a big part of their agenda. That\u2019s why tariffs, federal budget and personnel cuts, and changes in federal agency duties that the administration might well have secured through the Congress Republicans completely control are instead being pursued by executive order and implemented by quasi-legal organizations like DOGE and an OMB director who believes the president should have the right to impound every nickel of appropriated dollars. Trump\u2019s narcissism is perfectly matched to a cult of personality that is diametrically opposed to the measured and balanced approach to governing always associated with conservatism.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that the first truly national protest movement of the second Trump administration goes by the headline \u201cHands Off!\u201d It\u2019s a movement with no demands beyond the restoration of the status quo ante enjoyed by its members before Trump and Musk and their allies assaulted their values, their interests, and their peace of mind. These protesters are the real conservatives in America today.\n\nSo you can call MAGA folks by all sorts of labels from \u201creactionary nihilists\u201d to ultranationalists to the \u201calt-right\u201d to apostles of an American Greatness associated with the distant past. But they\u2019re not conservatives unless that term has lost all meaning. Trump and his acolytes are trying to create a very different country than the one whose leadership they have inherited. In the America most of us cherish, they see nothing worth conserving."

Not going [to] happen,\u201d the former Florida senator concluded.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have been detaining foreign college students for deportation for aligning themselves with the extreme Islamist group, Breitbart News reported.\n\nIn the case of Rumesya Ozturk, a Turkish national and Tufts University graduate student who was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE officers while she walked down the street near the Massachusetts campus in a now-viral video, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said she was \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.\u201d\n\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, D.C.

Officials from the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Staff, US Central Command, US Indo Pacific Command, Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, and the State Department told Congress in recent days that the strikes have eliminated several members of Houthi leadership and destroyed some Houthi military sites.\n\nBut they acknowledged that the group has still been able to fortify their bunkers and maintain weapons stockpiles underground, much as they did during the strikes that the Biden administration carried out for over a year, the sources said. And it has been difficult to determine precisely how much the Houthis still have stockpiled, a defense official said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken out some sites, but that hasn\u2019t affected the Houthis\u2019 ability to continue shooting at ships in the Red Sea or shooting down US drones,\u201d said one of the sources briefed on the operation. \u201cMeanwhile, we are burning through readiness\u2014munitions, fuel, deployment time.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times first reported details of the military operation shared in briefings with Congress.\n\nThe operational tempo of the strikes is also higher now that CENTCOM Commander Erik Kurilla no longer needs higher-level approval to conduct strikes\u2014a shift from the Biden administration and a return to the policies of Trump\u2019s first term, when military commanders were given more freedom to carry out missions in order to achieve \u201ca strategic effect\u201d as opposed to needing case-by-case approval from the White House for each strike and raid.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear, though, how long the Trump administration plans to continue the offensive, which CENTCOM has described as a \u201c24/7\u201d operation. Trump has said it will last until the Houthis stop attacking Red Sea shipping, but despite weeks of bombing the Houthis have continued launching missiles and drones at targets in and over the Red Sea. Earlier this week, they shot down another US MQ-9 Reaper drone\u2014the second MQ9 shot down since the offensive began last month, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nAnother defense official noted, however, that ballistic missile attacks from the Houthis against Israel have decreased in the last week, and said the relentless US bombing campaign has made it more difficult for the Houthis to communicate and hit things accurately because they\u2019ve been forced to \u201ckeep their heads down.\u201d\n\nThe people briefed on the operation also all described the Houthi officials who have been killed in the US strikes as mid-level, akin to \u201cmiddle management.\u201d One exception is the Houthi official in charge of the group\u2019s drone operations, who was killed in a strike last month, officials said.\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz referenced that Houthi leader in the Signal chat in March that was disclosed by The Atlantic. Waltz said in that chat that the Houthis\u2019 \u201ctop missile guy\u201d was killed when he walked into his girlfriend\u2019s building in Yemen which \u201ccollapsed\u201d amid US strikes.\n\nTwo of the sources briefed on the ongoing operation said that comment is indicative of how the US military under Trump is taking a more \u201cexpansive\u201d approach to the strikes than the Biden administration did, in terms of being less concerned about collateral damage. The Houthis have long used more populated areas to conceal command and control sites, the sources said.\n\nBut one of the defense officials said the building was not a civilian apartment building, but rather a meeting place for Houthi officials, and that the US military is using precision munitions and taking other measures to mitigate the risk of civilian casualties.\n\nThe large-scale operation has also rattled some officials at US Indo-Pacific Command, who have complained in recent days and weeks about the large number of long-range weapons being expended by CENTCOM against the Houthis, particularly the JASSMs and Tomahawks, the sources said. Those weapons would be critical in the event of a war with China, and military planners at INDOPACOM are concerned that the CENTCOM operation could have a negative impact on US military readiness in the Pacific.\n\nOne of the defense officials also downplayed that concern, calling it \u201can exaggeration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe employ precision munitions in every strike. We retain authority to use the full capacity of our deployed forces in the Middle East region against the Houthis,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe have no concern about employment of long-range weapons when and if needed to maximize our effectiveness."

Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nBrugh and other small business owners are weighing in on the tariffs Trump unveiled against virtually all U.S. trading partners on Wednesday afternoon. He described the tariffs as \"kind reciprocal\" and will focus on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S.\n\nThe new measures -- which Trump described as \"historic\" -- include a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all trading partners and further, more targeted punitive levies on certain countries, including China, the European Union and Taiwan.\n\n\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" he said, adding, \"because we are being very kind.\"\n\nHendrick Svendsen, the owner of a furniture store in Merriam, Kansas, told ABC News on Wednesday he has decided to close his store due to Trump's tariffs announcement.\n\n\"We just made the decision we are going to close down, we will be out in August,\" Svendsen said.\n\nHe said there is no way to continue the store's operation by using American-made products, with 90% of their items made overseas.\n\n\"I don't think that furniture manufacturing is ever going to come back to the U.S. North Carolina, where it used to be made, it's like a ghost town,\" Svendsen said on ABC News Live. \"When it comes to skill and workers, I don't think we have that in the U.S.\"\n\nFurniture manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined over the past few months, with 336,900 reported in February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick holds a chart as President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, April 2, 2025, in Washingto, D.C. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nSimon Bryant, a restaurant owner in San Francisco, told ABC station KGO that food costs have already been difficult to manage due to bird flu, and the tariffs could make things even more challenging.\n\n\"The reality is everyone's paying higher prices,\" Bryant said. \"We have to figure out what to do as a community.\"\n\nBut, there are individuals who are optimistic about the tariffs, including Duane Paddock, the owner of a Chevrolet dealership in Buffalo, New York. He told ABC News Live that he has seen the best sales in 13 years.\n\nWhile he is uncertain of the exact impact of the tariffs, he said he is hopeful that Trump's announcement is the \"best thing for our country\" and that his dealership will continue to \"keep prices as low as possible and do our fair share to help the customers.\"\n\n\"Whether President Trump was a Democrat or Republican, I have to have faith in my president and that's what I choose to do,\" Paddock said.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of these tariffs allowing for products to be made in the United States.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity for people to get back with manufacturing and have an opportunity to have a great middle-class life and increase their compensation over the course of time,\" Paddock said.\n\nJames Evans, a manufacturer who produces car parts in the U.S., told Baltimore ABC affiliate WMAR the tariffs will be \"great for us in six months to a year probably.\"\n\n\"I think in three, four years, it should set us up and other people that are manufacturing here in America for success,\" Evans said. \"I'm fine with dealing with some headaches for the next six months to a year and hopefully things go the way I think they're gonna go and then we'll be good, but maybe not. Only time will tell.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, shrimp catchers are also pleased with Trump's tariff announcement. Rocky Magwood told Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV that he will now be able to \"sell everything\" he catches. According to the Southern Shrimp Alliance, 94% of shrimp consumed in the United States is imported, with India and Ecuador supplying nearly 70%.\n\n\"This is the greatest stuff we see,\" Magwood said. \"Maybe people will want to buy our shrimp more. I can't say on the politics one way or another because I'm not into politics. That's not what feeds my family.\"\n\nBut Leah Ashburn, the president and CEO of Highland Brewing in North Carolina, said moving to American production is not feasible in all industries, especially her company, which relies on aluminum to make beer cans. While there are existing aluminum manufacturers in the United States, Canada is still the fourth-largest primary aluminum provider, behind China, India and Russia, according to the Canadian government.\n\nIn 2021, the United States accounted for less than 2% of global aluminum production, according to a Congressional Research Service Report.\n\n\"The U.S. simply can't pivot to making aluminum cans,\" Ashburn told WLOS. \"Mining is not done here. Aluminum is 95% brought in from other countries, and we are dependent on Canada. The effort to make aluminum here would be complex, costly and take a lot of time. It won't come soon enough.\"\n\nShe also said her business cannot raise their prices because consumers have \"hit their limit on what they're going to pay for a six-pack.\"\n\nThe 10% baseline tariff rate goes into effect on April 5, according to senior White House officials. The \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs go into effect April 9 at 12:01 a.m., officials said, and will affect roughly 60 countries.\n\nABC News' Jaclyn Lee, Alexandra Hutzler, Lauren Lantry and Michael Pappano contributed to this report"

            "full_content": "Trump launches a trade war. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nTo those of us who have been closely watching the slow unfolding of Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda in Congress, it all looks like a giant Jenga tower: imposing but very fragile. Partly because of his party\u2019s narrow margins of control (particularly in the House) and partly because of the \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d strategy of cramming nearly everything he wants accomplished into a single budget-reconciliation measure, the success of the whole initiative will likely come down to a few all-or-nothing votes whereby the package will fly to Trump\u2019s desk or collapse in immense disarray. And while the success enjoyed so far by Mike Johnson and John Thune in keeping the troops in line may boost the odds of it all working out in the end, the slow forward momentum of the budget process has depended in no small part on tricks used to delay the resolution of major differences of opinion dividing House and Senate Republicans and factions in each chamber.\n\nEven as Congress creeps toward enactment of a budget resolution this month, we don\u2019t know the level of tax or spending cuts it will impose, much less a lot of the details, including hot-button topics like Medicaid benefit cuts.\n\nEvents outside Congress have already stressed those working inside Congress: notably the Elon Musk\u2013led DOGE initiative that has usurped congressional authority while mobilizing public opposition to the austerity measures Republicans intend to pursue legislatively as well as via executive actions. GOP lawmakers have been repeatedly blindsided by DOGE raids on federal agencies, often accompanied by cartoon-villain boasts from Musk and his minions about the damage they are inflicting on \u201cuseless\u201d federal employees and the \u201cparasites\u201d they serve. But they cannot object to this largely nihilistic behavior without displeasing the Boss, so they\u2019ve bitten their tongues.\n\nBut now Trump himself has given his congressional allies a whole new cross to bear: his audacious and market-crashing global tariff regime. Even those who believe Trump is doing the right thing in seeking to reorder the entire global trading system (probably a minority of congressional Republicans), and that it will eventually produce positive results for U.S. growth and employment, have to acknowledge (as Trump has) that the short-term consequences could be painful. For that very reason, the period of transition to the planned Fortress America will likely be very rocky politically. Will Senate and particularly House Republicans facing difficult contests in 2026 simply salute and march off the cliff in lockstep support of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda if his job-approval ratings go significantly underwater? Will they demand modifications in that budget-reconciliation bill that hard-core MAGA shock troops in safe seats will reject? How does the Jenga tower stay stable?\n\nBeyond the basic politics of the tariff blitz, its economic effects could unravel some of the assumptions underlying Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. Restored inflation could increase political resistance to domestic-spending cuts as consumer purchasing power erodes. And if the nightmare of stagflation (inflation combined with reduced economic growth) descends on the U.S. economy, both financial markets and the Federal Reserve may take actions to counteract what the Republican Congress is trying to do, even as recessionary fears undermine the case for federal budget austerity.\n\nAs Punchbowl News reports, Republicans in Congress are increasingly frustrated by the situation:\n\nThe climate in Washington and across the country \u2014 both politically and economically \u2014 is making it much more difficult for Republicans to pass a massive tax-and-cut plan. Equity markets are getting rocked. Economists are already saying that a recession is possible. It will be difficult for Republicans to make the case that they should cut government spending. One almost wonders if the president should\u2019ve waited on his tariff regime until after the reconciliation bill was passed.\n\nThe overriding point is that passage of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda depends not just on partisan loyalty to the 47th president, but on a reasonably stable political and economic environment. It\u2019s just the worst possible time for that environment to be shaken up like a snow-globe landscape by presidential actions that have massively increased uncertainty about the immediate future of the United States internationally and domestically. The Jenga tower of legislation will be much harder to keep upright. It will be interesting to see if Trump himself understands everything he is putting at risk with his beloved tariffs and the trade war they have already sparked."

            "full_content": "Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nAfter President Trump announced sweeping tariffs this week, the financial markets saw their steepest one-day declines since 2020, Americans started panic buying everything from TVs to soy sauce, and financial analysts warned that we\u2019re facing \u201ceconomic Armageddon.\u201d Like many people, I was feeling pretty jittery about the collapse of the post\u2013World War II economic order. But then I took a look at Donald Trump\u2019s Truth Social feed and learned everything is going exactly according to plan!\n\nI\u2019ll admit: I did not find the \u201ctruth\u201d pinned to the top of Trump\u2019s feed all that reassuring. It\u2019s a video (replicated below on X) of the president declaring on Thursday that the markets are \u201cgoing to BOOM\u201d while in reality, they were doing the exact opposite:\n\nI think it's going very well\u2014The MARKETS are going to BOOM... pic.twitter.com/aDXwfR2tlZ \u2014 Trump Posts on \ud835\udd4f (@trump_repost) April 3, 2025\n\nBut after scrolling down Trump\u2019s feed, I realized the markets actually aren\u2019t supposed to \u201cBOOM\u201d \u2014 or at least, not yet. You see, \u201cTrump is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers,\u201d according to an X post the president shared. The accompanying TikTok video was eye-opening: We aren\u2019t just spiraling into an unnecessary economic downturn, \u201cTrump is Purposely CRASHING The Market\u201d:\n\nTo be clear, Trump did not say this himself. But presumably he agrees with the sentiment, as that would be an utterly insane thing for a president to highlight in a tense economic moment if he didn\u2019t mean it.\n\nSo what\u2019s the \u201csecret game\u201d Trump is playing that could \u201cmake you rich\u201d? Here\u2019s the full text of the TikTok video (as Mediaite notes, the voice-over appears to be from an Instagram post filmed by crypto and finance influencer Brian Decker two weeks ago):\n\nTrump is crashing the stock market by 20 percent this month, but he\u2019s doing it on purpose. And this is why Warren Buffett just said Trump is making the best economic moves he\u2019s seen in over 50 years. Now here\u2019s the secret game he\u2019s playing and it could make you rich.\n\nSo why is he doing this? To push cash into treasuries, which forces the Fed to slash interest rates in May and those lower rates give the Fed the ability to refinance trillions of debt very inexpensively. It also weakens the dollar and drops mortgage rates. Now it\u2019s a wild chess move but it\u2019s working.\n\nNow you\u2019re probably wondering, what about his tariffs? Well I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s a genius play. It actually forces companies to build here to dodge them. It also forces farmers to sell more of their products here in the U.S. to bring grocery prices way down. We\u2019ve already seen this with eggs.\n\nNow remember, 94 percent of all stocks are owned only by 8 percent of Americans. So Trump, he\u2019s taking from the rich short term and handing it to the middle class through lower prices.\n\nNow, I can\u2019t find any evidence that Warren Buffett praised Trump\u2019s economic moves (in fact, Buffett recently called tariffs \u201can act of war to some degree\u201d that eventually become \u201ca tax on goods\u201d). And I feel like I\u2019ve heard experts say that\u2019s not how any of this works; in fact, Trump\u2019s policies would actually \u201cshift the tax burden away from the well-off and toward the poor and middle class.\u201d But hey, I\u2019m not an economist! And I definitely like the idea that the president knows what he\u2019s doing and isn\u2019t upending the economy because he has a fifth-grader\u2019s understanding of how tariffs work.\n\nFrom there, Trump\u2019s morning missives just kept getting more and more reassuring. He declared, \u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH, RICHER THAN EVER BEFORE!!!\u201d This must be true because he shouted it in all caps, with three exclamation points:\n\nAnd Trump clarified that while his \u201cPOLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE\u201d he is open to changing them if other nations offer him something good:\n\nFinally, Trump touted Friday\u2019s better-than-expected jobs report as evidence that \u201cIT\u2019S ALREADY WORKING.\u201d (I assume \u201cit\u2019s\u201d refers to his entire economic plan, not this week\u2019s tariffs, specifically, as the jobs in question were added in March.)\n\nSo while things might seem a little grim right now, Trump has convinced me that all we need to do is \u201cHANK TOUGH\u201d!\n\nActually, scratch that. Trump quickly deleted that post and explained we\u2019re supposed to hang tough:\n\nEither way, I know I feel better being in such competent hands!"

            "full_content": "Photo: Bing Guan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAmerica\u2019s top tech stocks plunged after Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcements, with the so-called Magnificent 7 \u2014 Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla \u2014 losing more than a trillion dollars in collective value the next day and continuing their bleeding on Friday.\n\nThe president\u2019s rambling \u201cLiberation Day\u201d proclamation contained different versions of the same bad news for each firm. Apple manufactures a lot of devices in China but has spent billions of dollars hedging with new factories in Vietnam, India, and Malaysia. Now, all of them are subject to massive new tariffs. (One analysis estimated iPhone price increases at \u201c30 percent to 40 percent.\u201d) In addition to Elon Musk\u2019s co-dependent relationship with the Trump administration, around 20 percent of Tesla\u2019s revenue comes from China, as do many components of its cars sold elsewhere.\n\nThe sizes of the drops in shares of big tech companies varied in ways that made sense: Microsoft (down about 20 percent from its highs) is probably structurally less exposed than, for example, Nvidia (down 40 percent), which outsources chip manufacturing to Taiwan and is now clinging to a narrow (and negotiable) semiconductor exemption from generally astronomical tariffs. Meta and Google (both down around 30 percent) are valued as complex tech companies but make basically all their money from advertising, which fares particularly poorly during economic downturns, and which in recent years has been coming from China, where their services are otherwise banned.\n\nSome of the biggest spenders on Google and Meta ads are Shein and Temu, which are subject to the top-line tariffs on imported goods but also benefited from the de minimis exemption, which allowed them to ship cheap goods to American customers directly while bypassing scrutiny by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and avoiding tariffs. On Wednesday, Trump announced he was ending that policy, again.\n\nWhich brings us to Amazon. The retail giant lost nearly a tenth of its value on Thursday alone (and is down 28 percent overall). With the substantial caveats that these tariffs could be repealed or changed as quickly as they were instituted, that Amazon\u2019s last-minute bid for TikTok could involve or implicate it in some sort of broader negotiation with China, and that China might react in ways that further complicate Amazon\u2019s situation, there are two obvious ways to understand how these new rules could matter to Amazon. One is narrow: By eliminating de minimis shipments, which created a shipping and tariff situation so favorable to companies like Shein and Temu that Amazon cloned them, the administration is taking pressure off the company, and probably bringing prices on the platforms like Temu and Shein (which are substantially selling the exact same ultracheap stuff these days) in line with each other. For their part, the Chinese e-commerce companies seem to have known this was coming \u2014 Trump tried it in February, before backing off \u2014 and have been refocusing their efforts on other markets for a while now, especially Europe.\n\nThe second effect is broader: Amazon\u2019s business is massively dependent on relationships with Chinese businesses, in one form or another. As is the case with many American retailers, a massive portion of its products are manufactured there, of course. Unlike most retailers, a majority of its products are also sold by third-party merchants on the platform, and the majority of those sales come from sellers based in China. In the last few years, says tech and e-commerce analyst Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, Amazon has \u201conly accelerated its dependence on China. It has massive training centers for sellers in China, it organizes conferences for sellers. Any tariffs on China obviously have a massive impact on everything Amazon sells.\u201d Without much \u201cheadroom\u201d to absorb these tariffs, Amazon prices could go up across the board.\n\nThis is obviously bad news for any retailer, and painful for its customers. In the longer term, though \u2014 again, assuming this is a long-term situation \u2014 this could further entrench Amazon without substantially affecting its relationship with China.\n\nMore than a decade of aggressively pursuing cross-border commerce has transformed Amazon into a largely brandless store full of discount goods, which were often cheaper than their similarly imported, but branded, alternatives sold elsewhere. A situation in which prices are driven up for Amazon spatulas is a situation in which prices are driven up for most other spatulas people might buy instead. Cheap spatula production isn\u2019t likely to be re-shored to the U.S. anytime soon, if ever. So everyone\u2019s prices will be higher, but Amazon\u2019s will be relatively low, and its lower-end major competitors will have been neutralized, leading customers back to Amazon, where shipping is faster and they probably already subscribe to Prime anyway. \u201cDuring recessions, customers go for a cheaper alternative, Kaziuk\u0117nas says. \u201cAmazon equally benefits from situations like this.\u201d If, say, discretionary spending falls in general, that\u2019s a challenge for Amazon, but perhaps less than many of its peers. Even setting aside its profitable cloud business and other ventures, Amazon\u2019s retail business is diversified in ways that could mitigate tariffs. Its mostly internal advertising business, for example, squeezes fees out of sellers even when they fail, and while Chinese sellers account for much of that spending now, it\u2019s an extremely profitable, high-margin business even if it shrinks (comparable businesses at Walmart are growing but relatively minuscule).\n\nIf Amazon benefits from Trump\u2019s new trade rules, at least in relative terms, who loses? Direct-from-China e-commerce companies that have spent billions trying to lure American customers in a bid to ultimately take on Amazon more directly are obviously at risk, but so is basically everyone else. Small retailers selling more premium branded \u2014 but still likely imported \u2014 products will struggle. Other discount retailers, despite their dependence on imported goods, will both benefit from budget-conscious shoppers and find themselves competing more directly with the Everything Store. (Again, even in an environment where Chinese goods are subject to a 54 percent tariff, Marshalls and Ross are still cheaper than Target, and none of them is filling its shelves with made-in-the-USA goods anytime soon, which would likely still end up being far more expensive anyway.)\n\nThe biggest loser is shoppers. Prices will go up across the board with, in many cases, nothing to show for it in the purchased goods themselves. The country\u2019s dominant e-commerce firm will tighten its grip on retail. People will still be buying Temu-tier Haushof or XiaoZu spatulas on Amazon. They\u2019ll just cost as much as OXOs do. Or rather, did."

Photo: Chet Strange/Getty Images\n\nLast month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rebuffed criticism of his handling of the government-spending bill, arguing that averting a shutdown by backing the Republican-led legislation was the best option in an overall terrible situation. \u201cI knew it was a difficult choice and I knew I\u2019d get a lot of criticism for my choice. But I felt as a leader I had to do it,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nBut discontent around Democratic Party leadership has only grown as the Trump administration continues to implement its agenda unabated, with a recent survey suggesting that there are some voters who are ready to turn the page to a new generation of leaders.\n\nA new Data for Progress poll found Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez leading Schumer by double digits in a hypothetical 2028 Senate matchup, with the congresswoman receiving 55 percent of the vote to 36 percent for the veteran leader. Nine percent of respondents said they weren\u2019t sure.\n\nThe progressive polling firm also found Schumer with the lowest favorability of the New York Democrats and party leaders tested, receiving a net-favorable rating of +26 compared to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s +69 rating as well as former vice-president Kamala Harris, who received a +63 rating. The poll, which was first reported by Politico, surveyed 767 likely New York Democratic primary voters from March 26-31.\n\nCNN reported in March that some of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s House colleagues were urging her to primary Schumer following the intraparty debate on the stopgap-spending bill. But with 2028 several years away, it\u2019s not clear that the congresswoman has any aims to pursue the Senate. Her name was similarly floated as a possible challenger to New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand in 2024, but Ocasio-Cortez opted instead to run for reelection and glided to victory.\n\nIn an interview voicing her opposition for the bill, Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t directly answer a question about possibly challenging Schumer and instead emphasized the need for the Senate to stand firm on that issue. \u201cThe strength of our leadership in this moment is going to demonstrate the strength of our caucus,\u201d she said last month.\n\nSchumer downplayed the possibility of a primary challenge in a March interview with the New York Times, suggesting it was too early to entertain the thought. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time away. I am focused on bringing Trump\u2019s numbers down, his popularity down, exposing what he has done to America and what he will do. That\u2019s my focus right now,\u201d he said."

            "full_content": "U.S. border-patrol agents in New Mexico. Photo: Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump recaptured the White House by convincing voters to trust him on two issues: the economy and immigration. So far, the first is not going well. The month after his swearing in, the U.S. added 19,000 fewer jobs than expected and opinion polls showed his approval ratings underwater on the economy. On Wednesday, he announced new tariffs that sent global markets plummeting. A trade war and 1970s-style \u201cstagflation\u201d are now looming, which, besides ravaging Americans\u2019 pocketbooks, could lead to him hemorrhaging political capital. That leaves immigration \u2014 which is also not going well. Per Axios, Trump\u2019s rate of removals lags stubbornly behind Joe Biden\u2019s in 2024, which Trump ridiculed as \u201cweak and pathetic,\u201d despite him promising \u201cthe largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America.\u201d\n\nYet unlike Trump\u2019s upending of the economy, which was always part of his plan, immigration enforcement seems to be a source of real frustration. The president was reportedly so angry that ICE had not met his arbitrary deportation quota by mid-February that he reassigned the agency\u2019s two lead enforcers. In more recent weeks, with border crossings in decline and the economy set to contract, the administration has started coming up with increasingly creative ways to juice the boss\u2019s stats, offering a glimpse of how wide America\u2019s deportation dragnet can become when the president fixates on a solution in search of a problem.\n\nThe alleged problem \u2014 crime committed by immigrants \u2014 is being redefined accordingly. Students on visas and green-card holders who have spoken out in support of Palestine are suddenly criminals. And as he burns through the Mahmoud Khalils and Rumeysa Ozturks, Trump is turning his attention to seemingly any foreigner who has run afoul of the law \u2014 no matter how petty the indiscretion. Dogukan Gunaydin, a Turkish graduate student at the University of Minnesota, thought he had resolved his legal troubles when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor DUI in 2023. Then on March 27, he was snatched off the street by plainclothes ICE agents for the same offense. While it is unclear if deportation proceedings are underway as Gunaydin languishes in detention, legal analysts told the New York Times that a case as old and minor as his usually gets resolved with a written notification and a path to retaining visa status.\n\nNo more. Instead we see gestapo-like fear tactics, like when a woman identified as Sarahi, a Guatemalan undocumented immigrant with two children ages 1 and 5, accidentally drove onto the Ambassador Bridge, a one-way toll road connecting Michigan and Ontario, Canada, in March. The mistake got the vehicle\u2019s passengers \u2014 including Sarahi\u2019s kids and teenage brother \u2014 detained by border-patrol agents, who threatened to deport her. Rather than being released under supervision with a future court date, as formerly was custom, she was locked in a windowless office for five days with a single cup of ramen-noodle soup to split with her children that first night.\n\n\u201cThis administration has an obsessive focus on detention,\u201d Miriam Aukerman, an ACLU of Michigan staff attorney, told NPR of these methods, which oscillate between nitpicky quibbling and blithe carelessness. Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran man living in Maryland with his American wife and 5-year-old son, was airlifted to CECOT, El Salvador\u2019s megaprison, on March 16, after it appears he was baselessly labeled a member of MS-13. Lawyers for the administration admitted to making an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d But Garcia, who has protected legal status and has lived in the U.S. since 2011, has now been exiled to what is functionally a legal black hole from which the administration claims it is powerless to retrieve him. Not that it wants to \u2014 when confronted about the error on X, Vice-President J.D. Vance falsely labeled Garcia \u201ca convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just ICE and border agents carrying out this agenda \u2014 the entire national-security apparatus seems to be following the same script. After the administration paid $6 million to have Garcia and more than 200 other deportees imprisoned in El Salvador and celebrated the transfer with a fascist sizzle reel, Kristi Noem, Trump\u2019s secretary of Homeland Security, released footage of herself preening at CECOT wearing a $60,000 gold Rolex. Promotional videos of this variety \u2014 well-heeled politicos posing in front of kneeling prisoners \u2014 have been distributed so widely online that Garcia\u2019s wife, who did not initially know where her husband had been taken, apparently discovered his location after spotting him in the background of one.\n\nTrump\u2019s deployment of 9,000 troops and tanklike armored trucks to the U.S.-Mexico border offers them a similar photo op. And while it is currently illegal for active-duty military to perform civilian law enforcement, the administration plans to recategorize a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d along the border in New Mexico as a \u201csatellite military installation\u201d that would make crossing it equivalent to trespassing on a military base \u2014 this generating even more detainees to use as props.\n\nThese dire trends only stand to worsen as pressure mounts on Trump to fulfill his campaign promises \u2014 or at least give the appearance that he is. The administration already seems to have defied a judge\u2019s order to halt the deportation flight that took Garcia to El Salvador, and if its defiance goes unchecked, there\u2019s no telling how many more people could be vulnerable to removal. The president\u2019s go-to move whenever he fears an election-season wipeout, dating back to his first term, is to demagogue immigration. But while the ginned-up migrant caravans of yesteryear have no obvious near-term equivalent, approaching headwinds portend more of the same: Tuesday\u2019s state supreme-court election in Wisconsin broke heavily for the liberal candidate despite Elon Musk spending a record amount of money to defeat her.\n\nUltimately these developments speak to how contingent Trump\u2019s political strengths are. The harder he leans on deportation theater in this imploding economy, the clearer it becomes that our crises cannot be purged by ICE agents, because they are homegrown."

            "full_content": "It\u2019s easy to imagine Donald Trump feeling a sense of urgency and scheduling a busy day of difficult work. Major indices around the world have responded to the president\u2019s trade tariffs with steep drop-offs. The likelihood of a recession is growing. Key businesses have announced layoffs. Consumer prices are poised to climb.\n\nKey U.S. allies are turning against us, and U.S. rivals are imposing retaliatory measures. Even some of the White House\u2019s most sycophantic partisan allies are struggling to defend the White House\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn case this weren\u2019t quite enough, four U.S. servicemen who died during a training exercise in Lithuania are poised to return home at a dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.\n\nThe president, however, hasn\u2019t scheduled a busy day of work at the White House, and he won\u2019t be on hand for the service members\u2019 return. As The Washington Post reported, \u201cA day after seeking to remake the global economic order, President Donald Trump on Thursday is returning to another priority: remaking professional golf.\u201d\n\nTrump will dine with leaders of the LIV Golf tour at his [Doral] club outside Miami, his latest visit to Florida and a sporting event in a 73-day-old presidency that has already been full of both. The trip combines the president\u2019s prized relationship with the Saudi Arabian leaders who own the tour; his regular visits to Florida, where he has spent most weekends of this presidency at his Mar-a-Lago resort; and his frequent mixing of personal business with his presidential office.\n\nI think we\u2019re all familiar with the old adage, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going to Florida for a Saudi-backed golf event.\u201d\n\nOr something like that.\n\nFor a president who tends to be preoccupied with camera-ready appearances and the optics of politics, some part of him must realize that it doesn\u2019t look great to take a golf trip after setting much of the global economy \u2014 and your retirement account \u2014 on fire, but Trump\u2019s doing it anyway.\n\nMaking matters slightly worse, all of this comes on the heels of Trump\u2019s recent declaration that federal employees who work remotely necessarily abuse the system. \u201cI happen to be a believer that you have to go to work. I don\u2019t think you can work from home,\u201d the president said in February. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to work from home. ... They\u2019re going to play golf.\u201d\n\nWell, someone\u2019s going to be playing golf instead of working, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the federal workforce.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget that as a candidate in 2016, the Republican seemed eager to give voters the impression that he\u2019s a workaholic. At an event in New Hampshire, for example, while complaining about Barack Obama\u2019s golf outings, Trump declared that if he were in office, \u201cI\u2019d want to stay in the White House and work my ass off.\u201d Soon after, he assured voters, \u201cI\u2019m going to be working for you. I\u2019m not going to have time to go play golf.\u201d\n\nAfter taking office, Trump proceeded to golf rather obsessively throughout his first term. His second term is offering more of the same.\n\nWhen he spoke to NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker this past weekend and the topic of a third term came up, the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host reminded him of just how much work a president has to do.\n\n\u201cWell, I like working,\u201d Trump replied.\n\nSure you do, big guy. Sure you do."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s aggressive and fast-paced effort to advance its immigration agenda has exposed existing challenges with a dated system and raised concerns that authorities are flouting due process to ram deportations through.\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump and his team have taken extraordinary measures to crack down on immigration, including invoking a rarely used wartime authority, known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that has pitted the administration against a federal judge and prompted public backlash.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has made multiple missteps in recent weeks, including mistakenly deporting a Salvadoran man whose case will be heard in a federal courtroom on Friday. The errors kept happening despite federal agents assuring they are carefully vetting each person before putting them on flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nTrump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly maintained that authorities have done due diligence to gather information that the migrants they are deporting should be removed, especially from the Latin American gangs MS-13 or Tren de Aragua.\n\nAfter hundreds of alleged gang members were flown to El Salvador last month in possible violation of a judge\u2019s order, Homan said in an interview with ABC that \u201cevery single\u201d migrant was a member of one of the gangs \u201caccording to the information\u201d given to him \u201cfrom the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of gang members don\u2019t have criminal histories, like a lot of terrorists in this world,\u201d Homan said. \u201cWe have to count on social media, we have to count on surveillance techniques, we have to count on sworn statements from other gang members.\u201d\n\nWhite House 'border czar' Tom Homan speaks with members of the press on the grounds of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 4, 2025. Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMultiple detainees on those flights were eventually returned to the US because the Salvadoran prison wouldn\u2019t take them once they landed there.\n\nIn the court fight over the deportations using the Alien Enemies Act, a senior Immigration and Customs official, Robert Cerna, defended the process for identifying members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua, or TdA.\n\n\u201cAgency personnel carefully vetted each individual alien to ensure they were in fact members of TdA,\u201d Cerna wrote in a declaration. \u201cOfficers and agents well versed in gang activity in general and TdA in particular reviewed the information gathered on each alien, identifying TdA members based upon the results of investigative techniques and information.\u201d\n\nBut Cerna also wrote the US has little specific information about the detainees it believes are Tren de Aragua gang members.\n\n\u201cThe lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose. It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile,\u201d the ICE official said in his declaration.\n\nKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia Courtesy Jennifer-Vasquez\n\nThe immigration push made national headlines again this week, when the administration admitted it shouldn\u2019t have deported \ufeffKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national who was living in Maryland, to the notorious mega prison in his home country, even though he had been granted a protected status that should have prevented him from being removed there.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the man\u2019s removal a \u201cclerical error.\u201d\n\nAlso this week, a judge in Texas found that a man was wrongfully detained by immigration authorities, after he narrowly avoided being put on one of those deportation flights to El Salvador. The judge ordered the immediate release of Gil Rojas, a Venezuelan national whose attorneys had obtained a court order keeping him in the US just before the series of flights took off in mid-March.\n\nCourts weigh in\n\nThe cases underscore the complexity of the US immigration system: Proceedings can take years, people are granted a variety of different legal statuses, and the process for both immigrants and the federal government is cumbersome.\n\nThe mid-March deportation flights to El Salvador were central to a court hearing on Thursday, where US District Judge James Boasberg considered whether government attorneys misled him about the flights and if they or others in the administration should be held in contempt.\n\nBoasberg pressed for answers, sharply questioning the Justice Department about the administration\u2019s rush to fly detainees to the Salvadoran prison on Saturday, March 15. The judge pointed out that in its haste, the administration risked putting people on the planes who shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\nThe court fight \u2013 parts of which are before the Supreme Court \u2013 has raised questions about the reach of executive authority on immigration policy.\n\n\u201cThe district court has no ability to \u2013 in any way \u2013 restrain the president\u2019s authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, or, as I believe, to conduct the Foreign Affairs the United States,\u201d Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s White House deputy chief of staff, told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cThe Arena\u201d last month.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union attorneys are arguing that some of the migrants may have been sent to El Salvador erroneously because of common choices they made, like getting tattoos of a soccer ball and crown. One detainee said the tattoo was for the soccer team Real Madrid, but the administration read it as a possible sign of gang affiliation.\n\nThe case tests Trump\u2019s power to send migrants away without removal proceedings where the migrants can argue they aren\u2019t gang members. The high court hasn\u2019t yet decided what it will do.\n\nAt an appeals court hearing last week, one of the judges said mistakes could be easily made with the administration\u2019s current process.\n\n\u201cYou all could have put me up on Saturday and thrown me on a plane thinking I\u2019m a member of Tren de Auga and giving me no chance to protest,\u201d DC Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Patricia Millett said. She added at the court hearing that in her hypothetical, she wouldn\u2019t be able to argue, \u201c\u2018Excuse me, no I\u2019m not, I\u2019d like a hearing.\u2019\u201d\n\nSalvadoran Minister of Justice and Public Security Gustavo Villatoro, pointing, accompanies US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a tour of the Terrorist Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador on March 26, 2025. Alex Brandon/Pool/Reuters\n\nDenying gang affiliation\n\nWhile senior Trump officials have expressed confidence in their deportation decisions, migrants and their advocates say quick decisions have been catastrophic and may flout longstanding immigration procedures.\n\nImmigration attorneys and family members have argued that some of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador\u2019s mega prison last month are not tied to gangs, like the administration has described. Some of those removed had also been in the middle of their immigration proceedings before being sent to another country.\n\nMany are still seeking answers.\n\nOn Wednesday, attorney John Dutton attended an immigration hearing for his client, Henrry Albornoz Quintero, who Dutton believes was sent to El Salvador.\n\nAsked by the immigration judge about the whereabouts of Albornoz Quintero, a Venezuelan national who was in immigration detention, the ICE attorney only stated he\u2019s no longer in the agency\u2019s custody.\n\nThe judge pressed for more information, calling the lack of answers ridiculous, according to Dutton. With no official confirmation of his deportation from ICE, another hearing has been scheduled.\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, co-founder and president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, also told CNN that her client, a Venezuelan asylum seeker, was abruptly removed to El Salvador before his immigration proceedings had concluded.\n\nToczylowski\u2019s client was expected to appear virtually for his immigration hearing from ICE detention last month, but he wasn\u2019t there. The ICE prosecutor didn\u2019t have information, according to Toczylowski, and the judge rescheduled the hearing.\n\nA few days later, ICE confirmed in immigration court that Toczylowski\u2019s client had been among those sent to El Salvador.\n\nCourt documents have shed light on some of the confusion with the flights to El Salvador.\n\nOne Venezuelan woman who was being held in Texas was flown to El Salvador along with a handful of other female Venezuelan detainees. But they were sent back to the US after landing at the Salvadoran prison. El Salvador\u2019s infamous Center for Terrorism Confinement, known as Cecot, wouldn\u2019t take the women, according to the filings.\n\n\u201cAll the men got off the plane,\u201d the woman, who is only identified by the initials S.Z.F.R., wrote in a recent sworn statement in the case before Boasberg. \u201cThe remaining women asked what happens to us? I was told that the President of El Salvador would not accept women. I was also told that we were going back to detention in the US.\u201d\n\nPrison guards in El Salvador also refused a male detainee of Nicaraguan descent because that Central American county was outside the agreement the US struck with El Salvador.\n\n\u201cI overheard a Salvadoran official tell an ICE officer that the Salvadoran government would not detain someone from another Central American country because of the conflict it would cause,\u201d the detainee wrote in a sworn statement.\n\nThe Trump administration conceded in a court filing Monday that it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father, to El Salvador \u201cbecause of an administrative error\u201d and argued it could not return him because he\u2019s now in Salvadoran custody.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed over his removal, and a hearing is scheduled on Friday.\n\nPrior to his removal, he was arrested by ICE in mid-March \u201cdue to his prominent role in MS-13,\u201d according to a court declaration from a senior ICE official. His attorneys say he\u2019s not a member of the gang, nor does he have any ties to it.\n\n\u201cAs others were removed from the flight for various reasons, he moved up the list and was assigned to the flight. The manifest did not indicate that Abrego Garcia should not be removed,\u201d Cerna, an acting ICE field office director, said in his declaration.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alejandra Jaramillo and Devan Cole contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "The Thai army has filed a criminal complaint against an American scholar working in Thailand, alleging that he insulted the country\u2019s monarchy\n\nBANGKOK -- The Thai army has filed a criminal complaint against an American scholar working in Thailand, alleging that he insulted the country\u2019s monarchy, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nPaul Chambers, a political science lecturer, said police came to his workplace at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok on Friday morning to serve him with an arrest warrant and summoning him to the local police station to formally hear the charges.\n\nChambers said he will report himself on Tuesday and hopes to get released on bail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically in limbo because I can\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019m not supposed to,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m kind of nervous.\u201d\n\nA copy of the police summons, seen by the AP, says the regional army command filed charges against Chambers, including violating the law against defaming the monarchy and the Computer Crime Act.\n\nThe letter, signed by Phitsanulok City police chief Watcharapong Sitthirungroj, said the warrant was approved by the Phitsanulok Provincial Court on March 31. Watcharapong denied any knowledge of the charges against Chambers when first reached by the AP, but when asked about his signature on the document, said he couldn\u2019t immediately comment and asked a reporter to call back.\n\nThe 3rd Army Area, covering Thailand's northern region, was named as the plaintiff in the document, but could not be reached for comment. Army spokesperson Winthai Suvaree could not immediately be reached.\n\nThe summons did not explain the details of the offense that Chambers was accused of. Chambers said he believes it was related to a webinar last October in which he discussed the influence of the military in Thai politics.\n\nThailand\u2019s lese majeste law calls for three to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent.\n\nCritics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and has been used in Thailand to punish critics of the government and institutions such as the military. The army plays a major role in politics and has staged 13 successful coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently just 11 years ago.\n\nIt is rare for a foreigner to be charged under the law, which has been applied frequently in the past decade during a period of political polarization.\n\nPublic criticism of the monarchy, a linchpin of Thai identity, used to be rare, but student-led pro-democracy protests began to challenge that taboo in 2020, openly criticizing the institution. That led to vigorous prosecutions under what was previously a little-used law.\n\nThe advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the lese majeste law, often referred to as Article 112."

            "full_content": "If you worked for Bryan Johnson, you\u2019d be seeing this now. Photo: Agaton Strom//Redux\n\nAt any given time, there are a lot of people who are upset with Bryan Johnson, the very online guy who wants to live forever. The entrepreneur, philosopher, and \u201crejuvenation athlete\u201d is in pursuit of the lofty goal of not dying. If he can\u2019t do that, he intends to at least slow down his own aging by taking 50-plus pills a day and eating his dinner around noon. At 47, his skin looks pretty good, if a little Draculean from years of abstaining from sunlight. But Johnson says it\u2019s the inside that counts, claiming that his body is running like someone years younger than he is. Someone like his 19-year-old son, whose blood he has injected.\n\nThrough his company Blueprint, Johnson sells supplements featuring collagen, creatine, and other vitamins commonly promoted by fitness influencers. Like anyone making a load of health claims purporting improvements in a customer\u2019s life for the low price of $46.55, Johnson has attracted a number of people questioning the science behind his claims. He appears to be a true believer in what he\u2019s peddling, though he also benefits from being rich enough not to have to listen to anyone. Over a decade ago, he sold his payments company, which owned Venmo at the time, to PayPal, netting him perhaps as much as $300 million.\n\nAs with so many situations with people who made their name online, the more you talk about Johnson, the more it seems that he wins. Recently, he explained this succinctly: \u201cBryan Johnson hate is good for business.\u201d\n\nEvery so often, though, his haters can mess up his business as usual.\n\nJohnson says he had never heard of the writer and lawyer Matt Bruenig until a few weeks ago, despite being a big reader. (Johnson said over the phone this week that he\u2019s \u201cprobably read over a hundred\u201d biographies of the great minds in history.)\n\nFor the past decade, Bruenig has been a popular voice of the wonky op-ed left, voicing progressive labor ideas in pretty much every paper and magazine that isn\u2019t owned by the Murdoch family. (His spouse, Elizabeth Bruenig, a writer at The Atlantic who often tends to more Godly matters, has been printed in the rest of them.) If you\u2019re concerned with the future of the Democratic party and how it can attract young voters with worker-friendly economic policies, you\u2019ve probably run into his work. But Bruenig\u2019s actual day job is as a labor attorney.\n\nAs it happens, Bryan Johnson has a profound love not just for aging slowly, but also for nondisparagement agreements. The New York Times reported a few weeks ago that Johnson required his staffers to sign 20-page NDAs blocking them from speaking about pretty much anything related to Johnson or his companies. One \u201copt-in\u201d document to protect him from potential lawsuits informed his employees they had to be comfortable with extremely specific situations. These include being around Johnson while he has very little clothing on as well as \u201cdiscussions for media production including erotica (for example, fan fiction including but not limited to story lines/ideas informed by the Twilight series and-or 50 Shades of Grey.)\u201d\n\n\u201cThat stuff is weird,\u201d said Bruenig. But what really concerned him is what he described as \u201cJohnson\u2019s suppression of employee speech through these disparagement clauses.\u201d\n\nIn late 2019, according to publicly available court documents, Johnson handed one of these agreements to Taylor Southern, an employee at Kernel, his neuroimaging company. She was also his fianc\u00e9e, until court docs say that Johnson called off their marriage, forced her to move out, then fired her \u2014 all while she was being treated for breast cancer. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the problem with an employer becoming engaged to an employee: this whole thing gets so entangled,\u201d Bruenig said. \u201cThe agreement forbids Southern from saying anything disparaging about Johnson without making any exceptions for her unwaivable right to speak about her working conditions.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Southern was looking for a way to get out of the nondisparagement clause that has barred her from speaking about this experience when she says she \u201cstumbled across Matt\u2019s blog\u201d and reached out to him. Bruenig explained that she has a right to discuss her working conditions and agreements silencing dissent from other employees so long as she does so in coordination with other workers. After speaking with Bruenig, she and two more of Johnson\u2019s former employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, arguing to the watchdog agency that handles private-sector labor disputes that they should be released from what they see as overbroad clauses.\n\nIn March, Southern went public with her legal battle. She had sued Johnson, saying that he owed her $150,000 for rent and moving out post-breakup, per the Times. Unfortunately for her, the suit was moved to arbitration, where she was ordered to pay him $584,000 in legal bills thanks to a fee-shifting clause, a provision in the agreement she signed that forced her to pay his lawyers if she sued and lost.\n\nJohnson\u2019s attorney said that her social-media use violated the terms of her nondisparagement clause. Of concern was a video from February in which she described being \u201csuddenly alone\u201d after Johnson ended their engagement, as well as her posts on social media criticizing Harvey Weinstein and Sean Combs for their use of NDAs. \u201cGiven that Ms. Southern so frequently comments about Mr. Johnson, there is little doubt she is attempting to equate him with these individuals and paint him in a false light,\u201d Johnson\u2019s attorney wrote.\n\nFor Bruenig, this was a step too far. This week, he filed another unfair labor practice charge, describing this legal threat as a violation of Southern\u2019s rights under the National Labor Relations Act. \u201cIf Mr. Johnson is uncomfortable with the fact that his use of non-disclosure agreements puts him in the same company as Harvey Weinstein and Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs, then he should reconsider how he conducts his employment relationships,\u201d Bruenig wrote. As for the end of Johnson and Southern\u2019s relationship, Bruenig\u2019s argument had universal appeal: \u201cBreakups cause people to feel alone. Saying so is not disparagement.\u201d\n\nFrom here, a lawyer for the NLRB will investigate the matter then kick it up to higher authorities at the watchdog agency if the unfair labor practice charge has merit. If the board ruled in Southern\u2019s favor, no money would be awarded. \u201cThe remedies at the NLRB are not that great,\u201d said Bruenig. \u201cBut it does help defend us in the case of a lawsuit. If he does start to actually bring lawsuits attempting to enforce this stuff, we can point to the existence of the unfair labor practice charge to hopefully get that lawsuit dismissed.\u201d\n\nSouthern, for one, is happy to have Bruenig in her corner. \u201cMatt is the first person to offer a little bit of hope that I\u2019m maybe not stuck in this forever,\u201d she said. But as the case at the NLRB moves forward at a bureaucratic pace \u2014 made slower by President Trump\u2019s refusal to fully staff the board that rules on cases \u2014 Johnson doesn\u2019t seem phased. He says he is unable to comment on the case involving his ex-fianc\u00e9e, their breakup, and her ouster while she was battling cancer aside from describing the ongoing NDA spat as just \u201cnoise.\u201d He stands by his ways: When it comes to NDAs in the workplace, \u201cI think that more people should do this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Times reports that somehow my use of NDAs is nefarious, that it\u2019s somehow an evil plan to silence people,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the exact opposite.

He\u2019s also not shopping Johnson\u2019s products, noting that they\u2019re often just longevity-branded versions of stuff you can get for cheaper at any store, like the product that Johnson markets as \u201csnake oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of aside from any of the issues we have, but why would you ever buy this?\u201d Bruenig asked. \u201cJust go to the grocery store and buy olive oil.\u201d"

The 10% baseline tariff on virtually every country \u2014 and higher numbers on countries with which the U.S. has larger trade deficits \u2014 now leaves his Republican supporters trying to thread the political needle of not criticizing him while also understanding the economic peril the tariff plan may cause.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s team has not had a clear message to either explain the strategy behind the tariffs or his thought process behind the decision to go much further than his supporters expected.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day.

Wall Street on Thursday saw its worst day since the depths of the pandemic, with nearly $2 trillion wiped out from the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq didn\u2019t fare well, either. The rout could be read as a harsh early verdict on Trump\u2019s tariff plan. Analysts are increasingly raising alarms about the potential for recession.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s most staunch congressional allies are still expressing their support, albeit with caveats. \u201cIf they make things better, they should want more,\u201d Sen.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nVice President JD Vance applauded in the front row of the Rose Garden as President Donald Trump announced a massive new round of tariffs on Wednesday \u2013 an economy-rattling policy he promised would bring back manufacturing jobs.\n\nBut for years before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, Vance argued the opposite.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, Vance said repeatedly that American manufacturing jobs were lost for good, and that \u201cprotectionist\u201d trade policies would do little to bring them back.\n\nVance\u2019s comments are another example of his transformation from a self-described \u201cNever Trump guy\u201d to a full-fledged MAGA backer in the Senate and on Trump\u2019s ticket, a change he has attributed to seeing the successes of Trump\u2019s policies in his first term.\n\n\u201cVice President Vance has been crystal clear in his unwavering support for revitalizing the American economy by bringing back manufacturing jobs and sticking up for middle class workers and families since before he launched his U.S. Senate race, and that is a large part of why he was elected to public office in the first place,\u201d said Taylor Van Kirk, spokesperson for the vice president.\n\nVance is now a key messenger for Trump\u2019s economic agenda as the administration pursues sweeping new protectionists policies announced on what they deemed \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our declaration of economic independence,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cJobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already.\u201d\n\nStarting around 2016, when Vance rose to national fame as the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d he argued in repeated interviews, speeches and social media posts that automation and technological change were the primary forces reshaping the American economy and said he opposed \u201chyper protectionists\u201d and their policies.\n\n\u201cSo many of these jobs that have disappeared from these areas just aren\u2019t coming back. They haven\u2019t disappeared so much from globalization or from shipping them overseas,\u201d Vance said in a January 2017 interview with Education Week. \u201cThey\u2019ve largely disappeared because of automation and because of new technological change.\u201d\n\nOther comments and social media activity from Vance during that time directly took aim at Trump\u2019s trade rhetoric. Shortly after Trump met with manufacturing CEOs in February 2017 and publicly railed against America\u2019s trade deficits, Vance pushed back.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be repeated enough: if you\u2019re worried about America\u2019s economic interest, focus more on automation/education than trade protectionism,\u201d Vance wrote.\n\nIn December 2016, as then-President-elect Trump visited a Carrier plant in Indiana to tout a deal he claimed would keep manufacturing jobs from moving to Mexico, Vance liked a tweet from Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse that offered a different explanation for job loss.\n\n\u201cAutomation\u2014even more than trade\u2014will continue to shrink the number of manufacturing jobs,\u201d Sasse wrote. \u201cThis trend is irreversible.\u201d\n\nThe like, which CNN saved before X made likes private last year, underscored Vance\u2019s alignment at the time with Republicans who doubted the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s proposals to restore blue-collar jobs through trade pressure alone.\n\nEven when Vance acknowledged that globalization had caused deep harm in some communities, citing research that linked increased exposure to Chinese imports with strain on local labor markets, he argued that those downsides did not justify a sweeping reversal of US trade policy.\n\n\u201cNow does that mean that we should be hyper-protectionists in our approach to trade? I would argue no,\u201d Vance said at an April 2017 event. \u201cBut should we be cognizant of the fact that when you have some of those communities that are really exposed to trade, it can very often harm them or at least cause some pretty negative consequences, even as it might cause some positive ones. I think we have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think that trade hasn\u2019t necessarily been in the best interests of a lot of these communities. Now, the question of whether you can go backwards in time, I think the answer is no,\u201d he told a gathering at the University of Chicago in February 2017.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds up a chart of new tariffs. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe long-term solution, Vance argued in December 2016, was to retrain workers.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental issue with American jobs and manufacturing right now is not that all of our jobs have gone to Mexico and China, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve been auto\u2013automated. It\u2019s that mechanization has sort of reduced the manufacturing work base,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a solution to that problem. It\u2019s to train people for the next level of jobs, to train people for the 21st century workforce.\u201d\n\nVance also expressed skepticism about Trump\u2019s promises to revive traditional industries through trade policy, specifically questioning whether legacy jobs like coal and steel could ever return.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a simple, \u2018Let\u2019s bring the coal or steel jobs back,\u2019\u201d Vance said in early 2017. \u201cBut I also think that if folks are employed in next generation jobs with dignified work and good wages, that they\u2019re not gonna be angry that Trump didn\u2019t bring back the steel jobs.\u201d\n\nWhile recognizing the downsides of globalization, Vance also argued it was too late to reverse course while agreeing at the time that fighting over trade was \u201cyesterday\u2019s war.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you could [turn the clock back] a little bit on trade if we were in the \u201980s, but we\u2019ve already lost that battle in some ways,\u201d Vance told CNN in February 2017. \u201cThe jobs are already gone.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Vance has credited Trump\u2019s first term in the White House with broadly shifting his view on his agenda. And Vance\u2019s public statements on globalization were beginning to shift by 2019, just before he has said he fully embraced Trump, voting for him in 2020 and then running the next year for Senate as a Trump-allied Republican. In October 2019, Vance called the view that automation had taken jobs a \u201cbad argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an economist, but I can spot a bad argument. And the argument\u2013reproduced ad nauseum in the business press\u2013that manufacturing jobs not keeping pace with output = automation is the main culprit is really bad,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut even in the final half of Trump\u2019s first term, when Vance was more sympathetic to the Trump administration\u2019s arguments on trade, he was not optimistic on the odds of success of protectionist policies.\n\n\u201cFWIW, my guess is the policy may very well fail, especially if Biden is elected president and China\u2019s intransigence is rewarded. I\u2019ve seen some claim that they\u2019re explicitly betting on that fact,\u201d he wrote."

            "full_content": "Paul Weiss agreed to \u201cessentially a settlement,\u201d in Trump\u2019s words. Photo: Jeenah Moon/The New York Times/Redux\n\nYou\u2019ll be forgiven if your heart isn\u2019t breaking over the fate of the handful of elite law firms recently targeted by Donald Trump. So a few megarich corporations who help make mega-megarich corporations even richer stand to get a little less rich? We\u2019ve got bigger problems.\n\nBut don\u2019t skim past this one. You\u2019ve heard the Shakespeare quote: \u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers.\u201d That line is sometimes misinterpreted as an expression of frustration directed at lawyers, who are always mucking things up and impeding free enterprise and a good time. But Shakespeare\u2019s point, in context, is that lawyers stand in the way of lawlessness, so anyone hoping to subvert the established order might want to start by chucking all us pesky J.D.\u2019s in the river.\n\nTrump has now targeted a string of elite law firms for reasons that are equal parts Machiavelli, Mean Girls, and Dick (the character who speaks the aforementioned line in Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VI, Part 2). The president has issued a series of formal proclamations that warn vaguely but darkly of the \u201csignificant risks\u201d posed by these \u201crogue law firms,\u201d which engage in \u201charmful activity\u201d and \u201cegregious conduct.\u201d The Orwellian preludes quickly give way to burn-book flaming of the condemned law firms. Trump offers zero pretext; this is entirely about retribution, personal and political.\n\nWitness the sins of the commander-in-chief\u2019s disfavored firms. Covington & Burling (where I worked 20-plus years ago) made the list primarily because, horror of horrors, it is providing free legal services to Jack Smith. The president attacked Jenner and Block largely because it formerly employed Andrew Weissmann, who once prosecuted the bumbling Trump-adjacent ostrich-skin aficionado Paul Manafort, and WilmerHale, which has hired lawyers who once worked on Robert Mueller\u2019s special-counsel investigation. Perkins Coie got its comeuppance because it represented Hillary Clinton and has worked with George Soros. (Now, don\u2019t you feel safe and protected from all the big, scary, \u201csignificant risks\u201d that were afoot?)\n\nTrump instinctively understands how to hit his chosen enemies where it hurts most: the bottom line. All law firms aspire to high-minded principles (and sometimes achieve them), but they are, at core, relentlessly profit-seeking entites. Trump \u2014 no stranger to cold-blooded capitalism \u2014 has expertly crafted his proclamations to bring the named firms to their knees.\n\nFirst, the proclamations strip all firm lawyers of security clearances and bar them from access to government buildings \u2014 making it effectively impossible to represent clients in any federal criminal or regulatory matter. And, crucially, the proclamations threaten that any company doing business with the targeted law firms will lose its government contracts.\n\nConsider these conditions from the perspective of a potential blue-chip client \u2014 say, a private aeronautics company that relies on federal-government contracts for the bulk of its revenue. If that company needed representation on any criminal or regulatory case, it would immediately drop the targeted firms, given that the lawyers can\u2019t even step foot inside DoJ or Securities and Exchange Commission or Department of Defense buildings. And why would our hypothetical aeronautics company hire a blacklisted firm, if that meant risking losing its federal government contracts? The safe move for a rational, self-interested client is to tiptoe down the street to any of the dozens of elite law firms that have not (yet) incurred the president\u2019s wrath.\n\nTrump\u2019s retributive effort has left the targeted law firms with two stark options.\n\nFirst: surrender. Two of the firms selected by Trump, Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps, did the math and buckled. The (perhaps formerly) megaprestigious New York\u2013based legal practices cut deals with the president \u2014 \u201cessentially a settlement,\u201d in his words; \u201cessentially a shakedown,\u201d in mine. These arrangements are voluntary for the law firms in the same sense that the corner butcher voluntarily peels off five hundreds every Friday for the local capo\u2019s collector.\n\nPaul Weiss agreed, first, to do $40 million worth of pro bono legal work for various causes; Skadden Arps coughed up $100 million. Well, that\u2019s not so bad, right? We generally celebrate lawyers for donating their time to pro bono causes, after all. But the catch is that firms agreed to do that work for causes supported by the President. Want to represent a pro-choice abortion advocacy group? A climate change non-profit? A death row inmate challenging his conviction? Good luck getting approval from those government overseers. The problem here isn\u2019t with the causes themselves; it\u2019s that these private law firms will allow the President and his administration to dictate what causes and clients they can and cannot represent.\n\nThese firms are victims in a sense, but they\u2019re not helpless patsies. Paul Weiss in 2024 made over $2.6 billion in total revenues and \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 $7.5 million in profits per equity partner. Skadden Arps generated $3.2 billion in revenues, and $5.4 million in profits per equity partner. These are collectives of extraordinarily savvy lawyers who make their living navigating the corridors of power. And when faced with the President\u2019s wrath \u2013 and the loss of big-money clients \u2013 they chose to negotiate revenue-saving deals, at the expense of their independence and professional dignity.\n\nThe other option for the targeted firms is to do the same thing they do for a living, the same thing they thought they\u2019d be doing when they went to law school, years ago: Go to court and take a stand.\n\nThree firms have now challenged Trump\u2019s proclamations; all have achieved some measure of success. In all three cases, federal judges (including two George W. Bush appointees) have placed temporary holds on key aspects of Trump\u2019s targeting actions. One of the Bush-appointed judges called Trump\u2019s scheme \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\nTrump has picked countless legal fights during his first two months back in office, many aimed at expansion of his own power. He might ultimately prevail on some of those, especially in the conservative-leaning, pro-Executive Supreme Court. But he\u2019s going to get his clock cleaned on his lawyer-targeting initiative.\n\nFor starters, it\u2019s flagrantly unconstitutional. This is about more than a few posh law firms enduring a temporary reduction in revenue. It\u2019s about free speech and association. It\u2019s about due process and access to government. It\u2019s about the freedom of individuals and (yes) corporations to engage counsel of their choosing.\n\nThe courts will have none of it. Keep in mind that every judge is a lawyer \u2013 many came through the same type of big-law mega-firms now in the crosshairs \u2013 and they\u2019ll understand the threat posed by Trump\u2019s actions. This isn\u2019t about left-against-right or liberals-against-conservatives. This is about the integrity and functioning of the legal profession, writ large.\n\nUltimately from Trump\u2019s perspective, the targeting of law firms is about eliminating an especially potent source of resistance (lower-case \u201cr\u201d) to implementation of his agenda. It\u2019s clear now that Congress will do nothing to check the President\u2019s actions. Nor will there be any meaningful adverse investigation by our fully-neutered DOJ \u2013 led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has already shown herself to be completely in the bag for Trump \u2013 or from anywhere else in the Executive Branch. The only real pushback will come from the courts and the lawyers. And, as Trump recognizes, if he can incapacitate the lawyers, then he can wipe out one of the few remaining sources of meaningful opposition to his romp through American public (and private) life.\n\nNow those law firms in the president\u2019s crosshairs must decide: Do they cave in to save their own profits-per-partner, or do they stand up and fight?"

            "full_content": "Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like losers. So one has to wonder what he is thinking after Elon Musk, his biggest political donor, fell flat on his face in an attempt to prop up a MAGA-backed candidate in this week\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important not to overthink the results of an off-cycle election, Trump and Musk\u2019s embarrassing loss is a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nIt came at an unfortunate time, as Trump announced massive across-the-board tariffs that spooked Wall Street, leading to the biggest one-day loss since 2020. Two Florida Republicans also underperformed in special elections for House seats, raising concerns among Republicans about their narrow majority.\n\nBut Wisconsin was the clearest signal of the looming danger for Republicans.\n\nMusk overplayed his hand. The tech tycoon and his super PAC poured tens of millions of dollars into the race, but all that money could not stop the growing pushback against Trump\u2019s trail of destruction. Despite Musk\u2019s efforts, voters elected state Circuit Judge Susan Crawford to the state\u2019s Supreme Court, maintaining the court\u2019s 4-3 liberal majority.\n\nThe victory wasn\u2019t easy. Trump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris in Wisconsin by less than 1 point, making it the closest state race in the 2024 presidential election. Yet Crawford defeated Trump-endorsed Brad Schimel by 10 points.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election in Wisconsin is not the only sign that Republicans need to read the writing on the wall: Trump and Musk\u2019s DOGE tactics are toxic in the minds of voters. While GOP candidates won both special elections for two House seats in Florida, Democrats cut into the margin of victory in each race by double digits. By sticking with Trumpism and enabling an unelected billionaire, the Republican Party has exposed itself to a possible bloodbath during the 2026 midterms.\n\nI know a thing or two about winning tough races. I served as chairman of the Republican National Committee during the 2010 midterms, when a \u201cRepublican wave\u201d changed the power dynamics in Washington and state capitals across the country. But 2010 didn\u2019t start out that way. It came about because of a concerted effort to take advantage of an incumbent president\u2019s missteps.\n\nIf I were a state Republican chairman looking at Tuesday\u2019s election results, here\u2019s what I would be thinking: First, voters are already sick and tired of all the chaos Musk has unleashed across America. Trump will be left to clean up the mess that Musk leaves behind on every aisle. Voters will blame the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers who didn\u2019t stand up to Musk. The Republican Party needs to understand this reality.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing voters express their anger at town halls, and GOP leadership asking Republicans in Congress not to meet with their constituents doesn't help. Republican candidates are stuck with the Trump brand if they don\u2019t offer the electorate an alternative path.\n\nRepublicans in tight House races must differentiate themselves from Trump.\n\nThat brings us to my second point: Republicans in tight House races must differentiate themselves from Trump. They can only do that if they\u2019re more concerned about what their voters want instead of what Trump thinks of them. However, since Republicans seek Trump\u2019s endorsement to win primaries, it becomes nearly impossible for them to distance themselves from his damaging policies.\n\nIt will take individual candidates who are not afraid to draw stark contrasts between their vision for American families and whatever politics Trump is playing. If they are successful, it creates a lane for a new generation of GOP candidates to rise above Trump\u2019s stranglehold on the party.\n\nLastly, Democrats have a role to play if they get out of their own way. Republicans have been masterful at defining the Democratic Party. It\u2019s now time for Democrats to define exactly what this Republican Party is. Voters are just starting to process the chaos, the mixed messages, the damage to institutions and the growing sense of insecurity surrounding Trump\u2019s second term. This can\u2019t be a missed opportunity. Democrats must find a straightforward narrative and make it stick. Drive it home every single day and don\u2019t give an inch.\n\nThe key to success is keeping it simple and standing with voters heading into the midterms next year. GOP communications veteran Doug Heye warned Democrats not to overplay their hand. This week on MSNBC, he said, \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t need a wave. They just need a ripple, given how small the House majority is. Stay focused and say the smart things. Don\u2019t make overpredictions.\u201d\n\nThe path forward for the pro-democracy movement will be a balancing act. Tuesday\u2019s elections underscored the weaknesses inside the Republican Party and how that weakness shows up at the ballot box. It\u2019s now up to Democrats to exploit those weaknesses and return power to the American people.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch \u201cThe Weekend\u201d every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nMarkets around the world plunged on Thursday after President Trump imposed harsh across-the-board tariffs, igniting a probable global trade war. And if there were any hopes that Trump\u2019s tariffs were merely a negotiating tactic, the White House attempted to squash them. Amid the chaos, I spoke with Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities and a longtime prominent tech-sector analyst. Among other things, we discussed why Trump\u2019s tariff numbers are so nonsensical and why Wall Street has been caught off guard by a seemingly predictable development.\n\nIn a note to investors, you wrote that \u201cif a ninth-grader in high school presented this tariff chart to a teacher in a basic economics class, the teacher would laugh and say, \u2018Sit down and work on the assignment.\u2019\u201d Have you seen any credible defense of what\u2019s going on here?\n\n\ufeffThe calculations on tariffs are befuddling, insane, and absurd. It just takes away credibility on day one on what the actual numbers are, because this goes against every basic economic theory in the last hundred years. The view on Wall Street is that it\u2019s a laughable calculation at best.\n\nIn other words, the rules of the game from day one make no sense. How do negotiations start when you\u2019re going off of a number that makes no sense, at least on earth? I\u2019ve talked to executives around the world the last 24 hours, and everyone\u2019s saying the same thing. It\u2019s created such chaos and the numbers are so absurd that you have to assume it\u2019s just a negotiation point. Otherwise, it\u2019s an economic Armageddon, and it guarantees a recession, and there\u2019s really no debate about that.\n\nCould you briefly explain why these numbers are so laughable?\n\n\ufeffTariffs by definition are a charge that consumers or companies pay to sell into a country. The calculation the White House came up with on the tariff chart is based on the import-export imbalance that\u2019s converted into a tariff. Cambodia is never going to buy almost any goods from the U.S., but the U.S. will buy from Cambodia. That\u2019s why they have a ridiculous tariff, just like Vietnam. Those are not tariffs. It\u2019s the nature of global trade in modern-day society to convert an import-export trade deficit into a tariff percentage \u2014 again, if that were presented in high school, the teacher would laugh and tell you to sit down.\n\nIt actually does remind me of a famous scene from Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.\n\nNo, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s like. The average American doesn\u2019t fully comprehend how bad this category-five hurricane is going to be until they start to see it over the coming weeks and months at grocery stores, on Amazon, in electronic stores, and in anything they\u2019re buying on a daily basis. What I\u2019m trying to explain is that people want to believe, \u201cLet\u2019s make America better. Let\u2019s build in America.\u201d But that\u2019s so far from reality.\n\nIn my understanding, there are two extremely large barriers to that reality. One is the length of time it would take to bring manufacturing back to America in a serious way.\n\n\ufeffFour to five years to build a factory.\n\nBut the other one is very much related to this policy, which is uncertainty. How do companies even know what\u2019s going to be happening in a month? They certainly don\u2019t feel like things are stable enough to go, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going all in on America now,\u201d because this might change in three days.\n\n\ufeffAnd the problem is uncertainty almost guarantees negative GDP growth for Q2 and raises the odds of a recession to likely over 50 percent. And once the snowball starts going downhill, you can\u2019t just stop it. That\u2019s part of the problem \u2014 the numbers are so absurd, and the calculation is so head-scratching, that investors don\u2019t even know where to start. Look, I\u2019ve covered tech stocks for 25 years on Wall Street, seen everything from the dot-com bubble to the financial crisis to COVID and everything in between this. This one tops the list in terms of a self-inflicted economic Armageddon.\n\nLet\u2019s talk absolute best-case scenario here. This won\u2019t happen, but let\u2019s say these tariffs totally disappear in a few days. Even in that scenario, how much damage would be done, and how difficult would it be to repair that damage?\n\n\ufeffAlready there\u2019s damage with trade partners, friends of the U.S. and companies are in a tailspin, and it\u2019s created natural uncertainty. And I believe many companies are not going to give guidance on their conference calls for Q1 in late April, because right now they\u2019re playing darts blindfolded.\n\nThe impact on inflation is obviously not going to be good, but how bad do you see it getting?\n\n\ufeffThis is the biggest inflationary move a president\u2019s ever made. So to say that this is going to force the Fed to cut rates, you just made the biggest inflationary and uncertain move in modern-day history. It goes against the whole thesis that the Fed could cut. Now, they might have to cut if things get so bad, but inflation was coming down until this.\n\nAnd the Fed was already under the gun from Trump.\n\n\ufeffThe Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place. You just basically created a tariff torpedo that\u2019s going to result in massive inflation. There\u2019s no debate about it. There\u2019s one person that pays the tariff: the U.S. consumer. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a debate.\n\nYou\u2019ve been talking to a lot of executives. I assume that the mood is just panic right now?\n\n\ufeffIt\u2019s panic and anxiety, and they don\u2019t even know where to turn because you can\u2019t all of a sudden just change your supply-chain trading partners. And there\u2019s a lot of things you can\u2019t even get in the U.S. So what are you going to do, wait four years to build a factory?\n\nOne thing that has puzzled me is that Trump has been warning about doing this for months. And he\u2019s had these firm beliefs about tariffs since the \u201980s. In his first term, the tariffs weren\u2019t so dramatic, but now he\u2019s only surrounded by sycophants, not people like Gary Cohn. So could everyone be so shocked about this? The markets supposedly had it priced in, but it turns out they didn\u2019t.\n\nBut remember, this is worse than the worst-case scenario. No one ever thought in the nightmare of nightmare scenarios that he\u2019d come out with calculations out of a sci-fi movie. If it had come out as like-for-like, as reciprocal, that would be a starting point. When you come out with China at 68 percent, Taiwan at 64 percent \u2014 I mean, those numbers are wrong. And investors don\u2019t even know where to start. It would be like a house selling for $500,000 and you bid $2,000.\n\nSo in other words, it\u2019s somewhat defensible that the market didn\u2019t build this in, because it was so unimaginable.\n\n\ufeffReciprocal tariffs, baseline tariffs, hard-line stands \u2014 the market understood that. But the numbers, they\u2019re basically created out of thin air to build a narrative. That\u2019s the problem.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nBad things can happen when presidents seem to lose their grip on reality.\n\nAfter a day of stock market shocks and global recriminations, there are reasons to question whether President Donald Trump fully grasps the consequences of the tariff barrage that he used to fire up a global trade war.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday, in the aftermath of his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement the day before.\n\n\u201cIt was an operation like when a patient gets operated on and it\u2019s a big thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.\u201d\n\nAs chaos whipped across the planet and American seniors dreaded looking into depleted market-linked retirement savings accounts, Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWe\u2019re feeling good.\u201d He told Newsmax: \u201cLook, I frankly thought in some ways it could be worse in the markets because this is a big transition.\u201d\n\nTheir bravado followed the worst day on Wall Street in five years, where $2.5 trillion was wiped off the S&P index. This financial carnage was not caused by some act of God, like a pandemic, or natural disaster, terrorist attack or foreign crisis. It was the result of a conscious choice by a president making a gut check call.\n\nStocks took another tumble on Friday morning after China imposed 34% reciprocal tariffs on US imports in a move that will make it far harder for US manufacturers to profit from its vast market. Trump, however, suggested he\u2019d outwitted America\u2019s superpower rival.\n\n\u201cCHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!\u201d he posted on Truth Social.\n\nThere are growing signs of confusion about the White House\u2019s strategy, just weeks after Trump inherited an economy that was humming when President Joe Biden handed it over and stocks hit record highs.\n\nTrump suggested Thursday evening that his single-handed blitz against the global trading system was merely a bargaining position. \u201cTariffs give us great power to negotiate,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One as he left the growing crisis behind for one of his Florida resorts to host a tournament for the millionaire players on the Saudi-backed LIV rebel golf tour.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his son Eric Trump drive in a golf cart, after arriving on the ninth hole during previews for LIV Golf Miami at Trump National Doral Miami in Doral, Florida, on Thursday. Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images\n\nBut earlier, on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on CNN, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, vowed: \u201cThe president is not going to back off.\u201d And on Fox News, Trump\u2019s top trade adviser Peter Navarro insisted \u201cthis is not a negotiation.\u201d\n\nThe conflicting messages and sense of drift posed fundamental questions of whether a presidential inner circle that critics have long said is delusional about the impact of a tariff war also has the competence to navigate out of the crisis.\n\nThose questions were exacerbated by the sleight of hand that the president used to deliver tariffs that he said were reciprocal and matched those that were a dollar-for-dollar match but in fact were not. The rudimentary formula that was used to arrive at bewildering tariff rates deepened the sense of fury among US trading partners.\n\n\u201cThey know nothing,\u201d veteran Wall Street trader Peter Tuchman told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett.\n\n\u201cThe formula they used \u2026 it\u2019s like apples, oranges, a couple of cashews divided by 10 times four.\u201d He added: \u201cNone of it makes any sense and billions and trillions of dollars are being wiped out of the market on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\u201cIt was nothing but blood on the streets.\u201d\n\nThe Stellantis car factory in Toluca, Mexico, on Thursday. The company said it would pause production at some factories in Mexico, where it produces Dodge and Ram vehicles, and in Canada. Mario Vazquez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPrice hikes to come?\n\nFinancial experts predicted painful price hikes to consumer goods and a resurgence of inflation \u2014 just five months after Trump won reelection with a promise to cut the costs of food and housing that bedeviled the country for years.\n\nThe immediate impact of the tariff announcements was driven home when Stellantis, which produces Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, paused production at plants in Mexico and Canada. Some 900 US-based workers were temporarily laid off. They won\u2019t be the last if the president\u2019s action causes an economic downturn.\n\nThe enormous risk Trump is taking with the financial wellbeing of millions of people in the US and abroad is in tune with an early second term he\u2019s using to conduct the most extravagant power grabs that he was talked out of in his first.\n\nTrump is challenging the rule of law with his expansive claims of executive power, has unleashed Elon Musk to eviscerate the federal government \u2014 including health care programs that have saved millions of lives. Migrants are being swept up off the streets or even expelled to a vicious El Salvador jail, often in apparent denial of due process and in defiance of judges and the rule of law.\n\nThe circus that took over the White House between 2017 and 2021 is back in town.\n\nAlmost unbelievable revelations about top officials discussing air attacks on Yemen on a chatroom app were followed by zero accountability for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for posting operational intelligence. The drama provoked the same anxiety about the competence of Trump\u2019s national security team in a crisis as are now surrounding his economic brain trust.\n\nIn another stunning development, the White House fired multiple officials, including three National Security Council staffers after meeting Laura Loomer. The far-right activist who once branded 9/11 an inside job accused the officials of disloyalty to the president.\n\nTrump is causing havoc on his national security team while also upending decades of US foreign policy, as he has fractured confidence among America\u2019s western allies that he\u2019d defend them against Russia.\n\nNews on President Donald Trump's tariff's are seen displayed in New York's Times Square on Thursday. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s supporters back tariffs, at least for now\n\nA recurring trend of Trump\u2019s political career is that his most outlandish acts \u2014 from his criminal indictments to his most outrageous uses of presidential power \u2014 often unleash a hysterical reaction from critics.\n\nIn the eye of the storms of his own creation, the president draws political energy from the controversy and wrong foots his opponents. So, it\u2019s fair to ask whether Thursday\u2019s uproar is an overreaction. After all this is far from the first stocks sell-off in history.\n\nTop officials insist that the tariffs are a first step towards building an economy that protects American workers and rebuilds manufacturing desecrated by the loss of US factory jobs to low wage economies in Asia and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see is factories going to be built here,\u201d Lutnick told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown. \u201cWhy should US policy basically suggest that you can find the cheapest labor in the world with the worst labor conditions in the whole wide world, the worst pollution \u2026 no environmental rules at all, let\u2019s go build there because it\u2019s really cheap, and we will sell it to the great American economy?\u201d\n\nNo one can argue that the toll inflicted on former industrial heartlands is an unworthy issue for a president. And Trump is responding directly to the thwarted aspirations of millions of his voters who don\u2019t care that Wall Street traders took a hammering or that American allies who they regard as freeloaders are angry.\n\nAnd since China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization ended up bankrolling its spectacular rise, shouldn\u2019t someone be asking whether a trade policy that created a superpower enemy should be adjusted?\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters \u2014 in the democratic election that he won in 2024 \u2014 also voted for maximum disruption: He left no doubt that he\u2019d be unleashed in a second term, even if some of his advisers suggested during the campaign, as they have this week, that tariffs would just be used as a negotiating tool rather than a permanent high barrier.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with national security. The disapproving foreign policy elites who condemn Trump officials for lax cellphone use come from the same intellectual class that brought America the lost wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And whether it\u2019s fair or not, many citizens view the federal government as indifferent to their plight and ripe for Musk\u2019s chainsaw.\n\n\u201cTo anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on CNN Thursday, trying, and failing, to calm the coming stock market mayhem. \u201cThis is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term.\u201d\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell on Thursday. Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe acid test of Trump\u2019s popularity\n\nWall Street traders may no longer trust Trump, but it will take more than a stock market slump to shatter the rare bond that the president enjoys with his base.\n\nStill, if the markets crisis develops into a recession and if the temporary pain that administration officials say will pave the way to a new economic golden age turns out to be more permanent, Trump\u2019s support may face its steepest test. Coming days may establish whether the president and his supporters are willing to pay a significant economic or political price for the fruition of campaign trail vows.\n\nAnd ahead of midterm elections in November 2026, Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans may soon start to learn whether more moderate and independent voters who bought into Trump\u2019s vaunted dealmaking and business mystique and thought he could supercharge the economy will stick with his party when he\u2019s off the ballot.\n\n\u201cThe challenge these tariffs are going to present is that they are almost certainly going to raise the cost of living for Americans at least in the short-term,\u201d Republican pollster and strategist Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt.\n\n\u201cWhat Donald Trump is asking is for everybody to endure a little bit of short-term pain in exchange for some long-term benefit \u2014 in his view a healthy reordering of the global economy,\u201d she said. \u201cIn politics, because we have elections every two years for Congress \u2014 saying that this is going to be very good for you way down the road is a tough sell for a lot of voters.\u201d\n\nBut the administration \u2014 beyond unspecific warnings about short term disruption \u2014 still isn\u2019t conceding Americans will face price hikes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks to board Marine One on Thursday. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\u201cForeign nations who have to sell here are going to lower their prices and then the next thing they\u2019re going to do is continue to manipulate their currency, so our currency is going to get stronger,\u201d Navarro told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have more purchasing power for the imports. That\u2019s going to offset it.\u201d\n\nThese predictions could be a trap for the White House. Past presidents have irrevocably severed trust with the public when they insisted on a reality that voters could perceive was false. This includes Lyndon Johnson\u2019s insistence on expanding a war he was losing in Vietnam, George W. Bush\u2019s denial when victory in Iraq degenerated into an insurgency and Joe Biden\u2019s insistence that the chaotic exit from Afghanistan was a success.\n\nJudging by their remarks on Thursday, Trump and Vance risk going down a similar road even as their situation promises to get worse.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you have a terrible stock market experience, it\u2019s because a bank fails or there\u2019s a pandemic or there\u2019s a hurricane or some other country does something,\u201d former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CNN\u2019s Hunt.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have these kind of stock market responses in response to polices that the president of the United States is proud of. That is something that is entirely without precedent and it is extremely dangerous.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration has fired the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, the United States\u2019 powerful cyber intelligence bureau, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation, members of the Senate and House intelligence committees and two former officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe dismissal of Gen. Timothy Haugh, who also leads US Cyber Command \u2014 the military\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber unit \u2014 is a major shakeup of the US intelligence community which is navigating significant changes in the first two months of the Trump administration. Wendy Noble, Haugh\u2019s deputy at NSA, was also removed, according to the former officials and lawmakers.\n\nThe top Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committee, Sen. Mark Warner and Rep. Jim Himes, denounced the firing of Haugh, who served in the roles since February 2024, in statements on Thursday night.\n\nLt. Gen. William Hartman, an experienced military officer and the deputy of Cyber Command, is expected to serve as acting head of the command and NSA, the two former officials said.\n\nThe news of the dismissals comes as the White House also fired multiple staff members on the National Security Council on Thursday, after Laura Loomer, the far-right activist who once claimed 9/11 was an inside job, urged President Donald Trump during a Wednesday meeting to do so, arguing that they were disloyal.\n\nLoomer, who brought a list with roughly a dozen names of people she deemed insufficient in their support of Trump, also advocated for the firing of Haugh and Noble, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.\n\nDuring the meeting, Loomer told the president that Haugh specifically should be fired because he was handpicked by the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. Haugh was nominated in 2023, while Milley was serving, to head up the NSA and Cyber Command.\n\nIn a social media post overnight Loomer said, \u201cNSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired. As a Biden appointee, General Haugh had no place serving in the Trump admin given the fact that he was HAND PICKED by General Milley.\u201d She went on, \u201cThank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.\u201d\n\nLoomer did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on Haugh and Noble\u2019s dismissals, however, she told CNN on Thursday that it \u201cwas an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security.\u201d\n\nCyber Command and the NSA declined to comment. CNN has requested comment from the White House National Security Council.\n\nHaugh told his colleagues to support Trump\u2019s national security priorities in an emotional farewell note that touted the agency and command\u2019s successes in countering threats from China and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, the Command and Agency need your courage, commitment and sacrifice,\u201d Haugh wrote in a message to NSA and Cyber Command employees Friday that CNN reviewed. \u201cI ask you to support the President and keep after our Nation\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell issued a statement on Haugh\u2019s departure on Friday afternoon: \u201cThe Defense Department thanks General Timothy Haugh for his decades of service to our nation, culminating as U.S. Cyber Command Commander and National Security Agency Director. We wish him and his family well.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, called the move \u201cinsane\u201d and said he hasn\u2019t received an explanation for the decision in a strong reaction on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d Friday morning.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a moment where you would not want to destabilize the national security agency, and this is exactly what the president has done, without any explanation to any of us, except to listen to Laura Loomer. And you know this is just more again, just pure chaos instead of common sense,\u201d Gottheimer told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan.\n\nLast month, Haugh hosted billionaire Elon Musk, who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency, at the NSA and Cyber Command headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland.\n\nSome current and former defense officials say there is a growing culture of fear inside the officer ranks within the Defense Department, among officials who worry that they could be fired at any moment for conduct deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump.\n\nHaugh was not in the now-infamous group chat on the messaging app Signal, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top officials discussed a sensitive military operation targeting the Houthis in Yemen while unaware that a journalist was part of the group. At a House Intelligence Committee hearing last week where Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled about the Signal group chat debacle, Haugh testified that, in general, there are risks to using the app.\n\nNSA is one of the US government\u2019s most powerful and critical spy agencies. Its code breakers and computer operatives conduct intelligence operations all over the world that provide insights to the president and his top advisers. Cyber Command was established over a decade ago to combat growing foreign threats in cyberspace and has matured considerably in the years since.\n\nCyber Command has taken on a prominent role in defending US elections from foreign influence and interference, including by knocking a Russian troll farm offline in the 2018 election and defending against Iranian hackers in the 2020 election.\n\nRen\u00e9e Burton, a cybersecurity expert who spent more than two decades at NSA, called the news of Haugh and Noble\u2019s ouster \u201calarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cNSA\u2019s mission is vast and extremely complicated,\u201d Burton told CNN. \u201cGeneral Haugh and Ms. Noble have built the expertise and credibility it takes to oversee such a vital part of our national security. Replacing them will not be easy and the disruption will expose the country to new risk.\u201d\n\nIn an unprecedented purge of the military\u2019s senior leadership in February, Trump fired the top US general just moments before Hegseth fired the chief of the US Navy and the vice chief of the Air Force.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

The new duties he announced will take effect at the end of this week and next, likely thrusting the global economy into uncharted territory and putting Trump\u2019s economic acumen to the test.\n\nBut how much the president is willing to bend on his new tariffs was a question foreign leaders, Republican lawmakers and Wall Street investors were all asking as the tariff plan came into sharper focus.\n\nThe message from Trump\u2019s top advisers was one of resolute commitment to the heavy duties applied to all US trading partners, friend and foe alike. \u201cThe president is not going to back off,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown in an interview Thursday.\n\nBut the president himself suggested he was open for talks \u2014 if the terms were good enough.\n\n\u201cEvery country has called us. That\u2019s the beauty of what we do, we put ourselves in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as Lutnick stood behind him.\n\n\u201cIf we would have asked these countries to do us a favor, they would have said no,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cNow they will do anything for us.\u201d\n\nTrump and his team have offered sanguine proclamations against the dire economic warnings, suggesting days of red on Wall Street and price increases for American consumers are worth it if it meant Trump\u2019s big goals \u2014 the reorientation of the entire global economy and a resurgence of American manufacturing \u2014 are met down the road.\n\nBut even Republicans who said they supported Trump\u2019s attempts to realign global trade suggested they were watching for some kind of calibration by the administration.\n\n\u201cRight now we are all kind of waiting and seeing and seeing how the administration reacts and what the ultimate permanent policy may look like,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, suggesting the tariffs Trump announced from the Rose Garden a day earlier were not, in fact, the final word on the matter.\n\nAnd overseas, American diplomats were facing questions from governments who struggled to understand how the new tariff rates were calculated on their countries \u2014 or, in some cases, on uninhabited islands that export virtually nothing.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who left the Rose Garden announcement and headed directly to his airplane, was in Brussels, where the new tariffs hung over a meeting of NATO foreign ministers like a black cloud.\n\nMuted reaction on Capitol Hill\n\nAs markets shuttered and global leaders threatened retaliation, the president himself evinced little worry. He emerged from the White House midafternoon Thursday and predicted a quick turnaround in the markets.\n\n\u201cThe markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,\u201d Trump told reporters gathered on the White House South Lawn.\n\nTrump was heading to Florida, where he was scheduled to attend a golf tournament at his Doral club outside Miami before retreating to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. The tariff matter had consumed much of his time this week as the president determined how, precisely, to proceed with the tariffs he\u2019d spent the last six weeks promising.\n\nIn meetings with his trade team, Trump pushed advisers for a plan that couldn\u2019t be labeled soft or weak, mindful that some previous moves on tariffs had the appearance of backing down from his previous threats.\n\nHis team prepared stacks of analyses, reports and individual plans to apply new tariffs that could be described as \u201creciprocal,\u201d the term Trump has used to justify starting a global trade war.\n\nAfter debating various ideas \u2014 including a draft plan applying a 20% universal tariff on all imported goods and a tiered system that placed countries into bands of new tariff rates \u2014 by Tuesday the president and his team arrived at the tariff scheme he announced from the Rose Garden a day later.\n\nThe tariff rates assigned to each country \u2014 revealed on cardboard signs the president pointed to, with the numbers only visible to those in the front rows \u2014 initially prompted confusion. It was only later that it became clear they were not, in fact, dollar-for-dollar comparisons to countries\u2019 own tariffs but a different calculation altogether, using trade surplus numbers.\n\nThe announcement, which was attended by steel workers, pipe fitters, truck drivers and some Republican leaders, received a muted reception even from some of the president\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nThune, who hails from the agricultural state of South Dakota, said the short-term market reaction to Trump\u2019s tariffs proposal was not \u201cunexpected\u201d even as he cautioned there must be vigilance to make sure certain sectors of the economy aren\u2019t damaged by the long-term impacts of the tariffs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not unexpected. The markets expectedly were going to react. This is again a policy. It\u2019s a big policy change, bold policy change and I think it is going to take some time to determine what the ultimate impacts are going to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe wait-and-see approach was echoed by many Republicans in Congress who have argued Trump\u2019s team must be given some runway to see the impact of this massive economic policy.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me in two months,\u201d said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wait-and-see proposition.\u201d\n\nBoth South Dakota and Iowa are states with heavy agricultural interests that may have to now pay more to import Canadian fertilizer and find it more difficult to export their commodities. But despite their deep concerns about tariffs, Thune, Grassley and many other Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump\u2019s moves.\n\nQuestions overseas about the administration\u2019s willingness to negotiate\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff rollout stunned foreign diplomats in Washington, some of whom said they stayed up most of the night to analyze and answer questions from their capitals.\n\nSome Trump allies are giving diplomats clear advice: Tell their governments to stay out of it, three sources familiar with the conversations said. Instead, send their companies doing business with the US into White House meetings in order to prompt the administration to make a deal, the sources said.\n\nSome close to the president, however, suggested he would be flexible as leaders scramble to lower the tariff rates.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,\u201d the president\u2019s son Eric Trump wrote on X. \u201cThe first to negotiate will win - the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Donald Trump\u2019s claim that other countries \u201cwill do anything for us\u201d now wasn\u2019t immediately evident for Rubio in Brussels, where potentially difficult discussions with NATO allies were underway Thursday, every single one of which was slapped with tariffs.\n\nOfficials said the tariffs news was hanging over some of the conversations and meetings, meant to focus on more NATO-specific issues like defense spending and the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cObviously having this trade war going on makes it tough to do normal business,\u201d said a Western official who told CNN that \u201cit seems to be what most people are talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if they are talking about tariffs,\u201d the official continued, \u201cit means they aren\u2019t talking about the other priorities NATO needs to focus on.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, Rubio appeared to have been greeted warmly by the alliance\u2019s secretary general, Mark Rutte, and his NATO counterparts. As they gathered for a group photo, Rubio chatted easily with the others, warmly shaking hands and kissing Canada\u2019s Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on the cheeks.\n\nFinnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told CNN that the conversations have been \u201cvery constructive\u201d and \u201cvery positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tariffs aren\u2019t the best news,\u201d Valtonen said, \u201cbut I hope that this is an opening to a fruitful negotiation, especially between friends and allies, whereby we could reach a situation in which we effectively will let go of the existing trade barriers between us. Because that\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Alex Marquardt, Ted Barrett, Manu Raju and Kylie Atwood contributed to this story."
