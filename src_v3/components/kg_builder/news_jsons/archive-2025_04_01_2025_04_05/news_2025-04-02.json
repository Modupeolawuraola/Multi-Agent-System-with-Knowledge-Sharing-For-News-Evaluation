            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA public health association and one of the nation\u2019s largest worker unions are suing the Trump administration over the abrupt cancellation of hundreds of research grants, arguing that the moves were arbitrary and capricious and that the federal grant process is supposed to be above politics.\n\nThe complaint was filed Wednesday in a Massachusetts court by the American Public Health Association, the United Auto Workers, which also represents research scientists, and several scholars against the US Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nHHS and NIH said they do not comment on pending litigation.\n\nNIH grant cancellations have been extremely rare in previous administrations, and the new cancellations will end hundreds of research projects, many of which have been underway for years.\n\n\u201cPeople who are trying to wrestle with leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this country \u2013 indeed, around the world \u2013 are finding that their well-intentioned efforts, ratified for its quality by the NIH itself, has suddenly come under a microscope because it offends the sensibilities of a given political interest, and that\u2019s just exactly what the NIH process is supposed to be insulated against,\u201d said one of the plaintiffs, Dr. Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nNIH grants canceled\n\nLurie, a former associate commissioner at the US Food and Drug Administration, was an adviser and consultant on a project whose NIH grant was canceled after about nine months. The NIH said the grant was canceled because the project, which studied the effects of access to PrEP, medication that can prevent HIV infection, \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities.\u201d\n\nThe NIH has canceled hundreds of grants since President Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency began, and the agency said last week that it did so \u201cin accordance with the Presidential Memo \u2018Radical Transparency About Wasteful Spending.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe executive order says that the government spends too much money on \u201cprograms, contracts, and grants that do not promote the interests of the American people\u201d and directs all agency heads to let the public know the details of \u201cevery terminated program, cancelled contract, terminated grant, or any other discontinued obligation of Federal funds.\u201d\n\nMany of the canceled grants specifically touch on topics that Trump has directed agency heads to de-prioritize through executive orders on \u201cradical and wasteful government DEI programs\u201d and \u201cdefending women from gender ideology extremism.\u201d The latter memo declared that there are only two sexes and directed agencies to erase even any mention of and end any program that included people who identify as transgender.\n\nAmong the targets of the cancellations are projects on racial or gender differences and diseases that disproportionately affect minority communities, like HIV.\n\nGone is funding for a project to understand the connection between minority stress and intimate partner violence and another that looked at gender disparities in adolescent mental health. But other canceled grants were not specifically focused on minority communities; one given to Columbia University went toward research on the effectiveness of using wastewater to forecast the severity of Covid-19 outbreaks.\n\nMany of the projects were well under way.\n\n\u201cAll those billions of dollars of investment are wasted,\u201d said Lisa Mankofsky, one of the attorneys on the new lawsuit. She represents the Center for Science and the Public Interest, an organization that advocates for evidence-based and nutrition, food safety and health policies, but that group is not a plaintiff in the suit.\n\nThe cancellation of projects won\u2019t just hurt researchers, she said, it will halt treatments for patients and could even cost people their lives.\n\n\u201cThe topics that are covered under all of these terminations are some of the most pressing issues in public health: cancer, strokes, cardiac health, Alzheimer\u2019s, suicide prevention, Covid vaccine hesitancy, depression. I could go on and on because NIH\u2019s work is so widespread and so important, all those topics are covered,\u201d Mankofsky said.\n\nThe NIH is by far the biggest single funder of biomedical research in the world, and its backing is considered the gold standard of research support. Thousands of scientists compete for the funding every year. Grant decisions are made by leading scientific experts in the field at NIH who deliberate over the merit of the work for months.\n\nHHS regulations stipulate that there are only limited circumstances in which a grant can be canceled: for cause, such as when the grant fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or with the consent of the grantee.\n\n\u201cNone of those apply here,\u201d Mankofsky said.\n\nPolitics, Lurie said, is not supposed to factor into NIH decision-making.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be insulated from political interference.\n\nBut what is happening now, this is precisely what the process was designed to protect against,\u201d he said.\n\nThe complaint argues that the grant cancellations were an arbitrary and capricious act, exceeding statutory authority, and are void because they are vague \u2013 \u201cso vague that the recipients of the terminations can\u2019t know what is and what isn\u2019t prohibited,\u201d Mankofsky said.\n\nThe complaint also argues that Congress is given exclusive power over spending and lawmaking and that by deciding to pull funding, the executive branch is repealing congressional statues unilaterally.\n\nPulling minority-focused grants directly contradicts a directive of Congress, Mankofsky said.\n\nWith the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000, Congress directed the NIH to conduct and support research with respect to minority health conditions and other populations with health disparities and to give priority to this kind of research.\n\nPart of a wave of lawsuits\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a wave of litigation against the Trump administration. There have been more than 100 lawsuits filed against the administration\u2019s executive actions in the first months of Trump\u2019s second presidency.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic attorneys general and governors in 23 states and Washington, DC, filed a lawsuit against HHS arguing that the department\u2019s sudden rollback of $12 billion in public health funding was unlawful and harmful.\n\nIn March, faculty and national labor unions sued the Trump administration for cutting off $400 million in federal funds for public health research at Columbia University, arguing that these decisions are compelling speech restrictions on campus. The administration said it acted because of what it said was the school\u2019s failure to end antisemitism on a campus that has seen multiple high-profile pro-Palestinian demonstrations in the wake of the war in Gaza.\n\nIn February, multiple academic institutions sued HHS and the NIH for capping the amount of reimbursements available in medical research grants, arguing that such a policy exceeds the NIH\u2019s authority. In March, a judge issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the implementation of NIH plans to slash research overhead payments. In a separate suit, several nonprofits also sued HHS and the NIH over the issue.\n\nLurie hopes the latest lawsuit will force the Trump administration to continue to fund important public health projects.\n\n\u201cReally, the main thing for people to understand is that this is a fundamental attack on a disfavored group,\u201d he said, \u201cbut its implications go beyond even that to include the very edifice of the scientific enterprise itself.\u201d\n\nThe NIH is the \u201cbeacon on the hill,\u201d he said, where the most prestigious research is conducted and funded.\n\n\u201cTo have it undermined in this way is really to give ourselves a black eye to ourselves as a country,\u201d Lurie said."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a series of false claims about tariffs and trade \u2013 most of which he has made before \u2013 in the Wednesday speech in which he announced a sweeping set of global tariffs.\n\nHere is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nCanada\u2019s dairy tariffs\n\nTrump correctly noted that Canada has tariffs exceeding 250% on some US dairy products. However, he falsely claimed that merely \u201cthe first little carton of milk\u201d exported to Canada faces a \u201cvery low price,\u201d but \u201cthen it gets up to 275, 300%.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Canada has guaranteed that tens of thousands of metric tons of imported US milk per year, not merely a single carton, will face zero tariffs at all; Canada conceded a certain guaranteed level of tariff-free US access to its dairy market as part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump\u2019s own first administration negotiated.\n\nTrump also didn\u2019t mention something the US dairy industry acknowledges: The US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum level of exports to Canada in any category of dairy product, so the Canadian tariffs aren\u2019t being applied; with regard to milk in particular, the US isn\u2019t even at half of the tariff-free quota. (There is a vigorous US-Canada debate about why the US is so far from the maximum, with each country blaming the other. Regardless of who\u2019s right, the tariffs aren\u2019t hitting US milk.)\n\nTrump has persistently omitted key facts about Canada\u2019s dairy tariffs. You can read more here from a previous CNN fact check.\n\nUS trade deficit with Canada\n\nTrump, claiming \u201cwe subsidize a lot of countries,\u201d falsely said \u201cit\u2019s close to $200 billion a year\u201d with Canada. Trump has repeatedly used this $200 billion figure to describe the US trade deficit with Canada in particular, which is actually far lower than $200 billion; official US statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion and $70.6 billion in goods trade alone.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t mention the trade deficit in particular this time, but even if he was intending to use the word \u201csubsidize\u201d more broadly, there is no basis for the claim.\n\nWho pays tariffs\n\nTrump repeated his frequent false claim that, because of the tariffs he imposed on China during his first term, the US \u201ctook in hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d that \u201cthey paid.\u201d In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on China; it\u2019s easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\n\nPrevious presidents\u2019 tariffs on China\n\nTrump also repeated his frequent false claim that, before his first presidency, China \u201cnever paid 10 cents to any other president\u201d from tariffs. Aside from the fact that US importers make the tariff payments, the US was actually generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since 1789. Trump\u2019s predecessor, President Barack Obama, imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nUS wealth\n\nTouting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump claimed that \u201cthe United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been\u201d from 1789 to 1913, when tariffs made up a higher percentage of federal revenue before the passage of a 1913 law reestablishing the federal income tax.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t explain what he meant by \u201cproportionately the wealthiest,\u201d but by standard measures, the US is far wealthier today than it was in the early 20th century and prior. Per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.\n\nDouglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economics professor who studies the history of US trade policy, said in February after Trump had made similar claims, that if Trump\u2019s unclear comments are interpreted to be about per capita income, as \u201ceconomists usually take this,\u201d it is \u201cobviously not true,\u201d since \u201creal per capita income and standards of living are so much higher today than the past. \u2026 It is nice to have indoor plumbing, running water, not outhouses, etc.\u201d\n\nIrwin noted then that it\u2019s possible Trump had been referring to how the federal government after the Civil War \u201cran consistent budget surpluses and almost paid off the national debt,\u201d since \u201che seems to view the government taking in more money than it is spending as making the country rich.\u201d Irwin added, though, that \u201cbig fiscal surpluses don\u2019t make a country rich, per se.\u201d\n\nInflation under Biden and Trump\n\nTrump falsely claimed that, during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, the US had \u201cthe highest\u201d inflation \u201cin the history of our country.\u201d Trump could have fairly said that the year-over-year US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920. (And the rate then plummeted. Inflation in the last full month of the Biden administration, December 2024, was 2.9%; it was 3% in January 2025, a month partly under Biden and partly under Trump.)\n\nTrump also claimed that there was \u201cvirtually no inflation\u201d during his first presidency. He gave himself some wiggle room with the word \u201cvirtually,\u201d but it\u2019s worth noting that there was inflation during his first four years in office; prices rose about 8% from the beginning of that presidency to the end. Year-over-year inflation was 1.4% in the month he left office, January 2021.\n\nGas prices\n\nTrump, claiming he has brought prices \u201cway down\u201d since taking office again in late January, said that \u201cgasoline is way under $3.\u201d That is true in some parts of the country, but the national average for regular gasoline on the day he spoke was about $3.24 per gallon, according to data published by AAA \u2013 higher than on Trump\u2019s inauguration day, when the AAA national average was about $3.12.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Trump is responsible for the increase; presidents have a limited impact on gas prices, and there was a larger increase over the equivalent period last year. But the national average has not fallen during this presidency to date.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

Plus, Andrea Mitchell previews Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s trip to NATO headquarters.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f We want to hear from you!\n\nHave a question for the NBC News Politics Desk about this week\u2019s elections, Trump\u2019s latest tariff announcement or anything else happening in Washington?\n\nSend your questions to politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com and we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter.\n\nTrump ramps up his trade war\n\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled expansive tariffs on the United States\u2019 largest trading partners as he pledged to embark on the biggest reorganization of the global economy since World War II, Rob Wile reports.\n\nImporters seeking to bring goods into the U.S. from other countries will now face tariffs as high as 54% based on how the White House is calculating duties on U.S. exports, as well as \u201cnonmonetary\u201d trade barriers based on countries\u2019 doing things like manipulating their currencies or serving as \u201cpollution havens.\u201d\n\nThe result was a list of tariffs that are set to impose major duties on billions \u2014 if not trillions \u2014 of dollars in trade. China, one of the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, would be hit with a 54% tariff, the European Union with 20%, India with 26% and Japan with 24%, among many others.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how Trump or the White House had calculated those numbers; a handout listing the tariffs said it included \u201ccurrency manipulation and trade barriers.\u201d\n\nU.S. stock markets sharply reversed earlier gains as Trump made his remarks. In after-hours trading, S&P 500 futures fell 1.5%.\n\nAmerica has been \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered,\u201d Trump said in announcing the latest iteration of his tariff regime set to begin this week. He said from the White House Rose Garden that American industry \u201cwill be reborn\u201d and touted a new \u201cgolden age of America.\u201d\n\nThe context: The announcement is an effort to impose sweeping changes on decades-old trading arrangements under which the United States increasingly outsource some labor-intensive manufacturing to foreign countries in return for cheaper goods \u2014 at the cost, critics have said, of America\u2019s industrial base.\n\nThe tariffs are expected to take a toll on many companies whose products rely on global supply chains, which could be forced to raise prices or endure thinner profit margins. The White House and its surrogates have tried to communicate a message of patience and endurance, warning that some pain will be ahead but that the trade-off would be worthwhile eventually.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how that will play with the American public, especially after Trump came into office with promises of stable or even lower prices after an inflation-heavy recovery under President Joe Biden following the vast economic disruptions of the pandemic.\n\nZooming out on the stock market: Rob also notes that after an initial burst in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory in November, stocks have shifted downward as investors began to digest that Trump was planning to make good on significantly increasing trade duties.\n\nHow Congress is responding: Four Senate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine; Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 are expected to vote for a Democratic resolution to block Trump\u2019s Canadian tariffs, Frank Thorp V, Scott Wong and Sahil Kapur report.\n\nIf all 47 Senate Democrats also support it, the measure would have enough votes to pass through the upper chamber, though it wouldn\u2019t go anywhere in the House. Trump called out those four GOP senators by name on Truth Social.\n\nFollow live tariffs coverage \u2192\n\nRepublicans aren\u2019t panicking about Trump or Elon Musk after Tuesday\u2019s elections\n\nBy Bridget Bowman and Adam Edelman\n\nRepublicans say they\u2019re not panicking as they gear up for major races this year and a fierce battle for control of Congress next year, despite getting shellacked in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race \u2014 and seeing their margins decrease notably in a pair of House special election wins in deep-red Florida districts.\n\nDemocrats have largely cast the 10-point win by the liberal candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race Tuesday as a rejection by voters of Elon Musk, the billionaire White House adviser who took on a starring role in the campaign. And while the two wins by GOP candidates in Florida gave the party some breathing room with its narrow House majority, the sizes of their victories paled in comparison which what Republicans enjoyed in those districts five months ago.\n\nRepublicans, however, downplayed the results as expected outcomes \u2014 criticizing some of the GOP candidates, discounting the prospect of any broader fallout from the heavy-handed role Musk played in Wisconsin and suggesting that their candidates do a better job doubling down on explaining to voters Trump\u2019s accomplishments, including divisive ones like his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nDemocrats found some early success demonizing Musk in the Wisconsin race and believe they can expand that strategy. But while Musk will \u201ccontinue to be active\u201d in GOP campaigns, his prominent role in the party may be about to change: Trump told members of his Cabinet on March 24, more than a week before Tuesday\u2019s elections, that Musk would leave his government role in the coming months.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nSteve Kornacki: How Democratic voter intensity powered Susan Crawford to a win in Wisconsin\n\nRubio prepares to confront an anxious NATO\n\nAnalysis by Andrea Mitchell\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio arrives at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday morning for the first time since he became the country\u2019s top diplomat. He will find European leaders who are increasingly anxious about continued support from the military alliance\u2019s most dominant member and resentful of the Trump White House.\n\nSeveral episodes in recent weeks underscore the challenges Rubio will face. Vice President JD Vance\u2019s and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s recent criticisms revealed in a leaked Signal chat immediately reverberated around European capitals. Western diplomats have told me they are further aggrieved by what they see as Trump and Vance\u2019s ambush of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month in the Oval Office. And there are concerns over the recent negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, notably including the latest U.S. draft of an agreement that would require Ukraine to sign over not only its minerals but also its oil and gas rights to a Delaware-based fund that the United States would control \u2014 limiting Ukraine\u2019s access to other financing for reconstruction after the war.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister will be in Brussels meeting with NATO ministers and the secretary general but is not scheduled to meet with Rubio as negotiations with the United States are on hold pending an anticipated call Trump has said he will soon have with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhile the U.S. goal at NATO is to further press allies to contribute more to mutual defense, European ministers are focusing on how to go it alone without the United States if necessary by creating a European security force for Ukraine. Poland and Germany have suggested trying to obtain nuclear weapons should Trump withdraw from NATO entirely.\n\nThose tensions will only be exacerbated by Trump\u2019s new tariffs. And then there\u2019s Canada\u2019s furor over Trump\u2019s insistence that it become America\u2019s 51st state, even though that will never happen.\n\nFinally, in the category of \u201cmanifest destiny,\u201d Trump refused to rule out taking Greenland \u2014 a territory owned by Denmark, a NATO ally \u2014 by force in his comments to Kristen Welker last Sunday.\n\nWelcome to NATO headquarters, Mr. Secretary.

And its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it\u2019s not going to happen anymore. It\u2019s not going to happen. In a few moments, I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal \u2014 that means they do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple, can\u2019t get any simpler than that.\n\nApplause erupted in the Rose Garden before Trump said, \u201cThis is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It\u2019s our Declaration of Economic Independence.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now, it\u2019s our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt and it will all happen very quickly. With today\u2019s action, we are finally going to be able to Make America Great Again \u2014 greater than ever before.\n\nA chart displayed by Trump at his podium and posted by his rapid response team on X revealed the breakdown of tariffs:\n\nThe tariffs start with a baseline of 10 percent for all nations, but several received higher, based on half the amount they charge the United States.\n\nChina\u2019s 67-percent tariff on the United States is being met with a 34-percent tariff in response, and the E.U.\u2019s 39-percent tariff is being met with a 20-percent tariff.\n\nTrump added that a 25-percent tariff on \u201call foreign-made automobiles\u201d will go into effect at midnight.\n\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, D.C.

            "full_content": "Photo: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMy initial reaction to the news that Cory Booker was going to hold the Senate floor for many hours to dramatize his opposition to Trump 2.0 was a bit despairing: Having demonstrated that they no longer have any leverage over the administration and its supine congressional allies, Senate Democrats would now just talk as long as they could, as the chamber\u2019s rules allowed. It wouldn\u2019t change anything, but what was the harm?\n\nBut now that Democrats everywhere are greeting Booker\u2019s historic non-filibuster filibuster with joy, I realize there was a practical benefit to his feat of endurance beyond consigning Strom Thurmond\u2019s 1957 speaking record to the dustbin of history, where it belongs next to the segregationist cause it served. After months of strenuous efforts by Democrats to identify a precise silver-bullet argument against Trump\u2019s agenda and how it was being pursued, Booker showed pretty unmistakably that a general indictment of the administration and its enablers, delivered with passionate intensity, is actually what alarmed Americans are craving.\n\nBooker didn\u2019t concentrate on Trump\u2019s potential Medicaid cuts, illegal deportations, cruelty to public employees, abandonment of Ukraine, violations of civil liberties, reckless tariffs, usurpations of legislative powers, rampant corruption, or thuggish threats to federal judges. He talked about all this and more as a way to dramatize the ongoing assault on both democracy and the well-being of poor and middle-class Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s the sheer avalanche of bad policies, bad administration, and bad faith that makes the current situation such an emergency. And forgetting about that in order to identify some single poll-tested nugget of messaging has been a mistake all along. Among other things, the coolly analytical approach of sorting and weighing Trump outrages robs such criticism of the moral outrage circumstances merit. Booker wasn\u2019t just appealing to a rhetorical tradition in treating today\u2019s challenges as a \u201cmoral moment\u201d requiring the \u201cgood trouble\u201d exhibited by the civil-rights movement. He was calling attention to the fact that the MAGA movement truly has mounted a sustained, comprehensive assault on decades of slow but steady progress toward a wide array of worthy goals involving the health, wealth, liberty, and happiness of the American people, all in pursuit of a hallucinatory, often destructive vision of \u201cAmerican greatness.\u201d\n\nNone of this means other Democrats should emulate Booker by seizing the nearest megaphone and talking for many hours. But it does mean a broad coalition of resistance to Trump 2.0 may require an equally broad message about what\u2019s going on in this country and why it\u2019s urgent to push back. Calling to mind the wide variety of outrages underway could also help Democrats develop a broad, credible agenda for what they intend to do if and when they return to power. Every day, it\u2019s becoming more obvious that just returning to the federal policies and personnel in place on January 19, 2025, won\u2019t be advisable or even possible. Rebuilding an effective set of public institutions and domestic and international relationships will involve the work of many hands, and many words of inspiration from leaders like Cory Booker."

            "full_content": "This is what you\u2019d get if Bruce Wayne decided to become the Joker rather than Batman. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe most tiresome intra-Democratic debate of them all soon reached crisis levels after Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 election victory. Should the \u201cparty of the people\u201d focus on the threat to democratic institutions MAGA authoritarians most definitely pose? Or should they instead pursue lost non-college-educated voters via the ancient \u201cpopulist\u201d formula of class warfare over purely economic issues? The debate has often become very personal, with \u201cpopulists\u201d tending to dismiss arguments about democracy as elitist mumbo jumbo unintelligible to working stiffs who just want to see the money, and people frightened about fascism worrying that Americans will cheerfully sell out our heritage of liberty for $2 a gallon gas.\n\nFortunately, and just in the nick of time, a figure has emerged at the highest levels of government who can instantly unite \u201cpopulists\u201d and \u201cdefenders of democracy.\u201d That would be Elon Musk, who is simultaneously the richest man on earth (and in modern history) and an even greater threat to democratic institutions than Trump. He is, moreover, via the DOGE initiative, waging aggressive war on public-sector programs that restrain his tiny class of corporate predators and benefit the general public while violating every constitutional norm imaginable. And suffusing this entire assault on the people and the institutions to which Democrats should feel loyalty is a nihilistic personality exhibiting some of the worst impulses of the human race: narcissism, messianism, ethnocentrism, worship of power and technology, and a testosterone-poisoned lust for combat and destruction. It\u2019s as though Bruce Wayne had decided to become the Joker instead of Batman.\n\nTerrifying as Musk is, Democrats should thank their lucky stars that he doesn\u2019t simply operate in the background of the MAGA movement, financing Trump\u2019s antics but otherwise remaining anonymous. No: He has insisted on a very public place on the stages of politics, commerce, and culture, rivaled only by his benefactor and enabler in the White House. And the more people see of him, the less they seem to like him.\n\nThis week\u2019s judicial election in Wisconsin shows what happens when this peculiar man makes himself the center of attention in a popularity contest not limited to his sycophants on X. The most polarized electorate in the entire nation fed by the most expensive campaign ever to revolve around judges decided by a healthy margin that they did not want Elon Musk in charge of their destiny (much less the \u201cdestiny of humanity\u201d he so fatuously claimed was at stake). And better yet, the dispirited ranks of Democrats turned out disproportionately at the polls in the first electoral test since last November\u2019s disaster.\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that so long as Musk is the most powerful figure in the administration and the living symbol of Trump 2.0, Democrats should make Musk-bashing even more of a daily preoccupation than it has already become. Populists can draw fresh attention to the very real class implications of DOGE\u2019s assault on corporate regulation and on practical services like Social Security offices accessible to old folks and medical facilities that can keep middle-class people alive. Defenders of democratic institutions can continue to expose (and attack in courts) the arrogant pretense that self-appointed engineers who brag about their destructive intentions should be entrusted with \u201creforming\u201d government. And everyone can keep exposing the deeply sinister tech-bro worldview Musk and his accomplices exemplify, aimed at converting the United States of America into a privately held corporate oligarchy governed by insanely wealthy elites deploying AI at will and treating life itself as a video game in which the losers are the rest of us.\n\nObviously, Musk-bashing won\u2019t solve all the problems facing Democrats. They still need to regain public trust about their own values and competence. For one thing, DOGE\u2019s very existence remains a terrible indictment of the contempt for government that is now so epidemic, and that Democrats have for so long either ignored or tried to buy off with popular benefits; they need their own credible \u201cgovernment reform\u201d agenda and the determination to carry it out.\n\nBut make no mistake: Elon Musk is a political gift, particularly if his ego and Trump\u2019s reliance on his support mean he will insist on keeping himself front and center, showing up at Cabinet meetings and MAGA rallies alike while indulging his endless glossolalia on X. So long as he remains the face of Trump 2.0, Democrats would be wise to make sure that face is the first thing Americans think of when they survey the political landscape. If Musk and DOGE crash or are subdued by the jealous god in the Oval Office (as some reports suggest Trump has signaled may happen), that is a very good thing in itself and a worthy goal for the opposition. The day Musk goes back to his businesses will be a red-letter day for both populists and defenders of democracy."

            "full_content": "Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nRepublicans have a message for all the Elon Musk haters out there: He isn\u2019t going away.\n\nThat\u2019s even after Musk put himself center stage in Wisconsin and poured $25 million into the race for a supreme-court seat only to see his preferred candidate lose by nine points to Democratic-backed candidate, and after a pair of special congressional elections in Florida revealed a worsening national political environment for the GOP. \u201cThis is one of the moments when we separate the men from the boys,\u201d says one longtime adviser to President Donald Trump. \u201cThese are battles worth fighting. And anybody that wants to go against Elon or the president is going to reveal what side of the line they are on.\u201d\n\nThe result of Tuesday\u2019s elections left Democrats crowing about what an increasing drag Musk is on Republican fortunes, especially after a series of polls over the past several weeks showed how precisely unpopular Musk and his DOGE initiative to reduce the size of government are. A survey by the Democratic polling outfit Blueprint earlier this month showed Musk\u2019s favorability is 16 points underwater, ten points worse than Trump\u2019s, as voters fret that he will move to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\u201cElon Musk turned what should have been a pretty run-of-the-mill judicial election into a referendum on him and he is the least popular thing in the Republican Party right now,\u201d says Evan Roth Smith, Blueprint\u2019s lead pollster, who pointed out that even 20 percent of voters who approve of the job Trump is doing also disapprove of the job Musk is doing.\n\n\u201cHis favorability is dropping at the rate of around five points every two weeks,\u201d Roth Smith says. \u201cIt is not sustainable. He is a drag on the national party, he is a drag on the White House, and now somehow he has made himself a drag on state and local candidates and at some point the Republicans are going to have to ask themselves some serious questions about how willing they are to tie themselves to the rock of Elon Musk and let themselves sink to the bottom of the ocean.\u201d\n\nDespite that, Republicans say this amounts to a Democratic psyop to cashier him and it won\u2019t work. Musk is the richest person in the world and he is willing to spend that money to get Republicans elected. Republicans have struggled in off-year elections for a decade now, their thinking goes, especially when Trump is in the White House. For all of the attention on Musk this year, Crawford ran only one point ahead of Janet Protasiewicz, the 2023 Democratic-backed candidate for a judgeship in Wisconsin in a race that also attracted a torrent of national attention. And while in Florida, Democrat Josh Weil ran roughly 16 points ahead of Kamala Harris in a race that attracted over $10 million in Democratic, mostly small-dollar donations, he still lost the deep-red district to Trump-backed Randy Fine. His performance was not as strong as that of Democrat Gay Valimont, who ran roughly 23 points ahead of Harris in a nearby, even deeper-red district in a race that attracted far less interest from the media or out-of-district partisans.\n\nThe lesson for Republicans is that the more attention they can bring to these off-cycle elections, the better they do, and no one besides Trump is better at getting attention than Musk. The billionaire admitted that his stunt of giving away $1 million checks to voters who sign his PAC\u2019s petitions \u2014 a stunt of questionable legality, it should be noted \u2014 was because \u201cwe need to get attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt causes the legacy media to, like, kind of lose their minds, and then they\u2019ll run it on every news channel,\u201d Musk said at a Sunday-night town hall in Wisconsin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, I couldn\u2019t pay them to, it would cost, like, ten times more \u2026 to get the kind of coverage that we get.\u201d\n\nMusk, who only took a late interest in the race, grew to be so invested that he called it existential, telling a rally crowd that the previously sleepy affair could determine who controls the House after the latest round of redistricting, \u201cwhich then steers the course of western civilization,\u201d adding that \u201cI feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it\u2019s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.\u201d\n\nIt was a Trumpian raising of the stakes, only without Donald Trump, who only committed to a tele-town hall in the race, but otherwise mostly steered clear of what looked like a likely Republican defeat.\n\nTrump recently told his inner circle that Musk would soon be stepping away from his White House role. Musk\u2019s status as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d only allows him to work as the de facto head of DOGE for 130 days, which means he and the cost-cutting outfit he runs will likely only last until the end of May. He may step away from the government, but not, Republicans hope, from the greater cause of electing more Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe have one big problem, which is that when Donald Trump is on the ballot our voters come out to fucking vote, and when he is not, they don\u2019t,\u201d says another Republican strategist close to Trump. \u201cSo how do we solve that problem? We let Elon Musk be our sugar daddy and get our voters out.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Disgraced reality show star Alec Baldwin watched Ken Burns\u2019 epic documentary The Civil War and concluded America is \u201cin a pre-Civil War culture now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cawful that this country had to go through that, awful,\u201d he said referring to the Civil War. \u201cI look at the politics of it, of where people are in this country today, in the division and how they\u2019re holding fast, and no one\u2019s going to falter, no one\u2019s going to break or compromise. And it\u2019s bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think in terms of that,\u201d he added, \u201cin order for us to get anywhere, it doesn\u2019t seem likely right now. And watching this show really reminded me of how we are in a very similar state now, in a pre-Civil War culture, in a pre-Civil War environment. It\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d\n\nHay, it is good to know Baldwin\u2019s wife gave him permission to speak, or maybe she was out in the backyard barefoot making homemade tortillas in a sombrero.\n\nWhat is Baldwin talking about \u2014 Civil War? We just had a national election with a clear winner who was handed a clear mandate from a majority of the American people. The only people committing violence over this are those among the lunatic left who are on the wrong side of 80/20 issues like auditing the government, deporting gang members and terrorists, mutilating kids to appease the trans loons, and keeping men out of women\u2019s sports.\n\nOther than those wackos, the number of people who say the country is on the right track has hit 20-year highs. President Trump\u2019s approval rating sits at a healthy 50 percent, and there\u2019s an overall feeling that the uptight Woke Terror is ending, so we can all have fun again.\n\nNothing happening today resembles the Bloody Kansas mentality of the Civil War. If anything, we are back in the late 60s and early 70s of the Weather Underground, where spoiled, crybaby, entitled leftists can\u2019t handle not getting their way so they resort to violence.\n\nBaldwin might be so frustrated over Trump\u2019s triumphant reelection that he\u2019s ready for violence, for a Civil War. And I can understand why. Like a lot of insulated celebrities, he thought his \u201cart\u201d (e.g. his terrible Trump impression on Saturday Night Live) would be the end of Trump\u2019s political career. That kind of failure, coupled with his wife\u2019s public emasculation of him, must make Baldwin feel like an incel with no power who is eager to lash out.\n\nThe biggest difference between the actual Civil War and today is this\u2026 Back then, half the country felt that the federal government was over-stepping its bounds when it came to telling the individual states what to do. Back then, people did not consider themselves Americans. They saw themselves as citizens of their respective states; as Virginians, Texans, and Tennesseans. Very few Southerners owned slaves. It wasn\u2019t so much about that as it was Mind your own business.\n\nTrump is the exact opposite. No one can claim he\u2019s encroaching on anyone\u2019s freedom. Rather, he\u2019s looking to decrease the power of the federal government and return local authority to the states when it comes to education and natural resources.\n\nMaybe in their warped minds, today\u2019s Democrats are as angry as Civil War-era Democrats. If you think about it, back then, Democrats were furious over Lincoln taking away their slaves. Today, thanks to Trump\u2019s mass deportations, Democrats (like Alec Baldwin) are losing something very similar: all that cheap labor they could exploit and bully.\n\nJust thinking out loud here.\n\nJohn Nolte\u2019s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook."

            "full_content": "Summary The Supreme Court unanimously backed FDA denials of flavored vaping products in a setback for the industry.\n\nAt issue were a series of FDA denials during the first year of the Biden administration for vaping products that officials said are geared toward minors.\n\nPublic health groups praised the ruling as a victory for protecting youth from nicotine addiction.\n\nThe case returns to an appeals court to reconsider a dispute about marketing plans.\n\nVaping companies can reapply for approval, potentially finding favor with President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday backed a series of decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration to deny market access for flavored vaping products in a rare win for government regulators that may limit access to those products across the nation.\n\nThough a partial win for the FDA, it remains uncertain whether President Donald Trump\u2019s administration will shift gears and free up access to the products. During the campaign, Trump vowed to \u201csave vaping.\u201d The vaping companies are also entitled to reapply to the FDA for approval of their products. Meanwhile, the justices sent the case back to an appeals court for further review.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.\n\nAt issue were a series of FDA denials during the first year of the Biden administration for vaping products that officials said are geared toward minors with flavors like \u201cPink Lemonade,\u201d \u201cRainbow Road\u201d and \u201cJimmy the Juice Man Peachy Strawberry.\u201d The vaping companies claimed that the FDA had changed the requirements for approval as it was assessing the applications to market the products.\n\nThe companies \u201cexpress frustration about the lack of clear prior notice regarding the type of scientific evidence that was essential for approval of an application,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cBut we cannot agree with their argument that the FDA went back on any commitments made in the guidance it provided before ruling on respondents\u2019 applications.\u201d\n\nPublic health groups praised the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, calling the decision a significant win for American youth and asserting it should embolden the FDA to continue to police the products closely.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a major victory for the health of America\u2019s kids and efforts to protect them from the flavored e-cigarettes that have fueled a youth nicotine addiction crisis,\u201d said Yolonda Richardson, president and CEO of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cIt affirms that the FDA\u2019s marketing denials for flavored e-cigarettes have been legally and scientifically sound and should encourage FDA to stay the course.\u201d\n\nThe vaping industry says its nicotine-delivering products help Americans transition off cigarettes and that the dessert-themed flavors are attractive to adults.\n\nEric Heyer, who represented the vaping industry at the high court, said he was \u201cobviously disappointed\u201d in the decision but that the companies \u201ccontinue to believe in the great harm reduction potential of their products for cigarette smokers.\u201d\n\n\ufeffHeyer said the companies would continue to fight the FDA in the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nPublic health advocates have been warning for years about a spike in vaping among young Americans. The FDA reports that 19% of high school students and 4.7% of middle school students vaped in 2020 \u2013 a far higher share than students who smoked.\n\nRecognizing the harm caused by youth smoking, Congress passed a law in 2009 giving the FDA new powers to regulate tobacco products. In 2016, the FDA decided that e-cigarettes qualified as tobacco products and it began reviewing authorization applications for millions of new vaping products.\n\nThe multi-billion-dollar industry says that the FDA changed its method for that review in the middle of the process, requiring companies to show, with randomized trials, that flavored products are more effective than tobacco-flavored products at helping smokers quit or cut back on cigarettes.\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the industry in January, finding that officials had perpetrated a \u201cregulatory switcheroo,\u201d sending manufactures on a \u201cwild goose chase\u201d to get approval. Seven other appeals courts rejected similar challenges of the agency\u2019s denials.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, wrote a short concurrence that seemed to take issue with a line from Alito\u2019s opinion. The FDA was not \u201cfeeling its way toward a final stance\u201d on how to review vaping products, she said. It was, instead, giving the companies some flexibility to prove their products would be beneficial.\n\nIn light of the law, she wrote, \u201cand the well-documented and serious risks flavored e-cigarette products pose to youth, it should have come as no surprise that applicants would need to submit rigorous scientific evidence showing that the benefits of their products would outweigh those risks.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court sent the case back to the 5th Circuit to reconsider a related dispute in the case that deals with marketing plans.\n\nAt first, the FDA asked for the companies to provide those plans to demonstrate how its advertising could reduce misuse of the products by minors. But the FDA then said it didn\u2019t consider those plans because past efforts to address the problem of youth vaping through marketing were not effective.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s handling of the marketing plans prompted a technical legal question about whether the appeals court should have sent the denials back to the agency for further review. Alito wrote that the 5th Circuit read Supreme Court precedents \u201ctoo broadly\u201d to conclude that the FDA\u2019s decision to not consider the marketing plans necessarily amounted to a legal error.\n\nBut Alito also wrote that the FDA\u2019s argument on the point wasn\u2019t quite right and so it asked the appeals court to \u201cdecide the question afresh.\u201d That technical point could bring the case back to the Supreme Court next year.\n\n\ufeffOn the other hand, the vaping companies may have an easier way out of the loss: They can reapply for approval with an administration that may be friendlier to its position. During the oral arguments in December, Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed the parties on the practical effect of a decision either way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curious what relief looks like in this case, because the companies can always reapply, correct?\u201d Kavanaugh asked.\n\nCurtis Gannon, an attorney with the Justice Department, agreed that they could.\n\n\u201cThey can reapply without a fee,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some other applicants have reapplied.\u201d\n\nBut an attorney for the vaping industry countered that the FDA sometimes takes years to resolve applications.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to wait that out,\u201d Heyer said. \u201cThis was their one shot.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Wednesday."

Photo: @NYCMayor/X\n\nA federal judge officially dismissed the pending corruption charges against Eric Adams in an unsurprising but big win for the long-embattled mayor, whose public-approval ratings have plummeted after being indicted by the government last year.\n\nAdams addressed the end of his legal battle in prepared remarks outside Gracie Mansion, thanking his attorney Alex Spiro and his supporters. \u201cLet me be clear. As I\u2019ve said all along, this case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor said he wished to apologize to New Yorkers for having to deal with the \u201clies spread through false leaks\u201d and \u201csensational headlines,\u201d but that he never lost his focus on working for them.\n\nIn a notable moment, Adams ended his remarks by holding up a copy of the book \u201cGovernment Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth and the Battle for our Democracy\u201d written by now-FBI director and Trump loyalist Kash Patel, urging New Yorkers to read it. \u201cRead it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his ruling, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho acknowledged that both Adams and the Justice Department were aligned in their requests to dismiss the case, concluding that the court lacks the power to force the government to prosecute a case if it doesn\u2019t wish to. \u201cA court cannot force the Department of Justice to prosecute a defendant. That is by design. In our constitutional system of separation of powers, a court\u2019s role in a criminal case is to preside over the matter \u2014 not to decide whether the defendant should be prosecuted,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut in a notable break with the federal government, Ho moved to dismiss the indictment \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d which removes the Trump administration\u2019s ability to revive the charges in the future if it so chooses. The judge stated bluntly that his action ensures that the charges \u201ccannot be used as leverage\u201d over the mayor or New York City, addressing a concern held by many that the White House could choose to hold the case over Adams in exchange for support for President Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cDismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor\u2019s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,\u201d Ho wrote.\n\nThough the judge largely granted the Justice Department\u2019s request, Ho dismantled its reasoning for the dismissal, writing that its argument that the case held the appearance of \u201cimpropriety\u201d was \u201cunsupported by any objective evidence.\u201d\n\nHo also stated his belief that some of the arguments against dismissal had merit, writing that Adams\u2019s ability to assist with federal immigration actions was not impaired as argued by the Justice Department. The judge noted that, in contrast, the mayor did take immigration enforcement actions in line with the Trump administration\u2019s political views. \u201cEverything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHo\u2019s ruling marks the end of an ongoing saga that took a new turn following Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Under new leadership, the Justice Department moved to dismiss the case against Adams, directing Manhattan prosecutors to do so. But the order had a cascading effect, as Danielle Sassoon, the interim U.S. attorney, stepped down from her role, likening the dismissal to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between Adams and the new administration. Multiple prosecutors soon followed suit, similarly protesting the directive.\n\nLast September, federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused Adams of knowingly soliciting illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals in exchange for luxury travel perks. Adams has long professed his innocence in the matter and rebuffed calls for him to step down or drop his long-shot bid for reelection. Recent polls have shown Adams trailing behind former Governor Andrew Cuomo and many of his other Democratic challengers have embraced a ranked choice voting strategy, urging voters to leave both men unranked on their ballots."

            "full_content": "Marine Le Pen has for years been a superstar of Europe\u2019s far-right movement. That was until this week, when a spectacular court ruling banned her from running in France\u2019s 2027 presidential election \u2014 a vote she looked well placed to win.\n\nNow, the future looks difficult for Le Pen, 56, who was found guilty of running a \u201csystem\u201d of embezzlement that siphoned $3.4 million of European Union funds to her National Rally party.\n\nThe implications are also unclear for her party and the wider European far-right movement, which has won friends in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nJust like Trump in the United States, Le Pen has attacked the French legal system, condemning the ruling as a rigged attempt to block her from power. Those comments are a marked departure from her years of efforts to become a respected, mainstream force in European politics.\n\nThe National Rally leader has vowed to appeal her five-year election ban and two-year suspended prison sentence, plus another two with an electronic ankle tag. She was among two dozen defendants from her party.\n\nBut this is \u201cthe kind of obstacle you don\u2019t hop over just by a publicity campaign or ignoring it,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Alduy, a French studies professor at Stanford University.\n\nSome opponents fear that like Trump, the sentence will beatify her as a martyr with her supporters. She has already urged the \u201cmillions of people\u201d outraged to protest.\n\nThe establishment \u201cbrought out the nuclear bomb,\u201d Le Pen told the French Parliament on Tuesday. \u201cAnd if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it\u2019s obviously because we\u2019re about to win the elections.\u201d\n\nTrump was quick to draw parallels with his own situation.\n\n\u201cShe was banned for running for five years and she\u2019s the leading candidate \u2014 that sounds like this country,\u201d he told journalists Tuesday in the Oval Office. \u201cThat\u2019s a very big deal.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump adviser Elon Musk said it was an example of \u201cthe radical left\u201d abusing \u201cthe legal system to jail their opponents\u201d when its members can\u2019t win elections. \u201cThis is their standard playbook throughout the world,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nTrump was convicted last year of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.\n\nNeither Trump nor Musk offered evidence of French impropriety, and far from \u201cthe radical left,\u201d France is governed by President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist-led alliance.\n\nStill, facts may not dilute the potency of those populist critiques.\n\nFar-right leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Dutch anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders have this week voiced support for Le Pen's cause. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, called it \u201ca violation of democratic norms.\u201d\n\nThat Le Pen was leading the field is undeniable, after softening her party's hard-line image while retaining its staunchly anti-immigration ideology.\n\nAn Ifop poll taken four days before her sentencing projected she would get 36% of the vote in 2027. The two-term Macron is ineligible for a third but his ally, \u00c9douard Philippe was second on 25%.\n\nLe Pen is far from the first high-profile French politician to face legal troubles, with former Presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy both being convicted of corruption.\n\nIf she fails in appealing her disbarment, she has a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and heir-apparent in Jordan Bardella, 29, the millennial darling of the far right with a bootstrap backstory of growing up with Italian-Algerian heritage in Paris' grittier suburbs.\n\nJordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen in Paris last year. Bertrand Guay / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nWith 2 million TikTok followers, he became the party\u2019s president at 26 and its first not born a Le Pen. He is deeply loyal, and was poised to become Le Pen's prime minister if she won in 2027.\n\nBut his mentor's conviction \u201cmight lead to a change in plans,\u201d according to Tara Varma, a visiting fellow at Washington\u2019s Brookings Institution think tank.\n\nLe Pen acknowledged as much in an interview with French television Tuesday, saying Bardella might have to be deployed to run for the top job \u201csooner than necessary.\u201d\n\nA survey by the pollster Harris Interactive the day of Le Pen's sentencing put her and Bardella's popularity on equal footing, but his rise is not a fait accompli, analysts say.\n\n\u201cA lot of internal fights are likely to emerge,\u201d said Alduy at Stanford. And Bardella\u2019s \u201cleadership will be put into question by Marine\u2019s allies.\u201d\n\nHis debating and media skills \u201cpale in comparison\u201d to Le Pen\u2019s \u201csteady bulldozer-like calm,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear that at 29 years old he is cut for the role.\u201d\n\nAnother potential successor is Le Pen\u2019s niece, Marion Mar\u00e9chal, who dropped the family name in 2018. Some commentators said that was an attempt to distance herself from her late grandfather and Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, though she denied it.\n\nThe senior Le Pen founded the National Front, as National Rally was then known, but his daughter later kicked him out in her own attempt to distance the party from his record of racist remarks and Holocaust denial.\n\nMar\u00e9chal still \u201ccarries the Le Pen name\u201d in spirit at least, said Varma, and would continue a lineage unbroken since the 1970s.\n\nUltimately, the only certain outcome from this week's events for French politics is more drama.\n\nAfter inconclusive snap elections last year, Macron has cobbled together a fragile coalition which could soon face fresh no-confidence votes from Le Pen, who is still a lawmaker, Alduy said.\n\nAnother governmental collapse \u2014 there were two last year \u2014 is not impossible. If that happens, Alduy added, \u201cmore chaos is certainly in store on all sides.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe judge overseeing the corruption case against Eric Adams has dismissed the charges against the New York City mayor, and in a split with the Trump Justice Department, ordered that the charges cannot be brought again.\n\nJudge Dale Ho said his hands were essentially tied \u2013 even though he has concerns about the Justice Department\u2019s reasons to dismiss the case \u2013 he could not force them to prosecute a defendant.\n\nHo\u2019s ruling criticized the Trump administration\u2019s motives for dropping the case at a time when the White House is seeking to bolster its authority over the Justice Department and federal prosecutors.\n\nDOJ\u2019s effort to drop the case and retaining the ability to restore charges resulted in the mass resignation of several Justice Department officials, including the acting US attorney in the Southern District of New York and the top career prosecutors overseeing public corruption cases.\n\nIn a strongly-worded opinion, Ho rejected the Justice Department\u2019s core argument \u2013 that New York prosecutors were politically motivated in bringing the case and that the charges were impacting the mayor\u2019s ability to carry out Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cEverything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,\u201d he wrote in a 78-page opinion. He said DOJ\u2019s position is \u201cdisturbing\u201d because it implies public officials may receive special treatment if they go along with political priorities. \u201cThat suggestion is fundamentally incompatible with the basic promise of equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Justice Department said, \u201cThis case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources. We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe.\u201d\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney for Adams, said the case \u201cshould have never been brought in the first place \u2013 and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn light of DOJ\u2019s rationales, dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor\u2019s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,\u201d the judge wrote Wednesday.\n\nIn remarks to reporters at his New York City home, the mayor reiterated his claim that the case should never have been brought and that he did nothing wrong. He made no mention of Trump, although he did hold up a copy of \u201cGovernment Gangsters\u201d\u2013 a book written by FBI Director Kash Patel.\n\nAdams, who is up for reelection this fall, was indicted in September on charges related to bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals in exchange for political favors. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Honig on \u2018incalculable damage on DOJ\u2019 01:40 - Source: CNN Honig on \u2018incalculable damage on DOJ\u2019 01:40\n\nThe indictment alleged Adams\u2019 illegal actions stretched back to 2014, when he was Brooklyn Borough president. Prosecutors said Adams received luxury travel benefits including hotel room upgrades, meals and other perks from a Turkish official. In exchange, prosecutors say Adams pressured a New York City Fire Department official to grant permits to open a Turkish consular building that had failed to pass inspection.\n\nIn February, Trump\u2019s DOJ recommended the case be dropped following a meeting with the mayor\u2019s lawyers in Washington. Then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said, \u201cThe pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that escalated under the policies of the prior Administration.\u201d\n\nBove\u2019s letter spurred several DOJ prosecutors to resign rather than carry out his order. In her resignation letter, then-acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, wrote that during the meeting Adams\u2019 attorneys \u201crepeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department\u2019s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.\u201d\n\nBoth Adams and Bove appeared in court and denied the existence of any quid pro quo.\n\nThe judge then asked Paul Clement, a well-known conservative attorney, to advise him on DOJ\u2019s request. In his report, Clement said the complete dismissal of the case would resolve any taint over the issue.\n\n\u201cA dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the accused,\u201d Clement wrote. \u201cDismissal with prejudice avoids those concerns and promotes another important separation-of-powers virtue \u2013 namely, accountability.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Ho explained his reasons for dismissing the charges permanently and denying the Justice Department\u2019s full request.\n\n\u201cIn light of DOJ\u2019s rationales, dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor\u2019s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\n\u201cIt ensures that, going forward, the charges in the Indictment cannot be used as leverage over Mayor Adams or the City of New York,\u201d the judge added.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton, one of several key leaders who met with New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul when she was deciding on using her power to remove the mayor, says that the perception that Adams is controlled by the White House should now be gone.\n\n\u201cIt takes away the felling that he was under the thumb of the president,\u201d Sharpton told CNN. \u201cIt clearly says that now whatever he does, now he\u2019ll be judged on his own decisions.\u201d\n\nThe judge said his decision should not be read as an opinion on the allegations against the mayor. Ho added that it\u2019s ultimately the public\u2019s opinion, not his, that matters. With limited options, the judge said one that he has is to provide transparency.\n\n\u201cBringing these decisions into the open may, in turn, lead to attempts by the public to influence these decisions through democratic channels,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nCNN\u2019s Mark Morales contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and comment."

And two women speak out about the Trump administration\u2019s failed attempt deport them.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know today.\n\nTrump to announce new tariffs on \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 in intensifying trade war\n\nIt\u2019s April 2 \u2014 the day President Donald Trump has dubbed \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d during which he\u2019s expected to roll out the largest set of new trade barriers in generations. The anticipated announcement is a culmination of months of the president\u2019s big talk about tariffs and adds to the duties he has already imposed.\n\nThe details of this latest round of tariffs aren\u2019t yet clear. Trump has already announced his intention to impose tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, and he has suggested other new tariffs would be both reciprocal with other nations and include duties on specific sectors like pharmaceuticals or computer chips. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged yesterday that Trump and his advisers were still \u201cperfecting\u201d the policies.\n\nSome countries are trying to get ahead of the new duties, with Vietnam and Israel indicating they would relax duties on U.S. goods, while leaders in Europe were still holding out hope for negotiations.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nIn the U.S., the impending tariffs are causing uncertainty in the economy. Stock markets have tanked. Consumer confidence is down. The Federal Reserve shifted its inflation forecasts higher. And businesses said they\u2019re already seeing higher prices.\n\nTrump\u2019s reasons for imposing trade duties are varied. When imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada, he cited a desire to curb the flow of fentanyl and undocumented into the country. Trump has also been fixated on reversing America\u2019s trade deficit, and he has accused countries of \u201ctaking advantage of\u201d the U.S. and \u201cripping us off.\u201d\n\nEconomists have cast doubt on Trump\u2019s policies, saying his views on trade are outdated at best. One expert, who suggested Trump\u2019s policy ambitions are part of \u201csome misplaced nostalgia,\u201d said, \u201cWe should not wish for American workers to be sewing tennis shoes together \u2014 they can have better jobs than that.\u201d\n\nRead the full story here, and follow our live blog for updates from Trump\u2019s announcement and reactions to the new policies.\n\nMore tariffs coverage:\n\nHere\u2019s how tariffs work , who pays for them in the short and long run and why they\u2019re used in the first place.\n\n, who pays for them in the short and long run and why they\u2019re used in the first place. Metal recycling businesses stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s tariffs, but they fear retaliatory tariffs would blunt whatever advantages they may gain.\n\nTakeaways from the special elections in Wisconsin and Florida\n\nYesterday's special elections in Wisconsin and Florida saw both Democrats and Republicans claim victories that hinted at shifting mindsets since the 2024 election.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Susan Crawford won a seat on the state Supreme Court, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority in the battleground state\u2019s highest court.\n\nWith Crawford\u2019s win, Democrats have a new boogeyman in Elon Musk, who spent millions to bolster Crawford\u2019s opponent, Brad Schimel. After the election, the Trump White House was quick to downplay Schimel\u2019s loss, saying the off-year race was \u201cpredictive of nothing\u201d and that Musk would continue to help in Republican campaigns. Whether Democrats can replicate their strategy in other elections in which Musk isn\u2019t playing such a major role will become clearer in time.\n\nThe Wisconsin race also saw Republicans try to use their 2024 playbook, with ads that hit on transgender issues and crime, only for the strategy to not work.\n\nHowever, the GOP\u2019s playbook was successful in Florida. Republicans Jimmy Patronis won in the state\u2019s 1st District, and state Sen. Randy Fine won in the state\u2019s 6th District to replace former Rep. Matt Gaetz and former Rep.

            "full_content": "Cheesehead. Photo: Getty Images\n\nDemocrats easily won a competitive and much-heralded supreme-court contest in Wisconsin, where the liberal candidate they backed triumphed over a conservative supported by Elon Musk. It\u2019s a humiliating result for the world\u2019s richest man after he spent heavily and campaigned personally in the state for conservative Brad Schimel, who was tied to the DOGE leader\u2019s large and controversial role in the Trump administration. Susan Crawford won by ten points and consolidated liberal control of a crucial battleground state court.\n\nThe Wisconsin race was the most expensive judicial contest in American history by a large margin, with nearly $100 million spent. Groups aligned with Musk represented over $20 million of that total. But money aside, Musk all but took over poor Schimel\u2019s campaign, as the New York Times reported a couple of days before the vote:\n\nHe brought a billionaire friend, $1 million checks and a Packers cheesehead hat. A pastor prayed for him. A superfan begged him for a follow on X.\n\nElon Musk was the star of a 2,000-person rally on Sunday night in Wisconsin \u2014 ostensibly for the conservative candidate in a closely watched state judicial race \u2014 just 36 hours before polls open on Election Day. Of course he was.\n\nThe billionaire Mr. Musk looked very much like a candidate at this rally, putting himself front and center in the final stretch of an election pitting two rivals against each other, neither of them named Elon Musk.\n\nMusk not only personalized the Wisconsin race: He also boosted the stakes, saying at one point that \u201cthe entire destiny of humanity\u201d rested on winning there. Without much question, his involvement helped energize Democrats, who saw a rare opportunity to take the arrogant tech bro down a notch or two. Musk\u2019s profile was nearly as galvanizing as the abortion issue that helped the liberal candidate win in the last Wisconsin supreme-court election in 2023, which overturned a conservative majority on the court. Turnout was again high for this kind of election, with over 2 million votes cast (not far off the 2022 midterms, and about two-thirds of the vote cast in the red-hot 2024 presidential race).\n\nThe results could help produce progressive rulings in a variety of Wisconsin cases and perhaps even lead to a re-redistricting of congressional districts benefiting Democrats. Wisconsin Republicans consoled themselves with the overwhelming approval of a constitutional amendment embedding a voter-ID requirement.\n\nTuesday featured the first major election contests of 2025. Republicans fared better in Florida, where they held two vacant House seats, as expected, winning both by 14 points. The margins were reduced from recent elections in part thanks to the same sort of Democratic grassroots energy that powered Crawford\u2019s victory and filled the coffers of candidates in the Sunshine State. The First District, previously represented by MAGA bad boy and momentary attorney-general nominee Matt Gaetz, has elected Randy Fine, though with less than half the margin Gaetz won in 2024. The Sixth District will be represented by Jimmy Patronis, who also fell over 30 points short of the margin won in 2024 by national security adviser and Signal power-user Michael Waltz. Turnout in both contests was healthy if not astounding: about two-thirds of the numbers posted in 2022, and about 40 percent of 2024 levels.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see if Musk\u2019s face-plant in Wisconsin affects his standing in Washington, D.C. Trump doesn\u2019t like losers and does enjoy shifting blame for adverse political trends. The liberal win could sharpen knives in Republican and White House circles already concerned about Musk\u2019s sagging approval ratings and regularly outrageous utterances. At a minimum, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll make any more appearances strutting around with a chainsaw or saluting with a stiff arm outward.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Illustration: Albert Tercero\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nHolly Davis didn\u2019t believe in luck until she realized just how unlucky she was. Then she couldn\u2019t quite shake it, this sense of having an anti-Midas touch, bad outcomes following her unprovoked. Often, it was the little things. Reservations she made disappeared. Rides she booked never came. Someone else would fill out an annoying but vital online form without a hitch; the site would crash as soon as she tried. Her neighbors\u2019 plants glowed a lustrous green while hers \u2014 same soil, same rain \u2014 shriveled with disease.\n\nShe knew it sounded crazy, but it all started when she accepted her grandmother\u2019s rings. She was 21, graduating college and getting engaged to her freshman-year sweetheart. They\u2019d both double-majored in sociology and women\u2019s studies. Now they were moving to Portland, Oregon, looking for jobs and housing. Second-hand engagement rings were considered bad luck, but she didn\u2019t give it much thought. To her, that was nonsense \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t like she had much money to buy rings of her own.\n\nAlmost immediately, there was acrimony when other relatives grew jealous that Davis had gotten these heirlooms. One lousy event would precipitate another. The job she found in Portland was at a halfway house for sex offenders. It sounds hyperbolic, but somehow, at the time, she always felt like she was the person on duty when a resident came home high on meth or wielding a knife, or when the bosses ordered a room search, which meant she was the one looking under mattresses and pulling back soiled sheets, rummaging for contraband cigarettes and porn. \u201cI was always the member of staff that ended up with jizz on them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was always on days when I would wear my nicest sweater, or a nice handmade scarf, and then it was like, \u2018Great, I\u2019ve got to go handwash this.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer romantic relationships followed the same rule. A grad-school acceptance in sociology at the University of Edinburgh pulled her out of the halfway house, and her fianc\u00e9 followed her only for him to declare Scotland \u201cthe land that God forgot\u201d and move back to his parents\u2019 basement. Years later, she married a Scot \u2014 again, using her grandma\u2019s rings \u2014 only for the British government to impose an income requirement for spousal visas that neither she nor her new warehouse-worker husband could meet. Their relationship fell apart. She\u2019d get into the car, ask if he might turn down the screamo, \u201cand his response would be to turn it all the way up to the point of, like, almost blowing the speakers out.\u201d\n\nShe knew there were other explanations \u2014 more rational explanations. The halfway house was chronically underfunded and understaffed; the work was rough and dirty for everyone. The suite of failed relationships might\u2019ve been a product of her own psychology, the trend of failed bookings a product of inattention. And yet. It felt like there was something else.\n\nShe started wondering whether the rings were hexed. She talked about it the way you might tell a ghost story \u2014 as an outlandish dinner-party anecdote you can\u2019t help laughing about but also, in some secret, inadmissible part of your soul, can\u2019t fully discount. Her grandmother had been volatile: a Hungarian Canadian bombshell with black hair, red lipstick, and a personality disorder that went undiagnosed until her 80s. She had a tempestuous second marriage to a soft-spoken man who painted portrait after portrait of the same female figure \u2014 decidedly not his wife \u2014 whom he described only as \u201cthe woman of my dreams.\u201d Ask him about his life in Hungary, and his answers had a quicksilver quality, hard to pin down. Then, once he died, stories started coming out. There was a cupboard, which he\u2019d usually kept locked, full of Nazi memorabilia: swastikas, military maps, gold teeth. There were secret bank accounts for sending money back to relatives in the Old Country, which he\u2019d stashed in secret compartments he had made by cutting holes into the pages of books. There were divorce filings that he\u2019d never finished filling out. True or mythologized, it was hard to say for sure. Still. Marital lies, possible collaboration with the Third Reich \u2014 the rings could be carrying an \u201cintergenerational family karma curse.\u201d It made a certain kind of sense.\n\nIt also made no sense at all. Davis was a sociologist, level-headed in her views. Her work was filled with references to redlining and deindustrialization, mandatory sentencing and welfare reform. She\u2019d left behind her parents\u2019 Catholicism. She was a millennial, born in 1984, conversant in the structural and the systemic, the sweeping explanations undergirding the patterns she could see in the world. She knew she\u2019d benefited from stability, a middle-class childhood, a good education that gave her options for what she could do with her life. She didn\u2019t believe in the supernatural.\n\nWas this just adulthood, she wondered, to be waging an endless war against the everyday, your clothes stained and your efforts foiled? Was this normal? The man who would eventually become her second husband didn\u2019t think so, and he knew a thing or two about luck. He\u2019d written a master\u2019s thesis about it, and a 122-page doctoral dissertation, and had co-edited a volume called The Philosophy of Luck. His name was Lee John Whittington, she\u2019d met him on Tinder, and he didn\u2019t believe in the salt-throwing, new-engagement-ring-buying sort of luck, either. At least in most cases he didn\u2019t. Though he too laughed about it, hedged about it, he came to see his wife as the exception, a living counterargument to his philosophizing. He sometimes joked she was the unluckiest person he\u2019d ever met.\n\nIn 2020, a professor at the University of Iowa named Michael Sauder noticed that one subject was tacitly off-limits in sociology. No matter how hard you looked, the literature was curiously silent about luck. There was an exception, he found, that seemed to prove the rule. Some 50 years earlier, a team of Harvard sociologists had published a lightning rod of an academic tome called Inequality. Access to good schools was important, its authors argued, but education alone couldn\u2019t close the country\u2019s divides; to do that, your best bet was to redistribute income.\n\nInequality was, to put it mildly, controversial. But one of the most contentious bits \u2014 rivaling even the socialist policy proposal \u2014 was the suggestion that some differences were attributable to sheer luck: \u201cchance acquaintances who steer you to one line of work rather than another, the range of jobs that happen to be available in a particular community when you are job hunting\u201d \u2014 the myriad little twists that have a big effect on a life. Other sociologists were not so sure. Luck was invoked in only a handful of the book\u2019s 400 or so pages but was mentioned 15 times in the American Journal of Sociology\u2019s review. Such assertions were \u201cmerely speculations about the unexplained variance, not findings.\u201d It generated such blowback that the lead author later said he regretted using the word at all.\n\nThe idea was still pissing people off decades later. When the Cornell economist and columnist Robert H. Frank appeared on a Fox Business talk show in 2009 to talk about the importance of luck in economic success, the British-born host wasted no time before telling him off: \u201cDo you know how insulting that was when I read that? I came to America with nothing 35 years ago. I\u2019ve made something of myself, I think through hard work, talent, and risk-taking, and you\u2019re going to write that this is luck.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something about luck that inspires skepticism or rejoinder. Partially, it\u2019s a question of terms. It\u2019s hard to agree what exactly we\u2019re talking about. The word is slippery, a kind of linguistic Jell-O. The critiques come from left and right, from those who see luck as a mask for privilege and those who see it as an offense to self-made men. Voltaire, with the confidence of the encyclopedist, once declared that one can locate a cause for everything and thus the word made no sense. Others dismiss it as mere statistics, still others as simply a term the godless use for God. It can call to mind an austere medieval manuscript, two-faced Fortuna, one side beaming, the other weeping, ordinary humans clinging to her fickle wheel.\n\nBut we can\u2019t quite quit it, either. It\u2019s something you might say you don\u2019t believe in but continuously invoke. We\u2019re up all night to get it, are warned not to push it, are sometimes down on it. It haunts our pop songs and expressions, but it isn\u2019t just some rhetorical holdover, like the bony stub of an ancestral tail. This organ is still in active use. Months before he narrowly survived an assassination attempt, a Washington Post op-ed called Donald Trump \u201cthe luckiest politician who ever lived\u201d; just two days before he arrived in Butler, Pennsylvania, a columnist at the National Review wondered whether he had a \u201cdesk drawer full of four-leaf clovers in his office at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d\n\nIn the tech world, managers ask about it in job interviews. \u201cAre you a lucky person?\u201d was reportedly one of Jeff Bezos\u2019s favorite questions in the early days of Amazon. Now it\u2019s common enough that some college career centers warn students to have an answer prepared. One year at Goldman Sachs, a superior in charge of hiring entry-level analysts divided the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s he\u2019d gotten into two piles at random, the way you might cut a deck of cards. Then he threw one pile out, saying, \u201cYou have to be lucky in this business. We might as well pick from the lucky ones.\u201d According to a Goldman Sachs spokesperson, this story is almost certainly apocryphal \u2014 but it keeps getting told, a parable for how luck figures in supposedly meritocratic outcomes.\n\nFor Frank, the Cornell economist, it was the difference between life and death. After an episode of sudden cardiac arrest on the tennis court, his survival depended on the fluke of an ambulance being nearby, having been dispatched to a car accident that involved no serious injuries, allowing those EMTs to scoot a few hundred yards to get to him. In true economist fashion, he saw in his brush with death a force that plays a vital role in markets. A globalized world makes competition fiercer, such that even meaningless variation \u2014 which product happens to get a good online review first, say \u2014 can have enormous impacts.\n\nOver the last 20 years, sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers have been looking at it, too. In a way, they\u2019re responding to a need. We live in an era of boundless data, an empiricist\u2019s fantasy. Apps count our steps and track our breaths. Websites watch our scrolls and clicks. Scientists trace the viruses and chemicals that get flushed with our urine and feces. We recognize the structural forces at play in our lives, the long tail of history and policy swishing around in the everyday. Our world should be at its most analyzable, explicable \u2014 but still it can feel like sorcery. That a hurricane\u2019s path was plotted by satellite and dropsonde, radar and big-data modeling doesn\u2019t dull the eeriness of one house destroyed and its neighbor still standing.\n\n\u201cAs social scientists, we have our own demons circling the edges of our enlightenment campfire, reminding us that there are aspects of social processes that we will never be able to account for,\u201d wrote Sauder in a paper called \u201cThe Sociology of Luck.\u201d He was urging his colleagues to peer into the darkness, to reopen the forbidden chamber Inequality had cracked way back in 1972. All sorts of forces help explain the world \u2014 race and class, gender and geography, redlining and Reaganomics \u2014 but they were never entirely sufficient. There were always ripples of randomness within those vast tidal currents, as Washington University in St. Louis sociologist Mark Rank put it after joining the party with his own luck book in 2024, The Random Factor. Luck might draw attention to the limits of a field\u2019s methods, but that wasn\u2019t a good reason to ignore it. To Sauder, luck was real \u2014 not an \u201cexplanatory junk drawer\u201d for anything that a sociologist\u2019s model couldn\u2019t explain but something specific and consequential that needed to be studied.\n\nThe one dimension of personal luck that transcends all others is to have been born in a highly developed country,\u201d Frank writes, and by that account Whittington was extremely lucky. He was born middle-class in England to parents who worked in pharmaceuticals, the kind of parents who could coach him toward good grades after he skipped every biology class one year to smoke up in a friend\u2019s basement listening to Cradle of Filth. To him and others in philosophy, though, that wasn\u2019t luck per se. Those details were so instrumental in determining the course of his life that changing them would require a cascade of other changes. If he\u2019d been born in a different country, or to a different set of parents, or into a different class, would he even be himself?\n\nLike many luck scholars, Whittington had stumbled on it by chance. In 2009, he was a master\u2019s student in philosophy at the University of Hertfordshire, outside London, staring down a meeting about the subject for his thesis when he happened upon a BBC article about the Monopoly World Championships. That sounds like complete bullshit, he thought. Sure, there might be strategies to boost your chances of winning, but the gameplay depends largely on rolling the dice. The whole point was trying to make your way in a fiction where luck wasn\u2019t just afoot but made visible.\n\nWhittington is a meanderer by nature, prone to following tangents and seeing where they lead. He logged on to PhilPapers, his field\u2019s answer to Google, where he quickly found a 2008 paper called \u201cWhat Luck Is Not.\u201d It was a riposte to other thinkers who, in the early aughts, had tried to come up with a coherent definition of what we mean when we talk about luck. This paper explained the two predominant accounts in order to tear them both apart.\n\nThe first account saw luck in events that were both significant to us and beyond our control. Imagine two drunk drivers, one who kills a pedestrian and another who is swerving just as wildly but on an empty road. The first might go to jail for manslaughter. The other might receive no more punishment than waking up the next morning with a hangover. To thinkers like Thomas Nagel, this discrepancy \u2014 \u201cmoral luck\u201d \u2014 signals a paradox. Our intuition tells us we can\u2019t be blamed for what isn\u2019t our fault, yet our circumstances are impossible to untangle from our actions and their fallout. Some contemporary philosophers took up that idea of luck, elucidating a concept their predecessors had used but not fully defined.\n\nMore evocative to Whittington was the second account of luck, this one about fragility, how easily things could have turned out differently. Take the example of a piano falling on your head. All of the pieces that had to align for that to happen form an intricate Rube Goldberg machine of ifs. If the stairwell hadn\u2019t been a quarter inch too narrow to fit this baby grand. If the movers hadn\u2019t decided to hoist it by pulley. If the ropes hadn\u2019t been frayed just enough to fail but not so much that they were obviously unusable. If you hadn\u2019t passed below at just the wrong time. The world in which you emerge unscathed is razor close. (The thought experiment sounds absurd. Yet think of the cellist from the Electric Light Orchestra killed in 2010 by a 1,300-pound hay bale that rolled out of nowhere and crushed him in his car.)\n\nOne might analyze such an event through the lens of probabilities. But Whittington hated the image of our brains as machinelike calculators for uncertainty. What drew him to the \u201cfragile worlds\u201d account was a belief that our minds run less on math, more on stories. \u201cWhen I think about luck, it fundamentally becomes an imaginative activity,\u201d he said \u2014 the act of visualizing worlds that might\u2019ve been and still might be.\n\nA defense of the \u201cpossible worlds\u201d account of luck became his Ph.D. dissertation at Edinburgh \u2014 but toward the end of his degree, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and during his postdoc, he died. There had been times when his dad had been difficult. Once, instead of telling Whittington off for leaving dishes unwashed, he\u2019d slipped them still sticky into his son\u2019s bed. But they had been close. They\u2019d gone to see Rammstein and Tool together. They had spent hours and hours talking about luck \u2014 at the dinner table, at the pub, at the whiteboard in his parents\u2019 house \u2014 his dad asking question after question, listening, defending a more probabilistic approach, listening again.\n\nNow, his dad was gone, and in that moment, none of the work seemed to matter. He had no stomach for academia\u2019s petty politics and abstractions. He stuck out the postdoc and then he left, went traveling. When he got back to Edinburgh, he wasn\u2019t sure whether to stay, so he played a little game. If he could find a flat and a job in the next five days, this would be home for a bit. If not, he\u2019d move on.\n\nHe found a rundown apartment and a receptionist job in a youth hostel. He matched on Tinder with a sociology postdoc named Holly Davis. She loved breeding chickens for egg color, crossing French Marans with Andalusians for deep green, Easter-eggers with leghorns for mint or pale blue. She was taking both burlesque and mixed-martial-arts classes. She liked bringing her students to a strip club so they could learn how to do ethnographic research.\n\nWhittington and Davis became friends. She was wary after dating another guy off Tinder who\u2019d turned out to be a creep. Whittington started staying over, but chastely. Finally, after a few months, while he was visiting his mother for Christmas, she asked him over the phone if he wanted to \u201cmove beyond platonic.\u201d He did. Then her car broke down on New Year\u2019s Eve, and they spent their first official date as a couple waiting for the tow truck.\n\nWhenever Whittington told anyone at Hertfordshire what he was researching, they always said the same thing: Talk to Richard Wiseman. Wiseman was a big name on campus, a psychologist who had, in the 1990s and early aughts, recruited a bunch of categorically lucky or unlucky people as research volunteers. The pseudonymous Patricia, for instance, was 27 and a star-crossed flight attendant. One plane she was on had to make an impromptu landing because passengers were belligerently drunk. Another was struck by lightning. A third was grounded for a different emergency. She had survived so far, but all her attempts at dating were doomed, and she avoided friends who were about to take exams or do job interviews lest they be infected by her miasma of failure. Wiseman\u2019s lucky volunteers, in contrast, had successful careers, satisfying marriages, a lifetime of doorways fortuitously opened in front of them.\n\nWas there any truth in these self-perceptions? To find out, Wiseman subjected them to a series of experiments. In one, he asked people to page through a newspaper and report how many pictures it contained. It was a trick. On the second page, he\u2019d written, \u201cStop counting \u2014 there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.\u201d On another: \u201cStop counting, tell the experimenter you\u2019ve seen this and win $250.\u201d The unlucky among his volunteers were less likely to notice those messages than their lucky counterparts: They were too anxious to see opportunity and good fortune staring them in the face.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Wiseman started his career as a magician. In his view, luck was little more than illusion, a kind of psychological sleight of hand. Wiseman\u2019s The Luck Factor, from 2003, would become perhaps the most famous entry in a subgenre of self-help. There\u2019s How Luck Happens, from 2018; The Science of Being Lucky, from 2019; and Conscious Luck, from 2020, to name a few. By looking for and seizing opportunity, the argument often goes, luck is something you can make yourself. This has a Hallmarkian neatness, at once attractive and frustrating. As Whittington saw it, it was fine as pop psychology, potentially even helpful, but it carried a Pollyanna-ish, moralizing overtone, as if every sling and arrow were of your own making. Sometimes shit just happened that wasn\u2019t your fault.\n\nDavis was a case in point. Four or five months into their relationship, they were in her cottage in Fife doing some administrative task online. Whittington did it for himself with no issue, but when Davis tried, there was roadblock after roadblock, glitch after glitch. The form would reset itself. Eventually, the whole site would crash. \u201cWhat the actual hell?\u201d Whittington couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cYou are the unluckiest human being I have ever met.\u201d In his philosophical work, luck was a quality of events, not of people; it denoted the fragility of outcomes, not something that clings to you. And yet. Davis\u2019s car had just been totaled by a van driver, not her doing. The latest brood of eggs she\u2019d incubated had yielded 12 males and one female \u2014 the chicken version of a truly lousy hand. She\u2019d have to rehome most of them; with a small yard, she couldn\u2019t keep that many roosters without them squabbling among themselves and harassing the hens.\n\nWas he serious? He knew luck; if that\u2019s what it looked like to him, she thought, then maybe that\u2019s what was wrong with her. She hadn\u2019t used \u201cthe L-word\u201d for it, but she knew she was misadventure prone, subject to Murphy\u2019s Law more than most. She\u2019d even gone so far as to get rid of her grandmother\u2019s rings after her first marriage dissolved, leaving them with her mom in Wisconsin. But when her mother started talking about getting them resized, something in Davis protested. Maybe the rings had cooled down, she thought. Or perhaps she wanted them in the way we often want what feels a little dangerous. She took them back.\n\nThe couple kept feeling the rings\u2019 force, at once malevolent and a little absurd. In Davis\u2019s sociology studies, she\u2019d had luck finding sex workers to interview for her master\u2019s thesis, and pimps for her dissertation, but try as she might, the johns at the center of her postdoc research just would not talk. She\u2019d managed to piss off some people in her department. She was cynical about finding a job at the end of the master\u2019s-Ph.D.-postdoc tunnel. She left academia, too.\n\nSo began a footloose few years of bouncing around Europe, of trying on various lives, every juncture a dice roll. In Hungary, they would have to abandon their plans to open a hostel. In Spain, Davis would be diagnosed with a rare spine-fusing condition called ankylosing spondylitis that could make it excruciating to move. In England, she and Whittington would have to leave a hotel because they dared ask a second time for a refill of the coffee pods in their room.\n\nWhat are the chances? That a lapsed luck philosopher meets an unluckiness magnet on Tinder and falls for her? That she falls for him? That she gets diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis? That they lose their accommodations over a coffee-pod dispute? It was the question Whittington the philosopher was initially pushing against. The ankylosing spondylitis could feel like luck in terms of both probability and possibility. Between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of Americans are thought to have it: a short stick Davis easily could not have drawn. Clear data is a bit harder to come by on ejection from hotels on coffee-related grounds. How much does that depend on the guest\u2019s demeanor, the manager\u2019s mood?\n\nThe trouble is that even when we know the chances of chance events, we\u2019re lousy at understanding them. Flip a coin a bunch of times. As soon as you start seeing heads over and over again, you start imagining that tails must be next \u2014 and when it isn\u2019t, your spine tingle gets a little more pronounced, as if you\u2019re witnessing a tiny miracle rather than a very predictable sort of unpredictability. This is the gambler\u2019s fallacy: mistakenly thinking that one coin toss has any power or influence over the next. You can feel that instinct at play when looking at this string of 60 digits, courtesy of the mathematician Joseph Mazur:\n\n458391843333834534555555555555185803245032174022234935499238\n\nThe first thing that hits our eyes is that long string of fives. That seems significant, too many repeats to be without meaning. But the digits are randomly generated. We do the same thing in images, finding faces in clouds and Rorschach blots. We create narrative links between unrelated events.\n\nBut not always. There are surprising patterns that are in fact patterns. In the 1980s, when Larry Bird was on fire, swishing basket after basket, some eminent psychologists debunked such lucky streaks. Analyzing Philadelphia 76ers games, Boston Celtics free throws, and some shooting experiments set up with Cornell\u2019s varsity team seemed to show that the outcome of one shot was independent of the last. The Larry Bird effect, the professors declared, was an illusion \u2014 a cognitive mistake. Athletes and fans didn\u2019t believe it for a second. They knew the hot hand was real. They\u2019d seen it with their own eyes or felt it with their own fingertips.\n\nThen, in 2018, they were vindicated. Two economists reanalyzed the basketball stats, and realized that the initial study had itself contained a miscalculation. In the original study, the psychologists had expected that if a player\u2019s track record of making a basket after another basket looked the same as his scoring overall, it would be evidence that the hot-hand effect is mere illusion. They didn\u2019t seem to realize that if the streaks were random, then the first value (chances of making a basket after other baskets) would have been lower than the second value (the chance of making a basket after any sort of shot), which meant the similarities they\u2019d seen in those two data points was in fact evidence that the hot-hand effect was real. Thus, the \u201chot-hand fallacy\u201d became known as \u201cthe hot-hand fallacy fallacy,\u201d a debunking debunked.\n\nBut even if the hot-hand effect is real, does it truly count as luck? Or is it simply a mix of skill and psychology, the confidence that comes with being on a roll, the way our narratives can shift our behavior and change our world? The framing definitely had an effect, too. In 1989 two puckish statisticians presented the results of a decade of collecting coincidences. Their notebooks bulged with unexpected intersections. A woman had won the lottery twice in a span of 180 days. Two spouses and their child all had birthdays on the 11th day of different months. The statisticians wrote down every eerie or surprising story they could find. But many of these convergences weren\u2019t nearly as strange as they seemed. \u201cThe law of truly large numbers,\u201d the professors called it. If there\u2019s a one-in-a-million chance of winning a lottery and a million people enter, the fact that someone rakes it in isn\u2019t surprising. What is surprising is when that person is you.\n\n\n\nIn other words, if luck lurks in calculations of chance, it all depends on whose perspective you\u2019re inhabiting. Probabilities can say much, but they\u2019re percentages, dispassionate as the weather. What most luck theorists can agree on is that it is predicated on us caring \u2014 not just in a general sort of way, but about the fate of something or someone. It could be a city or a sports team, a language or a bacterium, an earwig or a human being. Luck demands a protagonist.\n\nWhittington and Davis knew that Operation Hungary was a crapshoot. The quest had a storybook quality: The housing market in Edinburgh was rough, but they found a fixer-upper in Hungary, where Davis\u2019s forebears were from. It was several hours outside of Budapest in the middle of a magical forest, its hollows snuffling with badgers. They envisioned a farm-hostel. It was off the beaten path \u2014 but they\u2019d tried the beaten path. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough money or job security at the time to play it safe, so we had to take a long-shot gamble,\u201d Whittington said.\n\nIt was a disaster from the start, as if the whole project were overshadowed by the curse of her volatile grandmother\u2019s rings. Davis had gotten a small inheritance from her, which she\u2019d put toward a van for the trip, but almost immediately the vehicle began to have undiagnosable problems, emitting a weird grinding sound if she turned left, shaking violently if she tried to go over 40 miles per hour. She took it to mechanics, but they couldn\u2019t figure it out. The day they were meant to leave for Hungary, the thing wouldn\u2019t start; had they been parked on the street, the automobile association\u2019s jumpstart would\u2019ve been free, but because it was in a driveway, the guy had no choice but to charge them 150 pounds.\n\nThe construction crew they hired trashed their house rather than fixing it. They found themselves sleeping on the floor in a strange demolition zone, toilet leaking, walls full of incomprehensible drill holes \u2014 a cross between a lean-to and a loofah. The pandemic arrived. Davis discovered she was pregnant. They needed to leave the country before borders began to close. They tried to sell the bewitched van as scrap but the local official who\u2019d usually take a bribe to help with the paperwork had just gone to jail.\n\nThe philosopher Ronald Dworkin makes a distinction between two kinds of luck. \u201cOption luck\u201d encompasses the gambles we choose to take \u2014 throwing a whole week\u2019s pay into the pot for a craps game, say \u2014 while \u201cbrute luck\u201d finds us of its own accord, without us sitting down at the betting table. By that standard, you might see the Hungary debacle as predictable, a choice they made knowing it might not work out. Sometimes, Whittington wasn\u2019t even sure the trashed house involved luck at all. For contractors to charge more than their estimate is almost a universal law; for them to make a mess that you then might pay them to clean up is hardly unheard of. When he imagined the possible worlds close to our own, the likelihood of something going wrong with their rural Hungarian fixer-upper seemed pretty robust.\n\nThere were lucky moments, too, crazy things that worked against all odds. They drove across Europe, dodging the quicksand of COVID travel restrictions. They smuggled a favorite chicken into England in a lunchbox, hoping it wouldn\u2019t cluck. And yet that didn\u2019t always counterbalance the unease Davis felt, a nagging sense that things could have played out differently. Here they were, two millennial Ph.D.\u2019s in a pandemic, unemployed, their Hungarian farm-hostel dream foiled, living temporarily in Whittington\u2019s mum\u2019s house. A baby girl was born. They got married. They taught English in Spain. They decided to move to China, where the pay for such jobs was better. The company that was supposed to take them the three hours to the airport could only send a car that was too small for them and their luggage. The Chinese government wouldn\u2019t issue their daughter a visa because the middle name on her birth certificate had been left off her British passport. The odd thing about luck is that it can encompass both the trivial and the existential \u2014 and an unbroken chain of the former can, in the moment, start to feel like the latter.\n\nThe moving around was exhausting. Sometimes they fought. If she was prone to mishaps, he could be frustratingly bad about making plans. In retrospect, he wishes he\u2019d been more proactive at times, more helpful. Still they stuck together when a weaker marriage might\u2019ve come apart. At times, though, the absurdity became too much. Davis remembered a moment when Whittington became almost angry about her luck. \u201cHe \u2014 seriously \u2014 was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say this in my life, Holly, but I think you need a witch doctor or some sort of alternative religious practitioner. To uncurse you or something,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I don\u2019t understand how this keeps happening, but this has got to stop.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe was taken aback. Her atheist husband, who\u2019d written a dissertation about luck in the nerdiest, most jargon-filled, secular sort of way \u2014 luck presented almost as symbolic logic \u2014 was telling her she needed to get some kind of occult help? \u201cHe was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve gotta rewrite the whole thing now.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn order to test their definitions, philosophers often dream up thought experiments, purified world-in-a-jar stories, unmarred by the possible complexities of real life. In \u201cWhat Luck Is Not,\u201d the 2008 paper that sent Whittington down this rabbit hole, Jennifer Lackey of Northwestern University asks us to consider Ramona, a demolition worker. Ramona is about to blow up an old warehouse but doesn\u2019t know that a mouse has chewed through the wires connecting button to fuse. Right at the last second, though, a co-worker happens to hang his jacket in that precise spot, the metal hanger conducting the electricity that otherwise would\u2019ve been cut off. Kaboom.\n\nLackey uses this story to argue that a lack of control isn\u2019t necessary for an event to be lucky; Ramona\u2019s, after all, was still the finger on the detonator. But for the lay reader, more telling than the question of Ramona\u2019s agency is Lackey\u2019s description of her own microfiction. It is \u201cclearly riddled with luck.\u201d One test of what luck actually means, she implies \u2014 which she keeps using to kick the tires of other scholars\u2019 definitions \u2014 is our gut. Like the famous Supreme Court justice\u2019s definition of porn, we recognize it when we see it.\n\nBut look closely at Lackey\u2019s thought experiment and you might wonder whether the presence of luck depends on how she\u2019s told this story. After all, what makes Ramona lucky in our eyes but not her own is how much we know: about the mouse, about the co-worker, about the hanger. Cut a detail, add a detail, and watch the luck start flickering in and out. Luck lies deep in our narrative-loving, pattern-seeking brains, in our ability to shift the variables around, to pull a Rashomon and tell the story a different way. It\u2019s precisely this narrative alchemy that helped convince Steven Hales, a philosophy professor at the Commonwealth University of Pennsylvania, that luck is a myth. \u201cThe Guinness World Record holder for being struck by lightning? It turns out it\u2019s a park ranger, and the guy\u2019s been hit by lightning seven times,\u201d he said. \u201cSo is he a super-unlucky man or is he very lucky to have survived seven lightning strikes?\u201d\n\nBut our hunch that there was some kind of luck at play \u2014 good, bad, or both \u2014 is hard to shake. Luck emerges from a sense of contingency, an awareness of the myriad possible worlds that lurk close to our own. We invoke it when we hear our inner chorus of what-ifs, glimpse the infinite maze of paths all forking and crisscrossing. After Sauder published an article called \u201cA Sociology of Luck\u201d in 2020, exhorting his fellow social scientists to stop ignoring the concept, scholars responded, their studies full of such close calls. One looked at the role of chance encounters in working-class Britons\u2019 careers. Another looked at how people saw luck in surviving a car accident or breast cancer. There\u2019s a certain randomness to where we end up, which scholars like Sauder and Frank hope can function as an empathy machine. If someone else\u2019s life can take a turn toward destitution through no fault of their own, yours could too.\n\nThat precarity is real, though you might quibble over whether to call it luck \u2014 and might not be consistent in your quibbling. Even children, when asked about why a certain stuffed animal works as a lucky charm, sometimes give a rational, adult-sounding answer: It gives them confidence, they\u2019ve told Jacqueline Woolley, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies children\u2019s views about luck. There\u2019s a kind of half-belief there, a version of Pascal\u2019s wager. They aren\u2019t fully committed to the supernatural, but they haven\u2019t totally given up on it either. They\u2019re acknowledging a mixture of powerlessness and control.\n\nEven those who\u2019ve spent years trying to pin luck down can do that same cognitive dance, moving between the magical and the logical. Whittington didn\u2019t believe in the curse, and yet it kept popping into his possible-worlds-filled mind. Becoming a father in 2021 added another twist. He and Davis named their daughter Lilith. She\u2019s 4 now and a minor terror in the way that toddlers often are, screaming for spaghetti, throwing rice in little sticky fistfuls, pulling the cat\u2019s tail even after her parents tell her not to and maybe precisely because her parents tell her not to. She\u2019s also one of the best things that\u2019s ever happened to him. \u201cI cannot imagine a world without Lilith,\u201d he said.\n\nHe knows he sounds like a teenage boy high on Nietzsche. But wasn\u2019t his daughter potentially the product of events he\u2019d previously seen as unlucky?\n\nIf his dad hadn\u2019t died, he wouldn\u2019t have left philosophy. If he hadn\u2019t left philosophy, he might not have been making that internal pact about whether or not he\u2019d stay in Edinburgh. If he hadn\u2019t made that internal pact, he wouldn\u2019t have matched with Davis. If he hadn\u2019t been there to match with Davis, that sperm wouldn\u2019t have met that egg. And on and on and on. Would Lilith be the perfect, idiosyncratic Lilith that she is if she hadn\u2019t been conceived in a deconstructed house in rural Hungary? Would Lilith be Lilith if she hadn\u2019t first gone to day care in Spain and then in China?\n\nHe knows that someone might see danger in this kind of thinking; it could lead to an unseemly valorization of suffering. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I should be grateful my father died when he did, because that was obviously horrible,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t really keep thinking of himself and Davis as unlucky, either. You might say he\u2019d inadvertently taken the psychologist Richard Wiseman\u2019s advice, transmuting bad luck into good. Davis, too, felt the shift. She had left all responsibility of online forms and travel plans to Whittington. She had locked her grandma\u2019s rings away in a box. She didn\u2019t look at it, didn\u2019t touch it. Maybe that broke the curse. Or maybe that just liberated her from the past, from seeing the volatility of her grandmother on her own finger and in her own life.\n\nSettling in one place helped. So did her latest blast of therapy. She\u2019d had a breakdown after weaning Lilith and had gotten in touch with someone she\u2019d known back in Scotland \u2014 through \u201cfeminist neo-pagan gathering things\u201d \u2014 and those online sessions helped. \u201cWe had had such a tumultuous and difficult couple years there we got kind of trapped in a lot of the stories we were telling ourselves,\u201d she said. The universe no longer seemed quite so malevolent. It started to seem like things were just happening rather than happening to them.\n\nThings began going unexpectedly right. When she went in for IVF, in the hope of having a second child, doctors kept saying the odds were stacked against her. She was 40, of \u201cadvanced maternal age.\u201d She had a history of uterine fibroids. She had an autoimmune disease. Her ovarian reserves were low. Her body didn\u2019t respond to the hormones that were supposed to stimulate a kind of superovulation. Other patients in the clinic came out of their retrievals muttering worriedly about \u201conly\u201d getting eight eggs. Davis only got one.\n\nYet, against all odds, it worked. \u201cWe finally got some luck,\u201d she said. That didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t half-belive in the curse. They still planned to go see the Zodiac specialist a friend of theirs recommended to help choose the most auspicious date for the C-section.\n\nEven if Whittington wanted to know what in their lives was luck, that was something all his research on the subject couldn\u2019t necessarily tell him. Luck, in his work, is often \u201cepistemically closed off\u201d \u2014 philosophy-speak for a black box. You can theorize about how razor close our world is to one with a radically different outcome, you can dream up examples to test your definitions, but when it comes to real life, those forking paths lie mostly beyond our perception. You can\u2019t be sure whether you\u2019ve been lucky or not, because, he said, in many cases, \u201cWe often don\u2019t know how the universe would or could have been arranged.\u201d We wonder how our lives might\u2019ve been different, we arm ourselves with amulets and psychological tricks, we get rid of our grandmother\u2019s cursed rings, but we can never be sure. We can\u2019t access the bullets that whiz by us unseen."

            "full_content": "\u201cTariff reciprocity\u201d sounds good, right? Not to anyone who has studied U.S. trade policy. As the seminal authority on trade, the former Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, recently put it to Tucker Carlson: \u201cIf we just do zero for zero, we\u2019re going to get wiped out. We\u2019re going to end up with nothing, because we don\u2019t have the structure to compete on that basis.\u201d\n\nLighthizer is correct. For over a century, U.S. tariff acts have empowered presidents to adjust tariffs to \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d that effectively discriminate against U.S. exports. None of it works. Setting tariffs in reaction to policies in other countries doesn\u2019t work, as demonstrated through generations of U.S. trade policy. The historical lessons from reciprocity efforts show much more pernicious effects on the domestic zeitgeist, and that reciprocity is incompatible with a pro-tariff policy of protection and revenue.\n\nReciprocity is immoral, anticompetitive, and leads to the foreign entanglements President George Washington cautioned against. Its ill effects were best summed up in 1903 by a statement of principles adopted by the American Protective Tariff League:\n\nReciprocity in competitive products by treaty is unsound in principle, pernicious in practice, and is contrary alike to the principle of protection, to the fair treatment of domestic producers, and to the friendly relations with foreign countries. Reciprocity is neither ethical nor economic, since it seeks to benefit some industries by the sacrifice of others, which is the essence of injustice. As at present advocated, reciprocity is a policy of favoritism. It would tend to array industry against industry and section against section at home, and forment industrial retaliation and political antagonism abroad. Such a policy would open the door to the grossest favoritism in legislation, promote the growth of a corrupting lobby, and increase the power of debasing bossism. Such a policy has no justification in economics, statesmanship, ethics, or good politics. True American policy is protection of all the opportunities and possibilities of the American market for American enterprise, and fair, equal treatment for all other countries, namely the equal right to compete for American business in the American market by the payment of American wages. This alone is honest protection, good Republicanism, and the true American Policy.\n\nUnfortunately, the League\u2019s cautionary warnings failed to carry the day. But history has since proved them right.\n\nWhat are tariffs for? The first Congress of the United States provided their answer in the first sentence of the first Tariff Act, passed July 4, 1789:\n\nWhereas it is necessary for the support of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States, and the encouragement and protection of manufacturers, that duties be laid on goods, wares, and merchandise imported.\n\nTrump and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick know this history. Both men spoke during the campaign\u2014at length, and in front of hostile audiences\u2014about the importance of tariffs for revenue and protection.\n\nRevenue and protection are not incompatible goals for tariff policy. Since the dawn of civilization, tariff schedules\u2014lists of tariff rates for every imaginable product\u2014have been posted at every civilization\u2019s ports.\n\nSome products\u2019 tariff rates will have a revenue effect, some will have a protective effect, and some rates produce a bit of both for a given product. You can even enjoy both revenue and protective tariff rates on a single product through the use of what are called tariff rate quotas (TRQs). With a TRQ, you have an \u201cin-quota\u201d rate that can be a revenue tariff, and then an \u201cover-quota\u201d rate that is protective.\n\nTariffs were the preferred form of state revenue through most of history, including in the United States. In 1815, Congress asked Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas to propose a budget for the United States, with instructions that two-thirds of the needed $24 million in federal revenue come from tariffs. Dallas returned a detailed memorandum guiding on how to use tariffs for revenue and protection, which informed the \u201cDallas Tariff\u201d (Tariff Act of 1816) and created a lasting template for U.S. tariffs for generations. Nowhere were preferential tariff rates for certain countries contemplated.\n\nIn March 1824, when he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Henry Clay would go on to give one of the most famous speeches in Congressional history. Rejecting the premise that reciprocity would ever be possible with a foreign nation, Clay went to pains to demonstrate the futility of counting on export markets, especially for agricultural producers. Clay launched what became known as \u201cthe American System\u201d: a combination of protective tariffs, federal funding for internal improvements, and a central bank.\n\nThe Whig Party, followed by the Republican Party, would largely carry on the American System into the 20th century. The United States would implement only two \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d treaties between 1789 and 1891, and both provide cautionary lessons for today.\n\nIn 1854, like a bully pawning off a homework assignment to a weaker student, Britain successfully brow-beat the United States into its first \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff agreement, a list of duty-free Canadian commodities. This treaty also involved plans for the U.S. annexation of Canada and a subsequent drive to replace America\u2019s first income tax with tariffs, making it remarkably timely.\n\nThe story begins almost a decade before the treaty\u2019s ratification, after the British Parliament infamously embraced free-trade policy with repeal of the \u201ccorn laws.\u201d With Britain\u2019s tariff on corn mostly abolished, and the tariff on lumber cut in half, Canada\u2019s exports to her Mother Country collapsed. British merchants abandoned Canada for grain from the Danube and lumber from the Baltic.\n\nCanadians were in trouble. On May 12, 1846, the Canadian parliament passed a resolution asking Britain to open negotiations with the United States for a reciprocal tariff treaty for Canada. Recognizing the distress in Canada, Britain authorized the power for the Canadian provinces to set their own tariff rates. Canada promptly equalized its tariffs for the UK and U.S., seen as a necessary first step to preferential rates with the United States.\n\nThe British and Canadian legislatures felt they had a solid chance. The United States had maintained protectionist tariffs for most of the preceding decades back to the repeal of Jefferson\u2019s Embargo Acts. This changed when Democrats replaced the Whig\u2019s protectionist Tariff of 1842 with the \u201cWalker Tariff\u201d of 1846, named after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Walker. The Walker Tariff reduced rates on all products and completely eliminated \u201cspecific tariffs,\u201d which are assessed on volume (that is, so many dollars per unit), not the importer\u2019s declared value. With the Walker Tariff, all tariff rates were reverted to simple ad valorem percentages, assessed on whatever invoice the importer provides. Using ad valorem instead of specific tariffs typically substitutes protection for revenue. As Henry Clay remarked at the time, \u201cIt is evident that on the ad-valorem principle, it is the foreigner who virtually fixes the actual amount of the duty paid. It is the foreigner who, by fixing that value, virtually legislates for us\u2014and that in a case where his interest is directly opposed to that of our revenue.\u201d\n\nDespite the less protectionist Congress and the receptive Walker, there was insufficient interest in Washington to generate the momentum necessary for a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada. In 1848, a bill was introduced in the U.S. House, but stalled.\n\nThe economic situation continued to deteriorate in Canada. Lord Elgin, Canada\u2019s governor general, wrote to the Colonial Minister that \u201cproperty in most of the Canadian towns, and more especially in the capital, has fallen fifty per cent in value within the last three years. Three-fourths of the commercial men are bankrupt, owing to free-trade.\u201d\n\nDespite the dire situation in Canada, Britain proceeded to repeal her navigation laws, a significant blow to the maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, which made use of preferential cabotage to promote a Canadian carrying and shipbuilding industry.\n\nThen, in late 1849, just as Congress was preparing to address slavery in the Mexican Cession, a dramatic development in Canada grabbed headlines: A group of prominent Montrealers published the Montreal Annexation Manifesto, calling for the peaceful separation of the Province of Canada from Britain and union with the United States\u200b. This declaration sent shockwaves through the political press on both sides of the border.\n\nThe manifesto laid blame at Britain\u2019s embrace of global free trade as to why U.S. annexation was necessary: \u201cThe reversal of the ancient policy of Great Britain, whereby she withdrew from the colonies their wonted protection in her markets, has produced the most disastrous effects upon Canada. In surveying the actual condition of the country, what but ruin or rapid decay meets the eye.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s response? Stiffen her resolve and strengthen free trade by creating a new export market for Canadian products through a \u201creciprocal\u201d trade deal with the United States.\n\nIt was very much a stick-and-carrot approach, heavy on the stick. On July 5, 1852, Britain sent a communication to the United States announcing that ships from the Royal Navy had been dispatched to assert fishing rights in a disputed 1818 treaty. American fishing vessels found violating Britain\u2019s interpretation of the treaty would be seized. The United States sent Commodore Matthew Perry and the steam frigate Mississippi in response, but finding six armed British cruisers, the Maine and Massachusetts fishermen retreated.\n\nThe message was received; it was known in Washington \u201cthat Great Britain would not consider the settlement of the fishery question aside from reciprocal trade.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s fisheries gambit was further aided by the Southern delegation in Congress, which was alarmed at the prospect of Canada joining the United States as a non-slave state. According to Republican Senators Jacob Collamer of Vermont and Zachariah Chandler of Michigan, \u201capprehension on the part of the South, in 1854, was what brought about the treaty.\u201d\n\nOn June 5, 1854, Britain succeeded. U.S. Secretary of State William Marcy and Elgin signed the Reciprocity Treaty. It provided for the mutual enjoyment of the Atlantic coast fisheries north of the 36th parallel, reciprocal free trade in a number of agricultural commodities, and gave the United States free navigation of the St. Lawrence River and of the Canadian canals.\n\nAs would become the pattern throughout American history, however, the \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d agreement benefited the other country at America\u2019s expense. Representative Frederick Pike, a Republican from Maine, in a speech to Congress in 1862, laid out the results: \u201cIn 1854, we exported about three dollars for one of imports, and now, in the last two years, have imported about a million and a half more than our exports.\u201d\n\nPike described the immoral nature of how the reciprocity treaty pitted producers and states against each other: \u201cMassachusetts was willing to sacrifice the interests of Maine, if thereby she could get the cheap wood of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\u201d\n\nPike condemned the foreign influence and money behind the reciprocity campaign: \u201cIt is well known that Canada spent considerable sums to aid in lubricating [the treaty\u2019s] passage through the channels of official routine in this city.\u201d Even today, the Government of Canada continues to spend money throughout the United States attacking U.S. tariffs.\n\nBy 1864, Canadian exports to the United States benefiting from duty-free treatment were double that of the United States to Canada.\n\nUltimately, what would kill the Reciprocity Treaty would be its interference with much-needed tariffs for revenue. Congress had passed the first federal income tax in 1862, which managed to provide for nearly a quarter of the Civil War\u2019s revenue, despite relying on voluntary compliance. But by 1864, the United States was $2.6 billion in debt with only $858,309 of cash on hand.\n\nRevenue was needed, and Republicans were particularly incensed that reciprocity with Canada compelled the Treasury to forgo tariff revenue while collecting a domestic income tax: \u201cThere existed a feeling that the American producer should not be loaded with taxes, while at the same time the Canadian producer, who competed with him, contributed nothing to the revenue of our Government.\u201d Several senators made statements in the chamber decrying the admission of duty-free imports while a domestic income tax system existed. Chandler:\n\nThe citizens of Michigan are largely taxed for the support of this Government, taxed directly and indirectly ; taxed upon their income, and upon their products, and upon their consumption ; taxed in every way, while the inhabitants of Canada raise precisely the same articles, are engaged in the same business, and send their products here to compete with ours without contributing one dollar to the support of this Government.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, Congress voted to give the one year\u2019s notice per the treaty\u2019s terms to withdraw, and on March 17, 1866, the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada was terminated.\n\nThe termination would prove a happy ending for both the United States and Canada. The following year, on July 1, 1867, realizing they could not count on Britain nor the United States, the British provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick united into one federation called the Dominion of Canada. Canada\u2019s first prime minister, Sir John A. MacDonald, would go on to implement Henry Clay\u2019s American System for British North America. His government campaigned on a \u201cNational Policy\u201d that embraced protective tariffs and Canada\u2019s own transcontinental railway. The United States and Canada would spend the rest of the nineteenth century rapidly industrializing, raising the standard of living in both countries ahead of Europe, all under their respective protectionist tariffs. And indeed, by 1911, Canada out-protectionismed America, rejecting a second reciprocity treaty that year that had been pushed by the United States.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hawaii had first proposed a Reciprocity Treaty with the United States in 1855, but the effort was plagued with similar problems to Canada\u2019s advocacy and did not benefit from the extra push by Britain.\n\nStill, while the Canada Treaty was adopted partially by interests in both Washington and London on quelling annexation talk, the same cannot be said of Hawaiian Reciprocity. As Senator Justin Morrill (R-VT) said in a March 18, 1875 speech, \u201cThe most potent argument now offered [in support of Hawaiian reciprocity] is the same suggestion that has heretofore been most prominently presented, as in 1855 and 1869, namely, that if we do not make this arrangement\u2014so feeble are their numbers, so lamentably deficient are their resources\u2014they will be compelled to lean upon some other power. Great Britain or New Zealand will snatch them up and they will be lost to us forever.\u201d\n\nMorrill still cautioned about the bad precedent of Republicans supporting a reciprocal tariff deal: \u201cWhat may be done with King Kalakaua may be done with the Queen of Great Britain or the Autocrat of Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Hawaiians (or more accurately, the sugar-plantation owners) were ultimately successful, with Hawaiian tariff-free reciprocity effective September 9, 1876. Joseph N\u0101wah\u012b, a Hawaiian legislator, publicly predicted that the treaty would be \u201ca nation-snatching treaty,\u201d stating, \u201cThe Treaty of Reciprocity becoming law will be the first step of annexation later on, and the kingdom, its flag, its independence and its people will become naught.\u201d\n\nA modern observer may readily conclude that this treaty was a \u201csuccess\u201d insofar as Hawaii is now a U.S. state. After all, if reciprocity is a mere prelude to annexation, then ultimately, reciprocity is not incompatible with tariffs for revenue and protection.\n\nBut this glosses over the history and chronology. The annexation of Hawaii was not a smooth commercial union akin to the Alaska Purchase of 1867. As Congress would acknowledge in the Apology Resolution of 1993, the Kingdom of Hawaii was \u201coverthrown\u201d (Congress\u2019s words) with U.S. military support.\n\nWhether reciprocity was a necessary stepping stone to annexation is beyond the scope of this article. But a few observations are warranted. Reciprocity\u2019s overwhelming benefit to Hawaii was for Hawaiian sugar exports, and on the American side, to sugar refiners in San Francisco. But there were losers: namely sugar-cane plantations in Louisiana and Florida, and western sugar-beet farmers, who were supplying approximately one-tenth of U.S. demand.\n\nAnd as always, hard lessons were learned about the inadvisability of international supply chains. After the Hawaiian Reciprocity Treaty was ratified, between 1875 and 1890, U.S. consumption of Hawaiian sugar increased over 1,400 percent, cementing Hawaii\u2019s economic dependence on U.S. exports. But in 1890, Congress was flush with more revenue than Congress knew what to do with. William McKinley, then chairman of the U.S. Ways and Means Committee, wanted to increase tariffs on manufactured goods, but was under tremendous pressure to offset those tariff increases with tariff cuts elsewhere. McKinley chose sugar, eliminating the tariff of two cents per pound (64 cents per pound today). Hawaii\u2019s duty-free concession on sugar was now worthless, devastating Hawaii economically. U.S. sugar importers immediately switched to Cuba, while American planters in Hawaii set about plotting the overthrow of the queen.\n\nShortly after their successful revolution, the United States restored the sugar duty in 1894, seriously damaging Cuba\u2019s newfound prosperity. Per the tariff historian John Dobson, \u201cIn a few months, Cuban revolutionaries had capitalized on the discontent of the impoverished Cuban peasants and had renewed a bloody fight for independence begun 25 years before. This conflict ultimately drew the United States into a war with Spain in 1898\u2026 Thus, the seemingly innocent juggling of the sugar duty had important consequences for the United States and for the world.\u201d\n\nUltimately, McKinley\u2019s 1890 nullification of Hawaiian reciprocity seems to have been a necessary step towards the country\u2019s annexation.\n\nA leading figure drawing the Republican Party, and the United States, away from isolationism and defense of the home market above all was James Blaine. A Congressman for Maine, Blaine was elected as Speaker of the House for the 41st Congress beginning in 1869. After President Ulysses Grant selected protectionist Morrill to be his Treasury Secretary, Blaine was appointed to Morrill\u2019s Senate seat. Blaine, like the rest of Maine\u2019s delegation, had been opposed to the reciprocity treaty with Canada, but his views changed. Nominated by President James Garfield to be secretary of state in 1881, Blaine embraced reciprocal trade as a means to get ahead of European involvement in the Western Hemisphere. He negotiated tariff reciprocity treaties with Mexico in 1882, and with the Dominican Republic and Spain (for Cuba and Puerto Rico) in 1884. However, protectionists in the Senate managed to stall consideration of Blaine\u2019s treaties. None would be implemented.\n\nInternational intrigue resulting from the Tariff Act of 1890 did not end with sugar and Hawaii. The Republican Party was now splitting into factions, those singularly focused on protecting the home market versus those led by Blaine who saw reciprocity as a means to create an American empire.\n\nAfter the Democratic interlude of President Grover Cleveland\u2019s first term, Blaine returned as secretary of state in 1890, convening the First International Conference of American States as one of his first orders of business. Blaine went so far as to push for a hemispheric customs union at the Conference, but the idea had little support in Congress or from the other countries.\n\nNevertheless, in Congress, Blaine would win an important battle against McKinley that would cement reciprocity\u2019s future ruination of protection. During Congressional consideration of the Tariff Act of 1890, Blaine was victorious against McKinley over the inclusion of a reciprocity clause in the Tariff Act of 1890 (hereinafter, the Blaine Clause).\n\nThe Blaine Clause did seem innocent enough. While McKinley\u2019s Tariff eliminated the duty on sugar, molasses, tea, coffee, and hides, Blaine\u2019s Clause authorized the President to reinstate the tariffs against countries that treated U.S. exports in a \u201creciprocally unequal and unreasonable\u201d fashion. McKinley, known as the \u201cNapoleon of Protection\u201d, opposed the Blaine Clause as an improper delegation of Congressional authority. President Benjamin Harrison, however, sided with Blaine, which secured Blaine\u2019s reciprocity clause in the Senate version of the bill, despite McKinley\u2019s resistance. The so-called \u201cMcKinley Tariff\u201d would become famous for containing the Blaine Clause despite McKinley\u2019s opposition.\n\nBlaine, by all accounts a master orator, was successful in persuading even some ardent protectionists that reciprocity was compatible with protection. In October 1890, the American Protective Tariff League published a column quoting from a speech Blaine gave in Canton, with the writer saying it \u201cdiscredits forever and absolutely the Free Trade statements that Mr. Blaine had become indifferent to Protection, or personally hostile to members of the Republican party who did not accept or approve of his views upon Reciprocity.\u201d The column assured protectionists that Blaine would only sacrifice revenue-tariffs (tariffs on certain commodities for which we were import-dependent) to promote exports, and never protective tariffs. This seems impossible to square with Blaine\u2019s desire for a hemispheric customs union.\n\nMarketing reciprocity as compatible with protection would be a major rhetorical strategy for globalist Republicans in the following decades.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1892, under Harrison, Blaine used his clause to secure 10 reciprocity treaties. Key agreements included those with Brazil, Spain (for Cuba and Puerto Rico), and several Latin American nations like the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\n\nBlaine did not think annexation of all these countries was worthwhile. He genuinely believed in promoting international trade in the Western Hemisphere for its own sake, for the promotion of foreign entanglements. Blaine wrote privately to Harrison that only Hawaii, Cuba, and Puerto Rico \u201care of value enough to be taken.\u201d\n\nThese reciprocity agreements set a terrible precedent, as unlike the Canada and Hawaii treaties, these new ones were not \u201ctreaties\u201d per the Constitution's Treaty Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2). They did not require Senate approval, a novel executive power shift. The president would merely be using the Blaine Clause\u2019s delegated power from Congress. This clause was challenged in court by an importer forced to pay duties per the President\u2019s invocation of the clause, but the clause was upheld by unanimous Supreme Court judgment in Field v. Clark (1892).\n\nBlaines\u2019s treaties were immediately followed by the Panic of 1893, and Blaine\u2019s health rapidly declined, leading to his death that year. Democrats dismantled McKinley\u2019s tariff, replacing it with their Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, effectively nullifying Blaine\u2019s agreements and removing the clause.\n\nThe 1896 Republican Party platform declared \u201cProtection and Reciprocity are twin measures.\u201d And McKinley\u2019s views on reciprocity, or at least the president\u2019s use of tariff powers, had apparently changed by 1896 as he ran for the White House. In a recorded campaign speech from 1896, he declared, \u201cOur creed embraces an honest dollar, an untarnished national credit, adequate revenues for the uses of the government, protection to labor and industry, preservation of the home market, and reciprocity which will extend our foreign markets.\u201d\n\nHistory has proven that protection and reciprocity are not, in fact, twin measures, or at all compatible, as Henry Clay had so eloquently demonstrated back in 1824.\n\nBut the 1896 Republican Party had clearly subordinated the home market emphasis, despite still giving it a nod. The platform continued:\n\nResolved, That we favor such reciprocity measures as will enable the United States to secure a proper share of the markets of the world for the products of our labor and our manufactures, and to that end we favor the cession of our right to impose retaliatory duties upon the importations from any country which imposes unequal or discriminating duties upon the products of American labor or manufactures.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s 1897 Dingley Tariff Act raised duties to a record 57 percent, yet included a reciprocity provision allowing negotiated trade deals. Treaties with France and others followed, though protectionism still held sway. Nelson Aldrich, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, championed protection, at least rhetorically.\n\nBy 1901, McKinley\u2019s final speech\u2014days before his assassination\u2014pushed further, advocating tariff flexibility to boost exports. Theodore Roosevelt, succeeding him, initially maintained this balance. His administration negotiated reciprocity with Cuba in 1902, cutting duties by 20 percent, but faced resistance from protectionist \u201cOld Guard\u201d Republicans.\n\nWith the rise of the giant American \u201ctrusts\u201d (monopolies and oligopolies) during this period, public sympathy for tariff protection was at a low. While the same Republican Congress that had passed the McKinley Tariff of 1890 also passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, Republican Presidents had failed to adequately make use of its antitrust authorities. In retrospect, failure to more vigorously enforce the Sherman Act surely led to the destruction of protection.\n\nWilliam Howard Taft\u2019s presidency (1909\u20131913) marked the peak of this tension. The 1909 Payne-Aldrich Tariff aimed to lower rates, but Senate revisions led by Aldrich kept duties high (averaging 40 percent), alienating progressive Republicans who favored reciprocity and reform.\n\nCementing the shift in thinking, it was now Republicans pushing for reciprocity even with Canada. Taft\u2019s push for a Canadian reciprocity agreement in 1911\u2014proposing mutual tariff cuts\u2014split the party. Progressives like Robert La Follette backed it for cheaper goods and markets, while protectionists saw it as betrayal. It was Canada\u2019s rejection in 1911, fearing U.S. dominance, that killed the deal.\n\nBy 1912, the Republican split deepened. Roosevelt ran as a Progressive, splitting the vote and giving Democrats a trifecta with uber-globalist Woodrow Wilson as President. The 1912 Democratic Party Platform led with the proposition that protectionist tariffs were actually unconstitutional, a long since discredited argument made by Confederates decades earlier.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson wasted no time working with \u201cFather of the Income Tax\u201d Cordell Hull, then a Tennessee Congressman at Ways and Means, to eviscerate America\u2019s longstanding protective tariff. They did so with their radical Revenue Act of 1913, drastically slashing tariffs and substituting that revenue with the new income tax and Internal Revenue Service. The protective tariff was now fully destroyed.\n\nThe First World War temporarily held off a flood of imports. When that surge did take off in 1919, wiping out American farmers, Democrats were eviscerated at the polls. In 1920, the GOP swept Congress and the Presidency. The 67th Congress wasted no time in restoring tariffs for revenue and protection with the Emergency Tariff Act of 1921 and then the more sweeping Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922. The 1922 bill did a number of things:\n\nIt raised tariffs on a wide range of goods, including chinaware, pig iron, textiles, sugar, and rails, restoring duties to the high levels of 1907.\n\nIt increased tariffs from 60 to 400 percent on dyes, chemicals, silk and rayon textiles, and hardware;\n\nThe average ad valorem tariff rate for dutiable imports rose to about 38.5 percent\n\nIt was an incredible success. In 1923, tariff revenue surged to over $582 million, an increase of more than $200 million from the Democrats\u2019 tariff. The Roaring \u201820s ensued:\n\nGross National Product from 1923 to 1928 grew roughly three percent annually;\n\nThe national war debt by was shrunk 34 percent;\n\nBy 1927 the unemployment rate was 3.3 percent, and\n\nSignificantly for the Trump administration, income tax was eliminated for 98 percent of the population.\n\nTrump is serious about renewing this success. He has discussed using tariffs to replace the income tax with Congressional Republicans, although as of March 2025, Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader John Thune have not shown much tariff ambition. On the revenue side, the Trump administration aims to raise anywhere from $400 billion to $1 trillion per year, and on the protection side, he has increased tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, and is poised to do so on copper and copper articles, lumber and wood articles, and medicines. On March 3, 2025, Trump channeled Clay\u2019s American System speech from March 1824, pledging protection of the home market to American farmers. On March 12, 2025, when asked by host Stuart Varney on Fox Business\u2019s Varney & Co. about the administration\u2019s tariff strategy, Lutnick said, \u201cThe president is here to protect American workers. He\u2019s here to protect American industry.\u201d\n\nThe president has marked April 2 as Liberation Day, promising sweeping new tariffs for revenue. As of March 31, according to the Wall Street Journal, Trump has pushed his Cabinet to embrace the \u201cuniversal\u201d tariffs he campaigned on, as opposed to country-specific reciprocal tariffs. This further evidences Trump\u2019s bona-fide protectionist instincts.\n\nThe 1922 Tariff Act contained eight \u201creciprocity\u201d provisions tied to specific products. Notably, Title I, Sec. 1, Par. 369 of the Act set the tariff on cars at 25 percent, much as Trump has just done. Paragraph 369 also mandated that if any other country charges more than 25 percent, then the United States will impose the same tariff as that country, up to a rate of 50 percent.\n\nTitle III Sec. 315 the 1922 Tariff also gave the president broad authority to increase tariffs on any country if that country was found to discriminate against American exports in any manner.\n\nWhile the United States had dabbled in \u201creciprocity\u201d for a handful of commodities with a handful of countries, mostly for short periods of time, these were aberrations. Per a Senate finance report, \u201cThe United States consistently applied a single-schedule tariff to imports from all countries. Reciprocal treaties granting reductions from the general tariff rates were few in number at any given time.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1920s, Cordell Hull was, unfortunately, still ascendant, preparing to seal America\u2019s subsequent ruin. He became chairman of the Democratic National Committee as well as a champion of America\u2019s international creditors. Hull attacked the Fordney tariff on the basis that protective tariffs were making it harder for overseas vendors to export to America, and thus harder for them to earn dollars to repay their debts. He also attacked the settlements of debts owed to U.S. lenders that involved lenders accepting less profit.\n\nHull and his companions around the world who put creditors ahead of producers helped not only lay the foundation for the Great Depression, but exacerbated it. While the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 has been long defamed as playing a role in the Great Depression, no less than the former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other leading economic historians have \u201clargely blamed that catastrophe on the international gold standard.\u201d As Ben Stein noted in the New York Times, \u201cexports were only about 5 percent of the economic output of the United States\u2026 To say that the [Smoot-Hawley] Act, which applied to a distinct minority of imports and which raised tariffs generally by only about six percentage points, caused the Depression is almost comical.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, with the Depression in full effect, Democrats swept Congress and the Presidency in 1932. Hull now represented Tennessee in the Senate.\n\nLook in any textbook or ask any AI, and you can learn about the \u201cReciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.\u201d In fact, there was no such legislation. What actually happened is that Democrats amended the Tariff Act of 1930 (Smoot-Hawley) with legislation titled \u201cAn Act to Promote Foreign Trade.\u201d\n\nMuch like with Blaine\u2019s 1890 clause, it allowed the president to adjust tariff rates based on mere \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d (no Senate ratification necessary). But that\u2019s where the similarities ended. Hull\u2019s 1934 amendment (hereinafter the Hull Clause) allowed the President to eliminate duties on any item, and worse yet, cemented an \u201cUnconditional Most Favored Nation (MFN) Principle.\u201d\n\nLest there be any doubt about the motivations, Section 3 of the Hull Clause stated that \u201cNothing in this Act shall be construed to give any authority to cancel or reduce, in any manner, any of the indebtedness of any foreign country to the United States.\u201d Hull gave himself blanket authority to throw domestic producers under the bus so that foreign countries could export more to earn more dollars to repay their debts. But not a single dollar of that indebtedness was to be forgiven.\n\nHull\u2019s Clause permanently launched the presidential tariff era, and to this day Congress has not passed a Tariff Act since 1930.\n\nThe Hull Clause stated that any tariff cuts proclaimed by the president \u201cshall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly\u201d (emphasis added). This is known as \u201cUnconditional MFN,\u201d which applies tariff reductions made to one trade partner to all countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements. Whereas under the Blaine Clause a tariff cut for Brazil was just that, a tariff cut for Brazil, under the Hull Clause the tariff cuts for the 1935 \u201cReciprocal\u201d Trade Agreement with Brazil applied to virtually the entire world.\n\nIn the subsequent decade, Hull, now secretary of state, entered into 30 trade agreements with 29 foreign nations (he did Canada twice), each one cutting U.S. tariffs globally and on a non-reciprocal basis. This was the end of America\u2019s protective tariff.\n\nHull\u2019s tariff cuts really did apply globally: the Japanese Empire, Nazi Germany, it made no difference. Hull was virulently anti-tariff, and nothing was more important than lenders foreign debts being repaid through exports back to America.\n\nThe Hull Clause did contemplate other countries using \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d to thwart American exports. It authorized the president to \u201csuspend the application [of the tariff cut to] any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce.\u201d Presidents have had all the tools necessary to deal with lack of genuine reciprocity, but until President Trump, all were overwhelmingly reluctant to use those powers.\n\nAfter the war, in 1947, Hull\u2019s 30 trade agreements were collapsed into the global General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a non-reciprocal tariff agreement with 22 other nations.\n\nBy 1950, the average rate of duty paid on goods imported into the U.S. had fallen to 5.8 percent, and 60 percent of all goods were imported duty-free. Imports from the Soviet-controlled Eastern Bloc became a bridge too far, however. Trade policy was in the service of international lenders, but now also in fighting international communism. President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951. The American tariff schedule was split into \u201cColumn 1\u201d and \u201cColumn 2.\u201d Column 1 contained negligible tariffs for GATT countries and other non-communist countries, while Column 2 contained higher rates from the Tariff Act of 1930. Section 5 of the 1951 Act directed that communist nations be moved to Column 2. Column 1 and 2 remain today, but as of March 2025, Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, and Russia are the only countries in Column 2.\n\nCongress did get wise to the lack of reciprocity at the outset of the GATT \u201cTokyo Round\u201d in the early 1970s. Industries from flatware to bicycles had largely been wiped out, with temporary GATT-authorized \u201csafeguard\u201d tariffs only slowing the bleed-out. Congress legislated \u201cReciprocal nondiscriminatory treatment\u201d as part of the Trade Act of 1974, and it remains the law today (see 19 U.S. Code \u00a7 2136).\n\nThe president would only be allowed to proclaim the latest round of tariff cuts if he could certify that we had achieved reciprocity with Canada, Europe, and Japan. The president did so, and indeed, we got it. Ever since, Japan has charged zero tariffs on U.S. cars, while we have charged Japan 2.5 percent. Under this reciprocal regime, Japan sends us 77 cars for every one car we send them. And President Trump stands virtually alone inside the Beltway in identifying this first as a problem, and second as one that can be remedied through tariffs."

            "full_content": "Donald Trump rode into office\u2014twice now\u2014on a wave of promises to upend the Washington consensus, to drain the swamp of its self-serving mandarins and to keep America out of endless wars. His base cheered when he skewered the neoconservative architects of Iraq and Afghanistan, wars that bled our Treasury, and most importantly, many of our sons for little more than bragging rights in Beltway and Tel Aviv salons. Yet here we are, in the early days of his second term, with whispers growing louder from the usual suspects: advisors and hangers-on nudging him toward a strike on Iran, peddling the old lie that it\u2019ll be quick, clean, and simple. History, that stern teacher we keep ignoring, tells us otherwise. Yet the hawks in the Trump administration appear to be anxious to wreck another country, which would join the long, recurring tragedy of U.S.-caused failed countries in the Middle East.\n\nThe pitch is familiar, isn\u2019t it? A swift blow\u2014maybe a few airstrikes on Tehran\u2019s nuclear sites or a green light for Israel to do the dirty work\u2014and the mullahs will crumble, the region will stabilize, and we\u2019ll be home by Easter. It\u2019s the same tune the warmongers hummed in 1914, when Europe\u2019s leaders promised their boys would be back from the trenches by Christmas. These are also the same deceptions we heard in 2003, when Iraq was sold as a \u201ccakewalk\u201d\u2014a war that would pay for itself with oil and gratitude. Millions of lives and trillions of dollars later, we\u2019re still witnessing that tragedy.\n\nThe U.S. has been either directly bombing or participating in bombing the Houthis on and off since 2015. Why should we believe the war cheerleaders that this time will be more successful?\n\nIran is not Iraq circa 2003, nor is it some tinpot dictatorship ripe for a Predator-drone makeover. It\u2019s a 3,000-year-old culture with a population of 85 million, rugged as the Zagros Mountains, with a military hardened by decades of sanctions, assassinations, military attacks, cyber attacks, proxy wars, and constant threats from top leaders of Israel and the U.S. to destroy their country. The Islamic Republic has spent years preparing for this very fight\u2014dispersing its assets, fortifying its defenses, and cultivating allies from Hezbollah to the Houthis. A strike wouldn\u2019t be a surgical snip; it\u2019d be kicking a hornet\u2019s nest with no apparent interest in an exit strategy. Yet the war hawk advisers circling Trump\u2014some recycled from the Bush era, others eager to prove their toughness\u2014seem unworried about the chaos they\u2019d unleash. Chaos has been their game for decades.\n\nLet\u2019s play this out. Day one: bombs fall, targets burn, and the cable news chyrons scream victory. Day two: Iran retaliates\u2014maybe with missiles on U.S. bases in Qatar or shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, whence a fifth of the world\u2019s oil flows. Day three: oil prices spike, markets tank, and suddenly we\u2019re not talking about a \u201climited operation\u201d anymore. Hezbollah rains rockets on Tel Aviv, the Houthis blockade the Red Sea, and militia groups in Iraq and Syria start targeting American troops again. Before you know it, we\u2019re waist-deep in another quagmire, with the same generals and pundits who botched the last three wars demanding more troops, more money, and more time. Sound familiar? Lyndon Johnson followed that advice, descended into infamy, and had to exit politics.\n\nThe hawks will scoff at this. Like they\u2019ve done for decades, they\u2019ll say Iran\u2019s on the verge of collapse, it\u2019s a paper tiger, that deterrence demands action, that Trump must show strength. They\u2019ll invoke Reagan or Thatcher, forgetting that both knew when to hold fire. But strength isn\u2019t measured by how many bombs you drop\u2014it\u2019s knowing when to walk away from a bad bet. Trump, at his best, gets this. He resisted the full-court press to bomb Syria into oblivion after Assad\u2019s alleged chemical weapons stunts. He talked Kim Jong Un down from the ledge without firing a shot. He\u2019s not a pacifist, but he\u2019s no fool either. So why let the same clique that cheered on the Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria fiascoes steer him into this buzz saw?\n\nThe main problem is the company he keeps. The swamp didn\u2019t drain\u2014it got a new guest list. Some of these advisers see Iran as a trophy, a chance to flex America\u2019s muscles and settle old scores. Others are tethered to foreign capitals\u2014Riyadh, Jerusalem\u2014that would love to see us do their bidding and wreck Iran.\n\nAmerica has followed the neoconservative Zionists\u2019 foreign policy desires for decades. Every one of their wars ends up killing, wounding, and starving hundreds of thousands of innocent people. Millions are homeless. The target countries become dysfunctional, creating generations of new enemies. The narrative is the same: They say a leader is hurting his people. He is worse than Hitler and he must go. But the warmongers are unapologetic about the disastrous results such as warlords running Libya and Afghanistan, and the chaos and destruction in Iraq. Now that the \u201chorrible\u201d Assad is gone, a dressed-up Al Qaeda is running Syria. How is that not alarming? Our government enabled and supported that destruction for years.\n\nThe Christian Zionists are not crying out about the two-millennia-old Christian communities, which are being driven out of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Israel as a result of the wars they have supported. No apologies here either.\n\nIs it possible that the warmongers calling for the attacks on Iran would be perfectly satisfied leaving a mess like the other countries they have caused us to attack? How is that in America's interest?\n\nThey\u2019re not thinking about the young Americans who will bear the brunt when the \u201ccakewalk\u201d turns into a slog. They\u2019re thinking about their political masters, not Americans in the flyover country.\n\nConservatives used to understand this. They were the ones who questioned the hubris of nation-building, who saw war as a last resort, not a first reflex. Robert Taft and Dwight Eisenhower didn\u2019t fetishize military overreach; they knew it bankrupted nations and eroded liberty. Along the way, we let the neocons and their ilk hijack the movement, turning \u201cpeace through strength\u201d into \u201cwar for applause.\u201d President Trump\u2019s first term hinted at a return to that older wisdom. His second could cement it\u2014or squander it on Iran\u2019s altar.\n\nThe president should listen to his gut, not his courtiers. He\u2019s a dealmaker, not a warlord. He knows the art of the bluff, and the power of walking away. Iran is no angel\u2014its ambitions troubling\u2014but it\u2019s not an existential threat to America requiring a preemptive strike. Diplomacy worked with the Soviets; it can work here. War, though? War is the wildcard that breaks everything.\n\nSo here\u2019s the request, Mr. President: don\u2019t buy the dishonest hype. Don\u2019t let the warmongers\u2019 desire to wreck another country be your guide. You ran against the forever wars\u2014don\u2019t start another one. America wants jobs, borders, sanity\u2014not body bags and budget deficits. History is littered with failed leaders who thought war was simple. It never is, particularly when it is fomented by people who do not prioritize American interests. You know them by their fruits."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemocratic-backed candidate Susan Crawford has won Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race, maintaining the liberal majority on the court in a key battleground state less than three months into President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nCrawford, a liberal circuit court judge in Dane County, will beat the conservative candidate Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County judge who received Trump\u2019s backing in the final stretch of the campaign. The race was officially nonpartisan, but Crawford\u2019s victory will be seen as a bright spot for Democrats in Wisconsin and nationwide as voters handed the president\u2019s preferred candidate a defeat in the first major political test of the second Trump era.\n\nCrawford and her Democratic allies also worked to turn the election into a referendum on Trump ally Elon Musk, who poured millions of his personal fortune into the race. It quickly became the most expensive judicial contest in US history.\n\nAt a victory rally in Madison Tuesday night, Crawford thanked supporters, saying their votes helped send a message to the country.\n\n\u201cToday, Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our supreme court. And Wisconsinites stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price \u2013 our courts are not for sale,\u201d she said.\n\nCrawford did not mention Musk by name, but she did reference defeating his big spending in the contest.\n\n\u201cAs a little girl in Chippewa falls, I never thought I\u2019d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin, and we won!\u201d she said to loud cheers.\n\nCrawford said Schimel called her to concede. \u201cI want to thank him. He was very gracious, and I wish him and his family well,\u201d she added.\n\nMusk and groups affiliated with him spent more than $19 million in the state, including funding field operations and television advertisements. Crawford tied the tech billionaire directly to Schimel in her appearances, at times referencing Musk at \u201cmy opponent.\u201d Democratic groups ran television ads linking the Tesla CEO to Schimel.\n\nIn all, the candidates and outside groups spent more than $90 million \u2014 shattering spending records set just two years ago, when a liberal judge captured an open seat and flipped control of the court.\n\nSchimel and Republicans had hoped to draw on the network of voters who supported Trump in November\u2019s presidential election, when he narrowly won the battleground state. Schimel hugged Trump closely throughout the campaign and even appeared in a live chat with Musk on his social media site X.\n\nBut Democrats bet that seizing on that alignment would pay off with voters at a time when the two men have undertaken a controversial reshaping of the federal government. Issues such as abortion rights and the redistricting of congressional maps also emerged as flashpoints in the campaign.\n\nCrawford, who has represented Planned Parenthood as a private attorney, backs abortion rights.\n\nIn a state with divided government \u2014 Gov. Tony Evers is a Democrat, and Republicans control the state legislature \u2014 the Supreme Court has become the final arbiter on policies that affect Wisconsites\u2019 lives, including whether a 19th-century law that banned most abortions could be enforced today.\n\nAnd in a state that helps determine who wins the presidency, the high court would have the final word in resolving election disputes.\n\nSince the liberals won a 4-3 majority two years ago, the court has delivered major victories to Democrats \u2014 reversing a 2022 high court ruling that had imposed a near-total ban on ballot drop boxes and striking down state legislative maps drawn by Republicans.\n\nThe court could revisit congressional maps that have helped the GOP hold a lopsided advantage of six out of eight US House seats, despite the paper-thin margins of victory for Republicans and Democrats in statewide races.\n\nCrawford will serve a 10-year term.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nA new lawsuit filed Tuesday accuses tech billionaire Elon Musk and his super PAC of failing to pay canvassers who helped his pro-Trump political operation in 2024.\n\nDuring the final stretch of the 2024 campaign, Musk and his political group, America PAC, offered $100 to registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition supporting free speech and gun rights, and another $100 for every additional voter they convinced to sign the petition. The goal was to excite conservative voters and elect then-candidate Donald Trump \u2013 who narrowly won Pennsylvania in November.\n\nA man from the Philadelphia suburbs \u2013 who filed the lawsuit anonymously because he says he fears retribution \u2013 claims he is owed $20,000 for gathering signatures in Pennsylvania. The lawsuit claims there could be at least another 100 victims of Musk\u2019s alleged breach-of-contract. This comes after press reports about allegedly late or missing payments from the super PAC around the presidential election.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is about keeping promises,\u201d the man\u2019s attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, told CNN. \u201cHe was expecting to be able to pay his bills because of this promise. He was pounding the pavement during the campaign because Elon Musk asked him too. He believed in Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nAmerica PAC spokesman Andrew Romeo denied wrongdoing when asked about the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cAmerica PAC is committed to paying for every legitimate petition signature, which is evidenced by the fact that we have paid tens of millions of dollars to canvassers for their hard work in support of our mission,\u201d Romeo said in a statement, adding that the pro-Trump group is \u201ccommitted to rooting out fraud\u201d and has \u201cthe right to withhold payments to fraudsters.\u201d\n\nIn the past week, Musk revived his 2024-style giveaways in Wisconsin, offering $1 million cash prizes as he campaigned in support of a conservative candidate for the state Supreme Court.\n\nMusk and his super PAC denied claims during the 2024 campaign that their cash giveaways to voters violated federal laws against vote-buying or that it operated an illegal state lottery.\n\nThe Justice Department warned the super PAC in October about its $1 million sweepstakes for registered voters. And the Philadelphia district attorney, a Democrat, tried and failed in state court to get the daily giveaways shut down because, he claimed, it was an unlawful operation.\n\nLiss-Riordan, who filed the latest lawsuit Tuesday in Pennsylvania federal court, has previously sued X, the Musk-owned social media platform formerly called Twitter, in a case about Musk\u2019s takeover of the company. She was also involved in an unsuccessful effort to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot in Massachusetts because of the US Constitution\u2019s \u201cinsurrectionist ban.\u201d"
