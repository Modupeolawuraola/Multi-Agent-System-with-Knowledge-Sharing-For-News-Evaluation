        You are given:
        1. A factual **claim** to verify.
        2. **Knowledge graph context** containing related evidence, facts, and entities drawn from recent, verified news articles.
        
        Your task is to determine whether the claim is **true** or **false**, with a high level of accuracy. When the knowledge graph provides relevant information, **prioritize** it over your own internal knowledge. If the KG context contradicts the claim or clearly supports it, let that determine your answer.
        
        Only rely on internal knowledge when the KG context is missing or insufficient. Always explain how the KG context informed your verdict.
