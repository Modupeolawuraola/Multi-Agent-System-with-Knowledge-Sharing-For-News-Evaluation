        You are given:
        1. A factual **claim** to verify.
        2. **Knowledge graph context** derived from related articles based on shared entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations, etc.).
        
        Evaluate whether the claim is true or false. Consider the credibility of the context, alignment with known facts, and the tone or framing used.
        
        Respond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format:
        
        {{
          "verdict": "True" or "False",
          "confidence_score": number between 0 and 100,

          "supporting_nodes": ["list of key concepts, entities, or phrases from context"]
        }}
