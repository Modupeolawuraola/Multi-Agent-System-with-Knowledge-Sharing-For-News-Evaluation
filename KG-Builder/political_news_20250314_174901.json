(Tigard Police Department via AP)\n\nTIGARD, Ore. -- Gunshots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Oregon on Thursday for the second time in a week in ongoing vandalism and protests around the country since CEO Elon Musk became a key figure in the Trump administration.\n\nAround 4:15 a.m., more than a dozen shots were fired around the electric vehicle dealership in the Portland suburb of Tigard, according to the Tigard Police Department. The shooting caused extensive damage to cars and showroom windows, police said. No one was hurt.\n\nA similar shooting happened on March 6 at the same location. Police said they continue to work with federal partners at the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives to thoroughly investigate. An ATF explosive detection dog has been used after both shootings to help search for shell casings, police said.\n\nTesla has been a target for demonstrations and vandalism in the U.S. and elsewhere this year. People have protested Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has been moving to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nPolice said over the weekend that six Tesla Cybertrucks at a dealership in the Seattle suburb of Lynnwood were spray painted with swastikas and profanity directed at Musk, KING-TV reported.\n\nOn Sunday, four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a blaze in Seattle, but investigators have not said if the fire, or fires, were intentionally set. On Tuesday, the Seattle Police Department said it was working with federal partners to investigate the incident.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday that he was buying a new Tesla to show his support for Musk as the billionaire's company struggles with sagging sales and declining stock prices."

            "full_content": "S1: It's time for Midday Edition on KPBS. Today we are talking about the arts and culture that shape San Diego. I'm Jade Hindman with conversations that keep you informed , inspired , and engaged. A local author explores what a sense of home really is in a new book.\n\nS2: When we think of home , we do think of our house , or our apartment or our trailer. And I hope this book invites young people to think of home in a in a bigger sense.\n\nS1: Then Beth Accomando previews the upcoming San Diego Latino Film Festival. Plus , Julia Dixon Evans joins us with her weekend preview. That's ahead on Midday Edition. So what does home mean to you ? You might think about the actual physical structure you live in , or maybe you're imagining the neighborhood you were born and raised in. Well , a new picture book from award winning author Matt de la Pena asks us to think about the idea of home a little differently. Matt joins me now in studio to talk about the book. Matt , welcome.\n\nS2: Thanks so much for having me.\n\nS1: So glad to have you here. So your book is titled home , and it takes us through these different ideas of what home could mean and look like and feel like.\n\nS2: Our first one was called love , and it's it's the kind of book where you are exploring an idea and not just following a single character. So we kind of wanted to follow that up with another exploration. Um , so it took a couple of years , but then the pandemic hit , and it made me really think about what home means. You know , I'm an author who's often on the road , you know , I'm going to different cities every week , and all of a sudden I was grounded. And it was it turned out to be such a gift. I was with my kids and my wife every single day. Schools shut down. So I found myself teaching my daughter how to read. And so I just started to understand the power of being in one spot , and really like the importance of being with the people you love , right ? Yeah.\n\nS1: Well , you mentioned the pandemic , and that's a time when the earth really kind of stood still. Yeah. Um , and kind of returned to itself while everyone stayed inside.\n\nS2: And we're also taught that it's all about ambition , trying to get to this other place , go to the best college , get the best job. And you know when you're when you're stuck at home , you have to rethink this. And another thing I witnessed was the way , you know , maybe sometimes we're living against the earth or against nature trying to like , you know , tame it so we can find our little human space. But during the pandemic , I watched the Earth reclaims so many of those spaces. There were fewer cars. It felt like , you know , some like like a post-apocalyptic movie or something , when you'd walk down the street and see no cars. And of course , the book has nothing to do with the pandemic , but it was such an important starting spot to kind of just examine what this concept of home really means.\n\nS1: Yeah , I mean , at the time , it seemed like the air looked a little cleaner.\n\nS2: And yes.\n\nS1: The oceans kind of came to life a little more.\n\nS2: It's so true. Yeah.\n\nS1: Yeah.\n\nS2: This is , um , the very beginning of home. Home is a tired lullaby and a late night traffic that mumbles in through a crack in your curtains. Home is the faint trumpet of a distant barge. As your grandfather casts his line. From the edge of his houseboat home. Is the big bellied airplanes , always soaring overhead. The jet engine shrieks as you stack blocks or push plastic cars , and the rumble you feel through the floorboards is the promise of home. But a day may come when you learn how a home can be lost. Hurricane rains flood your streets or a thick black smoke blankets the sky or Papa's garment factory closes down. Wow.\n\nS1: Wow. Well , you know , it's like in your writing , you're talking about all of these sounds , and it is the soundtrack of of your life. Yeah , really. But then you go into this disruption and I want to talk about that , the idea of losing your home. Because earlier this year we witnessed the devastation caused by the LA fires and how it ravaged entire neighborhoods and displaced so many families.\n\nS2: And one of the most important things the illustrator chose to do is on the cover of a book called home. There is no house , there is no physical structure. So even the beginning , it just sort of invites you to think a little outside the box about the idea of home. And , you know , this book does have the the disruption of somebody losing a home. And I feel like as a person who writes for the very young , I've , I've had to ask myself this question. So what is my job ? Is it to tell the truth or preserve innocence ? And so there is no black or white in those terms , but I think I would always choose to lean a little bit toward truth , because I always say , you know , as a parent myself , we can't keep our kids from hurt or harm , but we can hold them through it. And , you know , hopefully that's what a good picture book can do is hold a child while they explore a deep concept.\n\nS1: Yeah , it's a it's certainly a needle to thread. Yes.\n\nS2: Well , first of all , you have to like I always think about it like a volume level , like you turning it up or turning it down. So if it's a scary idea , I turn the volume down a little bit with the text and give the illustrator a note that maybe we're going to do this in the visual story. Um , and then of course , if if I'm not exploring that tougher time , maybe I kind of turn the volume up a little bit with the text and try to create a musicality and tell the story that way. So there there's that. That's something important to share. I also think the concept of hope must always be there on every page , even if it on the most difficult page in the book , there has to be some form of hope. So in the book there is this loss of a home. But if you look at the illustration , the family is together. They're very tightly together , holding on to each other. Even the little dog is right there. So I think that suggests that even though this family is going through a very difficult time , they've lost their home to a hurricane , to a fire , whatever it may be , they're still together. And even if the kid can't see that at the moment , viscerally , they can feel it , right.\n\nS1: I think that's such a smart approach to because at certain points in the story , you'll let the picture tell more of the story , or the words tell more of the story. And I think that gives a child the chance to sort of receive what they're ready to receive.\n\nS2: That's exactly right. Yeah. Yeah. I'll expand on that with our first book , love. There's this very challenging moment where a boy is hiding under the piano while his parents are arguing , and I do. I turn down the text there , and there's really , like , staccato , you know , rhythm , just a few fragments of sentences. And when we were out on the road for that book , I remember I was in Colorado and this reading specialist came to me and she said , I've read this book to all the grades at our school , and I want to tell you something I noticed she said when I read it to the kindergartners and the first graders , they said , oh , I think they're playing hide and seek. She said , then when I read it to the second and third graders , they said , we think there's been a fight. And then the oldest grades , they said , oh , miss , we think they're getting a divorce. So just exactly the way you put it. These kids are entering at different stages of their development , and they're pulling different things from the text and illustration combination.\n\nS1: That's great. Tell me , because you're from National City. Yes , but have experienced San Diego in so many different ways.\n\nS2: You know , I have grandparents that are from Mexico , so they have experience coming across the border. My dad grew up in National City. My mom grew up in National City. They're of different races. My dad's Mexican and my mom is white. So this is where I was born , and this was a big part of my childhood. And then I moved to North County , and I saw a totally different part of San Diego , and I was meeting kids for the first time who had parents who went to college. So when I sit down to write a book , I do just kind of catalog through images from my childhood , and I'm trying to pull on those different settings and I'll share one thing with you. I had a very working class father. He was a very quiet man. He , you know , he worked his working class job , never took a sick day , but he was pretty quiet , man. But every once in a while , he would take me and my two sisters to the park , and we'd. We'd walk. And I remember this specific memory of walking across this bridge on the way to the park , and he suddenly just stopped us. And he pointed to the sky , and there was a hawk circling around , and he didn't say anything , you know , and I'm a young kid. And I was thinking at the time , why is my family so weird ? Why are we staring at this bird while , you know , all these cars are streaming by us ? But what I realized he was doing is he may not have had the language for this at the time , but he was saying , stop ! Look , the world is so interesting and beautiful. You have to notice it. And in a strange way , that memory from San Diego is really what I try to do when I write books. I'm basically saying to any reader who's going to pick up one of my books , stop ! Like , look at the world.\n\nS1:\n\nS2: It's that.\n\nS1: You know. Yeah , well , let's talk about your craft. So there are two approaches to picture books , the idea book , and then there's the character book. Yes. And you mentioned home is more of an idea book.\n\nS2: Right. Okay. So it's kind of like , um , it's like you draw up a play in football and now you have to figure out who's the best at executing this play. Like , who am I going to hand the ball to ? The same is true for the form I'm going to use. Um , so I come up with an idea. The first thing I have to decide is will this be best as a novel , or will these this be better as a picture book that will have a visual story alongside of the text ? So when I come up with an idea first like love or in this , this case home , you know , I think of it as like , okay , I've now got to figure out a way to arc the story when we're not following one particular character. So the way I perceive it is I have a cast of characters , but they all combine into what I call a collective contemporary American childhood. And then I can I can ask that , you know , like , how does the concept of home change in a child's life over time ? And in this case , the arc is going from , you know , home being paired with something physical and even industry , you know , making a new building , aspiring to living in a bigger home or , you know , a big new building. And ultimately the the arc of the story is now the child over time , possibly because of a disruption of losing a home or moving , you know , or your family changes. Now the child is looking elsewhere and maybe seeing that community is a form of home , but more specifically , my own family , you know , whoever is raising me , my siblings , my school. And then there's one final turn in this book , and this is the one that is directly sort of inspired by the pandemic. This turned to the grand sense of home , which is the natural world , the earth , and how this world is our home and what are we going to do to protect it ? But also , what are we going to do to try to live in harmony with it instead of living at it or against it ? Yeah.\n\nS1: Well , you currently teach writing at San Diego State.\n\nS2: You know , I can think of two authors right now that are born and raised in San Diego , and they're writing incredible novels that are set in San Diego. One is right on the border , and I think my job now as an elder or an old person , um , you know , I've had many years to be out on the road sharing my books , and I'm going to continue to write books. But it's so fun now to work with the voices of tomorrow and see what somebody's going to do that maybe update something you did years ago. I have one novel called Mexican White Boy. It's about growing up mixed race. But to think that that's like the seminal story of the mixed race experience in San Diego is silly. You know , there are so many versions of that story , and every year they change. So the voices of tomorrow are writing a different you know , they're exploring it in a different way. And it'll be fascinating to see what comes of that.\n\nS1: Very interesting. Well , I mean , is there anything else you want readers , young and old to walk away with , at least when it comes to how they're thinking about their home.\n\nS2: Yeah , I just think we don't often move beyond our physical structure. When we think of home , we do think of our house or our apartment or our trailer. And I hope this book invites young people to think of home in a in a bigger sense , and to actually explore the earth and how , you know , being at the ocean you mentioned earlier , you know , looking at the ocean , this ocean has been here forever. It has seen everything during the pandemic. When I would take my son to look at the ocean , you know , I was scared , like , what's going to happen ? My kids can't go to school. And I'd look at the ocean. I'd be like , wow , it's seen so much. All of our , you know , worries are quite trivial when you think about it in the context of the ocean. And I think , you know , for me , San Diego is so beautiful. You know , I , I love the ocean. I love when I listen to the tide coming up over the rocks and then retreating back in to itself. I love how that can sort of slow down the heart rate. So , you know , I'm thinking the older I get , the more San Diego the city is , is my home. And I hope that young readers will explore , like , what's the bigger sense of their home.\n\nS1: Right ? Well , we are all in a place that is a nice place to call home for sure. I've been speaking with children's book author Matt de la Pena. His new book , home , is out now. Matt , thank you so much for joining us.\n\nS2: Thanks so much for letting me share with you.\n\nS1: Up next , a preview of the San Diego Latino Film Festival. Hear more when KPBS Midday Edition returns. You're listening to KPBS Midday Edition , I'm Jade Hindman. Next week , the San Diego Latino Film Festival returns for its 32nd year. It's a celebration of Latino cinema culture and creativity. This year's theme is all about cinema Without borders. KPBS arts reporter Beth Accomando sat down with the festival's founder , Ethan Van Tilo , and filmmaker and actor Giancarlo Ruiz to talk about what audiences can expect. Here's that conversation.\n\nS3: Ethan , we are on the eve of the 32nd annual San Diego Latino Film Festival.\n\nS4: We started this as a small student film festival , and now look at us 32 years later , we have our own nonprofit organization. We have our own movie theater. We teach kids how to make films all year round. And then were you expecting over 120 movies this upcoming film festival , five days of cinema , close to 100 actors and filmmakers coming from all over the US , Mexico and Latin America. So super excited to once again bring Latino cinema to San Diego. And I believe the 32nd edition is more important than ever. And we're definitely in a situation now in our current political climate. We're just constantly hearing the negativity and the stereotypes about the Latino community , about immigration , about the border. And so I really try to always have a film festival that really shows a more accurate portrayal of Latinos and a more accurate portrayal of our border region. We know we live here in San Diego and in Baja , and we know what the border is really all about. And so I want the festival to break down walls , break down barriers , invite people in to learn about each other , watch these incredible movies that we have from all over Latin America and Mexico in the US.\n\nS3: And you mentioned this is five days in the past , the festival has been longer than that.\n\nS4: But also , you know , there's a changing landscape within the film festival world in general , right , where we're seeing that mainly people are comfortable just staying at home watching films on Netflix and Amazon , whatever it might be. And so we're trying to really look at the film festival as something new in the sense like , well , how do we get people out to come out and leave their homes and experience film again in the movie theater ? We want to really encourage people to celebrate a moviegoing experience and see it on the big screen with a wonderful sound , and not only see it on the big screen , but also meet filmmakers. So this film fest was going to include many filmmakers coming from around the world to be here , to be a part of Q and A , and so it's really an event that's really special. And so , yeah , so with the mall going through construction , you know , we couldn't do everything that we want to. But still , for the five days you're going to come to the film festival. There's going to be a stage , there's going to be dance performances , live music. We have a retail space that were taken over and turned into an art gallery with DJs every night , so we're still trying to make it the same experience that you had for the past 32 years. But just give me a little short and do the construction and just changes.\n\nS3:\n\nS4: Our film festival is really known over the years to be bringing a Mexican talent a lot , sometimes talent that maybe it's not really known here in the US yet. But to opening night , March 19th , we're going to show a comedy , Mesa , that Carlos from Mexico was Jose Eduardo Derbez. He's the son of Eugenio Derbez. So it's a super fun comedy. We want everyone to come out and enjoy it.\n\nS3: So you're going to give us some joy to begin.\n\nS4: You know , the festival is really about celebrating the Latino community and all the experiences , but we definitely try to diversify the genres and the and the topics of the festival. So yes , you have comedies , you have shorts , you have docs. But at the same time , you know , we're also dealing with many important topics. As I mentioned , we're trying to like look at our border region , look at really the politics that are currently happening. For example , we have an amazing documentary about the Friendship Park on the border that's screening the final day of the festival.\n\nS5: Fisher Park is a space that embraces humanity as a space that embraces families. It's a space that embraces the coming together of experiences. From the South to the north.\n\nS6: Friendship Park is a symbol of the border that never gets talked about.\n\nS7: People come to this park to be able to be face to face with their loved ones.\n\nS6: In friendship parks , all the beautiful things about the US-Mexico border and sadly , the those beautiful things about the US-Mexico border just hardly ever make the news.\n\nS4: We also have an incredible documentary called Kumeyaay Land. It's about the Kumeyaay community here in this region who are on the other side of the border in Baja. Imagine this wall that was built that really doesn't take into effect that , you know , the idea that the community is really one region. Right ? And so Kumeyaay Land is a documentary I'm really excited to see.\n\nS3: And you also have a documentary on Raquel Welch. Yeah.\n\nS4: Yeah. So we try to celebrate us Latino filmmakers , international filmmakers. But this is kind of a neat thing that I am. Raquel is celebrates an actress who lived in San Diego for many years. Many people might not know that.\n\nS8: The women's lives say all that. I'm exploiting myself as a sex object , and I say yes and happily so , you know what's the matter with it ? It's a terrific thing.\n\nS9:\n\nS4: We have Gregory Nava , another great filmmaker , local San Diego filmmaker who is in the film. It talks about her , and he's going to introduce the movie and have a Q&A after the film.\n\nS3: And one of the films you have , Broken Borders , features an actor who has been showing short films and features here at your festival. Talk a little bit about this kind of longevity the festival has , and your ability to see filmmakers kind of develop and evolve.\n\nS4: So again , we started 32 years ago. It started as a student film festival. So , you know , early films by Alfonso Cuaron , even , you know , when they were at film school and Mexico City. So yeah , super excited to have a John Carlos graced the screens on the big screen as an actor , started as a short film maker , won awards here at the film festival. And that's what the film festival is all about. We have a whole section called Frontera Filmmakers. We want to support local filmmakers , the production of local films on both sides of the border. We have two workshops that we invite filmmakers to come out. One is about distribution , getting your films into film festivals , and the other one is about fundraising. Like how do you fundraise ? So encourage people to come out and learn about the workshops and meet the film makers. Any emerging filmmakers that are watching this right now , come on and enjoy the festival.\n\nS3: All right , well , once again , I am looking forward to the Latino Film Festival here. And thank you for talking with me.\n\nS4: Thanks for your support. Nos vamos and Lenny.\n\nS3: That was Ethan Brown , founder and executive director of the San Diego Latino Film Festival. He mentioned Giancarlo and that's filmmaker Giancarlo Ruiz , who began making films while living in Tijuana before moving to LA. And now he's back in San Diego. I sat down with him at the Digital Jim Cinema and asked him to share a little of his history with the film festival.\n\nS10: I would say that for me , this festival is like home field advantage for sure. Growing up in Tijuana and coming to the film festival at a young age , I guess , you know , when it was barely starting and always was exciting to see , you know , what was out there. And then at some point , I get to be part of the festival with my own work as a director and as an actor as well. I've been part of the festival now over 25 years , probably the 2004 when they did the first award season or the fourth one awards my film insect , the one best experimental film. Yeah , it's been great. It's been great to see the growth and and how it's evolution through the years and the type of filmmakers that they bring. So it's exciting , obviously.\n\nS3: And I've known you for almost 25 years as well. I got to see your work at Southwestern College. So talk a little bit about going through that film school experience here in San Diego and how that helped you.\n\nS10: Yeah , well , growing up in TJ , we didn't really have like a film school. It's access to equipment was very limited. So the next best option was sort of Southwestern College , in a way , and having access not just to equipment , but to classes and to other like , like minded people was really something that set me off to think like , oh , maybe I could do this. This is like something very I feel very comfortable. It's very creative. And I think that if I learn all the right steps or the or the way how to tell a story , then I'll be fine. And , you know , I learned from basically cutting from film to three quarter decks to linear to non-linear , what I mean , so it's been I've been through the whole sort of transition of filmmaking as well , which has been nice.\n\nS3: That group of students who came through there , I showed a lot of the student films. You guys were so experimental and really pushing the envelope in a lot of ways.\n\nS10: I think , you know , the the group of us that were doing things , we were all we all had like like minded ideas. We like the same type of directors , and usually the directors that we like were very like a tour directors , you know , David Cronenberg , David Lynch. May he rest in peace. Poor guy. I think it was the city itself. I think Tijuana is a very in a sense , it's got an experimental DNA in it. You know , it's always evolving. It's always there's like a lot of things happening and it's a city full of chaos as well. There's nothing in order. So that that idea of nothing in order , nothing like here in San Diego , you know , allowed you so much freedom also that we would shoot without permits. So , you know , we were we were like , really like a wild bunch down there. And we were just closed streets. We would do whatever we need it and we would do it without permits. I remember people would be like , how'd you guys do it ? We're like , I don't know. We just do it. You know ? That's how you can do it down there. So that freedom , I think , also allowed us to experiment with the medium and try to find our own , unique voices.\n\nS3:\n\nS10: Obviously , they have a the Frontera filmmaker section , which is really nice because it allows filmmakers from the United States as well as from Mexico , specifically from the border , to showcase their work , which is very unique because that that gives you an opportunity to be part of the festival , to network , to take some of the workshops , and also to have that cross-pollination of the culture between the US and Mexico , which I think is really important. You know , you get to meet filmmakers from here , from other parts of the world that are here at the festival. I think it's like a big pot of gumbo , right , of information and of people that you can kind of steer around. I think the festival has that , you know , it has like this possibility of growing. They just like , yeah , you know what I mean ? Like I just feel their very positive with with what you bring. And they're very accepting. They're tolerant as well. You know they're tolerant with the work because not all the work is you know some stuff is a little bit crazy. But still , you know , I think they do a good job in curating and choosing the work.\n\nS3: And this year you are not presenting a film that you've directed. You are actually acting in one. So tell us what this one's about.\n\nS10: Okay , so I'm in the film called Broken Borders. It's directed by Rodrigo Alvarez Flores. He's also a filmmaker from Tijuana. This is his first feature film and it's doing pretty good. Won a lot of awards. And it's I think it's touch like a nerve in the way the with the storytelling. Maybe it's a story about a family and their own personal lives outside the house. So the story is told , the three points of view basically. So it's a mother and two kids , and you see what happens to them during their day individually , and then they come home. And the climatic or what happens in the film is happens like in one day. So everything kind of crosses. So it's very like a modest Burrows , kind of like Inarritu storytelling , very non-linear , very interesting , like points of view. And I think it's very fresh. I'm very excited and proud to be part of the the film. Obviously , I always try to support local filmmakers. A lot of them , you know , offer me roles or they write stuff for me and I'm always I'm always ready to , you know , hold the flag and be like , yes , you know , because , you know , I think it's important to look back and see who's doing stuff now and champion them and sort of look , hey , how can I support this person to become a success ? Right ? So I've received so much through the years through different people and organizations and opportunities. It's great. I'm really happy for Rodrigo. He , he This. This film took a while to to make , so for him , it's been cathartic , I think , to have all this experience. And he's , you know , he's traveling all over the world and , you know , it's amazing. It's so happy for him.\n\nS3:\n\nS10: It gives you opportunity to tell stories that you probably wouldn't see in a movie theater , that nowadays we all know that the movie theater experience is going extinct. You know , not just the polar bears , but also movie theater. So it's really special to be able to go to movie , sit down with other people , see it in the dark place where you should like in a movie , like just the way it should be. And this festival gives the opportunity to films that otherwise would not have that chance right specifically now with all the other digital platforms , all the possibilities. But I think just the narrative of cinema itself has changed so much in the last. I say 15 years , and the way we consume media that any time that I can go to a festival and sit down in a movie theater , or anytime I can go to a movie theater and sit down and watch a movie , it's one of the best experiences. And I think this festival offers that to films that will not have the opportunity to be shown in a in a movie. Yeah.\n\nS3: Well , you talk about yourself as an artist. Not only do you direct and write films and act in them , you are also creating.\n\nS10: So I wrote this graphic novel. I wrote it 14 years ago. Okay. And that was I was working with this artist from Taiwan. His name is Charles , is a collaborator of mine that I've worked with in many projects. It's a graphic novel , and we're going to release it in issues. So we have issue number one already. We have 15 more to go. That's another way that I that I've able to satisfy my need to direct without having to go through the whole process of making a movie , because , as we know , to make a movie takes hundreds of people and a lot of money. And so it's frustrating. So for me , writing that graphic novel was a big way to sort of like , oh wait , I can also do this. I can grab my scripts and create them into kind of like storyboarding. Also , I don't know if you know , but there's also within the festival , there's a the art exhibit. I have pieces as well , I guess I am an artist in general , but.\n\nS3: A very diverse one. Yes.\n\nS10: Yes.\n\nS3: Well , it's been wonderful reconnecting with you after all these years and look forward to having your film shown.\n\nS10: Thank you Beth.\n\nS1: That was San Diego Latino Film Festival founder Ethan Van Tilo , along with filmmaker and actor Giancarlo Ruiz , speaking with KPBS arts reporter Beth Accomando. The festival runs from March 19th through the 23rd at Digital Gym cinema in downtown and at AMC Mission Valley , you can purchase passes on the San Diego Latino Film Festival's website. Still to come , if you're looking for something to do this weekend , stick around. Julia Dixon Evans has your weekend preview. KPBS Midday Edition is back after the break. You're listening to KPBS Midday Edition. I'm Jade Hindman in our weekend preview. We have new paintings informed by sleep apnea , plus a memoir , music and cherry blossoms to tell you all about. Joining me with the details is KPBS arts reporter Julia Dixon Evans. Julia , welcome.\n\nS11: Hey , Jade. Thanks for having me.\n\nS1: Always great to have you here. So , local painter Mary Jane has a new exhibit opening at Oceanside Museum of Art. It's all about sleep. Sounds very interesting. What is she trying to convey with this art ? Right.\n\nS11: So this is Mary Jean. I've been following her work for a while , and she always has these , like , incredible , fragmented , fractured , like a silhouette of girl's faces in her art. And she's been doing this , this like motif in her painting for 20 years. She calls them the girls. And , um , they're very surreal. There's a bunch of , like , machinery , uh , even botanicals that sprout out from the girl's heads and sometimes even , like , houses and buildings coming out of their their silhouettes. It's incredible work. I love her work. She is an incredible local artist , and these girls have always been linked to her dream life. Like she's always had these vivid dreams and those inspire her paintings , quite literally. And then her paintings and things that she has painted in the past will show up in her dreams. But last year she was diagnosed with sleep apnea and started using a CPAp machine. This is like a mask that's connected to a machine that literally sends air directly into your airways to help you sleep , and she said that when she started using that , her dreams completely stopped. No dreams , no girls. And as an artist , she was was really struggling with how to find her way back to her creative muse.\n\nS12: In wanting to have sort of a better relationship to sleep health. I was losing the thing that gave me gave me my paintings , which was dreaming. So I didn't know how to have a relationship with with something like that. And this was a series that sort of explained that sort of intoxicating relationship to the thing that you love most as well , which is like , I love being able to dream. So I actually said to myself for a few seconds , like , well , maybe I don't need , you know , sleep aids , I don't need any of that. And then I went into the realization like , well , the challenge is having both. How can I , you know , how can I trigger my brain to dream again ? How can I get everything back and also still be in a good sleep ? Health. What do we choose ? Do we choose a thing that kind of ignites our creativity or our health ? And I feel like a lot of artists go through that all the time , no matter what the topic is.\n\nS11: And she eventually made her way back to her dreams and started a series of paintings about this very thing. I got to visit her recently in her studio , and then again when she was installing and painting site specific murals directly on the wall at Oceanside Museum of Art. The CPAp masks and the tubes , they're literally part of the paintings. They're kind of like interwoven into the girl's silhouettes and the backdrops , and she has a ton of new paintings , some diptych , like two paintings that are of the same subject , and also those huge murals. And it opens on Saturday and will be on view through June 15th at Oceanside Museum of Art. And also while you're there , there's also another really great new exhibit on view. It's Matt Devine. He has a new exhibit of sculptures that are inspired by nature and also anxiety. It's incredible and soothing and thought provoking and kind of is a weirdly nice complement to Mary Jane's exhibit. And there's even one of his pieces that's interactive and musical. So if you want to play with art there , you can.\n\nS1: Wow , sounds really fascinating. Speaking of music , the La Jolla Symphony is partnering with the San Diego Children's Choir for a special concert.\n\nS11: They're also playing Margaret Bond's Montgomery Variations. This was composed in 1964 , and bonds is a black woman composer , and she wrote this really like , sweeping piece. It's seven Variations on a spiritual , and it's inspired by the Montgomery bus boycotts. And this is that piece. And they're also playing a piece of music by African-American composer George Walker and then Icelandic composer Anna Thorvald Sutter's Meta cosmos. This composition has such a powerful build up. There's so much layering and all these different threads until this big crescendo towards the end. And so the symphony is having two concerts Saturday evening and then Sunday afternoon. This is at Mandeville Auditorium at UCSD.\n\nS1: All right. Actress , content creator and now author Dylan Mulvaney is coming to town to launch her new memoir , Paper Doll.\n\nS11: This chronicled her transition in like , really honest and raw detail. This went super viral , over a billion views across all different platforms. And she is also known as the actress who , as an influencer , Bud Light , sent her some product and she posted she made a post of her with the Bud Light , and there was this huge anti-trans backlash against the brand and a bunch of hate towards Mulvaney. And so this book talks about her whole journey doing the Days of Girlhood series and just going through that incredibly difficult chapter of her life. And yeah. Meet Cute Bookshop is sponsoring this event , and it'll be held at the Downtown Libraries Amphitheater this Friday at 7:00. And you can buy tickets there , $28. But they do include a signed copy of the book.\n\nS1: All right. And it is cherry blossom season , which means the annual festival at the Japanese Friendship Garden is happening now.\n\nS11: It runs from Thursday through Sunday and throughout the day. There's performances every hour. Each of the four days , there's going to be opera , sumo , traditional dance and music with traditional folk instruments. Also , vendors , crafts , a bunch of food and drink. And while you're there , you can also check the garden's gallery and see the Yasuo Yoshida exhibit. And yeah , cherry blossom season is very famously unpredictable and brief , but you can look up the Japanese Friendship Gardens Bloom Tracker on their website. It's currently at 40% in bloom , which is pretty good. I've checked it in recent years and this is a good one. So it's 10 to 7 every day , and the last admission is 5 p.m. , but you can stay for a little bit into the evening and tickets are $18 to $25.\n\nS1: I'm so glad they have the Bloom Tracker so helpful. All right. Well , the work of four prominent black artists will be on display at Art produce. The exhibit is called Lineage and Inheritance.\n\nS11: These are all locals and two of them are considered emerging. Mensah Bey is a painter. His work is abstract , almost a little like Cubist and figurative , and Dominique King is a fiber artist who's done this really incredible and fascinating series of like , embroidered portraits. And then Jean Cornwall and Andrew are rushing. They have decades of experience. And this is all curated by Kamal Martin from Art power , Equity and in collaboration with the Black Studies Project out of UCSD. There is an opening reception tonight at Art Produce in North Park from 6 to 8 , but also save the date for an artist talk , where all of the artists together will be in actual conversation , just like their works are in the exhibit. That's on April 13th.\n\nS1: All right. Well , finally , we always like to end the segment with your pick for live music.\n\nS11: He has this incredible voice. His songs are really vulnerable and beautiful. And this is his latest release , How to Let Go.\n\nS13: I need you to save my life , I won't lie. I might need you to put your hands on my ears. Show me how to let go. Show me Anyhow.\n\nS11: So she was performing at Soda Bar on Sunday with O. Rose , who's from Olympia , Washington , and also locals neutral shirt , who I also love. So it should be a great show.\n\nS1: All right , I like it. You can find details on these and more and sign up for Julia's weekly newsletter at our website , pbs.org. I've been speaking with KPBS Arts reporter Julia Dixon Evans. Julia. Thank you.\n\nS11: Thank you , Jade said.\n\nS13: You're here with me. All right.\n\nS1: That's our show for today. I'm your host , Jade Hindman. Thanks for tuning in to Midday Edition. Be sure to have a great day on purpose , everyone.\n\n"

The ballooning of DOGE\u2019s presence at the federal agency\u2014which Bloomberg, citing sworn statements filed in federal court Wednesday, previously reported\u2014comes as Musk and his cohorts are publicly threatening social security benefits, citing unsubstantiated claims of mass fraud.\n\nThe DOGE-affiliated personnel in question are currently listed in the agency\u2019s internal organizational chart. Background checks for two are still pending, according to a filing by the SSA in federal court in Maryland opposing a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by unions that would prevent DOGE from accessing SSA records. (A sworn statement attached to the filing from the SSA\u2019s deputy commissioner of human resources claims that six of the background checks are still pending.)\n\nThe operatives\u2014whom the government did not name in its filing\u2014are, according to internal documents, Akash Bobba, Scott Coulter, Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, Antonio Gracias, Gautier Cole Killian, Jon Koval, Nikhil Rajpal, Payton Rehling, and Ethan Shaotran. This team appears to be among the largest DOGE units deployed to any government agency.\n\nTen of the DOGE-affiliated staffers are listed as part of the same group within Microsoft Teams, which SSA employees use for internal communication, according to a screenshot shared with WIRED. They are listed as \u201cIT Specialists\u201d based at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington, DC, except for Bobba, who is listed as \u201cFront Office\u201d in the office of the chief information officer (CIO).\n\nMany of them have worked or interned at Musk companies such as Tesla and Space X, and the majority of them have also appeared at other government agencies in recent weeks, as part of DOGE\u2019s incursion into the government.

            "full_content": "As California continues to defy President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender athletes from girls sports, residents across the state are standing up to pressure officials to comply.\n\nThe California Interscholastic Federation, which is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education over potential Title IX violations, had its meeting Thursday crashed by protesters advocating for the protection of girls and women in sports.\n\nMultiple protesters spoke to CIF officials at the meeting, pleading with them to ban trans athletes from girls sports, citing their own experiences.\n\nTEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND\n\nOne of those speakers was St. Francis High School track and cross-country student-athlete Jordan Brace, who fears potential injuries from competing against a biological male.\n\n\"Allowing a biological male to compete against a female athlete that does not have the same kind of build or physical abilities is completely unfair and unsafe for women, and that can lead to so, so, so many injuries,\" Brace said.\n\n\"How many more injuries, which are sometimes permanent, will it take for everyone to realize how important it is for women to feel safe and for young girls to feel like they have fair competition.\"\n\nFormer high school volleyball player Payton McNabb is a female athlete who says she sustained permanent injuries from a trans opponent. McNabb says she sustained long-term physical and mental injuries in 2022 when she was spiked in the face by a transgender athlete allowed to compete on a girls team because of a policy put in place by North Carolina's high school athletic association.\n\nThe United Nations released study findings saying that nearly 900 biological females have fallen short of victories because they have been defeated by transgender athletes.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe study, \" Violence against women and girls in sports ,\" said more than 600 athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports, totaling over 890 medals, according to information obtained up to March 30, 2024.\n\n\"I want to know that I'm facing \u2026 someone who's the same gender as me,\" Brace said. \"That I'm not being beat by someone in a race that has more physical capabilities than me, that's naturally going to be faster than me, more muscular. I don't think that anyone, anywhere, any young women, should have to deal with that, should have to fear that they aren't safe or that they are being discriminated against in their sport.\n\n\"This is a matter of women's safety.\"\n\nCalifornia mother Riece Morris, who has five children who compete for schools in the state, implored CIF officials to \"do the right thing,\" while expressing her belief the officials have \"good intentions.\"\n\n\"Good intentions do not make good policy. Good intentions do not absolve you from being complicit in robbing the girls of California of fair competition and single-sex privacy,\" Morris said.\n\n\"Sacrificing girls sports by admitting boys was never a good idea. It was never going to last. So, I'm asking you to read the room, read the data and do the right thing. Do not let your legacy be that you had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do the right thing for girls after everyone else. Please stand up now and do the right thing.\"\n\nCalifornia has allowed trans athletes to compete in girls' sports since 2014, and the policy has resulted in multiple controversies over the last year alone.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMartin Luther King High School in Riverside, California, is embroiled in one of the most contentious disputes on the issue.\n\nA Dec. 19 Riverside Unified School District meeting included a parade of parents berating the board for allowing a trans athlete on the Martin Luther King girls cross-country team. A lawsuit filed by two girls on the team alleges their \"Save Girls Sports\" T-shirts in protest of that player were compared to swastikas.\n\nThe father of a girl who lost her varsity spot to the trans athlete previously told Fox News Digital his daughter and other girls at the school were told \"transgenders have more rights than cisgender[s]\" by school administrators when they protested the athlete's participation.\n\nStone Ridge Christian High School's girls volleyball team was scheduled to face San Francisco Waldorf in the Northern California Division 6 tournament but forfeited just before the match over the presence of a trans athlete on the team.\n\nA transgender volleyball player was allegedly booed and harassed at an Oct. 12 match between Notre Dame Belmont in Belmont, California, against Half Moon Bay High School, according to ABC 7. Half Moon Bay rostered the transgender athlete.\n\nThe state continues to allow transgender athletes in girls sports at the risk of losing federal funding by defying Trump's executive order, and Gov. Gavin Newsom recently admitted trans athletes competing with girls is \"deeply unfair.\"\n\nBut Newsom also won't take a decisive stand opposing transgender inclusion, arguing transgender people are \"poor people\" who are \"more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression.\"\n\nCalifornia state lawmakers have introduced two bills to block trans athletes from competing in girls sports.\n\nCalifornia Assemblyman Bill Essayli introduced one such bill Feb. 14, while fellow Assembly member Kate Sanchez announced Jan. 7 she is introducing a bill to ban trans athletes from competing in girls and women's sports."

            "full_content": "The president threatened allies with an invasion and hit them with tariffs. For Putin, he had only praise.\n\nHe denounced the European Union as \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d while threatening to ratchet up tariffs on some of its most famous goods by 200 percent. He openly mused about annexing Greenland while sitting in the Oval Office across from the head of the military alliance that would be called to defend it. He vowed to escalate a trade war with Canada while threatening its very right to exist as a sovereign nation.\n\nBut when it came to the authoritarian leader in Moscow, President Donald Trump boasted of his relationship with Vladimir Putin and declined to say that he would pressure his Russian counterpart to agree to concessions as part of a cease-fire deal with Ukraine. Trump\u2019s sympathies seemed to lie with America\u2019s foe over its friends, further unnerving already-whiplashed allies watching anxiously as the president\u2019s handpicked envoy met with Putin at the Kremlin.\n\nAnd that was all today\u2014a day not unlike many in the early weeks of this new administration.\n\nTrump\u2019s proclamations underscored how quickly the new president has reoriented U.S. foreign policy and the nation\u2019s global priorities. Old allies are now economic rivals. Friendly neighbors are territories to be seized. Authoritarians\u2014not just Putin, but also the leaders of China and North Korea\u2014are to be respected and, potentially, transformed into partners with whom to carve up spheres of influence.\n\nThe dizzying day began, as it so often does, with an early-morning social-media post.\n\nTrump took to Truth Social to escalate his trade war with the European Union, vowing to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne in a move that worsened anxiety among consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. He reacted angrily after the EU retaliated against a first wave of U.S. tariffs, with the bloc hitting back by levying 50 percent tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and other products. Trump deemed the tariffs \u201cnasty.\u201d\n\nTrump wrote, \u201cThe European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World [was] formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States.\u201d\n\nHis claim was both untrue and adversarial. The EU, which has long prized good relations with the U.S., was acting in response to Trump\u2019s initial tariffs, established the day before on goods such as aluminum and steel. EU leaders have made clear their hopes to do away with the tariffs but vowed to stand up for the continent by targeting politically sensitive goods in the U.S. in response to the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive posture.\n\n\u201cWe will not give in to threats,\u201d Laurent Saint-Martin, France\u2019s minister delegate for foreign trade, posted on X. He added that Trump \u201cis escalating the trade war he chose to unleash.\u201d\n\nThe tariffs were greeted with dismay by Americans who enjoy the continent\u2019s wine\u2014and by Wall Street, which took yet another trade-war tumble.\n\nThe markets were further buffeted by Trump\u2019s insistence later in the day that he would not back down from an April 2 deadline to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on Canadian goods. The president has waffled on tariffs with America\u2019s neighbor to the north, imposing one set on steel and aluminum earlier this week only to remove it hours later, but he declared in the Oval Office today that this time, he will follow through.\n\nTrump has repeatedly misstated the size of Canada\u2019s existing tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products and has wildly exaggerated the amount of fentanyl coming across the border. His broadsides against Canada have poisoned feelings toward the U.S. in Ottawa. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\u201d the nation\u2019s new prime minister, Mark Carney, said this week. Yet Trump has not stopped talking about adding Canada as his nation\u2019s 51st state, his rhetoric escalating from taunt to threat, with many Canadians viewing it as an existential worry.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need anything that they got. We [buy Canadian goods] because we want to be helpful, but it comes a point when you just can\u2019t do that. You have to run your own country,\u201d Trump said today. \u201cAnd to be honest with you, Canada only works as a state.\u201d\n\nTrump delivered that ominous observation in his first meeting of his second term with Mark Rutte, NATO\u2019s secretary general. Canada is a member of NATO, and an attempt to annex it by force would trigger the 75-year-old alliance\u2019s mutual-defense pact, known as Article 5, which theoretically could pit the rest of the West against the United States. But Trump further poked at NATO by suggesting that he also has his eye on another piece of land\u2014Greenland, a territory of Denmark\u2014and hinting that he may even send troops there.\n\n\u201cWe really need it for national security. I think that\u2019s why NATO might have to get involved in a way, because we really need Greenland for national security,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, we have a couple of bases on Greenland already, and we have quite a few soldiers, and maybe you\u2019ll see more and more soldiers.\u201d\n\nFor years, Trump has lusted after Greenland, which is rich with minerals and sits in a strategic location in the North Atlantic. But Denmark has refused to discuss a transfer or sale, even as Greenland this week elected a party that favors gradual independence. Rutte chuckled while Trump discussed Greenland, drawing the ire of some Danish officials, including Rasmus Jarlov, the chairman of Denmark\u2019s defense committee, who said that his nation does \u201cnot appreciate\u201d Rutte \u201cjoking with Trump about Greenland like this. It would mean war between two NATO countries.\u201d\n\nBut even as Trump delivered those threats, he pulled his punches with Putin. For weeks, he and his administration have aligned themselves with Moscow\u2019s view of the war in Ukraine. Trump has declared that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is \u201ca dictator,\u201d that Ukraine started the conflict, that Ukraine would not be allowed to enter NATO, the alliance designed as a bulwark against Russian aggression. Trump belittled Zelensky in the Oval Office last month, and his now-lifted pause in U.S. intelligence sharing with and military supplies to Ukraine allowed Russia to gain territory on the battlefield. Even as Trump\u2019s emissary Steve Witkoff traveled to the Kremlin to see if Russia would agree to the 30-day cease-fire proposal developed by the U.S. and Ukraine, the president declined to say today that he would push Putin to take the deal or to make any concessions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about leverage, because right now, we\u2019re talking to them, and [the talks] were pretty positive,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI hope Russia is going to make the deal too, and I think once that deal happens \u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going back to shooting again. I think that leads to peace.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Trump went on to declare that he \u201cgot along very well with President Putin.\u201d This time, Rutte didn\u2019t laugh."

            "full_content": "Wall Street\u2019s sell-off hit a new low following President Donald Trump\u2019s latest escalation in his trade war.\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Wall Street\u2019s sell-off hit a new low Thursday after President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating trade war dragged the S&P 500 more than 10% below its record, which was set just last month.\n\nA 10% drop is a big enough deal that professional investors have a name for it \u2014 a \u201ccorrection\u201d \u2014 and the S&P 500\u2019s 1.4% slide on Thursday sent the index to its first since 2023. The losses came after Trump upped the stakes in his trade war by threatening huge taxes on European wines and alcohol. Not even a double-shot of good news on the U.S. economy could stop the bleeding.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 537 points, or 1.3% Thursday, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2%.\n\nThe dizzying, battering swings for stocks have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour, and the Dow hurtled between a slight gain and a drop of 689 points on Thursday.\n\nThe turbulence is a result of uncertainty about how much pain Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to reshape the country and world as he wants. The president has said he wants manufacturing jobs back in the United States, along with a smaller U.S. government workforce and other fundamental changes.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest escalation came Thursday when he threatened 200% tariffs on Champagne and other European wines, unless the European Union rolls back a \u201cnasty\u201d tariff announced on U.S. whiskey. The European Union unveiled that move on Wednesday, in response to U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum.\n\nU.S. households and businesses have already reported drops in confidence because of all the uncertainty about which tariffs will stick from Trump\u2019s barrage of on -again, off -again announcements. That\u2019s raised fears about a pullback in spending that could sap energy from the economy. Some U.S. businesses say they\u2019ve already begun to see a change in their customers\u2019 behavior because of the uncertainty.\n\nA particularly feared scenario for the economy is one where its growth stagnates but inflation stays high because of tariffs. Few tools are available in Washington to fix what\u2019s called \u201cstagflation.\u201d If the Federal Reserve were to cut interest rates to boost the economy, for example, that could also push inflation higher.\n\nGood news came on both those economic fronts Thursday.\n\nOne report showed inflation at the wholesale level last month was milder than economists expected. It followed a similarly encouraging report from the prior day on inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling.\n\nBut \u201cthe question for markets is whether good news on the inflation front can make itself heard above the noise of the ever-changing tariff story,\u201d said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n\nA separate report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected. It\u2019s the latest signal that the job market remains relatively solid overall. If that can continue, it could allow U.S. consumers to keep spending, and that\u2019s the main engine of the economy.\n\nOn Wall Steet, some stocks connected to the artificial-intelligence industry resumed their slide and weighed on stock indexes. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, sank 4.8%. Super Micro Computer, which makes servers, lost 8%. Nvidia swung between gains and losses before finishing with a dip of 0.1%.\n\nSuch stocks have been under the most pressure in the U.S. stock market\u2019s recent sell-off after critics said their prices shot too high in the frenzy around AI.\n\nOther areas of the market that had also been riding big earlier momentum have seen their fortunes swing drastically. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla fell 3% following a rare back-to-back gain, and it\u2019s down more than 40% so far in 2025.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters dropped 4.1% after the retailer said \u201cless robust demand and colder weather\u201d have held back its performance recently. It forecasted a dip in revenue for the upcoming year, though it also delivered a stronger profit report for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nOn the winning side of Wall Street was Intel, which jumped 14.6% after naming former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its CEO. Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next week, more than three months after Intel\u2019s previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn at the once-dominant chipmaker.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 lost 77.78 points to 5,521.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 537.36 to 40,813.57, and the Nasdaq composite sank 345.44 to 17,303.01.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields lost an early gain to sink lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.32%. The yield has been mostly dropping since January, when it was approaching 4.80%, as traders and economists have ratcheted back their expectations for U.S. economic growth.\n\nWhile few are predicting a recession, particularly with the job market remaining relatively solid, recent reports have shown a souring of confidence among U.S. consumers and companies.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia, but the moves were relatively modest.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nTesla, the electric car company run by Elon Musk, said this week that retaliatory tariffs against US manufacturers could harm its operations and that the US should carefully consider its trade policies, a break from Musk\u2019s ally President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a March 11 letter to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, company representatives wrote: \u201cAs a U.S. manufacturer and exporter, Tesla encourages USTR to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Tesla recognizes and supports the importance of fair trade, the assessment undertaken by USTR of potential actions to rectify unfair trade should also take into account exports from the United States,\u201d the letter said.\n\nIt warned that past US tariff actions have resulted in \u201cimmediate reactions\u201d by the targeted countries, such as increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries. The letter is unsigned.\n\nMusk\u2019s Tesla has basked in the limelight under the Trump White House, which has put tariffs at the forefront of its economic policy. On Tuesday, the president posed in front of a fleet of Teslas, saying he would purchase one full price. As he spoke, Trump was holding what resembled a Tesla showroom pitch with a list of vehicle prices, according to a photo from Getty Images.\n\nBut Tesla shares have been in a sharp slump recently, erasing their gains since Election Day. The company\u2019s European sales dropped 45% in January, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. And despite his outsized role in the government, Musk has become a polarizing political figure. Tesla shares closed down 3% Thursday.\n\nPast tariff actions by the US, Tesla wrote, increased the cost of US-manufactured vehicles for the company and when those vehicles are exported out of the US.\n\nThe Office of the US Trade Representative should investigate ways to avoid these pitfalls in future actions, the letter added.\n\nThe letter also said that trade policy should consider the \u201climitations in the domestic supply chain\u201d regarding EVs and lithium-ion batteries. Some of these items are simply impossible to source within the US, the letter argued.\n\nTesla operates numerous US facilities that altogether employ over 70,000 people, according to the company. Its Fremont, California, factory manufactures vehicles as well as lithium-ion battery cells, and the company also has facilities in Austin, Texas; Sparks, Nevada; Buffalo, New York; Brooklyn Park, Minnesota; and Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nCNN has reached out to Tesla for comment."

I have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, and we'll see what happens, but certainly he's a nuclear power.\"\n\nOn January 20, when he was inaugurated for his second term, Trump said North Korea was a \"nuclear power,\" raising questions about whether he would pursue arms reduction talks rather than denuclearization efforts that failed in his first term in any re-engagement with Pyongyang.\n\nAfter referring to Russia and China's nuclear arsenals, Trump said: \"It would be a great achievement if we could bring down the number. We have so many weapons, and the power is so great.\n\n\"And number one, you don't need them to that extent. And then we'd have to get others, 'cause, as you know, in a smaller way - Kim Jong Un has a lot of nuclear weapons, by the way, a lot, and others do also. You have India, you have Pakistan, you have others that have them, and we get them involved.\"\n\nAsked if Trump remarks represented any shift in policy towards North Korea's nuclear weapons, a White House official said: \"President Trump will pursue the complete denuclearization of North Korea, just as he did in his first term.\"\n\nOn February 15, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Japanese and South Korean counterparts reaffirmed their \"resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization\" of North Korea in accordance with U.S. Security Council Resolutions.\n\nLast week, Kim Jong Un's powerful sister Kim Yo Jong criticized the Trump administration for stepping up \"provocations\" and said it justified North Korea increasing its nuclear deterrent.

He told police he had been severely abused since age 11, enduring \u201cprolonged abuse, starvation, severe neglect, and inhumane treatment,\u201d they said.\n\nWhen he was removed from school as a child, a former principal, Tom Pannone, went so far as to knock on the family\u2019s door looking for him, Pannone said in an interview.Pannone, who was principal of the now-closed Barnard Elementary School in Waterbury, said he was given several explanations about why Sullivan\u2019s son was no longer attending class in the early 2000s, including that he was being homeschooled.\n\nInterim Superintendent Darren Schwartz said, \u201cBased on available information, the student was unenrolled from the Waterbury Public Schools in 2004.\u201d\n\nWaterbury Police Lt. Ryan Bessette told NBC News the stepson told authorities that his formal education ended around the fourth grade and that then he was homeschooled.\n\nPannone told NBC Connecticut: \u201cYou could just simply withdraw your child from school, and you didn\u2019t even have to make a plan for homeschooling. It was a very lax system, and a lot of parents would just say, \u2018I\u2019m homeschooling them,\u2019 and that was it.\u201d\n\nSarah Eagan, of the Center for Children\u2019s Advocacy, a legal rights law firm for children, said that many states have some type of policy or regulatory framework around withdrawing children from school for the stated purpose of homeschooling but that Connecticut does not have clear guidelines.\n\n\u201cWhen a child is dis-enrolled from school, with a caregiver saying, \u2018I\u2019m withdrawing my child to home school,\u2019 that kind of ends it.

We\u2019ll verify,\u2019\u201d Eagan said. \u201cBecause Connecticut has no system for that and has been reluctant to create a system yet.\u201d\n\nEagan, who previously worked at the Office of the Child Advocate, a state watchdog agency, said that while parents have a right to educate their children as they see fit, states have a clear legal interest in ensuring the safety and education of their citizens.\n\nWhich is why legal challenges to states\u2019 homeschool regulations have been upheld for the most part, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is a balancing of rights and responsibilities, and it needs a thoughtful balance, because most people who are directing the education of their children are likely doing so well and appropriately,\u201d Eagan said.\n\n\u201cBut you have individuals who take advantage of the system, and it\u2019s not really about homeschooling. It\u2019s about people who pretend, people who use the pretense of homeschooling as a guise to remove their child from public view.\u201d\n\nKimberly Sullivan stands next to her attorney Jason Spilka during a bond hearing Thursday, March 13, 2025 at Waterbury Superior Court in Connecticut. Jim Shannon / Pool via AP\n\nThe years of cruelty for Sullivan\u2019s stepson ended Feb. 17 when he used a lighter, hand sanitizer and paper to set the fire, he told police.\n\nWhen authorities found him, he was \u201cextremely emaciated, his hair was matted and unkempt, he was very dirty and his teeth all appeared to be rotten,\u201d according to an arrest affidavit.\n\n\u201cInvestigators further discovered that he had been provided with only minimal amounts of food and water, which led to his extremely malnourished condition,\u201d police said.\n\nTo remove a student from public school in Connecticut, a parent \u201cshould\u201d formally submit that intention to district offices and file papers for the \u201cchild\u2019s withdrawal from school,\u201d according to the state.\n\nWhile parents are told to maintain \u201ca portfolio for each child which contains samples of activities, assignments, projects and assessments, as well as a log of books and materials used,\u201d regulations do not appear to have significant enforcement provisions.\n\nThe National Home Education Legal Defense Association ranks Connecticut as among the least-regulated states for parents or guardians to remove their children from class.\n\nConnecticut, Texas and Idaho have \u201cno notice, low regulation\u201d over homeschooling, the association said.\n\nWhile state officials could ask parents to show them portfolios of their children\u2019s work, the group said that it is \u201cnot necessary\u201d and that if \u201cyou are asked to participate in an optional portfolio review, please contact us for assistance.\u201d"

But Schumer said Republicans rejected that offer.

We look forward to presenting our evidence to a jury and finally having the opportunity to hold Fox accountable for its harmful actions.\u201d\n\nSmartmatic settled a similar defamation claim against One America News Network in April, and its lawsuit against Fox Corp. and Fox News is scheduled for trial in 2025.\n\nWhile the $40 million number is quite a sum for Smartmatic, it is eclipsed by the amount paid to Dominion Voting Systems by Fox News when they settled a similar defamation suit in April 2023.

            "full_content": "We learned something on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHouse Republicans can pass a government funding bill without Democratic assistance.\n\nBarely. 217-213.\n\nRepublicans could only lose one vote. And that\u2019s all they lost: Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nTHE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO WHERE WE STAND WITH A POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nThe GOP bill even picked up one Democratic yea: Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine.\n\nPassing government funding bills on their own wasn\u2019t always the case for the House GOP. Republicans have held the House majority for more than two years now. The GOP majority consistently leaned on Democrats \u2013 serving in the minority \u2013 for many of the votes to keep the government open and lift the debt ceiling. But that changed late Tuesday afternoon as House Republicans approved their own bill to keep the lights on.\n\nBut before the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., berated Democrats for opposing the temporary spending package, known as a \"Continuing Resolution\" or \"CR.\"\n\n\"If Congressional Democrats refuse to support this clean CR, they will be responsible for every troop who misses a paycheck. For every flight delay from reduced staffing at TSA. For every negative consequence that comes from shutting down the government,\" said Johnson.\n\nIt was unclear if Johnson could pass the bill with just Republicans. Especially as the Speaker upbraided Democrats for vowing to vote nay.\n\n\"You continually criticize the Democrats,\" yours truly said to the Speaker. \"Doesn't that imply that you don't have the votes on your side? Because you wouldn\u2019t need Democratic assistance to keep the government?\"\n\n\"No. We will have the votes,\" responded Johnson. \"We\u2019re going to pass the CR and we can do it on our own.\"\n\nA few hours later, the Speaker made good on his promise.\n\nBut he had an assist.\n\nVice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to assuage fears of skeptical House Republicans Tuesday morning. But Vance didn\u2019t quite close the deal.\n\n\"I saw some looks in there that didn't leave me feeling good as to securing the votes of those who may be having questions,\" said Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., after the House Republican conclave with Vance.\n\nRep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., and others said they needed more assurances about future spending cuts. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said he would \"pray\" about how to vote on the bill. But heading into the meeting, Burchett conceded he hadn\u2019t yet experienced any political intercession.\n\n\"I'm uncomfortable with giving the Pentagon more money, even though overall, we're cutting,\" said Burchett.\n\nBy afternoon, Burchett told me he was \"closer,\" but still not there.\n\nAnd when the House voted, it passed the bill.\n\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: HERE WE GO AGAIN (AGAIN)\n\nBut what made the difference when it came to convincing skittish Republicans to vote yes?\n\nRep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., told Fox he was \"barely\" for the CR.\n\n\"What's the \u2018barely\u2019 part?\" I asked.\n\n\"The \u2018barely\" is Donald Trump. He is the difference maker. I would never support this language. But I do trust Donald Trump,\" said Burlison. \"He's not let me down. I think that he is a man of his word. And so I believe him when he's when he says he's going to get it done.\"\n\nBut that was only half of the battle. The bill earned the support of all but one Senate Republican. But 60 votes are necessary to break a filibuster. Republicans only have 53 GOP members. So that would entail assistance from Democrats.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he opposed the bill because it didn\u2019t cut spending. Paul said he didn\u2019t get any blowback from the President or fellow Republicans on his position.\n\n\"People know kind of where I am. I'm pretty consistent on opposing debt and opposing spending,\" said Paul.\n\nContrast the silence Paul has heard to how President Trump unloaded on his Bluegrass State colleague, Thomas Massie. Mr. Trump argued that Massie should face a primary for his defection.\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., is the only Democrat on the record support the stopgap spending bill.\n\nSo, it\u2019s about the math.\n\nWith only 52 Republicans primed to crack a filibuster, that means the Senate needs eight Democrats to vote yes. That includes Fetterman. Note that they don\u2019t have to vote yes on the bill. Just to overcome the filibuster. Republicans can pass the bill on their own with a simple majority.\n\nThis leaves Democrats as badly torn as any party in recently on any issue.\n\nOn one hand, Democrats don\u2019t want to shutter the government. They fear that will imperil already skittish federal workers. And it could lead to additional cuts from Elon Musk and DOGE if federal workers aren\u2019t on the job.\n\nOn the other hand, they want to be seen as fighting for their base and rally against President Trump and Musk.\n\nBut it is often the darkest before the dawn.\n\nTRUMP'S UNION-ENDORSED PICK CONFIRMED BY SENATE TO LEAD LABOR DEPARTMENT\n\nDemocrats must either go to the mat or try to salvage something before the 11:59:59 pm et government funding deadline Friday.\n\nThere are rattlings that Democrats may ask for votes on a universe of amendments \u2013 none of which would pass. But at least Democrats could save face \u2013 telling their loyalists that they fought for their values and tried to stand up to the President and Musk. They could also make the case that a shutdown is worse than keeping the government open.\n\nFox is told senators would be interested in votes on the following subjects:\n\nRestoring funding for Washington, DC\n\nRestricting DOGE and/or efforts by the administration to \"impound\" money already appropriated by Congress\n\nA Democratic one-month, stopgap spending bill\n\nFetterman appeared to be the only Democrat willing to vote for the GOP interim spending bill, but Thursday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced he would vote for it. And it\u2019s possible that a vote on a set of amendments could unlock a few Democratic votes to break a filibuster on the bill.\n\nBut tensions are now running high.\n\nReporters staking out a meeting of Senate Democrats talking about the shutdown heard who they believe was Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand, D-N.Y., screaming at her colleagues through he thick Capitol walls.\n\nMultiple Senate Democrats were utterly silent as they left a lengthy Senate Democratic Caucus. None of the senators approached by Fox were willing to talk \u2013 even though some are quite loquacious under other circumstances. In fact Fox even asked several of the Democrats if they were told not to say anything. Several replied \"no comment.\"\n\nQuiet on Capitol Hill often means something is up and that lawmakers are trying to broker a very fragile deal. It also means that lawmakers are fuming.\n\nThere was genuine fear among Democrats that a government shutdown could permanently imperil the federal government and perhaps trigger additional layoffs of thousands of federal workers.\n\nHere\u2019s the other problem: If the government shut down, no one is quite sure HOW it could re-open. It\u2019s about the math. And the calculus under those circumstances simply did not work to for the House and Senate to eventually pass the same bill and re-open the government. That calculus simply did not seem to work.\n\nThat\u2019s why Schumer made the decision to support the Band-Aid spending bill \u2013 as risky as it is.\n\nThis is why multiple Senate Democrats refused to comment on what Schumer told them at the closed-door caucus meeting today. That\u2019s why tempers flared and Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was heard yelling through the thick Senate walls.\n\nBut this is not without peril for Schumer.\n\nHe needs to convince six other Democrats (for a grand total of eight) to support overcoming a filibuster.\n\nThere are 53 Senate Republicans. 60 votes are needed to avert a filibuster.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is a no. So the deficit is eight. Schumer and Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) are the first two Democrats to say they are willing to vote to overcome a filibuster. So Schumer needs six more.\n\nIf he can\u2019t find those votes, the government will close. And Schumer will have committed a tremendous tactical error.\n\nAs the saying goes, a leader with no followers is just a man out for a walk.\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, used to say that \"nothing good\" ever happens when Congress has been in session for more than three consecutive weeks.\n\nMembers grow angry. Antsy. Tempers are short.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., noted that the Senate has met for ten consecutive weeks.\n\n\"Senators have been seeing a lot of each other lately. In fact, too much,\" said Thune.\n\nThat includes three all-night sessions and weekend sessions. This period is the longest stretch of consecutive weeks for Senate activity in 15 years.\n\nThe Senate is scheduled to be out next week for the first time this year. A government shutdown trashes the recess. Senators have barely seen their family members. It\u2019s been a frenetic pace.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat\u2019s why the most powerful people in Washington could have the ultimate say about funding the government: Senate spouses.\n\nAnd if the Senate aligns with the House, they will have averted a government shutdown.\n\nBut barely."

Let\u2019s have some respect,\u201d Strable said.\n\nInfluencer Sam Jones was filmed picking up a baby wombat. Credit: Sam Jones / Instagram\n\nStrable was travelling in Australia when she posted a video on Instagram showing her carrying the baby wombat away from its mother.\n\nThe clip was later deleted.\n\nThe video sparked immediate controversy and people criticising her actions.\n\nAmid the backlash, Tony Burke said the government was looking over Strable\u2019s visa to determine whether immigration law has been breached.\n\n\u201cEither way, given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I\u2019ll be surprised if she even bothers,\u201d Burke said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual. I don\u2019t expect she will return.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese called the incident an \u201coutrage\u201d on Thursday.\n\n\u201cTo take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,\u201d Albanese said, describing the marsupials as \u201cgentle, lovely creatures\u201d.\n\nIn the video posted by Strable\u2019s Instagram account @Samstrays_somewhere, she was seen picking the wombat joey up and running down an isolated but unidentified road towards the camera, with a man laughing and saying: \u201cLook at the mother, it\u2019s chasing after her.\u201d\n\nHolding the hissing animal up for the camera, Strable then says: \u201cI caught a baby wombat. Mumma\u2019s right there, she is p*****, let\u2019s let him go.\u201d\n\nThe marsupial was eventually released back onto the road.\n\nPlay Video American influencer Sam Jones is facing backlash over the clip.

            "full_content": "TIGARD, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Gunshots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Oregon on Thursday for the second time in a week in ongoing vandalism and protests around the country since CEO Elon Musk became a key figure in the Trump administration.\n\nAround 4:15 a.m., more than a dozen shots were fired around the electric vehicle dealership in the Portland suburb of Tigard, according to the Tigard Police Department. The shooting caused extensive damage to cars and showroom windows, police said. No one was hurt.\n\nA similar shooting happened on March 6 at the same location. Police said they continue to work with federal partners at the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives to thoroughly investigate. An ATF explosive detection dog has been used after both shootings to help search for shell casings, police said.\n\nTesla has been a target for demonstrations and vandalism in the U.S. and elsewhere this year. People have protested Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has been moving to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nPolice said over the weekend that six Tesla Cybertrucks at a dealership in the Seattle suburb of Lynnwood were spray painted with swastikas and profanity directed at Musk, KING-TV reported.\n\nOn Sunday, four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a blaze in Seattle, but investigators have not said if the fire, or fires, were intentionally set. On Tuesday, the Seattle Police Department said it was working with federal partners to investigate the incident.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday that he was buying a new Tesla to show his support for Musk as the billionaire\u2019s company struggles with sagging sales and declining stock prices."

            "full_content": "She first put up skeletons for Halloween. Then when Christmas neared, Alexis Luttrell added some holiday flair, dressing her 8-foot skeleton man in red and green colors. She even gave the skeleton dog a Christmas tree toboggan hat. But officials in her Germantown, Tenn., hometown aren\u2019t so festive: They say the decorations have got to go. A code \u00adcompliance officer handed Luttrell a citation for violating the city\u2019s Holiday Decorations Ordinance. According to city officials, Luttrell could only keep her skeletons up from 45 days before to 30 days after Halloween. And changing the skeletons\u2019 themes to reflect other holidays wouldn\u2019t get her out of the citation or the Feb. 13 municipal court date. Rather than acquiesce and take down her \u00adskeletons, the Tennessee woman filed a case in U.S. District Court alleging Germantown\u2019s decorations law violates her First Amendment right to free expression. \u201cWhy do one or two people in code enforcement get to decide what counts as an appropriate holiday decoration?\u201d Luttrell told WMC-TV. In a Feb. 19 filing, Luttrell\u2019s attorneys asked the federal court for an injunction to prevent city officials from enforcing the decorations ordinance until the case is resolved.\n\nEnough with the ads!\n\nAn Indian man perturbed by \u00adnever-ending commercials rolling before a movie didn\u2019t just get mad\u2014he demanded reimbursement. In February, an Indian court ruled in favor of Abhishek MR who had sued an Indian cinema chain for wasting his time and causing him mental anguish after suffering through 25 minutes of commercials before the start of his movie. According to the lawsuit, the show ran long, preventing the patron from getting his work done. The court ordered the cinema chain PVR Inox to pay the angry patron\u2019s court costs as well as approximately $570 for wasting his time and $57 for mental anguish.\n\nMerely a common sandal\n\nBirkenstock sandals aren\u2019t works of art, a German court ruled Feb. 20, and they can therefore be copied like any other consumer product. The makers of the cork-and-latex sandals had sought relief in court against copycat manufacturers that have eaten into the shoemaker\u2019s market share. \u201cWe want to ensure that copycats can no longer make money at the expense of our brand,\u201d spokesman Jochen Gutzy told The Guardian. If the court had declared the sandals a copyrighted work of applied art, the designation would have allowed the company to sue competitors.\n\nIn a forgiving mood\n\nA French man whose backpack was stolen in February would like his wallet back. But what he really wants is a piece of what the thieves purchased at his expense. The victim\u2019s lawyer announced Feb. 20 the thieves had used the victim\u2019s bank card to purchase a winning French lottery ticket worth about $524,000. Attorney Pierre Debuisson said his client would happily split the proceeds with the thieves and preserve their anonymity, too. A shop owner remembers two men using the victim\u2019s payment card to buy the winning scratch-off ticket, saying the two men were so excited that they forgot their belongings in the shop. But, \u00adperhaps fearing arrest, no one has yet tried to claim the winning ticket.\n\nPothole pranking\n\nThe local government of Cambridgeshire, U.K., would like locals to report potholes through a form on a website. One impatient Brit had a different idea. Frustrated by the slow progress of fixing a massive pothole in the village of Castle Camps, James Coxall added legs to the road hazard Feb. 23. Working with his family, the 41-year-old stuffed an old pair of jeans with rags and buried it upside down in the pothole. He added a bright pair of shoes to garner more attention. \u201cThe shoes were going to charity anyway, so we thought we\u2019d give them an outing first,\u201d he told the BBC. According to Coxall, the pothole has been a problem for eight months, but he said local authorities have promised to soon inspect and fix it.\n\nPastry emergency\n\nAt first the 911 dispatcher couldn\u2019t understand the person on the other side of the emergency phone call. But eventually, the Moore, Okla., caller made clear the nature of his crisis: He wanted doughnuts. A toddler named Bennett made the call using an old cellphone, which still had the ability to dial 911 even without active service, the police department said. Before the Feb. 27 phone call ended, the dispatcher asked the boy if he\u2019d be willing to share any doughnuts that he had. The boy rejected the offer. But the next day, police officers appeared at Bennett\u2019s house anyway to drop off a fresh batch of doughnuts from Dunkin\u2019.\n\nWhat\u2019s a few extra zeros?\n\nFor a moment, it may have seemed like there was a new richest person in the world. According to a Feb. 28 report in the Financial Times, Citigroup accidentally credited a customer\u2019s account with $81 trillion last year. The financial behemoth said an employee caught the error 90 minutes after it posted and was able to fix the mistake. The miscalculation happened when an employee attempted to enter a $280 deposit into the client\u2019s account but failed to first zero out an entry field that was pre-populated with 15 zeros."

            "full_content": "Breaking down Zeldin's EPA rollbacks that could impact the environment\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will roll back or change 31 environmental rules and regulations.\n\nSome of these changes include revisions of national air quality standards for particulate matter, emission standards for industrial air pollutants and regulations restricting vehicle emissions.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the deregulation will drive \"a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more.\"\n\nBut a new update to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication's Climate Opinion Maps suggests most Americans support at least some environmental regulation.\n\nYale's study is based on estimates from large national surveys totaling more than 32,000 people between November 2008 and December 2024. Some questions have been included since the beginning, but Yale researchers also added questions over the years.\n\nNationally, they found an estimated 2 out of 3 Americans support the U.S. economy transitioning from fossil fuels to 100% clean energy by 2050 \u2014 a newly added measurement in the 2024 update. An even higher share, about 3 out of 4, support regulating carbon emissions and funding research into renewable energy.\n\nSupport for these policies is typically lower in more rural states and counties. In Wyoming, for example, an estimated 43% support a full transition to clean energy \u2014 one of three states where fewer than half of adults support this policy.\n\nBy comparison, 3 out of 4 adults in Maryland, Vermont and Massachusetts support a full transition to clean energy, higher than the national average.\n\nIn every state and county in the U.S., the Yale study found more than half of Americans support regulating carbon emissions and funding research into renewable energy.\n\nYale's study also found that about 63% of Americans say they are \"worried\" about global warming and believe it will harm people in the U.S.\n\nThese opinions also vary by geography, with more people in urban areas saying they are worried about global warming.\n\nNationally, a majority of people believe government officials should do more to address climate change. However, more people wanted action from people and companies than from government. See the differences below on where people are looking for action."

            "full_content": "Christianity\u2019s impact on culture is profound, shaping everything from how we think about family to the purpose of government. However, understanding the mechanisms by which Christianity influences culture and how cultural shifts, in turn, affect religious belief is a complex task. Three books have shaped my understanding of this dynamic, and each addresses different dimensions of the intersection between Christianity and culture. They challenge conventional wisdom and provide insights that significantly altered my perspective.\n\nFamily as the foundation\n\nMary Eberstadt\u2019s How the West Really Lost God (2013) transformed my understanding of secularization. Traditional theories suggest that societies become more secular as they become wealthier and more scientifically advanced. Eberstadt challenges this assumption by presenting a compelling alternative: The decline of the family is deeply intertwined with the decline of religious belief.\n\nShe roots her argument in the idea that the family serves as a divinely commissioned institution for the transmission of faith. Families are not social constructs. They are essential vessels for passing down religious beliefs and practices. When family life weakens\u2014due to declining birth rates, increased divorce rates, and cultural shifts away from \u00adhonoring traditional family values\u2014\u00adreligious belief also suffers.\n\nInstead of seeing secularization as an inevitable byproduct of modernity, I now understand it as a phenomenon tied to social structures. Eberstadt\u2019s thesis is proving true since statistics tell us that religious observance in America generally tracks with family structure: Intact families tend to be more religious. This insight also underscores the importance of strengthening the family if Christianity is to have a continued cultural presence. Rather than merely lamenting the rise of secularism, believers must engage in revitalizing family life as a means of sustaining faith for future generations.\n\nChristianity and the state\n\nRichard John Neuhaus\u2019 The Naked Public Square (1984) illuminated for me the role Christianity plays as a mediating force between individuals and the state. In contemporary society, there is a growing tendency to relegate religious belief to the private sphere, treating it as something personal rather than a force that shapes public life. Neuhaus argues that stripping the public square of religious influence leaves it vulnerable to the rise of statism and the idolization of the self.\n\nChristianity, according to Neuhaus, does not merely consist of internalized beliefs; it provides a framework for understanding the world and orienting our lives. Through Christianity\u2019s influence, mediating institutions\u2014such as churches, schools, and community organizations\u2014are able to form people\u2019s deepest convictions and counterbalance the power of the state. Without these institutions, the state becomes the primary source of moral authority, leading to an erosion of personal freedoms and a diminished role for religious conscience in public life.\n\nOne of Neuhaus\u2019 most powerful insights is that the exclusion of Christianity from public discourse does not result in neutrality. It results in state-sponsored secularism as the default ethic of society. The myth of neutrality creates a vacuum that is filled by alternative ideologies\u2014often ones that elevate state power or individual autonomy to an almost religious status. It\u2019s important to maintain a public role for Christianity, not just for the sake of religious believers, but for the health of society as a whole.\n\nIf Christians abandon the public square, they provide an opening for dangerous worldviews to dominate.\n\nCulture\u2019s moral underpinnings\n\nThe final book that significantly influenced my thinking on Christianity and culture is Robert P. George\u2019s Making Men Moral (1993). In this work, George grapples with one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary society: How can we establish a public morality that accounts for justice, truth, and moral order in a pluralistic world? He finds his answer in the natural law tradition, which he argues provides a foundational framework for understanding human goods and shaping law and culture accordingly. George\u2019s book is not a Christian book per se, but the attentive reader will see how his argument coincides with Christian teaching about justice, morality, and truth.\n\nGeorge argues there are objective moral truths society must recognize in order to function justly. These truths are not arbitrary but are grounded in the basic goods of human nature\u2014goods such as life, the pursuit of knowledge and truth, family, and community. He demonstrates\u2014without asserting directly\u2014that these basic human goods align closely with Biblical morality.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Making Men Moral is its rejection of the idea that laws should be morally neutral. Many contemporary thinkers believe laws should avoid making moral judgments to accommodate a diverse society. However, George counters that every law embodies some moral vision. The real question is not whether morality should inform law, but which morality should do so. A just society, he argues, must be built on a foundation that upholds human dignity and the common good.\n\nThis book helped me understand that public morality is not merely a matter of individual preference or cultural consensus; it is grounded in deeper moral truths that transcend subjective opinions.\n\nTogether, these books have reinforced my conviction that Christianity is not just a private belief system but a vital force in shaping civilization. They challenge the notion that faith should be relegated to the margins of public life and instead affirm that Christianity offers essential moral and social insights that benefit society. In an era in which secularism and relativism often dominate cultural discourse, the wisdom found in these works provides a compelling case for the continued relevance of Christian thought in shaping our world."

            "full_content": "Former Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on Thursday, launched a verbal attack on his predecessor, Governor Uba Sani, and the ruling All Progressives Congress following the arrest of his former commissioner, Jafaru Ibrahim Sani, by the police in Kaduna.\n\nSani, who served in various capacities under El-Rufai\u2019s administration, including as Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, Education, Science and Technology, and Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, was allegedly arrested on the orders of the state government.\n\nA source close to Sani confirmed the development, expressing shock over the arrest and suggesting that it may be linked to his recent defection from the APC to the Social Democratic Party along with El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked and concerned about the arrest of Jafaru Sani. We do not know the reasons for his arrest, but we suspect it may be connected to his recent defection from the APC to the SDP,\u201d the source said.\n\nSani had, in a letter dated March 10, 2025, announced his defection from the APC, citing disillusionment with the party\u2019s leadership in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed with the direction of the APC in Kaduna State. The party has lost its way, and I can no longer continue to be a part of it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, the police in Kaduna had yet to issue an official statement on Sani\u2019s arrest, and the command\u2019s spokesperson, DSP Abubakar Aliyu, was unreachable for comment.\n\nHowever, reacting to the development on X (formerly Twitter), El-Rufai accused the state government of orchestrating what he described as the \u201cabduction\u201d of his former aide.\n\nHe alleged that Sani was being persecuted for leaving the APC and joining the SDP.\n\n\u201cOur colleague and versatile former commissioner during the El-Rufai administration, Mallam Jafaru Sani, has been abducted in Kaduna by Uba Sani\u2019s kidnapping gang claiming to be the police this afternoon!\u201d El-Rufai tweeted.\n\nHe further alleged that Sani was remanded in prison custody by a magistrate without any formal charges from the police or the state\u2019s Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cOn inquiry, we have learned that Jafaru is being charged with money laundering\u2014a federal offence that neither the state judiciary nor the police have jurisdiction to adjudicate or investigate,\u201d El-Rufai added.\n\nHe also drew parallels between Sani\u2019s arrest and the detention of his former Chief of Staff, Bashir Saidu, who was reportedly held in custody for 50 days before being granted bail.\n\n\u201cThe tactics are similar to those used against another colleague of ours\u2014Bashir Saidu\u2014when he was abducted on December 31, 2024, and kept in captivity for 50 days before he was released on bail,\u201d he stated.\n\nEl-Rufai went on to criticise the judiciary in Kaduna, accusing some magistrates and high court judges of being compromised.\n\n\u201cThe ignominious role of some henpecked and compromised magistrates and high court judges in the Kaduna State judiciary remains a source of great concern to us,\u201d he wrote, adding that accountability would eventually come for those involved in such actions."

            "full_content": "Governor Siminalayi Fubara of Rivers State has declared his openness towards the attainment of peace, even as he called on all involved in the political crisis to also embrace peace in the interest of peace and development of the state.\n\nThe Rivers logjam deepened on Wednesday as Fubara and 27 lawmakers of the state House of Assembly traded accusations over the governor\u2019s failed attempt to re-present the 2025 Appropriation Bill before the Assembly.\n\nMinister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike had mocked Fubara\u2019s failed attempt to present an appropriation bill before the Assembly, adding that Fubara should be impeached if he was found to have committed an impeachable offence.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday during the inauguration of the 85-year-old Okrika Grammar School in Okrika Local Government Area, Fubara held that the State House of Assembly also had a duty to comply with the Supreme Court judgment.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is important at this stage that we all embrace peace. The Supreme Court has made its judgment; we don\u2019t have any option but to abide by it.\n\n\u201cAnd, by the special grace of God, we have started the process. We are appealing to other parties to consider the interest of Rivers State. The only thing that we owe this state is peace and development.\n\n\u201cI am open any day, any time for total peace in our State because if I have to govern well, there is a need for peace to prevail.\u201d\n\nFubara\u2019s appeal comes as several Ijaw stakeholders from the Kalabari Kingdom in Rivers State have planned a \u201cgrand reception\u201d for the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike.\n\nUnder the auspices of the New Associates, the Ijaw stakeholders said they are mobilizing to shut down the Asari-Toru Local Government Area during the reception scheduled for Saturday.\n\nThe Chairman, publicity committee, Enemi George, in a statement in Port Harcourt on Thursday, said chiefs, leaders, women and youths celebrated Wike as a friend of the Kalabari kingdom.\n\nGeorge said the event was arranged at Abalama town as a thanksgiving service and a grand civic reception in honour of the former governor for his love for the Kalabari Kingdom.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAll stakeholders in Kalabari are eagerly waiting to receive the FCT minister and to show him gratitude. March 15 has been set aside to celebrate Nyesom Wike for his love for the Kalabari kingdom and its people.\n\n\u201cHe has done much for the kingdom and he deserves to be celebrated. We are calling on our chiefs, leaders, women, youths and stakeholders of the Kalabari kingdom to make that day special. \u201c\n\nCommenting on the Rivers logjam, a former member of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Kingsley Wali has cautioned the governor of Rivers State against grandstanding, urging the governor to rather engage the Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, the political crisis rocking Rivers State took a new twist on Thursday as the Martin Amaewhule-led House of Assembly has asked the Department of State Services to investigate the State Chief Judge, Simeon Amadi over alleged age falsification.\n\nAt its sitting presided over by the Speaker, Martin Amaewhule, the Assembly resolved to write the DSS following some documents presented by the House Leader, Major Jack.\n\nA statement issued by the media aide to the Speaker, Martins Wachukwu after Thursday\u2019s plenary said \u201cRiding on Order 23 of the Standing Orders of the House, Major Jack laid a document on the table which alleged that Hon. Justice Amadi falsified his age in the civil service.\u201d\n\nMembers argued that falsification is a serious offence, but the allegation must first be proven and urged relevant security agencies to help the House investigate the allegation.\n\nCommenting, the Speaker, Martin Amaewhule, stated that the House, though empowered to investigate by the provisions of Section 128 of the Constitution, the Governor of the State has barred all heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies not to appearing before the House or assist the House in the conduct of the investigation.\n\n\u201cSo, the House is calling on the Department of State Service to institute an investigation on the alleged age falsification by the Chief Judge to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the allegation, which will be forwarded to the National Judicial Council\u201d.\n\nIn another development, the Speaker asked all Committees to submit their reports to the House before the House proceeds on recess, particularly, the House Committee on Public Complaints and Petitions."

As a new hire at Georgetown University Law Center in early 2022, he hadn\u2019t yet started his first day on the job when the school suspended him over a tweet criticizing President Joe Biden\u2019s promise to appoint a Supreme Court justice based on race. The tweet\u2014which Shapiro deleted and admitted was \u201cinartfully phrased\u201d\u2014sparked student backlash and prompted a four-month investigation from the school. Georgetown ultimately cleared him on a technicality but warned he\u2019d be further investigated if he offended again. Arguing the school had created a hostile work environment, Shapiro instead resigned. The experience led to his publication this year of Lawless: The Miseducation of America\u2019s Elites. Here are edited excerpts of our interview.\n\nWhy write a book about law school education? Law schools graduate the next generation of leaders and gatekeepers of our legal and political institutions. Today\u2019s left-wing ideological movement is not the decades-old conservative complaint about hippies taking over the faculty lounge. Those hippies of the 1960s Berkeley Free Speech Movement would be considered retrograde white supremacists by today\u2019s radicals. What\u2019s going on now is the undermining of the ideas of due process, equality under the law, free speech, or\u2014for university context\u2014open inquiry in the search for truth. These are truly worrying developments.\n\nWho are the \u201celites\u201d the title refers to? Sometimes it\u2019s self-anointed elitism. Sometimes it\u2019s who has the biggest megaphone. But generally when I talk about elites I mean those from the highest-ranked law schools: Georgetown, Yale, Stanford, Columbia, University of Chicago (where I attended). These schools graduate a disproportionate number of our federal judges and general counsels of Fortune 500 companies, politicians, and all the rest.\n\nSo what\u2019s the purpose of a law school education? It\u2019s not to come up with abstruse legal theories. It\u2019s to train lawyers to respect and uphold the rule of law, the rules of the game on which our republic is based. More concretely, to have critical thinking skills and see all sides of an argument or legal issue so you can better represent your clients\u2019 interests. Or to create better communication skills, written and oral, parsing difficult texts. Law schools are supposed to train lawyers, and they\u2019ve begun to fail.\n\nDoes ideological conformity in elite law schools affect the ability of students to become effective lawyers? If you think that certain positions are simply outside the Overton window of permissible possible policy views to be expressed, then you\u2019re really not going to be able to be a good lawyer.\n\nYou were born in the Soviet Union. How does that inform your work? I was born in Moscow in the late \u201970s. My parents were Soviet Jews, both engineers. We immigrated to Canada when I was a child, and I grew up around Toronto. The only political thing they taught me was that communism was bad. I sort of took it from there, being devoted to classical liberal ideas and not tolerating fools, gaslighting, and government perversions of various kinds.\n\nWhat was your own law school \u00adeducation like? I graduated in the early 2000s from law school. In my generation and prior, we thought it was all postmodern mumbo jumbo, the idea that there\u2019s no objective truth and all of our institutions are illegitimate and needing to be torn down and rebuilt according to a hierarchy of oppressed or oppressor. We thought that thinking had been relegated to sociology departments in the \u201980s and \u201990s with the damage contained there.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t? Ten years ago or so, the critical legal theorists came back with a vengeance. They were aided with a trend toward \u201csafety-\u00adism\u201d and disruptions from social media and smartphones. Then came DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), a racial identitarian queer theory that in the last decade has skewed things. The older baby boomer liberal professors are now afraid of their younger millennial, more activist colleagues. And there are more nonteaching staff than faculty: We have an educational bureaucracy that is not steeped in academic values. The National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education has thousands of members who want to promulgate this completely different view of America and its institutions.\n\n\n\nThe older baby boomer liberal professors are now afraid of their younger millennial, more activist colleagues.\n\nWe\u2019ve touched on ideological \u00addeviations and bureaucratic failure. What else? The leadership. Deans, presidents, or provosts are generally not woke radicals or social justice warriors. They\u2019re careerist bureaucrats who\u2019ve succeeded in climbing the greasy pole. The associate dean wants to become dean, the dean wants to become provost, the provost wants to become president, etc. And so they follow the path of least resistance. Most of them just behave amorally. They\u2019ll placate the squeaky wheel.\n\nDo you have a real-life example of a school leader placating the critics? Heather Gerken is dean of Yale Law School and wants to be president of an Ivy League institution one day. In response to ideological scandals at the school, she\u2019s made changes: transferred some people who were creating moblike behavior, hired new faculty who advocate for free speech and academic freedom. She hired a junior professor who had clerked for conservative Justice Samuel Alito\u2014doing things to right the ship. These kinds of changes are certainly an improvement.\n\nOther examples? My Manhattan Institute colleague John Sailer got some documents showing that Texas Tech University, a public school, was hiring biologists based on diversity statements. He published a Wall Street Journal op-ed about that. The very next day, the chancellor of the university said, Nope, we\u2019re not going to do that, that\u2019s not appropriate. So, you know, just a bit of exposure can foment discomfort. There need to be what economists call exogenous shocks, asymmetric pressure from donors, alumni, trustees, state legislatures, and the federal Department of Education. There are lots of players that can push these leaders, kicking and screaming at times, to do better.\n\nWhat do you see for America\u2019s future if the current trajectory in legal education isn\u2019t stopped? This is a dangerous trajectory law schools are on because lawyers occupy such important positions in our society. I\u2019m less pessimistic than I was when I left Georgetown almost three years ago, but the price of liberty (or even sanity, in this case) is eternal vigilance. And so even if we have passed peak woke and the pendulum is swinging back in higher ed? The jury\u2019s still out, so it\u2019s going to take some sustained effort."

            "full_content": "A British jury convicted United Nations Judge Lydia Mugambe on Thursday of forcing a Ugandan woman into domestic servitude after luring her to the U.K. under false pretenses.\n\nMugambe, who also serves as a high court judge in Uganda, brought the victim to Britain under the guise of securing her a job in a diplomatic household \u2014 only to make her work as an unpaid maid and nanny. She confiscated the victim\u2019s passport and visa, leaving her trapped until she was able to contact a friend, who alerted authorities, according to a Thames Valley Police statement. (RELATED: Dem Senator Wants To Restore Funding To UN Agency That Employed Literal Terrorists)\n\n\u201cLydia Mugambe used her position to exploit a vulnerable young woman, controlling her freedom and making her work without payment,\u201d Eran Clutliffe, an attorney for the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s Special Crime Division, said.\n\nThe 49-year-old judge, who was studying for a doctorate at the University of Oxford at the time, according to her profile on the U.N.\u2019s website, was found guilty on four charges, including forced labor, an immigration offense and conspiracy to intimidate a witness. Mugambe is also listed on Columbia University\u2019s website as a fellow in their human rights program. Prosecutors argued she \u201cexploited and abused\u201d the victim\u2019s lack of knowledge about her rights to keep her in a state of servitude.\n\nMugambe leveraged her connections within the Ugandan High Commission in London to secure a visa for the victim, presenting it as an official employment opportunity, according to court testimony. Instead of placing the woman in a diplomatic household, however, Mugambe brought her to her private residence and forced her to work without pay.\n\nThe case shocked observers, with audible gasps heard in the courtroom as the verdicts were delivered at Oxford Crown Court, according to the Associated Press. Mugambe reportedly appeared distressed and unwell following the decision, prompting the judge to clear the courtroom.\n\nMugambe, who was appointed to a U.N. international court in May 2023, denied all charges. She is scheduled for sentencing May 2.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

            "full_content": "Two Harvard medical school professors claim in a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration that their research was pulled from a public government website because it referred to the LGBTQ community.\n\nGordon Schiff and Celeste Royce said removing their work from the website, which focuses on patient safety, violates their First Amendment right to free speech. They claimed the administration unlawfully and dangerously suppressed their information on how to improve patient diagnoses, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S District Court in Boston.\n\nEach year, about 795,000 Americans die or are permanently disabled due to misdiagnosis, according to the suit filed on behalf of Schiff and Royce by the the American Civil Liberties Union and the Yale Law School Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic.\n\n\u201cAllowing the government to censor research regarding patient safety for political reasons will almost assuredly increase that number,\u201d the suit read.\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which falls under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, removed the private doctors\u2019 peer-reviewed articles solely because they contained terms such as \u201cLGBTQ\u201d and \u201ctransgender,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe lawsuit names the U.S. Officer of Personnel Management, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit said the articles were removed because it was perceived that they violated an executive order on gender ideology signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20.\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment Thursday.\n\nThe site, Patient Safety Network, emailed Schiff and his co-authors on Jan. 31 to inform them an article on suicide risk that included the words \"LGBTQ\" and \"transgender\" was being removed, the lawsuit said.\n\nAnother article on the medical condition endometriosis was removed because it mentioned the word transgender, it said.\n\nRachel Davidson, an attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts, said removing the articles and censoring medical research is a serious constitutional violation.\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of the First Amendment that the government cannot restrict speech just because it disagrees with the viewpoint of that speech,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think that is especially important in areas of scientific inquiry and debate and research.\u201d\n\nSchiff and Royce could not be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nBoth say in the lawsuit that they refuse to censor their medical conclusions, and they brought the lawsuit to \u201cdefend the integrity of medical research and the safety of patients from the government\u2019s dangerous, arbitrary, and unconstitutional censorship.\u201d\n\nSchiff, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, is a founding member of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine and the American Public Health Association\u2019s Quality Improvement Committee.\n\nRoyce is an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology. One of her areas of study is the role of clinical reasoning in improving patient safety, according to the lawsuit."

The letter was unsigned.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk is a White House adviser and has taken an outsized role in the administration. His proximity to Trump makes the letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer all the more curious.\n\nThe letter comes as Trump has levied tariffs on imports from the two biggest U.S. trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Additionally, the president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, regardless of their origin. Automakers are expected to be hit particularly hard, so much so that someone at Tesla felt compelled to write to the Trump administration.\n\nThe Times reported:\n\nIn an unsigned letter addressed to US trade representative Jamieson Greer, Tesla said that it \u201csupports\u201d fair trade but warned that US exporters were \u201cexposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions\u201d. \u201cFor example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries,\u201d the Austin, Texas-based company wrote in the letter dated March 11. Tesla\u2019s letter follows two weeks of erratic trade policy announcements that have rattled businesses and financial markets as investors worry about the growing risks of the world\u2019s largest economy being plunged into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a polite way to say that the bipolar tariff regime is screwing over Tesla,\u201d one person familiar with the transmission of the letter said. \u201cIt is unsigned because nobody at the company wants to be fired for sending it.\u201d\n\nTesla did not respond to the Times\u2018 request for comment.\n\nThe company told Greer that certain auto \u201cparts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the U.S.\u201d and urged him to consider \u201cdomestic supply chain limitations to ensure that U.S. manufacturers are not unduly burdened by trade actions.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump tried to give Tesla a public relations boost by hosting a promotion at the White House, where he praised the company\u2019s electric vehicles, calling them \u201cas good as it gets.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s share price has plummeted since reaching an all-time high in December after Trump\u2019s victory, as it has lost more than half its value since then."

            "full_content": "Lizzo was feeling bad as hell.\n\nThe 36-year-old singer is opening up about reaching a real low point after she was sued by former backup dancers and an ex-stylist in 2023 for alleged sexual harassment and claims that she created a toxic workplace environment.\n\nLizzo has denied all allegations, but she is still facing ongoing lawsuits. (However, she was dismissed from the stylist\u2019s lawsuit, although her production company, Big Grrrl Big Touring Inc., remains a defendant.)\n\n4 I was so deeply afraid of people that I didn\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d said Lizzo during an intimate show at LA\u2019s Wiltern Theatre. Billboard via Getty Images\n\n\u201cAbout a year and a half ago \u2014 it\u2019s so hard for me to talk about \u2014 I was in such a dark, deep depression,\u201d she told the crowd during an intimate show at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI was so heartbroken by the world and so deeply hurt that I didn\u2019t want to live anymore, and I was so deeply afraid of people that I didn\u2019t want to be seen. Eventually I got over that fear.\u201d\n\nThe four-time Grammy winner got a mental health boost while attending a concert around that time.\n\n\u201cAs I was walking through the crowd to get to my spot, something miraculous happened. Somebody, who I didn\u2019t know, looked at me and said, \u2018Lizzo, I love you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they reached out, and I reached back, and we hugged, and it felt so damn good.\u201d\n\nOthers at the concert joined in to show their support for the \u201cAbout Damn Time\u201d singer, which was \u201cf\u2014king life-saving,\u201d she said of the moment that inspired the title of her upcoming album, \u201cLove in Real Life.\u201d\n\n4 \u201cIf you\u2019re depressed, reach out to someone who will listen,\u201d said Lizzo during her intimate show in Los Angeles. Billboard via Getty Images\n\n4 Lizzo previewed her upcoming album \u201cLove in Real Life\u201d at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Billboard via Getty Images\n\n\u201cAnd after that experience I was like, \u2018Damn, you can\u2019t get this s\u2014y on the internet, bro. This is the kind of love you can only get in real life.\u2019 And I don\u2019t share that story to gain some sort of sympathy. We\u2019re beyond that, bitch. Look at me!\u201d\n\nLizzo told the story to help others who are dealing with \u201cdepression, or darkness, or felt so betrayed by someone they trusted or was lied on and hated on for those lies.\u201d\n\n4 Lizzo attended the Vanity Fair Oscar party on March 2. FilmMagic\n\nThe slimmed-down star encouraged others to \u201creach out\u201d if they\u2019re struggling too.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re depressed, reach out to someone who will listen,\u201d said Lizzo. \u201cIf you\u2019re mad about the government, reach out to someone else who\u2019s mad about the government and f\u2014king organize.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you hate the way you look, reach out to someone who loves you and who will tell you, \u2018You are f\u2014king beautiful as you are right now, no matter how your body changes,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause you may not believe, but you are special.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988."

            "full_content": "There's another Silent Hill game on the way, and if the reveal trailer for \"Silent Hill f\" (yes, it's lower-case) is any indication, this just might have the horror goods players are hoping for.\n\nIn the reveal trailer, which you can find on YouTube, a girl named Hinako Shimizu has her life suddenly thrown into chaos when a dense fog descends on her hometown of Ebisugaoka, twisting the environment and unleashing nightmarish monsters.\n\nIt's not clear exactly what the gameplay will be like, though given how Hinako is seen wielding a pipe, some form of against the creatures coming after seems extremely liked.\n\nSilent Hill f is set in 1960s Japan, with the store page indicating the game will be confronting some uncomfortable themes.\n\n\n\n\"These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved. If you feel uncomfortable at any point while playing, please take a break from playing or speak to someone you trust,\" reads the store page description.\n\nSilent Hill f is being developed by NeoBards, a team that's previously done support work on a number of Capcom and Square Enix titles, including Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n\nNeoBards is being aided by a support team at Konami, while series mainstay Akira Yamaoka is returning to help score the game's soundtrack.\n\nHinako Shimizu is the protagonist of Silent Hill f. (Image credit: Konami)\n\nInterestingly, the Xbox store page reveals a bit more, with the page description showing a PC version alongside Xbox Series X|S, as well as Xbox Cloud Saves support.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThat's a pretty solid pointer toward Xbox Play Anywhere support, meaning players can buy a copy and then play the game on Xbox consoles or through the Xbox PC app at no extra cost.\n\nXbox Play Anywhere is a staple of first-party games and often appears in third-party titles that come to Xbox Game Pass, but support elsewhere has been limited, making this nice to see.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Microsoft vice president of next generation Jason Ronald shared an update on the program, revealing that over 1,000 games now support Xbox Play Anywhere.\n\nSilent Hill back in force\n\nSilent Hill is such an iconic series that has done incalculable service to survival-horror as a genre, so I'm definitely excited to see how Silent Hill f turns out. The reveal trailer has things off to a great start, but hopefully we'll be learning more soon.\n\nI'm not expecting this game to launch in 2025 (it really seems like Konami would be saying that already if that were the case) but maybe 2026 isn't out of the question?\n\nWith the Silent Hill 2 remake launching last year to critical acclaim and commercial success while Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is slated to arrive in August, Konami has a stronger slate of games on its plate than it's had in a long time.\n\nSilent Hill f is coming to Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC (via Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the Xbox PC app), and PlayStation 5."

This will replace the now active third-party fact-checking feature on all of its apps. However, like X, users would first have to sign up to be contributors for this feature. These contributors will be allowed to write and rate notes on content across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.\n\n\"Around 200,000 potential contributors in the US have signed up so far across all three apps, and the waitlist remains open for those who wish to take part in the program,\" Meta explained in a press release.\n\nThe presser added that it will initially use X's open-source algorithm and build on it for Meta's platforms.\n\n(Image credit: Meta)\n\nTo be a contributor, users need to be over 18, have an account that\u2019s more than 6 months old, and be in good standing, meaning not flagged for misuse. Other than that, the profile should be two-factor authenticated as well.\n\nAs users start contributing, Meta says the author's names will remain anonymous to protect their privacy and show up as \"People added a community note\" under the said image/topic. Contributors will be able to submit notes on anything, including stuff posted by Meta, politicians, and other public figures. However, they won't be able to add to advertisements.\n\n(Image credit: Meta)\n\nAs for how it works, once contributors add their viewpoints on a certain topic limited to 500 characters, it won't be published on a post \"unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them.\"\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won\u2019t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context,\" the presser explained. Additionally, when community notes are added to a specific image/topic, it won't flag the post the way that fact-checking would.\n\nMeta adds that these notes will not showcase the opinions of the company but will attempt to create a more unbiased platform for people to voice their opinions.\n\n(Image credit: Meta)\n\nLastly, Community Notes will be showcased in six different languages commonly used in the United States. This includes English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Portuguese, and other languages will be expanded over time. That said, this feature will first be tested out in the U.S. starting Mar. 18 and then be rolled out to a wider audience."

            "full_content": "Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector, a critical driver of economic growth and employment, is grappling with an escalating crisis: exorbitant electricity prices, according to reports.\n\nPakistan\u2019s industrial sector is struggling under the burden of soaring electricity prices, which are significantly higher than those in competing economies.\n\nIn 2024, energy-intensive industries in the country are paying 13.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh)\u2014nearly twice the rates manufacturers in China, India, and the U.S. pay, where electricity costs range between 6.3 and 7.7 cents per kWh, according to an editorial published in The Express Tribune.\n\nEven within the European Union, known for its traditionally high energy costs, industrial electricity rates remain 18 percent lower than in Pakistan.\n\nThis stark price disparity is severely undermining Pakistan\u2019s export competitiveness at a time when global markets are already challenging.\n\nWith electricity comprising a major portion of production expenses, local manufacturers struggle to keep their pricing competitive, allowing cheaper imports from energy-efficient economies to dominate.\n\nBeyond stifling export growth, the exorbitant electricity costs also deter foreign investors, who prefer to set up industries in countries with lower operational expenses and higher profit margins.\n\nThe issue is further aggravated by inefficiencies in the energy sector, mounting circular debt, and dependence on costly imported fuels.\n\nDespite successive tariff hikes, the government has yet to implement structural reforms needed to bring down costs. At the same time, businesses continue to endure an unreliable power supply, further diminishing productivity and economic growth.\n\nSkyrocketing energy costs have placed an unbearable burden on industries, forcing many businesses to curtail operations, shut down, or relocate.\n\nAs the sector struggles to remain competitive in global and regional markets, the crisis threatens the country\u2019s economic stability, job market, and overall development.\n\nOver the past few years, electricity tariffs in Pakistan have surged to unprecedented levels. Some of the factors contributing to this crisis are \u2014\n\nPakistan\u2019s energy mix relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, including LNG, coal, and furnace oil, which are subject to international price fluctuations. The country has been slow to shift towards cheaper renewable energy sources, exacerbating the cost burden.\n\nThe South Asian nation\u2019s power sector suffers from a massive circular debt problem, estimated to be over PKR 2.5 trillion. This debt arises due to inefficiencies in power distribution, poor bill recovery, and excessive transmission losses, forcing the government to increase tariffs to compensate for revenue shortfalls.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has mandated reforms in Pakistan\u2019s power sector, requiring the government to remove energy subsidies and implement cost-reflective pricing. While these measures aim to address financial sustainability, they have significantly increased electricity costs for industries.\n\nPakistan faces one of the highest transmission and distribution (T&D) losses in the region. Ageing infrastructure, power theft, and mismanagement contribute to inefficiencies that further inflate electricity costs.\n\nThe depreciation of the Pakistani rupee against the U.S. dollar has further driven up the cost of importing fuel for power generation, leading to higher electricity tariffs.\n\nThe high cost of electricity has profound consequences for Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector.\n\nIndustries in Pakistan, particularly textile, steel, and manufacturing units, are struggling to compete with regional rivals in China, Bangladesh, and India, where electricity costs are significantly lower.\n\nHigher production costs mean that Pakistani products are more expensive in export markets, reducing demand and shrinking foreign exchange earnings.\n\nMany small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector, are shutting down due to unsustainable electricity costs.\n\nLarger industries are also downsizing operations, leading to mass layoffs. The textile sector, which accounts for the majority of Pakistan\u2019s exports, has been particularly hard-hit, with numerous factories closing down or shifting production to more energy-efficient locations.\n\nHigh energy costs deter foreign investors from setting up industries in Pakistan.\n\nMultinational corporations prefer investing in countries with stable and affordable electricity rates.\n\nThe unpredictability of energy prices in Pakistan makes it an unattractive destination for industrial investment.\n\nAs industries struggle with electricity costs, they pass the burden onto consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services.\n\nThis fuels inflation, making essential commodities more expensive and eroding the purchasing power of ordinary citizens.\n\nThe Pakistani government has introduced several measures to tackle the power crisis, but these efforts have fallen short in providing long-term relief to industries.\n\nPakistan\u2019s industrial sector is at a critical juncture, struggling to survive under the burden of exorbitant electricity prices.\n\nWithout urgent reforms and policy interventions, the country risks economic stagnation, rising unemployment, and declining industrial output.\n\n(Source: Agencies)"

And that\u2019s where we went back to really a pure populist movement to go with the grassroots, the precinct strategy, and kind of rebuild ourselves from there.\u201d\n\nNewsom responded, \u201cI appreciate the notion of agency that we\u2019re not bystanders in the world. It\u2019s decisions, not conditions, that determine our fate and future.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the governor\u2019s new podcast side hustle made headlines. The previous episode featured a long conversation with Charlie Kirk where Newsom said he sees Kirk \u201cflooding the zone\u201d with a steady diet of clips, campus visits and other moves to win over voters, and feels that is the winning formula.\n\n\u201cAnd then I\u2019m thinking about we\u2019re going to stand back and watch you run circles around us for six months, the next two or three years, waiting for the moment to finally strike?\u201d he added. \u201cIt struck me as not necessarily the best advice.\u201d\n\nWatch Bash\u2019s full clip above."

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing for the the U.S. Supreme Court to allow some restrictions on birthright citizenship even as legal battles continue over President Donald Trump's orders to end what has long been seen as a constitutional promise.\n\nOn Thursday, the administration filed emergency applications with the high court that would allow citizenship to be denied to people born in the U.S. after Feb. 19 if their parents are in the country illegally.\n\nDistrict judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington have blocked the order, which Trump signed shortly after taking office in January. It is currently blocked nationwide.\n\nBirthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\nTrump and his supporters have argued that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen, which he called \u201ca priceless and profound gift\u201d in his executive order.\n\nLegal scholars, though, have said its the 14th Amendment's constitutional protections would make it it extremely difficult to overturn.\n\nHere is a look at birthright citizenship, what Trump has said about it and the prospects for ending it:\n\nTrump has said for years that he wants to end birthright citizenship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. We are the only country in the world that does this with the birthright, as you know, and it\u2019s just absolutely ridiculous,\u201d he said in January. Dozens of countries, mostly in the Americas, have birthright citizenship.\n\nOpponents say the practice encourages people to come to the U.S. illegally so their children can have citizenship. Others argue that ending birthright citizenship would profoundly damage the country.\n\nIts elimination \u201ccould eventually place every single person in America in the precarious position of having to prove American citizenship,\u201d Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the pro-immigration Cato Institute, wrote after Trump's order.\n\nIn 2019, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 5.5 million children under age 18 lived with at least one parent in the country illegally in 2019, representing 7% of the U.S. child population. The vast majority of those children were U.S. citizens.\n\nCongress ratified the 14th Amendment in July 1868, soon after the Civil War.\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,\u201d the amendment says.\n\nBut it didn't always apply to everyone. It wasn't until 1924, for example, that Congress granted citizenship to all Native Americans born in the U.S.\n\nSupporters of immigration restrictions, including Trump, have argued the words \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d allow the U.S. to deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally.\n\nThe emergency appeal does not focus directly on whether the presidential order is legally valid. Instead, it is aimed at the broad reach of orders issued by federal judges.\n\nThe Justice Department argues individual judges lack the power to make their rulings go into affect nationwide. Five of the Supreme Court's conservative justices have raised concerns in the past about these nationwide injunctions. The high court, though, has never ruled on the matter."

(Tigard Police Department via AP)\n\nTIGARD, Ore. -- Gunshots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Oregon on Thursday for the second time in a week in ongoing vandalism and protests around the country since CEO Elon Musk became a key figure in the Trump administration.\n\nAround 4:15 a.m., more than a dozen shots were fired around the electric vehicle dealership in the Portland suburb of Tigard, according to the Tigard Police Department. The shooting caused extensive damage to cars and showroom windows, police said. No one was hurt.\n\nA similar shooting happened on March 6 at the same location. Police said they continue to work with federal partners at the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives to thoroughly investigate. An ATF explosive detection dog has been used after both shootings to help search for shell casings, police said.\n\nTesla has been a target for demonstrations and vandalism in the U.S. and elsewhere this year. People have protested Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has been moving to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nPolice said over the weekend that six Tesla Cybertrucks at a dealership in the Seattle suburb of Lynnwood were spray painted with swastikas and profanity directed at Musk, KING-TV reported.\n\nOn Sunday, four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a blaze in Seattle, but investigators have not said if the fire, or fires, were intentionally set. On Tuesday, the Seattle Police Department said it was working with federal partners to investigate the incident.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday that he was buying a new Tesla to show his support for Musk as the billionaire's company struggles with sagging sales and declining stock prices."

Gavin Newsom, but he faired better in the poll than his fellow Democrat Bass.\n\n7 A fire victim in Altadena reacts to the destruction of her home.

In the month after the fires, the state attorney general\u2019s office sent more than 700 warning letters to landlords and hotels suspected of price gouging.\n\n"

            "full_content": "The Tariff Selloff Narrative Doesn\u2019t Make Sense\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an explanation of why the stock market has been stumbling, the financial press has a ready-made answer: blame Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nThe claim is familiar, convenient, and utterly predictable. It also happens to be wrong. Markets don\u2019t move in neat response to political narratives, and the idea that investors suddenly woke up to the perils of trade policy months after Trump was elected is as laughable as it is lazy.\n\nIf the press had a better explanation, they\u2019d use it\u2014so long as it made President Trump look bad. Instead, they\u2019re dusting off the same script they used in 2018. But the numbers\u2014and history\u2014tell a very different story.\n\nThe Real Culprit: The End of the Government Spending Boom\n\nOver the last few weeks, technology stocks and other speculative assets cratered, while safe assets such as Berkshire Hathaway, Treasury bonds, and dividend-paying stocks have held steady or even risen. If tariffs were driving the selloff, we would see broad market declines, not a selective retreat from high-risk, high-valuation stocks. This isn\u2019t about tariffs\u2014it\u2019s about investors finally reckoning with the excesses of the past few years.\n\nJohn Rekenthaler, Vice President for Research at Morningstar, put it plainly: speculators have ruled the market for years, chasing anything that looked exciting. But when confidence shakes, they stampede out the exits\u2014just like we\u2019re seeing now.\n\nThe same thing happened in early 2022 when the Fed started pulling back the easy money. This time, the trigger is different, but the dynamic is the same.\n\nRekenthaler also made another key point: the market\u2019s timing doesn\u2019t support the tariff panic theory. Tariffs weren\u2019t some surprise revelation. Trump had been talking about them for months, yet the market surged from August through December. If tariffs were such a clear-cut market killer, investors wouldn\u2019t have waited until late February to react. That\u2019s simply not how markets behave. The selloff happened when speculation hit a breaking point\u2014not because of tariffs.\n\nThe Sell-Off Is a Rotation, Not a Sign of Economic Doom\n\nJared Woodard argues in the latest Bank of America RIC Report that this selloff is a rotation, not an economic crisis. The report highlights a major shift in market fundamentals. Tech stocks are plummeting, while sectors such as defense, value stocks, and emerging market debt are gaining. Government-driven growth is fading as public sector hiring slows and spending levels shift. The market is adjusting to a world where speculation and following the government-spending goodie trail is no longer being rewarded.\n\nFiscal and monetary policy are in transition, forcing investors to reassess risk. High-budget deficits and heavy government spending have propped up speculative assets in recent years, but that cycle is ending. The RIC report underscores a fundamental truth: this selloff is the result of markets recalibrating after an era of over-investment in high-risk, high-momentum stocks. Investors are pulling back not because they fear tariffs, but because they are repositioning in anticipation of a new market environment.\n\nDespite what the financial media wants you to believe, there is no academic support for the idea that tariffs drive broad market selloffs. History tells us the opposite. The Trump tariffs of 2018 and 2019 didn\u2019t tank the market\u2014it kept rising. Even Biden keeping those tariffs in place didn\u2019t stop the rally. Markets only fell when speculative excess and Fed tightening caught up with them.\n\nThe reality is that tariffs are a long-term adjustment tool, not a short-term market killer. The argument that tariffs are responsible for this downturn is nothing more than a convenient excuse for investors who don\u2019t want to admit that they bet too much on speculative assets.\n\nThe Financial Media\u2019s \u2018Liar\u2019s Poker\u2019 Routine\n\nIn Michael Lewis\u2019 famous Wall Street tome Liar\u2019s Poker, traders are depicted as inventing plausible-sounding but entirely imagined explanations for market moves to satisfy media demand for a simple narrative. When no one knew why the dollar was falling, they\u2019d just blame \u201cArab selling\u201d because it was a story that couldn\u2019t be refuted. No one had a clue what the Arabs were doing or why, so it was a full-proof answer.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening now. The financial press needs a tidy explanation for why markets are falling, so they scream \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs!\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be true. It just has to sound good enough to keep the anti-Trump narrative going.\n\nThis selloff isn\u2019t a referendum on tariffs or Trump\u2019s policies. It\u2019s a market recalibrating after years of massive overspending by government and speculative excess. Investors are running to safety. And Wall Street is looking for a scapegoat. Don\u2019t buy the spin. This isn\u2019t about Trump\u2019s tariffs. It\u2019s about a market waking up to economic reality, and that reality isn\u2019t as bad as the fearmongers want you to believe."

Kathy Hochul\u2019s pending phone ban.\n\n\u201cWe also have major expenses looming on the horizon, most significantly compliance with the class size mandate,\u201d she pointedly told councilmembers during a budget hearing.\n\n\u201cThis funding and headcount are not currently in the preliminary budget.\u201d\n\nThe city will need to hire 4,000 more educators to deal with the new United Federation of Teachers-backed requirement that classroom sizes max out at 20 students for early childhood grades and up to 25 for high school, the chancellor said.\n\nThe gobsmacking, arguably vague cash plea comes as New York City schools \u2014 the largest district in the nation \u2014 faces years of declining enrollment, middling test scores and chronic absenteeism, despite raking in ever-increasing mountains of dough.\n\n\u201cPeople need to stop pretending that the NYC Department of Education is about serving the kids,\u201d said Ken Girardin, research director of the Empire Center for Public Policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about job creation for adults. Accept that and everything else makes sense.\u201d\n\nThe proposed education budget for the 2026 fiscal year is already an enormous slice \u2014 36% \u2014 of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 $114.5 billion total spending plan, even without the additional cash.\n\nIf approved by the Council, the school budget would increase by nearly $820 million compared to this fiscal year\u2019s adopted budget, education officials said.\n\nSpending per-student is already at a whopping $32,284, even as enrollment has dipped 12% since the 2018-19 school year, according to an Empire Center report.\n\n\u201cEnrollment in the city public school system has declined dramatically, but there has not been an adjustment in the budget,\u201d said Danyela Souza Egorov, senior policy fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank who authored a recent report that found a whopping 35% of city students are chronically absent.\n\n5 School officials revealed Thursday that the Department of Education\u2019s (DOE) gigantic $41.2 budget plan for next year that will take up around a third of the entire city\u2019s budget still isn\u2019t enough money. Gabriella Bass\n\n\u201cThe question that policy makers should ask is how do we improve learning outcomes for New York City school children, rather than asking for more money.\u201d\n\nThe city is simply paying more and educating fewer kids, said Girardin, noting enrollment used to stand at 1.1 million kids.\n\nNow, the school system has roughly 900,000 students, city schools data shows.\n\nGirardin argued the class size law \u2014 signed by Hochul in 2022 and only affecting New York City \u2014 will only make things worse.\n\nThe UFT strongly pushed for the law, contending it would improve conditions in classrooms and help better educate kids.\n\n5 Aviles-Ramos told the City Council the DOE needs Hans Pennink\n\nThe bill caps kindergarten through third grade classes at 20 students, with further limits for fourth through eighth grade at 23 students and high school classes at 25 students.\n\nThe city has to slash classroom sizes by the 2027-28 school year under the law.\n\nAdams and his administration fiercely opposed the mandate, maintaining it\u2019d saddle the city with roughly $500 million a year just for elementary schools \u2014 with no real help from the state.\n\nDOE officials didn\u2019t respond to The Post\u2019s request for estimates of how much exactly they expect to pony up in the coming school year on the class size law.\n\nThey also didn\u2019t respond to a request for the expected cost of Hochul\u2019s proposed cell phone ban, which Aviles-Ramos said required increased funding to make it effective and sustainable.\n\n5 The proposed education budget for the 2026 fiscal year is already an enormous slice \u2014 36% \u2014 of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 $114.5 billion total spending plan, even without the additional cash. EPA\n\nThe governor has also proposed a statewide cell phone ban, a much-need step, but one that requires increased funding to make it an effective and sustainable effort,\u201d Aviles-Ramos said.\n\nBeyond paying for the class size law, the proposed budget calls for $7.7 billion for pension and debt-related funds and $816.6 more in spending than last year\u2019s adopted budget.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all \u2014 the nearly billion-dollar jump doesn\u2019t account for the fact that the DOE is set to go over budget by more than $500 million this fiscal year.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly due to so-called Carter Cases, in which parents can be reimbursed by the city school system if they enroll their child in private schools in cases where public schools can\u2019t meet their kid\u2019s special needs.\n\nEric Nadelstern, a former deputy chancellor in the DOE under Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said educators must demonstrate that spending is tied to student performance, not just keep asking for more money.\n\n5 If the DOE budget plan is approved by the City Council, the schools budget will increase by almost $820 million compared to the current fiscal year\u2019s adopted budget. Michael Nagle\n\nHe said schools whose enrollments plummet should not be rewarded with the same amount of funding.\n\n\u201cSchools that lose students and can\u2019t recruit new students should see budget cuts. Otherwise, you\u2019re rewarding failure,\u201d Nadelstern said, alluding to the \u201chold harmless\u201d provision.\n\nRecent scores showed just 33% of fourth graders were deemed \u201cproficient\u201d in math, and 28% in reading.

No one person is bigger than the PDP.\u201d\n\nHe noted that while the PDP had not fully stabilised, the South-South remained a stronghold with four PDP governors committed to working together.\n\n\u201cThe deputy governor of Delta is here, and I have received messages from the governors of Akwa Ibom and Rivers. We are united, and we will work with the zonal committee to keep our region strong for the PDP,\u201d he assured.\n\nMeanwhile, the leadership tussle over the PDP National Secretary position has escalated to the courts.\n\nOn Thursday, Ude-Okoye told the Federal High Court in Abuja that Senator Anyanwu was no longer a party official following the Appeal Court\u2019s December 2024 ruling.\n\nAnyanwu, who contested the 2023 Imo governorship election under the PDP, had sought to retain his role as National Secretary despite his gubernatorial bid.\n\nHowever, the Appeal Court upheld his removal, affirming Ude-Okoye\u2019s appointment.\n\nDissatisfied, Anyanwu has filed a suit challenging his removal and requesting a stay of execution. The case has now reached the Supreme Court, where a final judgment is pending.\n\nIn response, Ude-Okoye argued that Anyanwu\u2019s continued claim to the position violates the PDP Constitution, which mandates that any party officer seeking an elective office must resign before contesting.\n\nHe cited Article 47(5) of the party\u2019s constitution, which stipulates that such vacancies should be filled by a candidate from the same zone.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission has also weighed in, urging the court to dismiss Anyanwu\u2019s suit.\n\nINEC, in a counter-affidavit, argued that all parties should await the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict before making further claims.\n\nINEC\u2019s counsel, Ahmed Mohammed, noted that the commission adheres to strict protocols requiring official party correspondence to be signed by both the National Chairman and National Secretary.\n\n\u201cThe 1st defendant did not intend to join issues with the plaintiff, pending the determination of the appeal at the Supreme Court,\u201d INEC stated.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo has adjourned the matter to March 25, when both preliminary objections and the substantive suit will be heard."

            "full_content": "The Federal Government, through the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, has disclosed ongoing efforts to address the high cost of air tickets for both domestic and international travel while also announcing enhancements in airport safety and security.\n\nKeyamo disclosed this in his remarks at the Ministerial Press Briefing on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, he outlined key factors contributing to exorbitant fares, including limited access to affordable aircraft leasing, trapped funds of foreign airlines, and high airport taxes.\n\nKeyamo noted that Nigerian airlines struggle to lease aircraft at competitive rates, forcing them to opt for costly leasing or the outright purchase of aircraft, which ultimately affects ticket prices.\n\n\u201cWe have domestic tickets, and we have international tickets. I talked about domestic tickets and the fact that we don\u2019t have access to lease aircraft at a very cheap cost.\n\nWe will only go for the very expensive option of leasing aircraft or buying aircraft. We are addressing that. We will see the results very soon with the Cape Town Convention and the Dublin Conference we are going to. The deals are coming in, so we will see the results then,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said efforts were also ongoing between the government and foreign airlines to address the cost of airfares.\n\nKeyamo also exposed how foreign airlines had deliberately inflated ticket prices for Nigerian travelers due to uncertainties over when they would be able to repatriate their earnings.\n\n\u201cWe called international airlines and asked what they used to do. They said if you want to buy international tickets, you will see business class Z, grade J, different grades, but it\u2019s all the same. One can be N2m cheaper than the other. Those ones, they opened it for countries they knew that once they sold the ticket, they could get their money immediately. But they now opened only the high fare for Nigerian passengers since the last 3-4 years,\u201d he revealed.\n\nAccording to him, airlines set high ticket prices for Nigerian passengers because they feared currency depreciation would erode the value of their earnings before they could convert them to dollars.\n\n\u201cThey said because they were taking into account inflationary rates of the money that will be trapped, they don\u2019t know where they will get the money back, so they were building on top of it, inflationary rates, that by the time they want to get the money back, the naira may have collapsed. So instead of selling a ticket for N2m or N3m, they will sell it for 7m. Whereas Ghana will sell it for that price. Ghana is cheaper than Nigeria. This was an issue of policy,\u201d he said.\n\nTo reverse the trend, the government is actively engaging with international airlines to ensure that fares for Nigerian passengers reflect the cleared backlog of trapped funds.\n\n\u201cPresident Bola Tinubu, being very smart on this, cleared that first. And so we called them and said, look, it was recently we called them, you have been enjoying this high price because Nigerians were paying. So by the time we cleared this thing, they were still enjoying the high fares. We said, no, you cannot continue to enjoy it. We have cleared the backlog, so you cannot continue to open up the high tickets only to Nigerian passengers,\u201d Keyamo stated.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority is leading discussions with airlines to ensure they adjust their pricing, while also addressing other cost-related issues, including taxation.\n\n\u201cSo that discussion is going on now. NCAA is championing that, and I think they held a parliament with them recently on that, with one or two other factors in terms of high taxation. Our airport, they say, is the highest in Africa, their taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that high government-imposed taxes at Nigerian airports contribute to expensive tickets. However, he clarified that addressing these taxes would require collaboration with the Ministry of Finance.\n\n\u201cNigerian Airspace Management Authority and the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria are looking at them to see what we can do about it. Because it\u2019s not my call. We have to talk to the Minister of Finance to do that. So, don\u2019t look at the Aviation Minister alone. I\u2019m not in charge of revenue. I have no right to say I will reduce revenue. The money is not my money,\u201d he added.\n\nHe further noted that airlines factor these high taxes into ticket prices, passing the costs on to passengers.\n\n\u201cThe taxes imposed in our airports and navigation routes, they say, is one of the highest in Africa. And the airlines come here, they bill that too because they have to pay. And that trickles down to the passengers. So we will tackle that,\u201d Keyamo noted."

This is the moment to use that leverage.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cI think the concerns about the Republicans shutting down the government, because it will be the Republicans that do it, it will hurt them politically, it will be bad policy, and we will get back to using our leverage in an effective fashion.\u201d\n\nJust hours after Merkley\u2019s comments on Thursday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced that he would vote with Republicans to advance a government spending bill, despite opposition from other Democrats.\n\n\u201cI will vote to keep the government open, and not shut it down,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cWhile the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse. For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean CR, it is deeply partisan. It doesn\u2019t address far too many of this country\u2019s needs, but I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.\u201d\n\nWatch above via CNN."

The arrest has been roundly condemned by civil liberty groups, who have called Khalil a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d.\n\nThe leaders of Thursday\u2019s demonstration said they chose Trump Tower to send a message to the president. The high-rise houses both the Trump Organization and Trump\u2019s personal New York residence.\n\n\u201cAs Jews, we are taking over the Trump Tower to register our mass refusal,\u201d Jewish Voice for Peace, which organised the protest, wrote in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe will not stand by as this fascist regime attempts to criminalise Palestinians and all those calling for an end to the Israeli government\u2019s US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people. And we will never stop fighting for a free Palestine.\u201d\n\nAmong the protesters was actress Deborah Winger, who told The Associated Press news agency she was \u201cstanding up for my rights\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m standing up for Mahmoud Khalil, who has been abducted illegally and taken to an undisclosed location,\u201d she added. \u201cDoes that sound like America to you?\u201d\n\nReporting from New York, Al Jazeera\u2019s Kristen Saloomey said there were several \u201cdramatic moments\u201d as police arrested 98 of the protesters while clearing the lobby.\n\n\u201cThe demonstrators basically went in nonchalantly, dressed as normal tourists,\u201d Saloomey said. \u201cThen they took off their jackets, wearing red T-shirts that represented their cause. On behalf of Mahmoud Khalil, they said, \u2018Not in our name\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety-eight of them who were dragged out in handcuffs are being processed and charged with misdemeanour crimes.\u201d\n\nDetention continues\n\nWhile a federal judge has blocked Khalil from being removed from the US, pending a legal challenge, he remains in detention in Louisiana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis lawyers have requested he be moved to New York for the proceedings and to be closer to his wife, who is eight months pregnant.\n\nSpeaking during a court hearing yesterday, Khalil\u2019s lawyer Ramzi Kassem said he was \u201cidentified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights\u201d.\n\nFor its part, the Trump administration has remained defiant in its efforts to expel Khalil.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt has told reporters Khalil was subject to removal under a law that allows for the deportation of green-card holders deemed by the US secretary of state to be \u201cadversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests\u201d of the country.\n\nShe repeated the claim that Khalil supported \u201cterrorists\u201d, without offering any evidence.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has said Khalil\u2019s arrest is the \u201cfirst of many to come\u201d.\n\nIn a separate court proceeding on Thursday, eight Columbia students \u2013 including Khalil \u2013 were named as plaintiffs in a petition seeking to bar the university from complying with an order to share student disciplinary records with the government.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Labor has sought records for students involved in pro-Palestine protests, as part of its attempts to crack down on anti-Semitism on campus.\n\nThe students said the congressional committee\u2019s request violated the First Amendment and their privacy rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a US law that governs how universities handle student information.\n\n\u201cEntities like the university feel pressure to cooperate with the government in its efforts to chill and punish protected speech,\u201d the lawsuit stated."

            "full_content": "In March 2025, social media users claimed (archived) that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had rehired 6,000 employees after they were fired in February as part of the Trump administration's plan to reduce the size of the federal government workforce.\n\nThe claims spread across Facebook (archived), X (archived), Reddit (archived), Threads (archived) and Bluesky (archived). Snopes readers also emailed us about the claim.\n\nThe claims originated from a March 11, 2025, statement from the USDA. The statement said the USDA would \"place all terminated probationary employees in pay status,\" essentially putting them back on the USDA payroll. Probationary employees at USDA agencies faced mass firings in February; an investigation found that 5,900 people were fired.\n\nThe March 11 statement followed a March 5 order by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that adjudicates federal employment cases, to \"stay,\" or halt, the firing of probationary employees at the USDA for 45 days. A fired USDA employee brought a case to the MSPB suspecting prohibited personnel practices, resulting in the stay.\n\nThe MSPB's order pertained only to the USDA. However, on March 13, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California ordered several federal departments, including the USDA, to reinstate employees fired following Office of Personnel Management orders, according to several reputable news sources.\n\nAlsup's order was a significant rejection of the stated \"workforce optimization\" plan enacted by U.S. President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency. However, the OPM could appeal the order.\n\nAlso on March 13, federal agencies faced a deadline to submit \"Agency Reorganization Plans\" \u2014 plans to carry out the large-scale \"reductions in force\" laid out in a Feb. 11 executive order. These plans were not publicly available at the time of this writing, and it was unclear how they would affect USDA probationary employees.\n\nCourt found OPM issued unlawful guidance\n\nAccording to reporting by NBC, Alsup wrote in his March 13 order that the departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Energy, Interior, Agriculture and Treasury must: \"offer reinstatement to any and all probationary employees terminated on or about February 13.\" An earlier order in the case and an investigation by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel found that the OPM ordered mass firings of probationary employees on or around Feb. 13.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel is a federal agency that exists to protect federal workers from prohibited personnel practices, or practices that violate the merit system. The agency is carrying out its own investigation into the firing of probationary employees at USDA \u2014 more on this below.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case against the Office of Personnel Management alleged that the OPM unlawfully directed agencies to fire probationary employees. This direction included a memo dated Jan. 20, the day of Trump's inauguration, titled \"Guidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details.\"\n\nThe memo asked agencies to \"identify all employees on probationary periods, who have served less than a year in a competitive service appointment, or who have served less than two years in an excepted service appointment\" and \"promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"\n\nThe OPM argued that its memo did not amount to orders. A revised edition of the Jan. 20 memo added a section reading:\n\nPlease note that, by this memorandum, OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decisionmaking authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\n\nAlsup's March 13 order essentially agreed with the plaintiffs \u2014 the OPM had overstepped its authority in ordering agencies to fire probationary employees and thus the fired staff should be reinstated.\n\nAlsup order supported by federal employment tribunal\n\nPrior to Alsup's order, the Merit Systems Protection Board had already found fault with the OPM's methods.\n\nOn Feb. 28, the Office of Special Counsel brought the case of \"John Doe,\" a forestry technician who was fired from the USDA while within the probationary period. The OSC investigation found that the USDA carried out firings of approximately 5,900 probationary employees following the OPM's Jan. 20 memo.\n\nThe OSC recommended that the MSPB, a quasi-judicial agency that adjudicates cases from the OSC, order a stay for 45 days for the termination of John Doe, as well as any other probationary employees fired by USDA using the same wording as John Doe's termination letter.\n\nThe MSPB granted the stay on March 5. The order stated that:\n\nprobationary employees whom the agency has terminated since February 13, 2025, pursuant to letters stating, \"The [a]gency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the [a]gency would be in the public interest,\" shall be placed in the positions that they held prior to the probationary terminations.\n\nThe OSC investigation found that this email template was used to fire John Doe and the nearly 6,000 other probationary employees through the use of mass termination letters. According to the OSC request to the MSPB:\n\nUSDA officials testified that the agency created two templates, one for probationary employees in the competitive service and one for probationary employees in the excepted service, which it used to draft the mass termination letters it sent to Complainant and each of the nearly six thousand other probationary employees it has terminated since February 13, 2025.\n\nThe USDA based its mass termination letters on an OPM template seen by the OSC, the investigation found.\n\nThe MSPB stay will elapse on April 18. The OSC investigation into the firings continues."

But it\u2019s never too late to prank a rookie, and that\u2019s exactly what Spurs players did following their win.\n\nIn the 2024 NBA Draft, guard Stephon Castle was selected with the No. 4 overall pick. He tallied eight points and two rebounds in the Spurs\u2018 victory against the Mavericks. (RELATED: NBA Slaps Utah Jazz With $100,000 Fine In League-Wide Crackdown)\n\nWell, even though it was late, he got his official \u201cwelcome to the NBA\u201d moment as he found out all of the wheels were removed from his Toyota Supra. The situation was discovered after he exited the arena and went to the parking garage.\n\nDevin Vassell, a teammate of Castle\u2019s, published the footage on his Instagram Story, which showed Castle heading over to his vehicle to see it sitting on its brake pads right to the pavement.\n\nYou can watch the video here.\n\nNBA Rookie of the Year odds on Polymarket: \ud83c\udfc0Stephon Castle: -200\n\n\ud83c\udfc0Jaylen Wells: +900\n\n\ud83c\udfc0Zacharie Risacher: +1500\n\n\ud83c\udfc0Zach Edey: +3300 The Spurs would be the first team to have back-to-back ROTY winners since the Wolves in 2015 (Wiggins) and 2016 (KAT). pic.twitter.com/mWYTh0CvSu \u2014 Polymarket Sports (@PolymarketSport) March 13, 2025\n\nI can\u2019t lie, I absolutely love how they did this beside a Tesla Cybertruck, just because I\u2019ve been infatuated with those guys for a minute now.

March 13, 2025\n\n- - -\n\nListen, I\u2019d love it if we could create a society that worked perfectly for everyone, but that\u2019s not the reality we live in. In real life, you have to make choices\u2014choices that lead to terrible outcomes for everyone.\n\nI\u2019m not anti-immigration. You think I relish the sight of families torn apart, my neighbors terrified to show up for work or send their kids to school for fear of an ICE raid? If I could wave a magic wand and no one would be deported, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat. But when I see the precipitous downward dive the stock market is taking, I know all that pain and suffering was worth it.\n\nI don\u2019t want trans people to have their dignity assaulted and their very existence called into question. Furthermore, it\u2019s horrible to imply that people of color and women are the incompetent causes of every social problem. But when I go to the grocery store and pay just as much\u2014often more!\u2014than I did before the intensification of these attacks, by golly, I see the purpose of it all.\n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see the elimination of funding that was being used to feed hungry kids. And the disease-curing medical research we used to do! We can all agree: It would be way better if we funded such initiatives. But when I consider how much more quickly the prospect of affording a home during my lifetime has been vanishing, I feel a lot better about the uncured diseases and the dying children.\n\nAnd sure, we\u2019d all like common-sense limits put on corporations that harm the environment. I mean, drinking water that doesn\u2019t poison me and breathing air that doesn\u2019t launch me immediately into a fit of asthmatic coughs are two of my favorite things. But when I log in to my sinking 401(k) and realize I\u2019ll have to delay my retirement an additional decade or so, it reminds me not to bother worrying about a future that might not even happen.\n\nLook, it doesn\u2019t feel great to abandon reasonable diplomacy and instead maximize our national embarrassment with each new short-sighted foreign-policy move. No one wants to cozy up to dictators, blame invaded countries for having been invaded, or launch trade wars on previously mutually beneficial allies. But when I consider that I\u2019ll also be paying higher taxes next year, I stuff my shame deep down into a little box and forget about it. (It\u2019s an empty box that used to hold my money.)\n\nIn an ideal world, citizens would enjoy freedom of speech. I don\u2019t love it when people are fired or imprisoned for expressing opinions contrary to the administration\u2019s. But then I remind myself: Global markets are also in freefall, so it\u2019s, like, okay. Deep breath. This wasn\u2019t all for nothing.\n\nThe last few months have been a moral catastrophe. At least there\u2019s no economic upside."

            "full_content": "Gordon stepped into the role two weeks ago, replacing Kevin Ross, who put his retirement on hold in August 2023 to take the reins at Rangit\u012bkei following the resignation of Peter Beggs.\n\nAt his request, Ross\u2019 appointment was short-term while the council sought a replacement for Beggs.\n\nGordon, a Rangit\u012bkei local with more than 27 years' experience in local government, has been appointed for a three-year term.\n\nShe has worked for the Rangit\u012bkei council since 2014, most recently as deputy chief executive and group manager strategy, community & democracy.\n\nPreviously, she worked at Hawke\u2019s Bay Regional Council and Whanganui District Council.\n\nGordon said some of the bigger priorities in the year ahead for Rangit\u012bkei were the Local Water Done Well reform, October\u2019s local elections and the M\u0101ori ward referendum set to run alongside the elections.\n\nOther key projects were the Marton Water Strategy (which aims to improve the taste and smell of Marton\u2019s water supply), the Taihape town hall and library upgrade, and the Marton to Bulls wastewater centralisation.\n\nThe R\u0101tana P\u0101 wastewater treatment project was another significant project. The council was also rebuilding an Emergency Operations Centre and building new offices and a community hub in Marton.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot going on and a huge workload, but the executive leadership team and I are up for the challenge,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nRangit\u012bkei mayor Andy Watson has described the proposal to form a multi CCO to deliver three-waters services as the most significant change in Rangit\u012bkei council history.\n\nLocal Water Done Well replaces the Three Waters/Affordable Water reforms of the previous government.\n\nThe council opened month-long consultation last week on its preferred model for future delivery of drinking water, wastewater and stormwater.\n\nRangit\u012bkei residents are being asked for their views on who should manage the district\u2019s water services.\n\nIn December, the council agreed on a multi Council-Controlled Organisation (CCO) alongside Whanganui District Council and Ruapehu District Council as its first preference.\n\nResidents have also been presented with other options to consider, including for water services to remain in-house, as they are now, and a multi CCO with as many councils in the Manawat\u016b-Whanganui region as possible.\n\nWatson said while Local Water Done Well gives the council the option to keep water services in-house, he cautioned that Rangit\u012bkei was a large district with a small population and needed to be smart and realistic.\n\n\u201cThe average Rangit\u012bkei ratepayer connected to all three water services contributes about 50% of their rates towards water already, so affordability is a big consideration.\u201d\n\nHe said the long-term sustainability of partnership with other councils could not be underestimated.\n\nWatson said a regional model was forecast to save residents more money, but other councils in the Manawat\u016b-Whanganui Region (outside of Ruapehu and Whanganui) had indicated their preferences for either in-house water services delivery or collaboration with others.\n\nGordon said regardless of what council decides, Local Water Done Well would have a tangible impact on ratepayers.\n\n\u201cWe encourage people to submit their feedback on what is proposed,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nThe consultation period for Local Water Done Well ends on April 2. There will be three community meetings for residents to speak to elected members about the options being presented, as well as an online webinar.\n\nLDR is local body journalism co-funded by RNZ and NZ On Air"

Maharashtra added about 21,000 new companies in this period.Company incorporations indicate investor confidence in the medium-to-long term growth prospects of a state, among other reasons.Strong economic growth in recent years, a vast and expanding consumer base, greater focus on ease of doing business and a large pool of affordable workers, on top of improved law and order situation, have drawn investors to UP, experts and a state government official said.The national capital\u2019s proximity to Noida, a key industrial centre in UP, also helps draw investors there, the official said, given that real estate costs are lower there than in Delhi.Delhi still tops UP by a wide margin in housing \u201cactive\u201d or operational companies, thanks to a large number of incorporations over decades, even as Maharashtra remains the leader on this front as well.As many as 1,50,703 \u201cactive\u201d companies were based out of UP as of January 2025, compared with 2,50,162 in Delhi and 3,46,555 in Maharashtra, according to the latest data.Because of a spike in new company registrations, UP has overtaken West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the past five years to emerge as the third largest state in terms of housing operational companies, behind Maharashtra and Delhi.UP has a population of more than 240 million, according to the 2011 census, making it the largest state in terms of the number of consumers.About 55-56% of the state\u2019s population is in the working age group, which will continue to not just drive consumption but also keep the labour force large, a senior state government official had told ET late last year.The state\u2019s annual economic growth has remained in the range of 7.5-11.4% since 2021-22, beating the national average.The state is focussing on promoting both traditional (mostly agriculture-based industrial ecosystem) and the new and sunrise sectors, the official cited above said.UP has tailored sector-specific policies to meet needs of industries, on top of rolling out financial incentives for businesses, including MSMEs and startups, said Manmeet Kaur, partner at Karanjawala & Co. It has focussed on various sectors, including food processing, handlooms, electronics, tourism, solar energy and pharmaceuticals, she added.The state houses about 14,000 startups. In the past decade, it has wooed investors in consumer electronics, IT and defence production. Uttar Pradesh accounts for 40% of the country\u2019s mobile handset and 55% of mobile component productions, and holds the sixth position in software exports, according to state government data."

They allowed my staff to go in and view like, 10 or 12, they were really bad, but I can say with confidence there are hundreds more, and now with the new Trump administration we\u2019re going to be able to go in there and look at them.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported at the beginning of March, that ActBlue has seen \u201cat least seven senior officials\u201d resign as the donation platform has been \u201cunder investigation by congressional Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn response to the \u201cexodus\u201d of senior officials from ActBlue, \u201ctwo unions representing the group\u2019s workers sent\u201d a letter to \u201cActBlue\u2019s board of directors.\u201d The unions noted that there was an \u201calarming pattern\u201d of people leaving, adding that it was \u201ceroding\u201d their \u201cconfidence in the stability of the organization,\u201d according to the outlet."

            "full_content": "House Democrats have sent letters to 24 federal agencies asking for assurances that Elon Musk's DOGE team is not feeding sensitive government data into \"unapproved and unaccountable\" AI systems.\n\nThe letters [PDF], penned by Gerald Connolly (D-VA), the most senior Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, refer to several national newspaper reports claiming the Trump-blessed cost-trimming job-cutting DOGE unit has whipped out commercial AI tools at federal agencies to analyze projects, staffing, and other data without first carrying out appropriate safety and security reviews. The lawmakers say it would be inappropriate for the personal information of Americans to be sifted through by such systems.\n\nConnolly also expressed concern over reported claims DOGE has proposed cuts at many agencies based on the advice of unvetted AI systems following this analysis work.\n\n\"Federal agencies are bound by multiple statutory requirements in their use of AI software,\" Connolly said, citing Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) standards for cloud computing security as one such requirement.\n\n\"Failing to ensure that AI vendors \u2026 have adequate FedRAMP approval risks violating the Privacy Act of 1974, the Federal Information Security Management Act, and the E-Government Act of 2002,\" Connolly continued.\n\nThe letter also cited independent analyst Cyberintelligence Brief, which claimed supply chain management platform Inventry.ai is ingesting government data. The analyst claims \"multiple US government IP addresses point to its REST API.\" The lawmaker\u2019s letters claim the machine-learning outfit has not been approved through FedRAMP.\n\n\"These actions demonstrate reckless AI misuse, blatant disregard for data privacy, and a severe failure to maintain the cybersecurity of federal systems,\" Connolly wrote.\n\nWe've asked Inventry.ai for comment.\n\nThe letter also states that other federal statutes require all current and planned uses of AI in the federal government to be thoroughly and publicly documented, which the Congressman noted includes all of DOGE's use of AI.\n\nCiting reports on AI use in the US Department of Education (ED), Connolly claimed that DOGE's machine-learning toolkit may have been handed datasets containing agency financial data, information on ED employees, and information on student loan borrowers.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned that \u2026 borrowers' sensitive information is being handled by secretive members of the DOGE team for unclear purposes and with no safeguards to prevent disclosure or improper, unethical use,\" Connolly said.\n\nThe Congressman also cited concerns that Musk may be using government data to train his own AI model, Grok, although this seems to us speculative with no evidence to back it up.\n\nThe DOGE team didn't respond to questions asked for this story.\n\nConnolly has given the 24 federal agencies he contacted until March 26 to respond to questions in his letter. Among the requests he made are an explanation of the legal authority Musk and DOGE have used to justify their access to government data, what data has been collected and analyzed by AI, what privacy protections have been deployed to ensure data isn't exposed, what AI products are being used (including names, algorithm versions, training datasets, questions being asked, records and logs \u2013 the works), plus risk assessment records.\n\n\"Without clear purpose behind the use of AI, guardrails to ensure appropriate handling of data, and adequate oversight and transparency, the application of AI is dangerous and potentially violates federal law,\" Connolly concluded.\n\nThe Register has contacted all 24 federal agencies to ask questions about the letter, their responses, and whether DOGE has deployed AIs in their systems. Most didn't respond, but those that did declined to comment. \u00ae\n\nPS: A small bipartisan group of Congressfolk, including Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), has urged the UK not to, for the purposes of surveillance, force Apple to disable the end-to-end encryption of certain iCloud data stored at rest. This follows earlier political pressure from the group to change the minds of the British government."
