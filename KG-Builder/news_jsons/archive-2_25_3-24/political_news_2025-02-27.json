            "full_content": "Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump has a giant bruise on his hand. People spotted it when Trump met with French president Emmanuel Macron on Monday, and it was still visible during when he hosted British prime minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office on Thursday.\n\nCould this be a sign that Trump is suffering from some serious, life-threatening illness? Sure. Search \u201cTrump hand bruise\u201d on X and you\u2019ll find that armchair physicians have provided a wide range of diagnoses, from \u201cTrump is getting regular IV infusions\u201d to \u201cthe president injured himself in a dementia-related fall.\u201d And did you know that \u201cthe queen had a similar bruise a week before she died?\u201d Suspicious!\n\nOr, not suspicious at all. Trump loved to bully Joe Biden for his decrepitude and pretend that he possessed almost superhuman health and mental acuity, though he is only three years younger. But in reality, President Trump is 78 years old, and sometimes old people get random bruises. As the Mayo Clinic explains, \u201cEasy bruising is common with age \u2026 as people get older, the skin becomes thinner. It also loses some of the protective fatty layer that helps cushion blood vessels from injury.\u201d\n\nIt would be great if the Trump administration provided detailed medical records that could put an end to all the speculation that he is suffering from some mysterious illness. But instead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt just keeps giving the same dubious explanation: It\u2019s one of those hand-shaking injuries you\u2019re always hearing about.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is a man of the people, and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history,\u201d Leavitt said in a somewhat garbled statement to Fox News Digital on Wednesday. She continued, \u201cHis commitment is unwavering, and he proves that every single day.\u201d\n\nLeavitt provided a similar statement to NBC News, adding, \u201cPresident Trump has bruises on his hand because he\u2019s constantly working and shaking hands all day, every day.\u201d\n\nIt appears Leavitt got this line from Trump himself. Here\u2019s what the president-elect said when he showed up to his Time \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d interview with a bruise on his hand three days before Thanksgiving:\n\nSitting under bright lights for a 30-minute photo session ahead of a 65-minute interview, he\u2019s asked to explain the bruising on his right hand. \u201cIt\u2019s from shaking hands with thousands of people,\u201d he says.\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump worked a rope line just before his Time interview, or that he \u201cmeets more Americans\u201d than \u201cany other president in history.\u201d And it\u2019s not like any other world leaders are constantly black and blue from greeting people (save for nonagenarian British monarchs). But sure, he does greet a lot of people, and he has a pretty aggressive handshake:\n\nPresident @realDonaldTrump greets @Keir_Starmer, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to the White House \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 pic.twitter.com/hClm0cRDGQ \u2014 Margo Martin (@MargoMartin47) February 27, 2025\n\nSo what\u2019s really going on with Trump\u2019s giant bruise? You\u2019ll have to decide for yourself. Either it\u2019s proof that he\u2019s the most rugged and hardworking man ever to sit in the Oval Office, or it\u2019s confirmation that he is, as Graydon Carter famously put it, a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d with \u201cskin of gossamer.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we explore how governors (and candidates for governor) around the country are navigating the recent federal layoffs. Plus, how a measles outbreak could prove politically perilous for President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nHow Trump and Musk\u2019s job cuts are reverberating in the states\n\nPresident Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s initiative to dramatically slash the federal workforce is increasingly having a political ripple effect at the state level.\n\nThe job market: For starters, states are putting up \u201cWe\u2019re hiring\u201d signs for fired federal workers, as Adam Edelman reports.\n\nGovernors around the country are attempting to recruit these employees for public and private sector jobs in their states, while providing them with other resources as they exit their current positions and search for their next.\n\nIt\u2019s primarily Democratic governors in blue states who are leading the charge. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul launched the \u201cYou\u2019re Hired\u201d initiative this week, specifically targeting federal workers for state government roles who have lost their jobs as a result of the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s cost-cutting efforts.\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green recently signed an executive order instituting an expedited hiring process for qualified federal employees who are on their way out and seeking employment in state government positions.\n\nOne Republican, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, is getting in on the effort too by advertising 250,000 open private sector positions in the state. Virginia, home to approximately 340,000 federal workers, could be one of the states most affected by DOGE\u2019s job cuts.\n\nThe campaign trail: That brings us to the race to replace Youngkin, one of two high-profile governor\u2019s races this year.\n\nEdelman and Bridget Bowman write that there are signs of how the disruption could shape Virginia\u2019s political climate. They spoke with more than a dozen voters around the state who participated in past NBC News polls and said they were not strongly aligned with either party. All were aware of the ongoing federal layoffs, with some expressing deep concern about the effect on Virginia workers and those receiving federal benefits, though most were not yet tuned into the governor\u2019s race.\n\nSeparately, one man named Matthew, who was not comfortable sharing his last name, told NBC News that he expects the recent layoffs of federal workers to factor into his 2025 vote for governor \u2014 as the self-described political independent attended his first Democratic Party event a week after losing his own federal government job. He was one of more than 300 Virginians who packed the Arlington library auditorium Tuesday night for a county party town hall on the recent federal layoffs.\n\nFormer Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the only Democrat in the race, has described the widespread layoffs as an attack on the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThis frankly isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d Spanberger said in a recent interview with NBC News, later adding, \u201cIt is a chaotic circumstance coming out of this White House and this administration, and it is deeply, deeply damaging to real people and real jobs and real families.\u201d\n\nLt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican front-runner, has praised the DOGE effort while also pointing to the Youngkin administration\u2019s investments in the private sector of the Virginia economy as a reason that fired workers shouldn\u2019t fret.\n\nAnother state-level effect: Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cmove education back to the states\u201d is causing concern among local officials and lawmakers, who say they are unprepared to take on the responsibilities of the Education Department if it\u2019s dismantled. Read more from Edelman and Tyler Kingkade \u2192\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nTrump said that 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico would go into effect Tuesday, alongside yet another 10% layer of duties on China following one that came into effect earlier this month.\n\nTrump also said British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was \u201cworking hard\u201d to convince him not to impose tariffs on the U.K. at a joint news conference.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting, Starmer corrected Trump\u2019s claim that European countries who provided aid to Ukraine \u201cget their money back.\u201d\n\nAsked by a reporter if he stands by his earlier comments calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator,\u201d Trump responded: \u201cDid I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court last night temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to release frozen foreign aid funding by midnight.\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWith RFK Jr. at his side, a measles outbreak could prove \u2018politically perilous\u2019 for Trump\n\nBy Jonathan Allen, Julie Tsirkin and Laura Strickler\n\nSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been scarce at Health and Human Services headquarters and has not visited a number of agencies since he was sworn in to lead the department, according to one department official. Kennedy has not sent all-staff emails to the department\u2019s workforce and has not done anything to address the measles outbreak, the official also noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s still in campaign mode rather than realizing he\u2019s head of a large agency and workforce,\u201d the HHS official said.\n\nKennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said at President Donald Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting Wednesday that his department is tracking an outbreak of measles that has infected more than 100 people and killed an unvaccinated school-age child. But he played down the consequence of the resurgence \u2014 25 years after measles had been thought to be eradicated from the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to tap Kennedy to lead HHS reflected the president\u2019s own tortured relationship with Covid-19, mass immunization and a political base that has become increasingly critical of vaccines following the health and economic damage wrought by the pandemic.\n\nIt also poses a risk to Republican lawmakers in the midterm elections if measles, bird flu, ebola or another disease rips through the country following Kennedy\u2019s appointment and the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s cutbacks in foreign and domestic efforts to combat those viruses, according to some GOP strategists.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re cutting a program, that increases the potential for something to go wrong \u2014 you\u2019re going to own it,\u201d said one GOP strategist who has worked on presidential, Senate and House campaigns. \u201cMaybe the measles thing is the canary in the coal mine. ... This is a small example of a potential problem. This has real-life consequences, and that\u2019s the part that is politically perilous.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMore health news: A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains to be included in next season\u2019s flu shot has been canceled.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83c\udf0e \u2018A fundamental shift\u2019: Western officials say Trump\u2019s moves to embrace Russia and castigate Ukraine have rattled U.S. allies around the world \u2013 and could ultimately benefit China.

            "full_content": "Photo: Barry Williams/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Mayor Eric Adams was indicted by federal prosecutors on charges of bribery and corruption. Months later, the case became the center of both local and federal controversy as the Justice Department moved to dismiss it, prompting allegations of a corrupt deal between Adams and the Trump administration. The mayor has long professed his innocence and has denied claims of any deal-making between himself and the federal government. As we wait for the case\u2019s fate to get settled before a federal judge, here\u2019s a look back at where things stand.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening right now?\n\nOn February 14, the Justice Department officially moved to dismiss Adams\u2019s bribery case. But instead of approving that request, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho, who has presided over the matter, ordered Adams and Justice Department officials into court to discuss their reasoning for it.\n\nAt the hearing, Adams\u2019s attorney Alex Spiro and acting U.S. deputy attorney general Emil Bove rejected the notion of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between the mayor and the federal government, and Adams asserted under oath that he wasn\u2019t promised anything in exchange for agreeing to the motion. Ho then adjourned Adams\u2019s trial for the time being while appointing Paul Clement, a veteran conservative litigator and former U.S. solicitor general, to present arguments against dismissing the case. The judge set a deadline to receive briefs on March 7 with the possibility of an oral argument on March 14. In these situations, judges generally allow cases to be dismissed when both the prosecution and the defense are in agreement. But Ho\u2019s decision to have Clement argue against the motion is a signal that the judge could be open to bucking the trend.\n\nSince then, Adams\u2019s legal team has filed a new motion seeking the dismissal of the charges against him, alleging prosecutorial misconduct in connection to leaked letters from Justice Department officials, which they argue were prejudicial toward Adams. The mayor\u2019s lawyers requested the charges be dropped \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d meaning that they couldn\u2019t be brought against Adams in the future. In response, Ho ordered the Justice Department to file any potential opposition to that motion by March 7.\n\nWhat was the case about again?\n\nIn September, Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced an indictment against Adams, alleging a nearly decade-long scheme in which he knowingly solicited illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel benefits from foreign nationals beginning during his tenure as Brooklyn borough president. In exchange, the filing alleges that Adams facilitated the opening of the new Turkish Consulate in 2021 by pressuring the New York City Fire Department to allow the building to open without clearing a required fire inspection. Prosecutors also claim that Adams often failed to declare the costly international flights and hotels on his required disclosure forms and created fake invoices to hide the perks.\n\nAdams faces five charges: one count of conspiracy to receive campaign contributions from foreign nationals and commit wire fraud and bribery, one count of wire fraud, two counts of soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals, and one count of soliciting and accepting a bribe. His trial was initially slated to begin in April.\n\nSince the indictment was unsealed, Adams has faced a chorus of calls for his resignation. But the mayor has maintained his innocence in the matter, vowing to continue his work at City Hall with no intentions of resigning. \u201cI\u2019m not stepping down. I\u2019m stepping up,\u201d Adams said that month.\n\nWhat did the Justice Department do?\n\nIn February, the newly Trump-ified Justice Department asked Manhattan prosecutors to drop its own pending case against Adams. In a memo, Bove cited the possibility of political influence in the prosecution, specifically naming the now former U.S. Attorney Williams, whom Adams\u2019s lawyers have accused of bias. But he made clear that his request was really about something else: Adams\u2019s abilities to complete his duties as mayor, particularly in addressing immigration and crime, two of President Trump\u2019s top priorities.\n\nBove notably said the department reached this decision \u201cwithout assessing the strength of the evidence\u201d and asked that the case be dropped \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d meaning that the charges could potentially be brought up against Adams in the future.\n\nIn a brief address, Adams reiterated his innocence and signaled his eagerness to put this chapter of his life behind him. \u201cNow, we can put this cruel episode behind us and focus entirely on the future of our city. It\u2019s time to move forward,\u201d Adams said.\n\nWhat was the fallout?\n\nThe effects of the Justice Department\u2019s memo were immediate. Danielle Sassoon, the interim U.S. Attorney whose office undertook the case under her predecessor, rejected Bove\u2019s request and resigned from her post rather than fulfill it. It was later revealed that Sassoon had written a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and expressed her concerns about Bove\u2019s directive, alleging that the agreement discussed by Adams\u2019s attorneys and Justice Department officials amounted to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in exchange for the mayor\u2019s assistance with federal immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cRather than be rewarded, Adams\u2019s advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case,\u201d Sassoon wrote.\n\nSassoon was not alone. At least six Justice Department officials would go on to resign from their positions as Bove sought to reassign the case to the department\u2019s Public Integrity Section and have one of its prosecutors sign off on his directive.\n\nThe tumult extended beyond Washington, D.C., and the federal government. Four of Adams\u2019s deputy mayors \u2014 Maria Torres-Springer, Meera Joshi, Anne Williams-Isom, and Chauncey Parker \u2014 announced their intention to resign following the Justice Department\u2019s move to dismiss Adams\u2019s case.\n\nAdams himself has denied the existence of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between him and the Trump administration. \u201cI want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered \u2014 nor did anyone offer on my behalf \u2014 any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nCould Adams just get a pardon from President Trump?\n\nAs the spotlight on Adams has grown, so has his relationship with the president. The pair shared a dais at the annual Al Smith Memorial Dinner as then-candidate Trump publicly compared their legal plights during his remarks, suggesting Adams was targeted by the Biden administration for his criticism of its handling of the migrant crisis. \u201cWe were persecuted, Eric. I was persecuted, and so were you, Eric,\u201d Trump said in October.\n\nNotably, Adams did not denounce Trump\u2019s overtures toward him and made a pointed effort to meet with him following his win in the 2024 election. As the mayor traveled to Florida to meet with the incoming president and even traveled to attend his inauguration in D.C., speculation grew that Adams sought to be in Trump\u2019s good graces in the hopes of receiving some reprieve with his federal case under a new administration.\n\nFor his part, Adams rebuffed the rumors, saying that it\u2019s part of his job as mayor to work with whoever is in the White House for the betterment of New York City. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be warring with this administration,\u201d the mayor said in December. \u201cI\u2019m going to be working with this administration.\u201d\n\nDespite their friendlier interactions, Trump has yet to utilize his federal pardon power to assist Adams despite invoking it in other situations, such as with the January 6 rioters. With the Justice Department currently intervening on Adams\u2019s behalf, it\u2019s unclear if that will change.\n\nThough Adams\u2019s case is currently on hold, he is still contending with record unpopularity as well as a difficult path to reelection. Recent polls found the incumbent mayor trailing behind some of his Democratic challengers as well as former governor Andrew Cuomo, who has yet to officially join the race."

They may whine about it (Senate Appropriations Committee chair Susan Collins has been complaining that thunderbolts from Musk aren\u2019t the right way to downsize government), but they aren\u2019t willing to buck Trump, who so far seems to be chuckling with pleasure at DOGE\u2019s excesses and even egging Musk on. Meanwhile, Democrats have been excluded categorically from the formal budget process whereby Congress makes long-term fiscal plans, which are designed to be enacted in a huge package (which cannot be filibustered) via a strict party-line vote.\n\nBut Democrats in Congress have one big leverage point: Annual appropriations bills, providing the money to keep the federal government going, have to pass both chambers of Congress and can indeed be filibustered in the Senate, which means 41 of the 47 Democratic senators have the absolute power to say no. Democrats have additional leverage in the House, where the tiny GOP majority, combined with an assortment of Republican fiscal hard-liners who never vote for spending bills, means appropriations bills can\u2019t pass without Democratic votes. As the assault on the federal government and on Congress developed in the first days of the second Trump administration, Democrats appeared to be aware of their leverage and ready to use it, as reflected in a comment by Senator Patty Murray to Punchbowl News earlier this month:\n\nDemocrats are, as always, committed to responsibly funding the government, but it is extremely difficult to reach an agreement on toplines \u2014 much less full-year spending bills \u2014 when the president is illegally blocking vast chunks of approved funding, when he is trying to unilaterally shutter critical agencies, and when an unelected billionaire is empowered to force his way into our government\u2019s central, highly-sensitive payments system [at the Treasury Department]. Democrats and Republicans alike must be able to trust that when a deal gets signed into law, it will be followed.\n\nWith the stopgap spending authority enacted in December due to expire on March 14, now is the time for Democrats to use their leverage to refuse any deal that doesn\u2019t include meaningful curbs on executive usurpation of congressional spending powers. Yes, if executed, this gambit could result in a government shutdown, and Republicans from Trump on down (including those who love all government shutdowns as a way to show how useless government actually is) would seek to blame it on the minority party, despite the GOP\u2019s comprehensive, swaggering control of Washington. But at a time when Democratic constituencies are screaming from every rooftop that they expect their representatives in Washington to do something, refusing to go along with spending bills that the administration will just brush aside seems like a no-brainer.\n\nBut now that the moment of truth is approaching, there are signs some congressional Democrats are inclined to flinch in the face of a GOP-engineered choice to shut it or gut it, as Politico explains:\n\nDemocrats are insisting on the guardrails for Trump and Musk amid deep anger on the left about the president\u2019s unilateral dismantling of the federal government. Following a meeting of top GOP appropriators and party leadership Wednesday morning, Republicans officially rejected the proposal.\n\nDemocratic leaders now face a dilemma: Do they hold firm, refrain from bailing Republicans out and allow an unpopular shutdown? Or do they fold and risk the ire of liberal voters eager to see the party stand their ground against Trump and Musk? So far, they are treading carefully.\n\nIn this case, carefully appears to be a synonym for fearfully. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries sure isn\u2019t drawing any lines in the sand:\n\n[Jeffries] deferred to House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut when asked Wednesday whether Democrats could support a funding deal that doesn\u2019t restrain Trump and Musk.\n\nThis is not exactly a \u201chell no.\u201d More explicitly, Vermont Senator Peter Welch spelled out how Democrats might rationalize a surrender of their leverage, per Punchbowl News:\n\nWhat makes us think if we put more language in there, [Musk is] gonna pay any attention to that? He\u2019s on a lawless rampage, and there\u2019s nothing stopping him,\u201d Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) told us. \u201cThe big question will be if he faces a judicial order and disregards it.\u201d\n\nThis is another way of just throwing up one\u2019s hands and hoping the courts rein in the stampeding chief executive and his turbulent agents. In the meantime, presumably, Democrats can cut their little deals on spending, keep the federal government open, and hope for the best.\n\nIf that\u2019s the way the wind is blowing among congressional Democrats, it may represent an extreme version of the belief that the voters don\u2019t care anything about the Constitution or lawful behavior and can be mobilized only to resist Trump by extremely specific cuts in services or programs they value. But if there\u2019s a silver lining to the vast power Elon Musk has been given by the 47th president, it\u2019s that his indifference and even hostility to the very concept of government having any value is so blatant as to shock even the most diffident or inattentive voter. Here\u2019s how my colleague the longtime Musk watcher John Hermann puts it:\n\n[H]e wants to fire as many people as possible. Punishing workers is a cause and a purpose unto itself, inseparable from a grandiose conflation of personal desires and successes with the fate of humanity. It\u2019s an ecstatic project with an accelerationist character. \u201cI am become meme,\u201d he declares, as his team of private-sector loyalists harasses federal employees with spiteful emails threatening to get rid of them. The message from the largest employer in the country to its disfavored employees could not be much clearer: You are waste, you are fraud. We want to make a spectacle of your misfortune. We cannot wait to fire you.\n\nMusk is already unpopular, and he doesn\u2019t really care if the pain suffered by government workers or the \u201cparasites\u201d who depend on the benefits or services they provide make his project a political handicap for Trump and the GOP. Shining as bright a light on what DOGE is doing as possible is really the only play for the opposition party right now. If that means daring Republicans to trigger a government shutdown that MAGA folk will not be able to stop themselves from conspicuously enjoying, so be it."

Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nFederal employees and those who depend on the benefits and services they provide have been in shock from the moment the new Trump administration unleashed Elon Musk\u2019s shadowy DOGE operatives to conduct guerrilla warfare on the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Chaos and unpredictability have been the hallmarks of the DOGE reign of terror with Musk presuming enormous powers to judge and fire federal employees, deploying the high-speed destructive tactics he perfected in prior corporate takeovers, and with a vast troll army of X followers and MAGA activists hooting and cheering every move.\n\nNow it appears Team Trump is moving to a larger and more systematic \u2014 if no less legally and politically problematic \u2014 effort to decimate those elements of the federal government regarded as unfriendly or irrelevant to the president\u2019s radical plans, as Politico reports:\n\nFederal agencies are being ordered to submit plans by mid-March for laying off employees in \u201clarge-scale reductions in force\u201d \u2014 an escalation in President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal workforce.\n\n\u201cPursuant to the President\u2019s direction, agencies should focus on the maximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated while driving the highest-quality, most efficient delivery of their statutorily-required functions,\u201d according to the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management memo released on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the federal government has seen a host of layoffs since Trump took office, this move takes the president\u2019s agenda a step further. Most recent dismissals focused on probationary employees \u2014 generally federal workers in their jobs for one or two years \u2014 while reductions in force could target a wider range of workers. The memo directs agencies to submit these \u201cagency RIF and reorganization plans\u201d by March 13.\n\nThis latest offensive was set up by a February 11 Trump executive order that mainly drew attention as the first presidential authorization of DOGE\u2019s raids. But it also instructed federal agencies to get ready for large-scale RIFs (\u201creductions in force\u201d) unrelated to the administration\u2019s initial policies, taking a hammer to programs and personnel engaged on such prohibited topics as DEI and climate change. The new push is aimed simply at generating big numbers of firings and spending cuts. How big will it be? Lawfare\u2019s Nick Bednar suggests it could get rid of as many as 700,000 federal employees, which \u201cwould increase nationwide unemployment by about 0.5 percent\u201d totally aside from the damage wrought by important work left undone.\n\nThe other significant thing about this initiative is that it\u2019s being jointly supervised by Russ Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. The latter is DOGE\u2019s beachhead in the federal government and its first big landing sight. It\u2019s the entity that authorized the \u201cvoluntary retirement\u201d gambit that was Musk\u2019s first major action and sent out Musk\u2019s \u201cfive bullet points\u201d email ordering federal employers to justify their existence within 48 hours (subsequently countermanded by many agencies). Whatever happened earlier, Vought and Musk, arguably the two figures in the Trump administration most aggressively hostile to much of what the federal government currently does (other than \u201cwarfighting,\u201d jailing immigrants, and rewarding Trump\u2019s friends), are on the same page now and working closely together. That this latest push was discussed at a Trump Cabinet meeting attended by Musk is a signal that blowing up big parts of the federal workforce is indeed an administrationwide priority.\n\nThere are, as you can imagine, many legal, administrative, and political pitfalls surrounding these mass layoffs. The RIF process is invariably described as \u201carcane.\u201d Deployed so massively, it would probably violate both collective-bargaining agreements and congressional policy mandates. Lawsuits are inevitable, and confusion is absolutely certain, particularly since congressional action on Trump\u2019s budget proposals and on the spending authority due to expire on March 14 could change the facts on the ground enormously. Musk\u2019s ability to sit in a meeting with agency heads without pulling out a chain saw may suggest his conduct is being regularized, but it\u2019s entirely possible he will continue to freelance in order to please his many fans on X, most of whom would love to pillage the \u201cdeep state\u201d mindlessly for the sheer nihilistic hell of it.\n\nBut while it\u2019s not possible to fully contextualize the mass firings now underway in terms of their significance to Trump 2.0\u2019s overall scheme of counterrevolutionary extremism, they will represent a wakeup call to those who thought this man just wanted to bring back a stable economy and spread peace throughout a troubled world."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nMANA Nutrition makes a special kind of peanut butter paste that many humanitarian aid workers are familiar with. It is fortified with milk and essential vitamins, packed with calories and sent to severely malnourished children around the world, including some countries in Africa.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Mark Moore, the CEO and co-founder of the Fitzgerald, Georgia-based plant, got word from the US Agency for International Development: MANA\u2019s contracts with the agency were being canceled.\n\nCNN spoke with Moore just minutes after he said he received a series of contract termination letters from USAID. Still reeling, Moore described the furious scramble that the news had set off at his plant. One of his first orders of business: Asking his workers mid-production to immediately stop putting labels that say \u201cUSAID\u201d on the pouches that the peanut butter paste is squirted into.\n\n\u201cEvery one of those packets has printing on it that says, \u2018From the American people. USAID.\u2019 And if\u2026 I don\u2019t deliver it through USAID contracts, it\u2019s trash. I can\u2019t distribute it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can squeeze that peanut butter back out of that packet and put it in a new packet. So it\u2019s a problem. A huge problem.\u201d\n\nHis predicament is just one of the many aftershocks of the Trump administration\u2019s rapid decimation of USAID, which has suffered more severely than almost any other agency across the government. Thousands of positions at the federal agency have been eliminated and the vast majority of its officials have been placed on leave. Contracts are being canceled left and right, leaving many in the humanitarian aid world reeling.\n\nThis May 2024 photo from the US Agency for International Development shows a worker handling Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food at the MANA Nutrition Factory in Fitzgerald, Georgia. US Agency for International Development\n\nIn normal times, Moore\u2019s plant produces 10 pouches of the lifesaving paste every second. Each small bag contains 500 calories\u2019 worth of the special peanut butter \u2014 which does not require refrigeration or additional preparation \u2014 and is labeled \u201cRUTF\u201d for \u201cReady-to-Use Therapeutic Food.\u201d\n\nUSAID has been a major supporter and funder of RUTF products over the years.\n\nIn the middle of a phone call with a CNN reporter, Moore asked to switch to FaceTime to show rolls of USAID-emblazoned packaging film in his office that gets turned into the sealed pouches of peanut butter.\n\n\u201cSo this is 45 boxes. USAID-branded. This is our UNICEF stuff,\u201d he said, referring to the United Nations agency tasked with providing aid to children worldwide.\n\nIn their warehouse, Moore said, there are around 400,000 boxes of USAID-branded RUTF ready to be shipped out. He estimates that if USAID doesn\u2019t pay MANA for those boxes, he will have at least $10 million in wasted peanut butter pouches on his hands. And that doesn\u2019t include an additional $14 million in reimbursements from the federal government that he was already waiting for. He is unsure whether or when he will get paid.\n\nErin Boyd, a USAID nutrition adviser who was laid off from the agency in January, told CNN it is not an overstatement to say that children will die as a result of the decimation of USAID and funding for RUTF.\n\nAdelaida Marquez, 25, serves Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food to her 15-month-old son Javier, who has been diagnosed with malnutrition, in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, in August 2019. Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters/File\n\n\u201cEven before this happened, there wasn\u2019t enough funding to treat all the children who were presenting wasting.\u201d Boyd said. Wasting, according to UNICEF, refers to a life-threatening form of malnutrition: \u201cChildren with wasting are too thin and their immune systems are weak, leaving them vulnerable to developmental delays, disease and death,\u201d the group says.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the production of RUTF that Boyd is alarmed about. She worries that the overhaul of USAID will mean the elimination of countless humanitarian programs around the world designed to save impoverished children.\n\n\u201cIt will just mean that kids\u2019 programs don\u2019t exist; the children don\u2019t even get identified as malnourished, and they\u2019ll die at home and we won\u2019t know,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nCNN reached out to the State Department, which now oversees USAID, for comment.\n\nFor now, Moore is grasping for any clarity \u2014 but nobody seems to have any answers.\n\nMANA had received around a half-dozen contract termination letters by Wednesday evening. That accounts for \u201cmost of the contracts\u201d that MANA has with USAID, he said, but it was impossible to get anything resembling real guidance from anyone at USAID on how his company should proceed.\n\nThat\u2019s because Trump\u2019s assault on the agency has left thousands of positions eliminated and the majority of the agency\u2019s employees put on administrative leave.\n\nOne person placed on leave amid the Trump assault on the agency is the USAID contract officer that Moore has dealt with in the past on MANA\u2019s contracts.\n\nThis May 2024 photo from the US Agency for International Development shows boxes of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food at the MANA Nutrition Factory. US Agency for International Development\n\n\u201cHe called me from his personal cell,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe was just stunned.\u201d\n\nOne of the contract termination letters viewed by CNN is dated Wednesday, February 25, and signed by Nadeem Shah, a deputy director at USAID.\n\n\u201cThis award is being terminated for convenience and the interests of the U.S. Government pursuant to a directive from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in his capacity as the Acting Administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development [\u201cthe Agency\u201d or \u201cUSAID\u201d] and/or Peter W. Marocco,\u201d the letter says. \u201cImmediately cease all activities, terminate all subawards and contracts, and avoid incurring any additional obligations chargeable to the award beyond those unavoidable costs associated with this Termination Notice.\u201d\n\nThis comes as a Wednesday court filing showed the Trump administration saying it is terminating more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid awards.\n\n\u201cIn total, nearly 5,800 USAID awards were terminated, and more than 500 USAID awards were retained,\u201d the filing from the administration said. \u201cThe total ceiling value of the retained awards is approximately $57 billion.\u201d\n\nIn a new world where USAID is no longer a major funder of RUTF products, Moore wonders whether major nonprofit organizations will step in and help out.\n\n\u201cI can call World Vision, or Save the Children, or whoever, and say, \u2018Hey, guess what, none of us are going to get this medicine for malnourished kids from the US government anymore, because they\u2019re shut down,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Do you want to buy some?\u2019\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Alex Kent/Getty Images\n\nFor all the rightful rage and fear millions across the globe feel over Donald Trump\u2019s return to power, it\u2019s time to recognize one grim but straightforward truth: He\u2019s more right than wrong about Russia and Ukraine. Liberals in America and Europe still can\u2019t accept this, in part because Trump is so incendiary and prone to falsehoods. Yes, it\u2019s absurd to brand Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a \u201cdictator\u201d for suspending elections during wartime but say nothing about Vladimir Putin, an autocrat who has presided over rigged elections in Russia for a quarter-century. Yes, it was Russia that invaded Ukraine, precipitating a war that has, collectively, killed hundreds of thousands of troops on both sides. Putin, if he had his druthers, would have subsumed all of Ukraine.\n\nBut peace must come, and it must come soon. The new minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine is a beginning. It is less exploitative than it seemed at first blush and includes a reconstruction fund and some kind of security guarantee. The American government should take the lead because it has heavily funded and effectively guided the Ukrainian military throughout the three horrific years of war, and it should play a direct role in reaching an accord that can guarantee an end to all hostilities, a preservation of Ukrainian civilian life, and the winding down of tensions between the U.S. and Russia, the two great nuclear powers on the planet. As early as 2022, the United States could have spearheaded a serious peace effort, but it never did; the Biden administration mistakenly believed, along with the Western European powers, that Ukraine could actually win the war against Russia, driving Putin\u2019s troops fully out of the territories they newly seized and even Crimea itself, which Russia occupied a decade ago.\n\nThe Realpolitik of all of this never made much sense, and it was why a few prominent dissenting voices, including the late Henry Kissinger and the leftist icon Noam Chomsky, reached a similar conclusion: Europe and the Biden administration were deluding themselves. It was a form of crackpot realism, an insistence on full-scale victory against all available evidence.\n\nEarly in the war, it became clear that Russia could not, in fact, conquer all of Ukraine and march onward into Poland and the rest of Europe, as Adolf Hitler did at the start of World War II. This was thanks, in part, to U.S. military aid but also to the realities of modern warfare. Today\u2019s military technology \u2014 including drones and surveillance \u2014 makes blitzkrieg-style land invasions exceedingly difficult. Just as Ukraine could not achieve any long promised \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d in the war \u2014 every ballyhooed counteroffensive failed \u2014 Russia could not penetrate very deeply beyond a few regions of Ukraine.\n\nBy the summer of 2022, it was growing obvious to anyone who wasn\u2019t blinkered by military propaganda that this clash would not at all resemble what took place in World War II. A much better analogy was the First World War, when rapid technological advances begat brutal trench warfare, the battle lines barely shifting over multiple years as millions were slaughtered. In three years of fighting, neither Ukraine nor Russia can claim huge progress. All the old Biden hands and Western European leaders managed to accomplish is buying a bit more time, through tremendous bloodshed, for a negotiated end to a war that could have ended sooner.\n\nIf the Trump administration was too fast to broadcast its bargaining aims to Russia before the sides formally entered into peace talks \u2014 Ukraine should be involved, but the U.S. needs to lead \u2014 the goals, despite the outrage of liberal internationalists, are sensible: no NATO membership for Ukraine, no American troops in Ukraine, and no American military guarantee for European Union troops in Ukraine. No American president is willing to deploy American troops into combat with Russia \u2014 and no Congress in the near term will support it \u2014 so NATO membership will be untenable. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s statement that Ukraine could not reconquer its lost territories recognized a reality that has been obvious to all cogent military analysts for more than a year, since the utter failure of the Ukrainian military offensive in 2023, as Anatole Lieven has argued.\n\nGreater security issues, as they were during the Cold War, can be hashed out only between Washington and Moscow. NATO membership for Ukraine is up to the existing members of NATO, not Ukraine, and each member has a veto. It will be extraordinarily challenging for Zelensky to accept a compromise agreement unless he tells the hard-liners in his own country he has no choice but to do what the Americans say. British and European suggestions of support for Ukraine\u2019s military sans the United States \u2014 with European troops guaranteeing a cease-fire \u2014 are nonsensical and potentially destructive, making it harder for Zelensky to sell a peace deal.\n\nNow the negotiations can commence. The United States made the first move, and it is up to Russia to reasonably counter. The contours of an agreement will rest on American willingness to accommodate Russian security concerns, like the deployment of U.S. troops on Russia\u2019s borders, in return for specific Ukrainian demands. Some are more viable than others, and this will be part of the negotiation. None of this is straightforward \u2014 there will be inevitable setbacks, and none of the negotiating parties is terribly reliable \u2014 but it is all better than endless warfare. Russia hawks describe an enemy as threatening as the old Soviet empire, but three years of de facto trench warfare have not validated their worldview. Putin has hesitated to launch a mass-conscription campaign within Russia that could, in theory, completely overwhelm the Ukrainian military, an indicator that he is wary of alienating Russian citizens (hence the North Korean soldiers dying for Russia).\n\nUkraine, of course, will have to accept that total victory is not possible and never really was. Zelensky will have to hold elections again. Democrats should pressure Trump to strike a better deal for Ukraine, but they shouldn\u2019t try to scuttle a peace agreement or rattle the sabers for a new war as they contest the 2028 nomination. This has been a terrible chapter of world history that needs to be closed as soon as possible. The most direct path to averting a new world war is represented in these negotiations. The guns, soon, must fall silent."

            "full_content": "The American coach of the Canadian men\u2019s national soccer team blasted President Donald Trump on Wednesday amid icy geopolitical tensions between the neighbors. The fiery rhetoric comes just as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico prepare to co-host the World Cup in 2026, with Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on both nations looming.\n\nSince winning the presidential election in November, Trump has repeatedly stated that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, a thought that doesn\u2019t sit well with Canada\u2019s Wisconsin-born soccer coach Jesse Marsch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to address the 51st state discourse, which I find unsettling and frankly insulting,\u201d said Marsch while speaking to the press in Los Angeles this week. \u201cIf I have one message to our president, it\u2019s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an American, I\u2019m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we\u2019ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies,\u201d said Marsch.\n\nThe Racine native and former U.S. men\u2019s national team player compared the politics of his home nation to that of the country he\u2019s now coaching.\n\n\u201cCanada is a strong, independent nation that\u2019s deep-rooted in decency,\u201d said Marsch, who at one time was touted to take over the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that values high ethics and respect, unlike the polarized, disrespectful and often now hate-fueled climate that\u2019s in the U.S.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his desire for the United States to absorb Canada at the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI say Canada should be our 51st state. It\u2019s not fair for us to be supporting Canada, and if we don\u2019t support them, they don\u2019t subsist as a nation,\u201d Trump said, flanked by his Cabinet appointees and special government employee Elon Musk.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump blasted Canada and Mexico, writing on his Truth Social social media platform: \u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.\"\n\nWhile U.S. Customs officials intercepted 20,000 pounds of fentanyl at the Mexican border in 2024, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were intercepted at the Canadian border last year, according to an NBC News analysis of U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nTrump also said in his post that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday \"as scheduled.\"\n\nDuring his Cabinet meeting, Trump outlined the crippling effects his tariffs will have on Canada. \u201cThe tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell cars into the United States. The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s pugilistic tone toward Canada has taken shape, the tension between the longtime allies has boiled over into the world of sports. Canadian fans have booed the American national anthem before NBA and NHL games, including on Feb. 15 when the U.S. and Canada\u2019s hockey teams faced off in Montreal, where three fights broke out in the first nine seconds.\n\n\u201cThese international tournaments for Canada means something different now,\u201d acknowledged Marsch.\n\nThe most highly watched international tournament in all of sports is just over a year and a half away. The World Cup could see the host nations play each other in the knockout rounds amid the backdrop of unprecedented geopolitical dynamics."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 Congress is barreling toward a deadline to avert a government shutdown in just over two weeks, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether there should be guardrails on President Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress.\n\nDemocrats want to insert language in the funding bill to ensure that the administration implements the spending directed by Congress, a reaction to Mr. Trump and top adviser Elon Musk's work to downsize large swaths of the executive branch. But Republicans have made it clear that they won't accept those terms.\n\nGovernment funding expires on March 14, and keeping the government open past the deadline will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, but a funding measure requires 60 votes for passage. In the House, Republicans are operating with a razor-thin majority and a divided conference in which conservatives regularly vote against government spending bills.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday that a continuing resolution that funds the government at the current levels is the \"most reasonable thing to do to ensure that the government is not shut down.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks at a press conference with other members of House Republican leadership in Washington D.C., on Feb. 25, 2025. Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nIt has yet to be determined whether disaster relief for the California wildfires would be included in the funding measure, but Johnson told reporters it likely would not include language to codify cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the Musk-led task force that is slashing programs across the executive branch.\n\n\"It probably is as close to a clean CR as possible,\" he said of the potential path forward.\n\nJohnson's comments came after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut in an interview with CNN later in the evening, Johnson noted that the CR might include some \"anomalies,\" opening the door to spending cuts that would alienate most Democrats.\n\n\"You can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending. You can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a clean CR, mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here.\"\n\nThursday evening, Mr. Trump announced his support for a \"a clean, temporary\" continuing resolution, telling Congress, \"Let's get it done!\"\n\nDemocratic leaders have said the blame for any shutdown would lie squarely with Republicans, who control the House, Senate and the White House. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that Democrats don't want a shutdown and are at the table negotiating in good faith to fund the government.\n\n\"But Republicans are the majority in the House and in the Senate. If they want our votes, they need to work with us,\" Murray said, noting that appropriators are \"close\" on topline spending.\n\n\"We need to know Republicans are willing to work with us to protect Congress' power of the purse,\" Murray said. \"That is the absolute bare minimum, and it's frankly not asking a whole lot.\"\n\nRepublicans \"should not follow Elon toward a shutdown,\" Murray said.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Senate's top Republican appropriator, and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, her counterpart in the House, met with Johnson and Thune on Wednesday morning to discuss government funding.\n\nCole said he and Collins are on the same page, but do have differences with Democrats on \"some of the restrictions that they're demanding on what we consider legitimate presidential authority.\" He added that Republicans are \"not moving on that.\"\n\n\"That's a no-go, that's a red line that we're not changing our position on and they know that \u2014 that's been communicated consistently,\" Cole said.\n\nJohnson said Democrats have \"had completely unreasonable conditions assigned to this.\"\n\n\"They want us to limit the power of the executive branch, they want us to stipulate in the appropriations bills for the first time in history that certain agencies in the executive branch would have to have a specific number of employees, all sorts of just unreasonable \u2014 what I think are unconstitutional \u2014 demands,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a violation of separation of powers. So we're pretty far apart right now, but it is not because of Republicans, it's because of the Democrats.\"\n\nThe funding fight comes as Republicans in Congress have also been moving ahead on a separate budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for approving Mr. Trump's agenda on issues ranging from border security to energy and taxes. Though the two issues are distinctly separate, the focus on the budget has taken center stage in recent weeks, appearing to sideline progress toward government funding.\n\ncontributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nLet\u2019s build from scratch our Nightmare Prosecutor, the way kids might build their ultimate villain in an interactive, comic-universe video game.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by sliding our subject\u2019s prosecutorial experience rating to zero. At the same time, let\u2019s max out his arrogance score \u2014 nothing quite like having no chops but thinking you\u2019re Archibald Cox. Then we\u2019ll give our creation full control of a crucial prosecutor\u2019s office that will handle sensitive political matters so he can inflict maximum damage. Now let\u2019s amp things up and make our Nightmare Prosecutor a political attack dog, frothing to use his shiny new badge to settle scores and please his master. As a closing touch, we\u2019ll drag the sycophancy score all the way up; his public slobbering will be so comically excessive you\u2019ll have to stifle a laugh \u2014 until you remember how much power he actually wields.\n\nWelcome to the Weapon X of the Trump Justice Department: Ed Martin.\n\nDon\u2019t let the forgettable name fool you. The acting U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., recently nominated by Trump to the full-time post, is going to do major damage \u2014 to his political opponents, to the Justice Department, and ultimately to the Trump administration itself. Putting Martin in charge of the D.C. U.S. Attorney\u2019s office is like giving a power tool to a 6-year-old in a crowded room. He has no idea how to use it and no sense of the damage he can do, but he\u2019s going to run wild with it and people are going to get hurt.\n\nMartin \u2014 who had represented January 6 defendants (which is fine, everyone\u2019s entitled to a defense) and was a vocal \u201cStop the Steal\u201d proponent (which is not) \u2014 came to the job with an agenda. He quickly dismissed dozens of pending January 6 cases as he\u2019d been instructed to do by Trump and the acting attorney general. In one of those cases, the defendant had been represented by \u2026 Ed Martin. This, folks, is what we call a conflict of interest.\n\nMartin also fired about 30 of his own prosecutors, who had worked on January 6 cases, apparently for their unforgivable decision to prosecute cases against people who had obviously violated the law. Because retribution must be served not only cold but in heaping portions, Martin ordered some of his remaining prosecutors to investigate their own colleagues for potentially committing some unspecified crime by prosecuting the January 6 defendants in the first place.\n\nStill not satisfied, Martin recently posted on X an article about how, toward the end of his time as special counsel, Jack Smith had received $140,000 in free legal services from a D.C. law firm (Covington & Burling, where I worked 20 years ago and have several friends). Martin snarled, \u201cSave your receipts, Smith and Covington. We\u2019ll be in touch soon.\u201d What\u2019s even the potential crime here? Smith lawyered up \u2014 wisely, given the obvious retribution headed his way \u2014 and a law firm represented him pro bono. Somebody call the cops! And if Martin had a clue, he\u2019d know that it\u2019s generally not a great idea to broadcast a new criminal investigation publicly. It tends to, you know, out your case and tip off the bad guys. Either Martin is a prosecutorial buffoon or he only cares about the aggro X post \u2014 could be both. (Not to be outdone, Trump himself promptly announced that he\u2019d be seeking vengeance on Covington for having the gall to do free legal work for Smith, stripping security clearances and government contracts from the firm.)\n\nSpeaking of social media, D.C.\u2019s top prosecutor simply can\u2019t stop fawning over Elon Musk and DOGE. That would be fine, if mildly embarrassing, for a normal person. But Martin has seemingly enlisted his office as Musk\u2019s personal police force. He wrote an obsequious letter to Musk, then \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 posted it on X, prefaced by a sweet personal note about how Martin would seek out those who might oppose Musk\u2019s DOGE and prosecute \u201claw-breaking by the disgruntled.\u201d Ah, yes: United States v. Disgruntled, on a charge of Law-Breaking.\n\nDays later, Martin posted on X a hysterically overwrought follow-up. \u201cIf people are discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically, we will investigate them,\u201d Martin frothed. Hey, rookie: prosecutors can\u2019t indict people for \u201cacting simply unethically.\u201d\n\nThen, just to show how much he meant it, Martin added, in extra-scary bold typeface: \u201cwe will chase them to the end of the Earth.\u201d Listen, Ed. Take a breath. I know you\u2019re brand new to this whole prosecutor thing. It\u2019s exciting, I get it. But you need to see what actual crime looks like before you rip your shirt off and promise to tear down heaven and earth to bring to justice those folks who might\u2019ve upset Elon Musk.\n\nAnd in his most recent tantrum, Martin publicly threatened to prosecute Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Robert Garcia for \u2026 saying things about politics. Schumer infamously proclaimed in March 2020 that certain conservative Supreme Court justices \u201chave released the whirlwind and you will pay the price\u201d while Garcia said this month that \u201cwhat the American public want is for us to bring actual weapons to this bar fight.\u201d\n\nBoth Schumer and Garcia made stupid, irresponsible statements. But their screeds are wholly protected by the First Amendment, which applies most powerfully to political speech \u2014 a good thing, as it turns out, for one Donald John Trump, who regularly pushes the outer boundaries and has (rightly) avoided prosecution even for his inflammatory January 6 Ellipse speech. (Smith charged Trump for his pre\u2013January 6 efforts to steal the election but not for his political speech that day.) If Martin is unhinged enough to actually seek an indictment of either Schumer or Garcia, the chances of an eventual conviction are precisely 0.0 percent.\n\nPrecious few people can rein in Martin. There\u2019s Trump, of course, but don\u2019t count on that. There\u2019s also the Senate, which can and should reject his nomination, but that\u2019s not happening either; everyone above the Gaetz line has made it through.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has chosen thus far to remain blissfully unaware of her own Justice Department\u2019s most consequential moves. She claimed, for example, to be unaware of exactly what was happening with the Eric Adams debacle, even as the crisis boiled over publicly. Bondi\u2019s acting deputy, Emil Bove, would technically be in position to check Martin, but Bove has embraced the same aggressively retributive tactics. Then there\u2019s Todd Blanche, who will become the deputy attorney general once confirmed by the Senate. He\u2019s a friend and former colleague of mine, and he has a sound prosecutorial ethic. But his loyalty to core prosecutorial principle has yet to be tested, and it won\u2019t be easy to restore order inside the dark cloud that has enveloped the Justice Department.\n\nPerhaps the only real check is that Martin might go so far that he inflicts genuine political damage on the Trump administration. We learned a lesson from the frenetic, runaway prosecutions of Trump himself: The American people know prosecutorial overkill when they see it, and they\u2019ll reject it. Just as prosecutors brought ill-conceived, ineptly executed cases against Trump that backfired and provided him with political fuel, the American public will eventually take notice of Martin\u2019s excesses, and the Trump administration will pay the political price.\n\nBut that\u2019s an indirect cost at most, and it will take months or years, and many more abuses, to fully take hold. The cold reality is that it\u2019s already ugly in D.C., and it\u2019s going to get worse.\n\nThis article will also appear in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson vowed Wednesday that Republicans will not make cuts to Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security as they work to pass \u2013 and pay for \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislative agenda.\n\n\u201cThe White House has made a commitment. The president said over and over and over, \u2018We\u2019re not going to touch Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.\u2019 We\u2019ve made the same commitment. Now that said, what we are going to do is go into those programs and carve out the fraud, waste and abuse, and find efficiencies,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly said he will not cut entitlement programs, including during his administration\u2019s first Cabinet meeting earlier Wednesday, Republicans have long sought to shrink Medicaid.\n\nPressed on how they would cut the amount laid out in the House\u2019s budget blueprint without touching Medicare and Medicaid, Johnson argued that it is possible through work requirements and other cuts. Johnson also said that per capita caps on federal funding for those programs are \u201coff the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s let this play out,\u201d he added.\n\nJohnson\u2019s promise came hours after House Republicans passed a budget blueprint to advance Trump\u2019s legislative priorities, but it awaits Senate approval. Not all GOP senators are in favor of the trillions of dollars in spending cuts included in the House-passed version that Johnson was forced to add by conservative hardliners, as CNN has reported.\n\nThe House GOP plan calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts \u2013 and if it doesn\u2019t hit $2 trillion, it forces tax-writers to downsize some of their plans. Almost $1 trillion of that will come from savings in the Energy and Commerce Committee, which even some Republicans fear could mean steep cuts to the popular health program Medicaid.\n\nThat\u2019s yet another nonstarter for some Senate Republicans, particularly those from states where Medicaid enrollment accelerated after local leaders accepted more federal cash under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs the March 14 government funding deadline looms, Johnson acknowledged that Congress may have to settle for a yearlong resolution maintaining spending at current levels \u2013 with carveouts and adjustments to align with the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s cuts, including to the US Agency for International Development. Those kinds of changes are likely to anger Democrats, whose support Johnson may need to pass the resolution.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I say you add anomalies to a (continuing resolution); you can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending,\u201d Johnson said, referring to a short-term stopgap spending bill. \u201cYou can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a clean CR mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here,\u201d the Louisiana Republican added. \u201cAnd the new reality is less government, more efficiency, better return for the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report."
