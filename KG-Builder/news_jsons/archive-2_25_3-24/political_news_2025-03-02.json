            "full_content": "In one of the most mud-slinging, wide-open Oscar races in years, picking winners is like walking a tightrope over a pit of snapping scandals.\n\nNo sooner did \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" -- a Spanish-language musical crime drama from a French director -- receive the most nominations (13) of any movie this year than its chances were dinged by resurfaced tweets from the film's star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly trans actress to score an acting nomination.\n\nThough Gasc\u00f3n has since apologized for her comments, many have wondered if the damage is insurmountable.\n\nThen there's the controversy around \"The Brutalist\" -- with 10 nominations, including best picture -- for using artificial intelligence to help acting nominees Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones in the very few scenes where they had to speak Hungarian.\n\nAnd what's with \"Anora\" -- boasting six nominations, including best picture -- filming all those sex scenes without an intimacy coordinator, as revealed by star and acting nominee Mikey Madison in a Variety chat?\n\nAnd does the blockbuster musical \"Wicked\" really deserve the top prize if it's only Part 1 of a film that won't be complete until Part 2 is released in November?\n\nClearly these issues have absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the nominees themselves. The film academy is always concerned with how it looks to the outside world. Still, the heated battle between image and merit only adds to the fun, especially in a super competitive year like this one when trying to figure out how nearly 10,000 Oscar voters are going to come to a consensus is more of a head-scratcher than ever.\n\nThe 2025 Oscars will take place Sunday, March 2, airing live on ABC and streaming live on Hulu beginning at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nLet the games begin with my predictions about who should win -- and who will win -- in the major categories.\n\nAdrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nColman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\")\n\nRalph Fiennes (\"Conclave\")\n\nSebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\")\n\nSHOULD WIN (if the public voted): Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nChalamet's performance as the young Bob Dylan is acting, singing, guitar-strumming, harmonica-blowing perfection.\n\nAnd just a week ago, after watching Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\") take most of the critics prizes, he finally caught a big break with a significant win from his peers at the Screen Actors Guild for transcending impersonation in a warts-and-all portrait that also captures the petulant arrogance of the future Nobel Prize winner whose music, lyrics and raw vocal rasp helped define a generation. Chalamet's transporting performance catches Dylan in the exhilarating act of inventing himself as multitudes, a fugitive troubadour and poet who's always creating and always in the wind.\n\nShould Chalamet, nominated before in the same category for 2017's \"Call Me By Your Name,\" win the Oscar on Sunday night, he will become, at 29, the youngest nominee ever to win the best actor prize, besting previous record holder Brody by nine months and change.\n\nTimothee Chalamet stars as Bob Dylan in the movie, \"A Complete Unknown.\" Macall Polay/Searchlight Pictures\n\nWILL WIN: Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nSorry Timmy, but the one to beat is still Brody -- the current holder of the title of the youngest best actor winner (he was one month shy of his 30th birthday when he won the Oscar for 2002's \"The Pianist\" as musician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi invasion of Warsaw.\n\nBrody tops even that career triumph with his \"Brutalist\" portrayal of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor who arrives in America after the war in a burst of anticipation and dread. Acting doesn't get better or go deeper than the emotional tour de force given by Brody, who brings every fiber of his being to the role of his career.\n\nA second Oscar seems inevitable.\n\nAdrien Brody is seen in a still from the film \"The Brutalist.\" Lol Crawley/A24\n\nCynthia Erivo (\"Wicked\")\n\nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n (\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\")\n\nMikey Madison (\"Anora\")\n\nDemi Moore (\"The Substance\")\n\nFernanda Torres (\"I'm Still Here\")\n\nSHOULD WIN: Mikey Madison (\"Anora\")\n\nThe odds favor Madison. Let me explain.\n\nWhile Oscar traditionally makes guys wait until they have some age on them, the gold statue practically climbs into the hands of a young beauty in a breakthrough part. I'm talking Audrey Hepburn (\"Roman Holiday\") to Gwyneth Paltrow (\"Shakespeare in Love\") and Jennifer Lawrence (\"Silver Linings Playbook\"). So why not bestow the crown on Madison, 25, acing the title role in \"Anora\" as the stripper/sex worker who falls for her own fantasy of marrying a handsome prince -- in this case the son of a Russian oligarch -- and living happily ever after.\n\nThe comic and dramatic chops Madison brings to the role really are award worthy.\n\nA scene from the movie \"Anora.\" Universal Pictures\n\nWILL WIN: Demi Moore (\"The Substance\")\n\nThe only thing Oscar loves more than a discovery is a comeback, and Moore practically defined the term by scoring her first nomination at 62 for \"The Substance,\" Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp horror-satire about Hollywood's greatest fear: aging.\n\nDuring her victory speech at the Golden Globes, Moore talked about being dismissed as a \"popcorn actress\" who should stay in her lane. No way. For pushing past vanity to find the bruised heart of a character who literally splits herself in half to preserve the illusion of timeless allure, Moore spoke to everyone who felt banished to oblivion at the first sign of a wrinkle. She also found her finest two hours on screen.\n\nHow does Oscar resist that? Two words: it doesn't.\n\nDemi Moore in \"The Substance,\" 2024. Metropolitan Films\n\nBest actor in a supporting role\n\nYura Borisov (\"Anora\")\n\nKieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\")\n\nEdward Norton (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nGuy Pearce (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nJeremy Strong (\"The Apprentice\")\n\nSHOULD WIN: Jeremy Strong (\"The Apprentice\")\n\nThe \"Succession\" Emmy winner is evil incarnate as Roy Cohn, the dark prince of a lawyer who served as the architect of Donald Trump's rise to power before he even seriously considered politics. Cohn's three commandments for success certainly stuck with his apprentice, played by best actor nominee Sebastian Stan: \"Attack, attack, attack; admit nothing, deny everything; and always claim victory -- never acknowledge defeat.\" Strong plays Cohn with a demonic humor that makes every laugh sting, even those that sow the seeds of his own discussion.\n\nStrong finds a path into Cohn's battered soul in a film that didn't deserve its box-office neglect. He'd be tough to beat, except for...\n\nJeremy Strong is seen in a still from \"The Apprenctice.\" Briarcliff Entertainment/YouTube\n\nWILL WIN: Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\")\n\nThe \"Succession\" Emmy winner -- he and Strong played feuding brothers on the landmark series -- is in the wrong category since his is a lead performance in every sense of the word as a misfit named Benji on a Holocaust tour of Poland, where his late grandmother escaped the death camps. Director Jesse Eisenberg, who wrote the Oscar-worthy script for this funny, touching and vital dramedy, plays the cousin who accompanies Benji on the trip. There's not a manipulative, sanctimonious, false note in Culkin's off-the-charts great performance.\n\nForget the category fraud, if there is a sure-thing among this year's Oscar nominees, Culkin is it.\n\nKieran Culkin and Jesse Eisenberg in \"A Real Pain,\" 2024. Searchlight Pictures\n\nBest actress in a supporting role\n\nMonica Barbaro (\"A Complete Unknown\")\n\nAriana Grande (\"Wicked\")\n\nFelicity Jones (\"The Brutalist\")\n\nIsabella Rossellini (\"Conclave\")\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a (\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\")\n\nSHOULD WIN: Isabella Rossellini (\"Conclave\")\n\nIf you want to know what a true supporting performance is, check out the magnificent Rossellini as Sister Agnes, the only female in this all-male conclave of cardinals in the timely business of electing a new Pope. Critics say that Rossellini has only one big dialogue scene, not enough to cinch the win. Nonsense. She creates a woman in full in the space between words.\n\nThis is a first nomination for the gifted daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto Rossellini, and she emerges as the film's moral conscience and its grieving heart.\n\nThis image released by Focus Features shows Isabella Rossellini in a scene from \"Conclave.\" Focus Features via AP\n\nWILL WIN: Zoe Salda\u00f1a (\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\")\n\nDon't expect the controversies swirling around her film and her co-star Gasc\u00f3n to hurt the chances Salda\u00f1a has at taking home her first Oscar.\n\nAs the lawyer at the center of the story -- hardly a supporting role -- Salda\u00f1a proves she's more than the action dynamo of the \"Avatar\" franchise and Marvel Cinematic Universe, but an actress of grit and grace. She might even propel her sensational song-and-dance, \"El Mal,\" into a best song Oscar.\n\nWhere Rossellini goes small, Salda\u00f1a goes big and, fair or not, the size of her portrayal should tilt the balance in her favor.\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a as Rita Moro Castro in \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Shanna Besson/Page 114/Why Not Productions/Path\u00e9 Films/France 2 Cin\u00e9ma\n\nBest picture\n\n\"Anora\"\n\n\"The Brutalist\"\n\n\"A Complete Unknown\"\n\n\"Conclave\"\n\n\"Dune: Part Two\"\n\n\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\"\n\n\"I'm Still Here\"\n\n\"Nickel Boys\"\n\n\"The Substance\"\n\n\"Wicked\"\n\nSHOULD WIN: \"The Brutalist\"\n\nBy any measurement of roaring talent and ambition, director Brady Corbet's intimate epic about the immigrant experience in America is the best picture of the year. \"Anora\" and \"Conclave\" are breathing down its neck, but the technical aspects from cinematography to score are top-notch and the direction of the category best Corbet and the acting of Brody, Jones and Guy Peace set a new gold standard. The crucial complaint is that \"The Brutalist\" is too long at three hours and 35 minutes. Length didn't hurt \"Oppenheimer\" and it shouldn't be a problem here -- except for the growing plague of short attention spans.\n\nSo unless Oscar voters come to their senses and do the right thing, I'm conceding defeat.\n\nAdrien Brody is seen in a still from the upcoming film \"The Brutalist.\" Lol Crawley/A24\n\nWILL WIN: \"Conclave\" ... in a squeaker victory over \"Anora\"\n\nI expect a dead heat on Oscar night, with the saints of \"Conclave\" just edging out the sinners of \"Anora.\" Either could prevail. \"Anora\" showed a recent surge by claiming victory at the influential producers and directors guilds -- Sean Baker's love letter to sex workers is definitely the cool kids' choice. But throwback voters, blanching at the sex, drugs and F-bombs in \"Anora,\" are more comfortable with Edward Berger's classical approach in \"Conclave,\" which won the day at the BAFTAs (the British Academy with an overlapping membership with the American version) and just a week ago grabbed the best ensemble cast trophy from the Screen Actors Guild, the largest voting group at the Oscars.\n\nIt's a coin toss, which should have us all holding our breath on the big night.\n\nWhat could be better?! Place your bets.\n\nRalph Fiennes stars as Cardinal Lawrence in \"Conclave,\" 2024. Focus Features\n\nThe 2025 Oscars will take place Sunday, March 2, airing live on ABC and streaming live on Hulu beginning at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nDisney is the parent company of Hulu, ABC and \"Good Morning America."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe White House is making clear it views President Donald Trump\u2019s Friday Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as an overwhelming win that underscores Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d leadership, dispatching top officials and allies to amplify Trump\u2019s handling of the situation even as European leaders are expressing unified support for Ukraine and its leader.\n\nTrump often took aim at US aid for Ukraine on the campaign trail, reflecting waning support among Americans for Ukraine and Zelensky over the past three years of the war. Trump views the conflict through an economic lens, seeking to rebuild a partnership with Russia and recoup some of the financial support the US has provided to Ukraine.\n\nThe president\u2019s top lieutenants, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2014 all of whom were in the Oval Office during the explosive meeting \u2014 appeared on news shows Sunday to offer praise to their boss and criticism of his Ukrainian counterpart as Trump is dramatically reshaping US alliances.\n\nThe efforts come as dozens of European leaders are gathering in London for what British Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as a \u201conce-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe,\u201d a major show of support for Zelensky.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, France's President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Zelensky, Romania's Interim President Ilie Bolojan, European Council President Antonio Costa and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a summit in central London on March 2, 2025. Justin Tallis/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes, everyone around this table,\u201d Starmer said in opening remarks at the Sunday summit.\n\nTrump\u2019s team, meanwhile, is doubling down, framing the contentious Friday meeting from a position of US strength, even as it has been met with glee by the Kremlin.\n\nDuring an appearance on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Waltz indicated US support for new leadership in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war,\u201d Waltz told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAnd if it becomes apparent that President Zelensky\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands,\u201d Waltz said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also suggested in an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Zelensky should potentially step aside after the tense meeting, saying, \u201cEither he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that.\u201d\n\nTrump himself suggested after the meeting that Zelensky does not want an end to the war. Waltz said Sunday that the Ukrainian leader needs to make it clear \u201cpublicly and privately\u201d that he is \u201cready to go to peace.\u201d\n\nWaltz, who compared Zelensky to an \u201cex-girlfriend that just wants to argue\u201d earlier in the weekend, continued to slam the Ukrainian leader\u2019s Friday actions and body language, castigating \u201cthe shaking of the head, the kind of \u2014 the arms crossed, we just \u2014 we found it incredibly disrespectful.\u201d\n\nRubio also went after Zelensky, who, he said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cfound every opportunity to try to \u2018Ukraine-splain\u2019 on every issue.\u201d\n\nAnd Lutnick cast Trump as \u201cthe peacemaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the peacemaker, and if Zelensky is not interested in peace, then he should go home and think about it,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nZelensky, Trump, and Vance at the White House on Friday, February 28, 2025. Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe White House press office has also sent multiple emails amplifying warm reviews and messages of support from key Republican allies on Capitol Hill, members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and other top White House officials.\n\n\u201cSupport continues to roll in for the unwavering commitment of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Vance to the American people and the Trump Administration\u2019s relentless pursuit of peace,\u201d an email sent to reporters Saturday said, highlighting remarks from Johnson praising Trump for \u201cputting America first\u201d; from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard thanking Trump for his \u201cunwavering leadership\u201d; and from Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri asserting that \u201cthe age of \u2018America last\u2019 foreign policy is over,\u201d among others.\n\nJohnson, who spearheaded an effort to pass more aid to Ukraine last spring despite threats to his speakership from some hardliners in his own party, told Bash he had done so to \u201callow Ukraine to sustain itself and position them for peace negotiations\u201d by extending support until Trump took office.\n\n\u201cThe plan worked, but now Zelensky has to follow through, and the fact that he acted as he did, I think, was a great disappointment,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said.\n\nHe said an assessment by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a frequent GOP critic of the president, that the Trump administration was \u201cwalking away from our allies and embracing Putin,\u201d was \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d arguing that Trump, who has hesitated to call Putin a \u201cdictator,\u201d has been \u201cvery clear\u201d that the Russian president is an aggressor in Ukraine.\n\nFormer House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner, historically an avid supporter of Ukraine and hardliner on Russia, called Zelensky\u2019s actions during the meeting with Trump \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got to hear President Trump. I mean \u2026 he engaged by saying, you know, people are dying,\u201d the Ohio Republican congressman said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop the dying. \u2026 Let\u2019s go forward with the peace negotiations, and then we\u2019ll determine what security arrangements need to be made around the peace negotiations.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nWhen he steps onto the dais in the House chamber on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will have another major platform to relay his second-term priorities. For Democrats, the moment will present a fresh test of whether they can effectively counter Trump\u2019s prime-time programming.\n\nDemocratic leadership chose a first-term senator elected in a battleground state Trump won in November to deliver the party\u2019s official response. A Democratic senator whose name is often talked about for 2028 is among those skipping the address, predicting it will be a \u201cMAGA pep rally.\u201d And a protest movement organizing online has identified March 4 \u2014 the day of Trump\u2019s speech \u2014 as its next day of action.\n\nThe varying tactics of Democrats in Washington and across the country will be on display as Trump delivers his address to a joint session of Congress six weeks into a second term during which he\u2019s swiftly moved to remake the federal government and implement his foreign policy vision, at times unnerving US allies.\n\nWhile Democrats have rallied against Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency cuts, lawmakers in Washington have struggled to stop the president\u2019s early actions or settle on a cohesive approach to push back on them. It comes amid a debate within the Democratic Party about the best way to handle Trump\u2019s second term and position Democrats for success in the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election \u2014 with some saying party leaders aren\u2019t doing enough.\n\nHeading into Tuesday\u2019s speech, Democratic leaders \u2014 from Capitol Hill to the Democratic National Committee \u2014 are hoping to present a united front. They want to zero in on how Trump\u2019s actions are negatively impacting people and falling short of promises he\u2019s made, including a pledge to lower costs. Democrats also are eager to warn that Republicans could put Medicaid at risk in the upcoming budget fight.\n\nDemocratic leadership is turning to Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan to deliver the official rebuttal, a sign of their desire to appeal to working-class voters after Democrats lost power in the White House and on Capitol Hill in 2024. After Michigan voters split their tickets, sending Trump to the White House and Slotkin to the Senate, the freshman Democrat has emphasized her party needs to focus on kitchen-table issues as it looks to rebuild.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin at a Senate hearing in Washington, DC, January 14, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Slotkin would use her rebuttal to \u201ccommunicate that Democrats are fighting to lower the cost of living and protect Social Security and Medicaid while Republicans cut taxes for their billionaire donors and Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, is set to deliver the official Spanish-language response.\n\nSenate and House leadership have encouraged lawmakers to invite individuals who have been affected by Trump\u2019s moves, including job cuts and funding freezes, as guests, Democratic aides said.\n\n\u201cWe ask that House Democrats attending the Joint Address bring a guest who has been harmed by the Trump administration\u2019s early actions or will be hurt by the House Republican budget,\u201d the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee told congressional offices in a memo obtained by CNN.\n\nThe DNC has also coordinated with the Democratic campaign committees and officials in states across the country to message against Trump and Republicans around the joint address, a party official said.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who was the only freshman Democratic senator besides Slotkin to win in a state Trump carried in 2024, said Democrats need to tune out distractions around Trump\u2019s speech and zero in on issues confronting Americans on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cWhat they really care about is the fact that the price of eggs is so high. It\u2019s hard to get a house. All these things that are really dragging down the everyday Americans trying to just do a little better,\u201d said Gallego, who is planning to take a disabled veteran and federal worker who was recently fired due to Trump\u2019s cuts to the federal workforce as his guest.\n\nBut some Democrats may decide boycotting the speech is the best approach. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a leading voice in the pushback to Trump, is skipping the joint address and will participate in a counterprogramming event with progressive advocacy group MoveOn instead.\n\n\u201cI think every Democrat needs to make up their own mind. I think that State of the Union speech is going to be a farce. I think it\u2019s gonna be a MAGA pep rally,\u201d Murphy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWe have to fight every single day, every single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of Democrats think maybe you should fight every third day, you should reserve your power and jump out of the bushes at the right moment,\u201d he added. \u201cI just think we have to be on the offensive 24/7.\u201d\n\nAnother possible 2028 contender planning to play in the Trump pushback on Tuesday \u2014 former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who will appear on a live edition of \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d following Trump\u2019s speech. And several Democratic governors, including Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, delivered their own \u201cState of the State\u201d addresses back home in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nThe Working Families Party has said Democratic Rep.

Vice President Mike Pence is at left. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nWhile Republicans at times heckled former President Joe Biden during his State of the Union speeches, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who famously ripped up Trump\u2019s speech during his last State of the Union, urged Democrats to exercise caution with the current president.\n\n\u201cAny demonstration of disagreement, whether it\u2019s visual or whatever, just let him stew in his own juice. Don\u2019t be any grist for the mill to say this was inappropriate,\u201d the California Democrat said in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nOutside of Washington, one protest movement is hoping to provide voters with an outlet to channel their frustration. The 50501 movement, which describes itself as a nonpartisan effort, chose the date of Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress as its next rallying point.\n\nOnline organizers have encouraged demonstrators to participate in \u201cMarch 4th for Democracy,\u201d to \u201craise their voices on this significant occasion, amplifying concerns that impact everyday lives,\u201d a source working with the effort said.\n\nProtesters rally against the Department of Government Efficiency outside the US Department of Labor on February 5, 2025, in Washington, DC. Kena Betancur/VIEWpress/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nIt comes as visible signs of voter discontent with Trump, Musk and the GOP administration have started to bubble up in pockets of the country. Constituents engaged in fiery exchanges with some Republican lawmakers at town halls when the House was on recess last month, echoing scenes that played out in 2017 during Trump\u2019s first term in office.\n\n\u201cI think anything that gets more people actively doing something in the real world and draws more folks into an oppositional movement against Musk and Trump is healthy,\u201d said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive organization Indivisible. \u201cEvery day, there are new people who were on the sidelines, who have had enough and are now trying to figure out what they could do.\u201d\n\nRecent CNN polling found broad Democratic dissatisfaction with how congressional Democrats have handled their response to Trump so far. Nearly three quarters (73%) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents surveyed said the party\u2019s caucus in Congress is doing too little to oppose Trump. Twenty-two percent said they\u2019re doing the right amount, and 5% said they\u2019re overdoing it.\n\nPotential showdowns over a March 14 government shutdown deadline and the Republican push for a major budget bill to enact Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda could emerge for Democrats in the coming weeks.\n\nA leading Democratic super PAC is already planning to step up its attacks over the Trump administration\u2019s policy vision. The House Majority PAC, the leading Democratic super PAC, is rolling out new ads warning of Medicaid cuts and featuring images of tech billionaire Musk wielding a chain saw rolling out in more than 20 congressional districts next week.\n\nGallego is planning to hold town halls in rural parts of his state in the coming weeks to detail how Medicaid cuts would \u201cdisproportionately affect\u201d them. The Arizona senator said Democrats need to make \u201csure we\u2019re taking the fight not just to our normal Democratic areas, but our really Republican strongholds.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cEverything we need to be doing is make sure to remind people that whatever the president\u2019s doing right now, whatever Elon Musk\u2019s doing now, is not making your life any better.\u201d"

But also rare is his friendship with the late, trailblazing publisher of the Washington Post, Katharine Graham. \"If there's any story that should be told, it should be her story,\" he said. \"If I was a young girl, I'd want to hear that story. It would change my self-image.\n\n\"She was one of a kind, and she was terrified of the job,\" Buffett said. \"She knew she could do things, but she'd been told all her life that she wasn't [allowed], and that females didn't do things. I mean, her mother told her, 'Nobody's interested in listening to you.' And so, all of a sudden, here she is, and she had an all-male board that was waiting for her, and all they wanted was her to stay home and cash the dividend checks.\"\n\nAn undated photo of investor Warren Buffett and Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. CBS News\n\nGraham was thrust into the role, taking over the company, after her husband, Philip Graham, died by suicide. She was then the center of some of the century's biggest stories. She made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers that helped lead to the end of Vietnam War. It was Graham who supported the investigative journalism that led to President Nixon's resignation after Watergate.\n\nAll this in spite of the fact that, Buffett said, Graham had had drummed into her head the idea, \"Only men can succeed at business.\"\n\nGraham herself once said, \"The worst handicap women work under is the self-inflicted one \u2013 that is, if you've grown up thinking of yourself as a second-class citizen, that you tend always to put yourself down.\"\n\nGraham's journey from housewife to the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company is laid out in a new documentary, \"Becoming Katharine Graham,\" now streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\nAnd at the center of the story is an unlikely friendship that began on June 4, 1973, when Buffett sent Graham a letter after buying a significant amount of the Washington Post Company's stock. \"I said, 'I'll never buy another share unless you personally okay it,' and I signed a document. Then we became friends.\"\n\nIn the documentary, Graham recalled of Buffett: \"He used to come to board meetings with about 20 annual reports, and he would take me through these annual reports. I mean, it was like going to business school with Warren Buffet.\"\n\nAsked why he invested in the Post to begin with, Buffett replied, \"It was ridiculously cheap. It was a super bargain. It was worth at least $500 million and was selling for $100 million.\"\n\nKatharine Graham's son, Don Graham, a former publisher of the Post, said that Buffett was the greatest thing in business that ever happened to Katharine Graham.\n\nBuffett said, \"She needed somebody to reassure her.\"\n\nI asked, \"What were the things you would say to her to boost her confidence?\"\n\n\"The biggest thing I said is, when you look in the mirror, it's a funhouse mirror because you're seeing it for the eyes of what the males are telling you about it,\" Buffett replied. \"So, my job is to turn that funhouse mirror into a regular mirror. And she knew I was on her side, and I admired her enormously. And she was torturing herself. She couldn't help doing that.\"\n\nThe documentary, for the first time, shows the public the full extent of President Nixon's feud with Graham. A White House recording features one of the president's conversations with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover:\n\nHoover: \"I saw her on TV last night, Mrs. Graham. I would've thought she's about 85 years old. She's only about, I think, something like 57.\"\n\nNixon: \"Oh, no, I know that.\"\n\nHoover: \"She's aged terribly.\"\n\nNixon: \"She's a terrible old bag.\"\n\nHoover: \"Oh, she's an old bitch, in my estimation.\"\n\nNixon: \"That's right!\"\n\nBut according to Buffett, \"Nixon didn't scare her at all.\" What did scare her was the idea of losing the paper. Never did that feel more real to Graham than in 1975, when the Post's printers damaged the presses and went on a bitter strike for more than four months, limiting the paper's circulation.\n\n\"How challenging was that time?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, it tore her apart,\" said Buffett. \"She was suffering in that way at that time more than she ever suffered during Watergate, or during the Pentagon Papers, or anything. But she thought she might be blowing everything.\"\n\nBuffett told us Katharine Graham prevailed because she was brave \u2026 and it's because of her that the Washington Post Company stock price went up more than 3,000 percent while she was publisher.\n\nBut she didn't just make Buffett a lot of money; she said she introduced to him \"the possibility that a steady diet of fast food and Cherry Cokes might not be the best for him.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but she didn't convert me!\" laughed Buffett, who said his favorite foods were what he was eating when he was six years old: \"Hot dogs and hamburgers and Coke and ice cream sundaes, and root beer floats are my favorite. I frequently have a dinner with a root beer float.\"\n\nOnce, attending a dinner at Graham's, prepared by a French chef, Buffett was served a lobster: \"Well, I unfortunately attacked it from the wrong side,\" he said. \"Of course, she was very reluctant to criticize me. Finally at some point she said, 'You know, it might be helpful \u2026' What did I know about lobsters?\"\n\nGraham died in 2001, and Buffett served as an usher at her funeral.\n\nAs for the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" the legendary investor is now 94 years old, still chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and still making front page news. Every word he utters has the power to roil the financial markets.\n\nWhen asked about the state of the economy today, Buffett demurred: \"Well, I think that's the most interesting subject in the world, but I won't talk, I can't talk about it, though. I really can't.\"\n\nAsked about how tariffs will affect the economy, Buffett stated, \"Tariffs are actually, we've had a lot of experience with them. They're an act of war, to some degree.\"\n\nI asked, \"How do you think tariffs will impact inflation?\"\n\n\"Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay 'em!\" he laughed. \"And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'\"\n\nDespite deflecting questions about the current news from Washington, or of Trump adviser Elon Musk's efforts to cut the government, Buffett did admit that he is bullish on American companies. \"A majority of any money I manage will always be in the United States,\" he said.\n\nAnd why is that? \"It's the best place!\" he laughed. \"I was lucky to be born here.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nThe documentary \"Becoming Katharine Graham\" is streaming via Amazon Prime\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\n\n\n\nStory produced by Julie Morse.

            "full_content": "Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux for New York Magazine\n\nBy shouldering his way into the mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo is betting that what New York voters want at City Hall is deep government experience, competent execution, and a mayor ready and willing to do battle with the Trump White House. His entry tests the political axiom that elections are about the future rather than the past.\n\n\u201cI think it changes everything and nothing at the same time,\u201d Laura Tamman, a professor of political science at Pace University, told me. \u201cAll of the folks who are currently running have assumed he\u2019ll get in the race; some of them have taken him on directly already. But at the same time, I think he\u2019s going to bring a focus and an energy to the race that we haven\u2019t seen yet, because New Yorkers know who he is, and they\u2019re going to respond to his candidacy.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s nearly 12 years as governor \u2014 not to mention four years as HUD Secretary and four as state attorney general \u2014 allow him to accurately claim to have far more experience than any of his rivals. But that also saddles Cuomo with more than a decade\u2019s worth of budget choices and half-forgotten projects, policies, political fights, and personal behavior that his opponents are already attacking.\n\n\u201cHe spent years treating New York City like his personal punching bag,\u201d said candidate for mayor Scott Stringer, the ex-comptroller, on social media. \u201cSlashing MTA funding and wrecking the subway while funneling money to upstate ski resorts, and trying to cut billions in funding for public school kids and Medicaid for city residents.\u201d\n\nUpstate ski resorts? Outside of chambers of commerce in the Catskills and Lake George, only a handful of government insiders remember that five years ago, Cuomo championed tax breaks for upstate lodges that installed renewable energy-powered lifts, snowmaking equipment, and other machinery. But a far more serious chapter of Cuomo\u2019s history is the barrage of sexual-misconduct and hostile-workplace accusations that forced him from office in 2021, and were backed up by findings from State attorney General Letitia James and the Justice Department under President Biden.\n\nWithin hours of Cuomo\u2019s video announcing his candidacy, the Working Families Party released a video, \u201cWomen Deserve Better,\u201d that features well-known women activists reciting misconduct allegations and calling Cuomo \u201ca bully and an abuser.\u201d Those voices are not likely to go away. Ditto for those who criticize Cuomo\u2019s handling of policies and information regarding nursing home deaths at the height of COVID and the $5 million advance he got for a book about the crisis that may have violated ethical rules by including work done by public employees.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, Cuomo\u2019s sizable lead over his rivals in recent polls is based in part on a record of accomplishments, including those memorable daily briefings during the COVID crisis, the successful fight to legalize same-sex marriage in 2014, and the completion of long-stalled public works projects, including the Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station, the expansion of the Second Avenue Subway, the rebuilding of an expanded Kosciusko Bridge (the city\u2019s first new bridge in 55 years) and the creation of a new terminal at LaGuardia Airport.\n\nCuomo is betting that a critical mass of voters will remember and reward his good deeds. \u201cWhen I wear my wedding ring and put it on every morning, the thought goes through my head that I wouldn\u2019t be able to wear it were it not for Andrew Cuomo,\u201d political consultant Jon Reinish told me. \u201cNot just people in New York, but for millions of people across the country, that memory is going to come back, and it\u2019s a really big deal.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s candidacy puts a spotlight on the central question of every municipal election year in New York: what are the main problems in the city that most urgently need fixing? For the last half century, each new mayor has been hired to fix a specific crisis that was caused, ignored or bequeathed by his predecessor.\n\nHere\u2019s how the shorthand, admittedly oversimplified, version of history goes: Ed Koch beat a crowded field in 1977 by promising budget austerity in the wake of the city\u2019s near-bankruptcy; David Dinkins unseated Koch in 1989 by proposing a calm, less divisive approach to community relations in the wake of high-profile cases like the Central Park Five debacle; and Rudy Giuliani beat Dinkins in 1993 by vowing to crack down on crime after New York hit an all-time high of more than 2,000 homicides in a single year.\n\nMike Bloomberg, elected mayor less than 90 days after the 9/11 terrorist attack, won when the city needed a businesslike approach to reviving the local economy and rebuilding Lower Manhattan; left-leaning activist Bill de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign was based on the argument that Bloomberg had built a prosperous city but neglected the needs of working families. And ex-cop Eric Adams was elected when the city\u2019s emergence from COVID was accompanied by a spike in violent crime that he vowed to reverse.\n\nCuomo\u2019s theory is that the main municipal crisis this election year is that Adams \u2014 plagued by massive high-level turnover and resignations \u2014 has turned out to be an ineffective leader who is too compromised as a criminal defendant to display the independence and forcefulness required to deal with President Trump.\n\nThe ex-governor has a case to make, but it won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\u201cEvery chief executive will have some accomplishments including Cuomo,\u201d Sal Albanese, a former city councilman who made his own run for mayor in 1997, told me on social media, describing Cuomo as \u201ca political mechanic with a ton of political baggage.\u201d I\u2019m not sure Cuomo himself would dispute that description. An image comes to mind of the ex-governor carrying a weathered, battered valise filled with a long list of allies, enemies, and tough decisions, slowly ascending the staircase into City Hall."

Mia Love, the first Black woman elected to Congress as a Republican, faces an increasingly grave prognosis as her condition has worsened while fighting an aggressive form of brain cancer, according to her daughter.\n\nPosting to her mother\u2019s X account Saturday, Love\u2019s daughter, Abigale Love, said that she and her mother\u2019s team have decided to prioritize being with her and keeping her comfortable at this time.\n\n\u201cSadly her cancer is no longer responding to treatment and the cancer is progressing,\u201d Abigale Love said.\n\nIn May, Love appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d to explain her 2022 diagnosis with glioblastoma brain cancer, or GBM. People diagnosed with GBM typically have just a year-and-a-half to two years to live, with only a 10% chance of survival after five years, according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nLove told Tapper she began receiving immunotherapy every three weeks since August 2023 as part of a clinical trial at The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University. Love discussed her hopeful outlook despite her then-prognosis of 10-15 months to live \u2013 which she has since surpassed \u2013 and how her Mormon faith has helped her persevere.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a cure in my faith and in science,\u201d she said. \u201cFunny thing is, my patriarchal blessing said you will have a long and prosperous life, a rich and rewarding life, so long as you decide to remain in public service.\u201d\n\nLove, who is 49, represented Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District from 2015-2019. She later joined CNN as a political commentator and was a rotating guest on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nLove offered a message of hope on Facebook last year to others who may be facing similar conditions.\n\n\u201cI recently shared details of my cancer journey with my friend Jake Tapper. It hasn\u2019t been an easy journey, but I share it because I want my journey to give others hope,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether you are facing a cancer diagnosis yourself, or fighting a different battle, there is hope! For me, that hope comes from my faith and my family. Both have been a source of immeasurable strength, peace, love, and support. Every day, I thank God for my life and a family who give that life beauty and meaning.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox sent well wishes on social media, saying, \u201cMia Love has served Utah with integrity, and her strength and grace continue to inspire us. Our hearts are with Mia and her family during this difficult time. Utah stands with you.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal judge ruled Saturday that the head of a government watchdog agency whom President Donald Trump is attempting to fire is entitled to remain in the post, setting up a dispute that will almost certainly be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe ruling from US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is a win for the head of the Office of Special Counsel, Hampton Dellinger, who sued the Trump administration over his firing in a case that has already gone to the Supreme Court once before. The latest decision removes some of the technical legal issues that complicated earlier appeals by the Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIt would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal.\u201d\n\nRuling otherwise, she said, would offer the president \u201ca constitutional license to bully officials in the executive branch into doing his will.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing the decision.\n\nDellinger\u2019s case may ultimately help to decide how much power Trump has to fire the leadership at independent agencies, many of whom are protected by federal laws that bar their dismissal absent neglect of duty or malfeasance. But until now, most of the legal wrangling has focused on procedural issues, such as whether certain temporary court orders can be appealed.\n\nJackson\u2019s latest decision will clear away some of those procedural hurdles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\u201d Dellinger said in a statement. \u201cMy efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\u201d\n\nThe US Office of Special Counsel is unrelated to special counsels like Jack Smith or Robert Mueller who are appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations. Instead, Dellinger handles allegations of whistleblower retaliation made on behalf of federal employees \u2014 including some who are also losing their jobs as Trump attempts to rapidly shrink the size of the government. Congress has made clear that the special counsel, created during the Carter administration, could be removed \u201cby the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d\n\nThe director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office fired Dellinger on February 7 in a brief email that cited none of those requirements, court records show.\n\nDellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2024 to lead the Office of Special Counsel for a five-year term.\n\nThe Supreme Court has considered the controversy once before, in the first case tied to Trump\u2019s whirlwind of activity to reach the high court since the president began his second term. Five justices agreed late last week to hold the matter in \u201cabeyance\u201d for several days. That decision essentially allowed the court to punt the case until a temporary order handed down by Jackson was set to expire.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "As \u201cEl Presidente\u201d of Barstool Sports, Dave Portnoy has seen more than his fair share of fights and disagreements. However, what he saw between President Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday made him think he was \u201cwatching Bravo TV.\u201d\n\nPortnoy devoted an entire video to his breakdown of the bizarre disagreement among world leaders that began \u2013 oddly enough \u2013 after a comment about embracing diplomacy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just here for the pizza reviews, keep it moving,\u201d Portnoy told his listeners. \u201cBut \u2026 I had to talk about this meeting with Zelenskyy. I posted on my Twitter [Friday]. I said [it was] the most surreal thing I\u2019ve ever seen in politics. Felt like I was watching Bravo TV.\u201d\n\nPortnoy correctly observed that everything at the meeting seemed fine until the end. He also outlined the stances of the camps supporting Trump and those opposing him.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re anti-Trump, you\u2019re basically saying, \u2018This is the worst day in the history of America,\u2019\u201d Portnoy said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically the same as Russia and a dictator and Putin and evil. And if you\u2019re pro-Trump, you\u2019re like, \u2018Finally, somebody sticking up for American citizens, American taxpayers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Barstool Sports founder noted the diplomatic failures of the Biden administration,\n\n\u201cThis previous administration, Biden has [called] Putin a killer, a dictator, all the things Zelenskyy says,\u201d Portnoy explained. \u201cAnd what has that gotten us? Hundreds of billions of dollars given to Ukraine, and they\u2019re really no closer to ending this war.\u201d\n\nIn another moment, Portnoy spent considerable time criticizing Zelensky for not being appropriately dressed to meet President Trump in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cYou can say whatever you want about Trump,\u201d Portnoy explained. \u201cHe takes signs of disrespect personally. He\u2019s very much about, you know, respecting other things. So, Zelenskyy shows up, and he\u2019s wearing his sweatshirt and his customary outfit, which is his way of essentially saying, \u2018I\u2019m at war. I don\u2019t have time to play politics or any other stuff.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor me, this is just stupid. We get you\u2019re at war, but you\u2019re coming to meet a new administration,\u201d he added. \u201d And it\u2019s just a sign of disrespect not to show the same level of respect (in) the Oval Office that Trump clearly thinks it deserves.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Portnoy stressed the need for Ukraine to show \u201cdeference\u201d to the country that has done so much to help them.\n\n\u201cThey should show some deference to or thank you to the American taxpayers. We don\u2019t have to continually foot this bill. But I respect or understand Trump not wanting to vilify Putin. The last administration did it every single chance they could get. It got us nowhere. Trump made it very clear he wants diplomacy. He wants to end the debt. He wants to end this war.\u201d\n\nPortnoy said, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily have the answers, but I think Trump and Vance handled this as well as they could. Like, we\u2019re not going to just get steamrolled by Zelenskyy at the expense of getting a deal done. And if that means we have to throw a couple flowers at Putin, so be it.\u201d"

The U.S. won that game 3-1.\n\nNHL STAR DISHES ON TEAM USA PLAYERS' AMERICAN PRIDE: 'HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM AMERICANS IN GENERAL'\n\nThe Canadian national anthem was then booed at TD Garden in Boston before a 4 Nations game between Canada and Finland.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada then met in the final Feb. 20, and American fans in Boston once again booed the Canadian national anthem, albeit with a lighter tone. Canada won the game in overtime, 3-2.\n\nSince then, hostile rhetoric between the two countries, including in sports, has only escalated.\n\nCanadian men\u2019s soccer coach Jesse Marsch blasted Trump for his \"51st state\" remarks, calling them \"insulting\" Wednesday.\n\nDuring CONCACAF Nations League media day Wednesday, Marsch didn\u2019t hold back his opinion on Trump\u2019s comments, saying he was \"ashamed\" of how Canada was insulted by the president.\n\n\"If I have one message to our president, it\u2019s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,\" Marsch said. \"As an American, I\u2019m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard we\u2019ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies. But one thing\u2019s for sure, when I look forward a month from now, this will fuel our team. The mentality we have, the will we have to play for our country.\"\n\nNHL legend Wayne Gretzky has also been criticized by fellow Canadians for his apparent support of Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump recently said he asked Gretzky to become the next \"governor of Canada\" after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning.\n\nBut after Gretzky expressed support for \"Canada remaining a separate Country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State,\" Trump declared Gretzky a \"free agent.\"\n\nThat prompted hockey legend Bobby Orr, a fellow Canadian, to write in the Toronto Sun that he was disappointed to read criticism about Gretzky, someone he considers one of the \"greatest Canadians ever.\"\n\n\"How fickle can people be, when someone who has given so much time and effort to Canadian hockey is treated in such a way,\" Orr wrote. \"Listen, we all have our personal beliefs as they pertain to things such as religion and politics. Wayne respects your right to such beliefs \u2013 why can\u2019t you respect his?\"\n\nJanet Gretzky, Wayne's wife, read Orr's column, and she reacted on social media.\n\n\"Thank you Mr. Bobby Orr. Your words mean the world to Wayne and his family , i have never met anyone who is more Proud to be a Canadian and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments . . He would do anything to make Canadians Proud , with his Love for Hockey and his Country,\" Janet wrote in an Instagram post in which she shared Orr's column.\n\nTrump agreed Feb. 3 to pause tariffs for 30 days, which means they\u2019re expected to be imposed in early March. The tariffs imposed on Canada by Trump are a response to drug trafficking at the U.S.-Canadian border."
