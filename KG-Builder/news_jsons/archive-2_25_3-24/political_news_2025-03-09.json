            "full_content": "When Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, declared bankruptcy in 2019, it had no debt and was worth more than a billion dollars.\n\nHow is this possible? Well Purdue was facing trillions in claims over its role in the opioid crisis, which has killed more than 800,000 Americans.\n\nPurdue, and its wealthy owners, members of the Sackler family, wanted a bankruptcy settlement to resolve thousands of lawsuits.\n\nThat massive settlement is now on the table, but after five years the legal battle goes on. The Sacklers continue to own Purdue Pharma \u2013 and, to this day, not a single victim has received any compensation.\n\nRyan Hampton: Bankruptcy's not about justice. That's what I learned in this process.\n\nCecilia Vega: What is it about?\n\nRyan Hampton: It's about money. It's about money. It's about who gets paid the most and who gets paid out in what order.\n\nRyan Hampton is one of the 140,000 people who filed a claim against Purdue, saying they or someone they love were harmed by its opioids.\n\nRyan Hampton: I received an absurd amount of medication-- from the doctors that I was seeing.\n\nRyan Hampton 60 Minutes\n\nHampton was 23 years old when he says he was prescribed OxyContin in 2003 for a knee injury.\n\nA one-time White House intern, Hampton says he quickly became addicted to the powerful opioid, lost his job working on political campaigns and became homeless.\n\nCecilia Vega: You lost a lot. You lost your home. You lost friends through all this.\n\nRyan Hampton: I lost my dignity. I lost my self-worth. I can remember many times on the streets and thinking, \"If this is all my life is, as long as I am able to get my fix, then I'm completely fine with it.\"\n\nWith treatment, Hampton overcame his addiction 10 years ago and began speaking out against Purdue and the Sacklers.\n\nHe was appointed by the Justice Department in 2019 to represent the financial interests of victims. For two years, he served on a committee of creditors in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case.\n\nAs part of that case, in 2020, seven Sacklers \u2013 all former Purdue board members or employees \u2013 were deposed.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): And the top-selling opioid at Purdue Pharma was OxyContin, correct?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler (during deposition): Yes.\n\nDr. Richard Sackler is a former president of Purdue who, in 2001, helped turn OxyContin into what was at the time the most prescribed brand-name narcotic for pain in the United States. In his deposition, he described the drug's benefits and was asked about its deadly risks.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Now, higher dose OxyContin was more expensive, but it was also more dangerous. Is that accurate?\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Objection. You may answer.\n\nDr. Richard Sackler (during deposition): It wasn't more dangerous for the patient than any other pill.\n\nDavid Sackler, Richard's son, helped manage the family's wealth, and also served on Purdue's board of directors.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): What responsibility does Purdue have to the hundreds of thousands of patients who are prescribed Purdue opioids and got OUD?\n\nOUD is opioid use disorder or addiction.\n\nDavid Sackler (during deposition): What responsibility does it have to them? These were-- these were defined risks on the label, and while we feel terrible for them, I think we've taken a dramatic amount of responsibility for them\u2026\n\nThis past January, the Sacklers and Purdue agreed to pay up to $7.4 billion to settle the bankruptcy case-- potentially one of the largest opioid settlements ever.\n\nAnd while that sounds like a lot, there are 140,000 claims alleging harm \u2013 and just about 10% of the total amount will go to victims.\n\nClaiming nearly 90% are creditors including: 48 states, thousands of hospitals, insurance companies, and top pharmacy chains \u2014 all of which say they too paid a price in the opioid epidemic.\n\nRyan Hampton: It felt like every major company under the Sun-- was coming for a part of Purdue.\n\nCecilia Vega: Billions of dollars, in some cases.\n\nRyan Hampton: Billions-- billions of dollars.\n\nCecilia Vega: Is this just a money grab?\n\nRyan Hampton: It is a money grab, you know? CVS-- they have a pretty massive claim in the bankruptcy. CVS was charged by the Department of Justice for knowingly filling-- suspicious opioid prescriptions-- as late as last year.\n\nCecilia Vega: You were on the inside. You were privy to a lot of information that had never been seen publicly. What did you learn that was most surprising?\n\nRyan Hampton: The most surprising fact for me was that victims were not first in line, but last in line-- because there were larger corporate and government interests that wanted to get paid first.\n\nCourt records show that lawyers, mediators and others have already pocketed nearly $1 billion paid by Purdue.\n\nForty one firms have so far been paid more money than victims are expected to get in the $7.4 billion deal, with senior lawyers representing the company charging as much as $2,645 an hour.\n\nRyan Hampton: It's sickening.\n\nCecilia Vega: Do you not see this as something that could help families? This could be the only recourse they have.\n\nRyan Hampton: Absolutely. But do I think they're getting a fair shake? Do I think that they're getting anywhere near what they're owed, it-- knowing that you can't put a price tag to that? No way.\n\nCecilia Vega: Is your sense that a lot of those folks might actually not receive payment?\n\nRyan Hampton: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: That's a kick in the gut.\n\nRyan Hampton: It is a kick in the gut.\n\nTo have a valid claim, many victims will need to show proof of a Purdue opioid prescription.\n\nThat means there are families who do not expect to get a dime in the settlement \u2013 like Pete Jackson and Emily Walden.\n\nEmily Walden 60 Minutes\n\nEmily Walden: I've talked to a lot of parents. I know a lot of people that have filed claims. And nobody wants their blood money. But do they have a right to it? Did they pay for a funeral? Did they pay for treatment due to the actions of that company and the Sacklers? Should they get that money back? Absolutely.\n\nWalden says her son, TJ, became addicted to opioids after taking OxyContin as a teen. He was 21 and in the Kentucky National Guard when he overdosed 13 years ago.\n\nTJ's death certificate lists \"oxycodone\" \u2013 the active ingredient in OxyContin and other prescription opioids \u2013 as a factor. But in the bankruptcy case, that may not be enough proof.\n\nEmily Walden: If it's on their death certificate, they should have a claim. That's not right.\n\nCecilia Vega: Why should someone who wasn't taking this drug as it was prescribed be eligible for any kind of compensation at all?\n\nEmily Walden: They knew they were making massive profits on putting these on the street. They knew that. Why would they not be held liable for that? You knew it was being diverted. And you let it go.\n\nPete Jackson's daughter, Emily, was 18 and days away from starting college in Illinois when she died in 2006.\n\nHer family says she took OxyContin for the first time while drinking at a sleepover with cousins.\n\nCecilia Vega: You've compared OxyContin to leaving a loaded gun on the table.\n\nPete Jackson: Emily was blindsided. She didn't know that one pill could kill you.\n\nCecilia Vega: One pill?\n\nPete Jackson: One pill.\n\nPete Jackson 60 Minutes\n\nJackson blames the death of his daughter \u2013 and countless others \u2013 on the way Purdue and the Sacklers marketed OxyContin, pumping up sales despite reports of widespread abuse.\n\nCecilia Vega: What would you want to hear from the Sacklers?\n\nEmily Walden: I don't want to hear anything. I wanna hear the jail cell door slam.\n\nCecilia Vega: What does justice look like to you?\n\nPete Jackson: Justice would look like a full trial of the Sacklers and Purdue. A criminal trial first and foremost.\n\nBut that is increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn the bankruptcy depositions, Marianna Sackler, Richard Sackler's daughter, claimed not to know whether Purdue's opioids have harmed anyone. Her job was to help Purdue market and sell OxyContin.\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): Many people have been harmed by opioids. I don't know that many people have been harmed by the opioids that Purdue sold.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Do you suspect that people have been harmed by opioids that Purdue sold?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): I don't know.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): So if I understand correctly, people have been killed by opioids, but you don't know whether any of them were sold by Purdue?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): Yes.\n\nPurdue the company has pleaded guilty to four felonies over three decades -- including that Purdue lied about OxyContin as less addictive and less prone to abuse than other pain medications, like in this promotional video:\n\nPromotional video: Less than 1% of patients taking opioids actually become addicted.\n\nBut to this day, no member of the Sackler family or Purdue employee has ever faced felony charges.\n\nRick Mountcastle 60 Minutes\n\nRick Mountcastle: Companies are not driverless cars. If a company commits a crime, that means there are people, executives, who have used the company or caused the company to commit that crime.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Rick Mountcastle led the four-year investigation that resulted in Purdue's 2007 guilty plea. His team reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents.\n\nCecilia Vega: You were ready to charge three top Purdue executives with felonies.\n\nRick Mountcastle: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: You were hoping they would roll on--\n\nRick Mountcastle: Absolutely.\n\nCecilia Vega: --their bosses?\n\nRick Mountcastle: Yeah. Were not only hoping, but we-- we figured it was a-- probably a good possibility.\n\nTheir bosses were members of the Sackler family, who for decades held a majority on Purdue's board of directors. But Mountcastle says the felony charges were blocked by his superiors at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nInstead, the three executives: Purdue's top lawyer Howard Udell, medical director Paul Goldenheim and President Michael Friedman, pleaded guilty to misdemeanors but denied having any knowledge of Purdue's crimes.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): [D]id the Sackler Family scapegoat these three executives?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler: (during deposition): Quite the contrary. We were very loyal to them.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): You were so loyal that you paid them millions of dollars in bonuses after they pled guilty to criminal charges?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler: (during deposition): We did make termination payments to each of them. I don't remember the amounts.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Would it surprise you to know that the amounts were $5 million to Howard Udell and $3 million to Michael Friedman?\n\nDr. Richard Sackler: (during deposition): No, it would not surprise me.\n\nRick Mountcastle: Decisions are being made, not based on the facts and what's in the best interest of the American people; these are decisions that are me-- being made based on politics and personal gain.\n\nCecilia Vega: You spent more than 30 years as a federal prosecutor. Where does--\n\nRick Mountcastle: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: --all of this leave your faith in the Justice Department?\n\nRick Mountcastle: I-- I-- I am greatly disappointed in the Justice Department because everything that the department has done since 2007 to today has been to protect the billionaires, the Sackler family.\n\nThe Sacklers maintain their innocence and have agreed to settle claims in the bankruptcy not as an admission of guilt \u2013 but to end years of litigation. The family will also give up ownership of Purdue, but their vast wealth remains.\n\nIn the years leading up to the bankruptcy, the Sacklers took about $11 billion out of Purdue, more than 70% of the company's total assets.\n\n60 Minutes asked to interview members of Richard Sackler's family but did not hear back on that request.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Do you have any-- experience any guilt from living off the proceeds, at least in part, of the sale of OxyContin?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): No.\n\nLawyer (during deposition): Do you believe that Purdue bears any responsibility for the opioid crisis in this country?\n\nMarianna Sackler (during deposition): No.\n\nPurdue Pharma told us in a statement that they are \"hard at work\" on finalizing the settlement and delivering billions to fight the opioid crisis \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nPrior to 60 Minutes' March 9, 2025 broadcast, which featured correspondent Cecilia Vega's report on the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case, we reached out to Purdue Pharma for comment on our story, \"The Settlement.\" The company responded to 60 Minutes with the following statement:\n\n\"We are gratified to have reached a new agreement with virtually all of the private and governmental stakeholders in these cases. The terms of the settlements are the product of intense work with our creditors, with a single-minded focus on delivering billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver overdose rescue medicines that will save lives. We are now hard at work fully documenting these settlements, including in a new Plan of Reorganization, which we look forward to presenting to the bankruptcy court. We are working to emerge as a public benefit company \u2013 100% devoted to improving the lives of Americans \u2013 as soon as possible.\"\n\nProduced by Natalie Jimenez Peel.

            "full_content": "President Trump is casting aside those who might stand in his way and among the first to go were at least 20 leaders of federal offices that were created by Congress to hold administrations accountable. You may not know it but, after Watergate, Congress set up a system to audit the executive branch and ensure the rights of federal workers. Those offices became known as watchdogs. Congress has guarded their independence from politics so that no president can use these powerful auditors to punish enemies or hide their own fiascos. But now, for the first time in 44 years, President Trump has fired these officials en masse. One of them is Hampton Dellinger, who has a warning about what America is losing as it's firing the watchdogs.\n\nHampton Dellinger: Going forward you're always gonna have now a person in my position who's gonna be dependent on the President's good graces. That is not how Congress set up the position, that's not how it's been for the past 50 years. But that independence, that protection is gone.\n\nScott Pelley: And the message that sends to the watchdog agencies in general is what?\n\nHampton Dellinger: I don't think we have watchdog agencies anymore. The inspector generals are gone. The head of the Office of Government Ethics is gone. I'm gone. The independent watchdogs who are working on behalf of the American taxpayers, on behalf of military veterans, they've been pushed out.\n\nBefore Hampton Dellinger was pushed out, he was head of the Office of Special Counsel\u2014no relation to the office of the same name that prosecuted President Trump. Dellinger's office is where federal workers can bring employment complaints. And where so called \"whistleblowers,\" government employees, can report wrongdoing.\n\nScott Pelley: So if a person sees fraud, for example, in the Department of Defense, and they're afraid of telling their supervisor because they think there will be retaliation, they go to you?\n\nHampton Dellinger: They can. And that was a decision not by me, but by Congress, that employees in the Executive Branch who are seeing something going wrong inside of an agency need a safe place to go that's still in the Executive Branch but that is outside of the agency.\n\nHampton Dellinger 60 Minutes\n\nAnd it works. A recent report said whistleblowers helped Office of the Special Counsel find $110 million that was owed to veterans and uncovered the overprescription of opioids at a VA clinic.\n\nDellinger is a Democrat, appointed by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHampton Dellinger: My job though was not partisan at all. And my track record I will stand on as someone who has played it by the book. I'm not looking to promote a president's agenda or thwart it. I'm just trying to make sure the laws are followed.\n\nScott Pelley: And you filed cases against the Biden administration?\n\nHampton Dellinger: Time, and time, and time again.\n\nDellinger's present term was supposed to run into 2029.\n\nScott Pelley: What was the first moment that you learned that you had been fired?\n\nHampton Dellinger: A Friday evening, when I got an email from someone I didn't know purporting to be with the White House who said, \"You've been terminated. Thank you for your service.\" And, of course, that email is just flatly inconsistent with the law, which says I can only be terminated for a very good reason. They didn't have a very good reason. They had no reason.\n\nScott Pelley: Nothing?\n\nHampton Dellinger: Nothing.\n\nThe law says there has to be a reason, specifically one of three, neglect, inefficiency or malfeasance. The termination email said none of that. So, Dellinger sued to keep his job.\n\nHampton Dellinger: I think every American respects the presidency. But I knew that this order, this directive, was unlawful. And ultimately we are a nation of laws. The only reason we have a president is because we have a supreme rule book, the United States Constitution. So as much as we all want the president to succeed it's gotta be within the framework of the law.\n\nBut the law may have been ignored just four days into Trump's term when he fired 17 inspectors general, all at once, without cause. The inspectors general or \"IGs\" for short, were auditors of top departments including defense, veterans affairs, and foreign aid at the U.S. Agency for International Development. Paul Martin was inspector general there.\n\nPaul Martin 60 Minutes\n\nPaul Martin: Over the years and over the decades, we've been independent, apolitical, nonpartisan watchdogs in our agency with the goal of improving the functioning of that agency, to save money, and to look out for the taxpayers.\n\nMartin policed billions in foreign aid spending. Trump shut down USAID early and in haste. In the chaos of mass firings emergency aid stopped moving. So, Martin did his job, writing an alert that warned that half a billion dollars in food aid might spoil or be stolen.\n\nPaul Martin: We issued the alert on a Monday. On Tuesday, I was terminated.\n\nScott Pelley: What did that tell you?\n\nPaul Martin: That someone read our report.\n\nScott Pelley: Have you ever been fired by a president before?\n\nPaul Martin: I have not been fired by a president before.\n\nScott Pelley: But some people watching these events say, \"Doesn't the president always bring in his own team?\"\n\nPaul Martin: He may bring his own team in, but there's been an agreement between Congress and administrations over the last 45 years that inspector generals are different. They're chosen to be apolitical, nonpartisan oversight officials in each government agency. And that has been respected from administration to administration.\n\nPaul Martin started in IG offices 25 years ago under Bill Clinton. He was inspector general for NASA in Trump's first term and then Biden's.\n\nPaul Martin: I have worked over more than six presidents, and I have never had a concern that issuing an audit or an investigation even with what would be perceived as negative findings could impact my employment.\n\nScott Pelley: In these first weeks of the Trump Administration what is happening to these oversight offices?\n\nAndrew Bakaj: They're being dismantled and effectively being destroyed.\n\nAndrew Bakaj is a former CIA officer and a lawyer who has written federal regulations protecting whistleblowers.\n\nDavid Kligerman: Now it feels like an intentional dismantling. They are going after the things that somebody who knows how to dismantle the system goes after and that's maybe perhaps the scariest part.\n\nDavid Kligerman and Andrew Bakaj 60 Minutes\n\nDavid Kligerman is a former State Department attorney. Together, they represent whistleblowers for the nonprofit group Whistleblower Aid. Whistleblower Aid represented a client in the first Trump impeachment.\n\nScott Pelley: What is the purpose of firing a Hampton Dellinger or the inspectors general?\n\nAndrew Bakaj: It's, in my opinion, to prevent the truth from coming out. The entire purpose of having a Hampton Dellinger or the IG system is to ensure that there's transparency within government.\n\nDavid Kligerman: This is removing the umpires. This is just taking the umpires out of the game. There's no place to go. If you can't go to the Special Counsel or they effectively neuter it, then there's nowhere for you to go. This is a very, very big deal.\n\nBut not a big deal according to the president. He told reporters on Air Force One that firing the watchdogs is\u2014quote\u2014 \"a very standard thing to do.\" He's wrong. No president has fired the heads of the watchdog offices, en masse, in 44 years\u2014that was Reagan when the offices were brand new\u2014and he rehired a third of them.\n\nScott Pelley: And the reason you were given for being fired was what?\n\nCathy Harris: Oh, no reason. The president gave no reason.\n\nWhy fire Cathy Harris? Possibly because she's on the federal board that hears appeals of fired federal workers-- the very people the Trump administration has been laying off by the tens of thousands. If she left, their avenue of appeal could be blocked at least temporarily. Harris is also fighting for her own job. For now, a judge has reinstated her.\n\nCathy Harris: I swore an oath to the Constitution when I took this job that I would fulfill my term through March 2028. And I believe very deeply in the civil service and in public service. And I just couldn't look myself in the mirror and walk away from this. I'm here to fight.\n\nCathy Harris fights for fired workers, often after receiving their cases from the office of Hampton Dellinger. In his final days on the job, Dellinger worked to restore employment of workers whom, he says, were fired by Trump, illegally.\n\nCathy Harris 60 Minutes\n\nHampton Dellinger: So much is lost. You're losing talent. You're losing experience. You're losing integrity. You're losing tens of thousands of military veterans who served our country in uniform, who put their lives on the line for America, and who came back enjoying the federal civilian work force. But putting aside all the losses, at the end of the day, it has to be done the right way. If you're gonna fire federal employees, you've gotta do it lawfully. And that's my concern, that these mass firings aren't necessarily in accordance with the law.\n\nIn February, Dellinger took on the case of 5,000 fired employees of the Agriculture Department. He passed their case to Cathy Harris and her appeals board. Harris stopped the firing, at least temporarily. The Trump administration is still in court to get Harris removed.\n\nCathy Harris: But you've gotta be able to be in this job and do what it takes to uphold the law and not be afraid. Not be afraid you're gonna be fired at any moment if you make a decision that somebody doesn't like.\n\nPaul Martin: I think the message to inspector generals is that the oversight of these programs, particularly if they're negative findings, is not welcome anymore.\n\nA message loud and clear now, according to former USAID inspector general Paul Martin.\n\nPaul Martin: It's not welcome in the administration, this administration, and it's not welcome in this current Congress.\n\nScott Pelley: What should Congress be doing?\n\nPaul Martin: Congress created the inspector generals and relied on, for the past 45 years, their findings, and their audits, and investigations to conduct aggressive oversight of any administration's programs. Since the firing of the inspector generals, there has been a deafening silence in Congress as far as pushing back.\n\nScott Pelley: Why are they not speaking?\n\nPaul Martin: Unclear.\n\nMartin worries that independence lost, might never be regained.\n\nPaul Martin: I'm afraid that we've moved on to-- an era in which every administration will come in and assume that they're going to replace all the inspector generals with people of their choice, that the secretary of treasury or the attorney general will get to pick his or her inspector general. And that will turn the independent IG system on its head.\n\nScott Pelley: If your office is beholden to the president, what is lost?\n\nHampton Dellinger: Independence, accountability, a safe place for federal government employee whistleblowers to come to and know that they'll be respected and protected. That's gone.\n\nOther watchdogs are suing to challenge the president's power but Hampton Dellinger is out. Last week, an order from an appeals court removed him. He told us that taking his fight to the Supreme Court would take months or a year\u2014and by then his whistleblower office would be devastated.\n\nScott Pelley: The Trump administration argued to the court that it needed to, quote, \"Put an end to Dellinger's rogue use of executive authority over the President's objections.\" What's your response to that?\n\nHampton Dellinger: If wanting the rules to be followed is the new definition of going rogue, then call me by that name. I don't think I was going rogue. I think I was being a good American who believes in the rule of law. That's all I was trying to do is make sure the laws are being followed.\n\nProduced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate producer, Alex Ortiz. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim.

            "full_content": "TORONTO \u2014 Former central banker Mark Carney will become Canada\u2019s next prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and annexation threat, and a federal election looms.\n\nCarney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote.\n\nCarney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.\n\nThe surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.\u201cWe have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,\u201d Carney said.\n\nAfter decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.\n\nCarney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.\n\nThe other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.\n\nCarney is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month."

            "full_content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) admitted to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk that the Democrats have taken wildly unpopular positions on certain issues \u2014 such as men competing in women\u2019s sports \u2014 but will continue maintaining such losing stances as a matter of \u201cprinciple.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind losing. Sometimes you lose on principle,\u201d the California governor told Kirk during Thursday\u2019s episode of the This Is Gavin Newsom podcast.\n\nListen:\n\nNewsom was specifically referring to his unwillingness to agree with Kirk that men should not compete in women\u2019s sports, arguing that for him it is a matter of \u201cprinciple,\u201d not politics.\n\n\u201cI deeply am mindful of the politics of this, which are very unhelpful personally, and unhelpful more broadly and professionally to the Democratic Party and our brand,\u201d Newsom added. \u201cThe Democratic Party brand has just been crushed.\u201d\n\nKirk replied, \u201cYour self-awareness is helpful to know because it is deeply unpopular, and I think that is an ascendant political force that is not going away.\u201d\n\nEarlier in their conversation, Kirk had urged Newsom to \u201cstep up\u201d and say \u201cno\u201d to male athletes participating in female sports, to which the California governor replied by admitting he \u201ccompletely agrees\u201d with the TPUSA founder \u201con the issue of fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply unfair,\u201d Newsom said, adding that, nonetheless, he cannot take the stance that biological men should not participate in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThe governor explained his position:\n\nOn the issue of fairness, I completely agree. So that\u2019s easy to call out \u2014 the unfairness of that. There\u2019s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide and have anxiety and depression. And the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well. So, both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue? But at the same time deal with the unfairness?\n\n\u201cYou asked a good-faith question: how do Democrats get out of the wilderness,\u201d Kirk acknowledged, before reminding Newsom that the left\u2019s stance on this topic is still wildly unpopular, stating, \u201cThis one is an 80/20 issue.\u201d\n\nNewsom conceded, replying, \u201cI agree with you, we\u2019re getting crushed on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in my own friend cohort, people say, \u2018What the hell is going on? Why aren\u2019t you calling this out? When did this happen?'\u201d the governor noted before reiterating that he cannot bring himself to change his stance on the matter.\n\nKirk informed Newsom, \u201cYou guys are giving us an 80/20 issue that is just permeating the country, and it\u2019s such an affront to our senses,\u201d to which the governor replied, \u201cI don\u2019t disagree.\u201d\n\nThe TPUSA founder went on to explain to Newsom that the difference between liberals and conservatives is, \u201cYou guys will tend to view an incident through an \u2018oppress or oppressed\u2019 lens,\u201d and \u201cwe, as conservatives, tend to view things through right or wrong, or just or unjust.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the country is going far more in our direction and away from your direction\u201d Kirk said. \u201cBecause the problem with \u2018oppress or oppressed\u2019 is eventually, you run out of oppressors, and you start creating them out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

We don't need cars from Canada. We don't need energy from Canada. We don't need anything from Canada.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And acknowledges the possibility of economic disruption.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There could be some disturbance, a little bit of disturbance.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The administration says it hopes the tariffs will pressure Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into the U.S.\n\nWe will ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem if it's working and we will get the latest on the president's mass deportation mission.\n\nCanada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, will also be here. We will ask her about the costs and consequences of the growing trade war.\n\nPlus, with just days to go before a possible government shutdown, lawmakers unveil a new bill to avoid it. We will hear from the co-chairs of the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi.\n\nFinally, Russia expert Fiona Hill, who served as a top National Security Council official during the first Trump administration, joins us to discuss Trump's diplomatic pivot on Ukraine.\n\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nWe begin this morning with the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem.\n\nMadam Secretary, good to have you in person. Thank you for joining us.\n\nKRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Yes, good morning. Thank you for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dive right into this trade war.\n\nThe justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75 percent in the past six months.\n\nDoesn't that show the existing system is working?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office.\n\nAnd I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is, how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels?\n\nYou've seen the president name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada just recently is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here.\n\nHe pointed to CBP data that showed a 97 percent drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, we're\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is the data accurate?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The data is getting better. And I would say, in the conversations that I have had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action.\n\nSo this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system, so that we know, when someone crosses that northern border, who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with.\n\nWe also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens.\n\nPresident Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction. But, boy, every day, people in this country are dying of overdoses. And I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be \u2013 if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do presumably to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary said on another network: \"If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it,\" meaning the president, \"they will stay on until he's comfortable.\n\nIs it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, I have had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do. So they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them.\n\nIf they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business. And he meant it when he ran to be president of the United States again and since he's taken office that he will put America first.\n\nAnd every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country, and where Americans can look forward to the future.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal? This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying this really is about fentanyl?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It really is about fentanyl. It really is.\n\nAnd I think the president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation.\n\nI think a lot of people don't understand the strategy\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing.\n\nThey are bringing this in, not just to make money. They're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you.Border crossings, they're at a 25-year low.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 U.S. military personnel working at the border now. That number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month.\n\nHow long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense.\n\nBut, also, we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the attorney general's office. You know, we're working every day with the secretary of state. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure. And we see all-time record lows of encounters. Our Border Patrol is doing fantastic work.\n\nBut we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country, where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore.\n\nAmericans have to live by the law. So do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to \u2013 excuse me \u2013 migration.\n\nThe administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children, in ICE detention centers. Bush did it. Obama did it. Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained.\n\nBut, remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a Web site where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't have a choice in this. You know that.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They \u2013 if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family.\n\nAnd we need to remember that when Americans break the law, and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It's that President Biden didn't follow the law.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You won't\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: He didn't follow the law, in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.\n\nAnd so, today, we're \u2013 we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan. They have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan. That was going to be another expansion of this team.\n\nThey have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law. And, if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: al Qaeda you want the number of deportations to tick up?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I do, absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: People, remember, they have an option to go home on their own.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that. And if they don't, and they end up coming into our enforcement opportunities that we have in front of us, you know, they may never get the chance to come back. So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you have a capacity issue right now in terms of just beds to put people in when you detain them. Are you going to open up military facilities like Fort Bliss?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: There is, yes, a plan to use the facilities at Fort Bliss for detention facilities.\n\nBut, also, we need to remember to ask \u2013 Congress needs to continue through with funding that this administration has asked for. You know, we clearly have a C.R. discussion in front of us this week. We have a reconciliation discussion. That reconciliation bill needs to happen. We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that \u2013 that we have.\n\nAnd even \u2013 everywhere I have been in this country out there, looking at what President Trump has done on immigration and border enforcement, the people that I meet are saying, thank you. Thank you for getting these terrorists out of the country. He has deported\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Terrorists?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 in just one month\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you deported terrorists?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 22 known and \u2013 terrorists on the terrorist watch list are out of this country now.\n\nWe have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month, and\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which have been redefined as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, 281 specific TDA members, which we know are the worst of the worst, have been taken out of this country.\n\nSo, everyone that has a story like Laken Riley's family or Jocelyn's family, they're extremely grateful that that won't be perpetuated amongst other families in other states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You said that you have found leakers within DHS and you're going to prosecute them.\n\nBack on February 9, you tweeted: \"The FBI is so corrupt.We will work with any and every agency to stop leaks.\"\n\nWere you wrong then to blame the FBI if the leaks were from within DHS?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: No, I think there's leakers all over throughout this government. I think that everybody needs to be\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What did they leak?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think these \u2013 in DHS specifically, these two were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and exposed law enforcement to vulnerabilities, to those ops being jeopardized, to where their lives would be in danger.\n\nSo they will be prosecuted, and they could face up to 10 years in federal prison because they did that. Anyone who is leaking information outside of \u2013 of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you're going to continue these polygraphing\u2026\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 of employees?\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The authorities that I have under the Department of Homeland Security are broad and extensive. And I plan to use every single one of them to make sure that we're following the law, that we are following the procedures in place to keep people safe, and that we're making sure we're following through on what President Trump has promised, that he's going to make America safe again.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you for your time today.\n\nSECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Thank you for having me.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Canadian officials are warning of retaliation against the U.S. over President Trump's tariff threats.\n\nSenior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe has the latest from Ottawa.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Well, Margaret, President Trump is now threatening tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber exports, even as he holds off on the broader tariffs on goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement until at least early April.\n\nThis has mostly been a war of words so far, rather than a war over the wallet, but that's going to change in the coming day, as Ontario is now threatening to tariff electricity it wires to Minnesota, Michigan and New York.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nDOUG FORD (Premier of Ontario, Canada): I'm going to put a 25 percent tariff on the electricity, the 1.5 million homes and businesses, as of Monday, until President Trump drops these tariffs.\n\nHe has to understand that he can't attack our country economically and expect us to roll over.\n\n(End VT)\n\nED O'KEEFE: It's not entirely clear how the cost of those tariffs would be passed on to American households.\n\nNow, we're here in Ottawa today because, amid the tariff war, there's also a Canadian transfer of power under way. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January he would be stepping down after nearly a decade. His ruling Liberal Party today anoints his successor.\n\nIt's a race between Mark Carney, an economist and the former head of the Banks of Canada and Britain, and Chrystia Freeland, a former Trudeau deputy. Whoever wins the race, Margaret, becomes prime minister and has to deal with President Trump and the tariff war.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Ed O'Keefe in Ottawa.\n\nWe're joined now by Canada's ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman.\n\nAmbassador, it's good to have you here.\n\nKIRSTEN HILLMAN (Canadian Ambassador to the United States): Thanks for having me, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the homeland security secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow-through on fentanyl.\n\nDoes that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I hope so.\n\nI mean, it \u2013 I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources. We have given our law enforcement new powers. And we have responded to the requests of the Trump administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China.\n\nWe've had some really, really good discussions. So we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know, fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days, we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States.\n\nSo we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal or just because President Trump believes in them?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are \u2013 we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border.\n\nThere are other tariffs that have been discussed, and the president has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and, you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said Friday he may put tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Monday or Tuesday. Here's what he said. Take a listen:\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250 percent. Nobody ever talks about that, 250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore.\n\nWe're going to be \u2013 they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. And that's what reciprocal means.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On another network, the commerce secretary said, no, that's actually on hold until April 2.\n\nIt's confusing for us to follow this along. Is the clarity with the two governments any better?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, we are in active discussions with Secretary Lutnick. And those discussions are heading towards April 2.\n\nAnd that, I think, is \u2013 we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And, you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question.\n\nThe president \u2013 the president does have a variety of concerns and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives. But, really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues, like, for example, lumber. Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free.\n\nOn dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So, what's more, I think, productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But Canada does put a tariff as high as 241 percent on dairy imports, but it's a sliding scale that only kicks in at a certain level, and that's under the free trade deal.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: And it's like the United States. In agriculture, the United States is the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: In sugar and dairy, you allow a certain amount of product in, and then, after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports. And we do the same to protect our farmers and families and, you know, small family farms that \u2013 that need to be sure that they can have a bit of the market.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, there was this 50-minute phone call Wednesday with the vice president, the commerce secretary and President Trump with your prime minister, Justin Trudeau.\n\nAfterwards, the president posted that Trudeau was unable to tell him when the election was taking place, which made him curious, like \u2013 quote \u2013 \"What's going on here? I then realized he's trying to use this issue to stay in power.\"\n\nDo you think this is, like, a personal issue here? Do you think it'll change when your leadership changes?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: It's hard for me to \u2013 hard for me to say.\n\nI think that the prime minister and the president, Prime Minister Trudeau and the president, they've done big things together, right? They did renegotiate NAFTA together.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They have a history together.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Right. They have a long history. They did good things together. They managed our 6,000 \u2013 practically 6,000-mile border during COVID very successfully, in my opinion.\n\nSo it's a long relationship, and has many \u2013 has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in, in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's prime minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it will stop the vows from the president to talk about threatening to annex Canada?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, I guess what I can\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What is that?\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: I \u2013 I \u2013 yes, I \u2013 I'm \u2013 I'm not sure what that is.\n\nWhat I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But, more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors, you know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in L.A., but obviously 9/11.\n\nYou've come to our aid over the years so many times. And we feel \u2013 Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack. And that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society. I think our new prime minister, when that person comes in, will prioritize trying to have a good and \u2013 and healthy and productive relationship with the president.\n\nI am sure that that's going to be possible. Relationships go both ways, but I know that, on our side, that's going to be a priority.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for joining us.\n\nAMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Thanks.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to another front in President Trump's trade war, and that's China.\n\nForeign correspondent Anna Coren is in Beijing with the latest.\n\nANNA COREN: A tone of defiance from Beijing this week, with China preparing for a protracted trade war with the United States, which it maintains will have no winners.\n\nIt announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products and targeted 25 American companies in response to the now 20 percent blanket tariffs President Trump placed on all Chinese goods.\n\nIn a press conference on the sidelines of the National People's Congress, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the country would fight back, despite economic challenges at home. And without naming President Trump, he accused the U.S. of being duplicitous in its relationship with China, saying:\n\n(Begin VT)\n\n(FOREIGN MINISTER WANG YI SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\n\n(End VT)\n\nANNA COREN: \"No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while maintaining good relations with China on the other.\"\n\nWell, earlier this week, his ministry used particularly aggressive language, stating: \"If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight until the end.\"\n\nWhile there's no doubt a trade war will hurt China's economy, it's had six years to prepare for this since a trade war began in 2018. And, Margaret, despite being open to negotiations, its decision to opt for defiance, rather than flattery, is a sign China won't back down.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Anna Coren in Beijing.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including an interview with the bipartisan co-chairs of the Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi, plus the latest on President Trump's push for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi, represents a district that went for President Trump.\n\nSo, you all have to find the middle. And that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place.\n\nBut I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick.\n\nThere is this potential government shutdown looming March the 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines or do you need Democratic votes?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it, like most bills. There's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we've got to make an accurate decision.\n\nI will say, you know, Tom and I are friends. We came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill.\n\nThe construct in this country is, if you get 218 votes, you get everything. If you get 217 votes, you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n\nSo, the reason that we do what we do is we want two-party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning, over the next 24 hours, what's in it and what's not in it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi, because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter that Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Everything's very fractured. Everything's very divisive. And to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together.\n\nIn the case of this CR, there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiation. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes and then people start negotiating.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Awhile, meaning we could be staring down a shutdown March 14th?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this. But it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We never want to shut the government down. It's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislator's funding off if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So, people need to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way.\n\nThen it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So, it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide, who's going to get blamed for this thing?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And wouldn't it be better if we all just worked together to try and find common ground the way we -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And I will add, Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down, surveillance teams get shut down. It is massive implications that most people don't realize. You never ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen. And it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who - now a congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over directives. He had been supportive of bureau leaders who resisted turning over the nations of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January the 6th, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the bureau. It was the best job I ever had in my life, and most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that worked there. They're a tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. At 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable. So -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked - she went at the FBI. The FBI director was -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, there have been conflicts at the top. I want - I want to differentiate. So, there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like - people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point.\n\nThe FBI needs to be completely nonpartisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in, so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms. And things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted, and I think, in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: About the firing for the political (INAUDIBLE)?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: On past - Director - Director Patel worked on our committee.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that - that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, obviously, we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well after he did his executive order to say, no, asylum applications are between the ports of entry. But we need to make it permanent law. And Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So, we need to secure the border, we need to fix the broken asylum system and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The two of you together?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I - I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Lutrell (ph) from Texas, very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this.\n\nNow Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus are taking those efforts and others and trying - and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about, you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: OK, but we -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Like, you're talking about really hard, substantive things.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, what's going to happen is the - Homeland Security is going to need money.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're - they're spending money like crazy and the CR is not going to fix the problem. And at some -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's going to go to reconciliation, party line vote, right?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: If - you can't fix everything through reconciliation. And you're going to need - and you can't - certainly can't fix asylum and you certainly can't fix the dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There is going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is, we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And if I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came into this country through other places, Italy, Ireland.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My father was born in Italy.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And for Brian (ph) Fitzpatrick, Irish as well.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And, you know, that's the - that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries, is, we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran. Everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage.\n\nSo, we can combine border security and the rule of law with being - bringing the best and brightest people into this country and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. And that's what America is about.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody. Everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: There's no, why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that doesn't know what they're talking about.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's an entire political campaign, why don't you just.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Right. Right. Which doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Just sit across from each other and say, well, I think this, well I think that, well how about this, well how about that, and you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Compromise is not a dirty word. And we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway, you guys are no good because you're one of those - no, you're on of those.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: It's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine and its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded U.S. Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence, and military support from Ukraine, advances strategic interests or helps make America great.\n\nCan you explain that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this, we're going to get a briefing - a full briefing on this, this coming week. But I will say this, key in on what's not being said here. What kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So, what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over the horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Possibly. But, second, we -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Maxar technologies cannot (INAUDIBLE).\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the U.K., to give you one example. There's no restriction on the U.K. sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So, what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, this that this an escalate to de- escalate tactic by the administration to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that. And I get asked, well, what does that mean?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Vladimir - what victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine. That he wishes he did not do that. And that's really going to be the test here, right, because if we reward dictators from invading sovereign, freedom-loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this plant that, if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelenskyy was elected by 73 percent of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election as dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelenskyy is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the secretary of state, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of, Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the U.S. Congress who ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's not - it's not a threat. What this is, is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II. When we had - when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world saying it's not our problem, we don't want to provoke, we don't want to escalate. And a problem that could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history where we had to send our young - our youth in our country to fight on Omaha beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history.\n\nThese dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. And World War II, freedom won over dictatorship. They want to relitigate that. So, we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this, just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova and think about Poland.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're all next. And we have to stand up against this.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that. He's telegraphed this punch.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, President Trump says, oh, it's all different when he's in charge.\n\nBut, Congressman, I need to ask you, before you go, because of the districts and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent, earlier this week we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes. We - we communicate -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because some have gotten quite heated recently.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No, I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with their constituents. And there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the - what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium, the protesters shows up, they hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups.\n\nSo, there's - it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different depending on - on where they're at.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that. Later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is, it was a strategic mistake on the part - on our behalf as well because instead of talking about Social Security cuts, and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts, and talking about the things that the president said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that makes no sense whatsoever, we, instead, focus too much time on disruptive behavior.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Was - was that message from Democratic leadership not clear then?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Let's not make the story about us, let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And we squandered that opportunity.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you, gentlemen -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: For doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You bet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine following the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence sharing and military equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones.\n\nFor more now, we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings and during the first Trump administration she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council.\n\nGood to have you back.\n\nFIONA HILL (Senior Fellow, Brookings and Fromer National Security Council Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs): Yes, thanks, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS. We also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine.\n\nWhat's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?\n\nFIONA HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks, and it's also not just blindsided but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies, like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the U.K., have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So, even if there is, you know, some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact.\n\nAnd, frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two-way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the U.K., Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence freely?\n\nFIONA HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it will be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this. Because if you're bundling together intelligence, then effectively the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our five eyes allies, for example, or with other allies, particularly in the midst of basically a conflict that is, as we've heard, you know, over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard because he's not just affecting Ukraine, again, it's having knock-on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt. Here's what he said.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's - I think he wants to get it stopped and settled, and I think he's hitting them harder than - than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?\n\nFIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yes, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the Resolute Desk. I mean,n I think that's what you can take away from this. He accurately -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president and when he says things?\n\nFIONA HILL: That's - I think you should. Yes. I mean, he's the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine - the Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelenskyy, that he sees them on the back foot as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards was the line. He kept using that.\n\nFIONA HILL: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. And when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine, he said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was, like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose, you got their attention.\"\n\nIt's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?\n\nFIONA HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office in front of all the cameras to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message.\n\nAnd I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should not only be speaking in your native language. And I think that a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that - I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points. But there's one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your - your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden. And President Trump immediately dismissed all of that and basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, or the commitments that were made because they were weak and it wasn't me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because it was not me.\n\nFIONA HILL: And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, what he learned there, was that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment. And that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand.\n\nAnd I think in the future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nFIONA HILL: Although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side on the United States side could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nFIONA HILL: So, my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters, that's what they're there for.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters?\n\nFIONA HILL: That's absolutely right, your own government's interpreters, no (ph), because you actually asked that question, who's interpreters were used and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.\n\nFIONA HILL: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent. An umbrella. That's - does that mean the transatlantic alliance is gone?\n\nFIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of a kind of a one-sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States.\n\nI was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nFIONA HILL: And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.\n\nFIONA HILL: But we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.\n\nFIONA HILL: That's correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of a security guarantee that was not delivered on.\n\nFIONA HILL: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, thank you.\n\nWe'll be back.\n\nFIONA HILL: Thanks.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for today. Thank you for watching. Until next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)"

Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi represents a district that went for President Trump. So you all have to find the middle and that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place. But I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, there is this potential government shutdown looming March 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines, or do you need Democratic votes?\n\nREP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday, compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it. Like most bills, there's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we got to make an aggregated decision. I will say, you know, Tom and I are friends, we came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill- the construct in this country is if you get 218 votes, you get everything, and if you get 217 votes you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So the reason that we do what we do is we want two party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning over the next 24 hours what's in it and what's not in it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi? Because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter, Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?\n\nREP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy. Everything's very fractured, everything's very divisive, and to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together. In the case of the CR there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiated. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while, and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes. And then people start negotiating.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A while, meaning we could be staring down to shut down March 14?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week. We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this, but it's- it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad? We never want to shut the government down. That's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislators' funding off, if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So people need to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way. Then it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide who's going to get blamed for this thing. And wouldn't it be better if we all just work together to try and find common ground the way- this is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process. And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: And I will add Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down. Surveillance teams get shut down. It has massive implications that most people don't realize. You never, ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen, and it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who- now turned Congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over a directive. He had been supportive of Bureau leaders who resisted turning over the names of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January 6, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the Bureau. It's the best job I ever had in my life, and the most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that work there. They are tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. In 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable, so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked- she went at the FBI- the FBI director--\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: -- Well, there are problems at the top. I want to differentiate. So there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like- people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point. The FBI needs to be completely non-partisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in- so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.\n\nREP. TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms and things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted. And I think in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politicization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: -- Absolutely, absolutely--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- About the firings of the--\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: -- Director Patel he worked on our committee. He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that- that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Well, obviously we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well, after he did his executive order to say no asylum applications in between the ports of entry. But we need to make a permanent law, and Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So we need to secure the border. We need to fix the broken asylum system, and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though? The two of you together?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Luttrell from Texas. Very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges, and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this. Now, Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus, are taking those efforts and others and trying- and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about- you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: -- Okay, but we--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN:-- you're talking about really hard, substantive thing--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Well what's going to happen is the Homeland Security is going to need money. They're spending money like crazy, and the CR is not going to fix the problem and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But that's going to go to reconciliation, a party line vote, right?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: You can't fix everything through reconciliation, and you're going to need- and you can't- certainly can't fix asylum, and you can't- certainly can't fix the Dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There's going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, Dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: If I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came in to this country through other places, Italy, Ireland--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: -- My father was born in Italy. And for Brennan and Fitzpatrick I got Irish as well.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK : You know, that's the- that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries. It's- we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran, everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage. So we can combine border security and the rule of law with being- bringing the best and brightest people into this country, and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. That's what America is about.\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody, everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just? There's no why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --That's an entire political campaign--\n\nREP. SUOZZI: --Right\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why don't you just\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Which doesn't make sense. And so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues, to sit across from each other say, well, I think this, well, I think that. Well, how about this? Well, how about that? And you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle. Compromise is not a dirty word, and we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway. You guys are no good because you're one of those. No you're one of those. That's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded US Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence and military support from Ukraine advances strategic interests or helps make America great. Can you explain that?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this. We're going to get a briefing, a full briefing, on this, this coming week, but I will say this key in on what's not being said here, what kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over-the-horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Possibly, but second--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Maxar technology--\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the UK. To give you one example, there's no restriction on the UK sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, is that this is an escalate to de-escalate tactic by the administration, to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that, and I get asked, well, what does that mean? Yep. Vladimir. What victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine, that he wishes he did not do that, and that's really going to be the test here, right? Because if we reward dictators for invading sovereign, freedom loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this planet that if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit, as co-chair of the Ukrainian caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelensky was elected by 73% of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election that's dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelensky is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the Secretary of State, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the US Congress who are ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: It's not a threat. What this is is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II, when we had- when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world, saying it's not our problem. We don't want to provoke. We don't want to escalate, and a problem that could have been could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history, where we had to send our young, our youth in our country, to fight on Omaha Beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history. These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. In World War II freedom won over dictatorships. They want to relitigate that. So we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.\n\nREP. SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova, and think about Poland, right? They're all next, and we have to stand up against this.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that he's telegraphed this punch.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN\n\nRight, well, President Trump says that it's all different when he's in charge, but Congressman, I need to ask you before you go because of the district and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent. Earlier this week, we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, we, we--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Because some of them have gotten quite heated recently.\n\nREP. FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No. I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with our constituents, and there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium. The protesters show up. They hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups. So there's- it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different, depending on- on where they're at.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is it was a strategic mistake on the on our behalf as well. Because instead of talking about Social Security cuts and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts and talking about the things that the President said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that make no sense whatsoever. We instead focus too much time on disruptive behavior and the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the US House of Representatives--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Was the message from Democratic leadership not clear, then?\n\nREP. SUOZZI: --I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message, let's not make the story about us. Let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it. And we squandered that opportunity. All right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen for doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well."

CBS News\n\nNoem, who was confirmed and sworn in as DHS secretary in late January, touted the administration's work on the border so far, saying \"we've seen incredible progress\" since Mr. Trump took office. She noted that the progress can be built upon, including by working with the Mexican government to \"make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border, and make sure we're going after these cartels.\"\n\nThe DHS secretary argued that due to the Trump administration's tariffs, imposed last week and later delayed on Canada and Mexico, \"we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.\"\n\nNoem stressed that the tariffs are about stopping fentanyl from entering the country, saying Mr. Trump is committed to making the country safer.\n\n\"The president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well, but this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation,\" Noem said.\n\nNoem also announced Sunday that Todd Lyons will be serving as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who she said has a long history with border czar Tom Homan. Madison Sheahan will serve deputy secretary, she said.\n\nAmid the administration's effort to crackdown on illegal immigration and pledge to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history, illegal border crossings fell to a 25-year low last month. Asked whether she plans to keep the 6,000 military personnel at the southern border, Noem said they'll remain \"until that border is completely secure, and we see all time record lows of encounters.\"\n\n\"Our border patrol is doing fantastic work, but we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore,\" Noem said. \"This is President Donald Trump's country where we have a border, where we have laws and it applies equally to everybody.\"\n\nStill, the administration faces a capacity issue, with a limited number of beds for detainees. Noem said there is a plan to use a military facility at Fort Bliss in Texas for detentions, while urging that the administration needs Congress to approve more funding for the operations.\n\n\"We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that we have,\" Noem said."

These decisions can be made in a way that doesn\u2019t require the entirety of the federal government to come in on top of that. You know what I\u2019ll just say to the American people here is that the Republicans, Trump in particular, he\u2019s trying to make this about safety, but it\u2019s not about safety and security of our kids. You know, I\u2019ve got a seven year old and a nine year old. You know, if it was about safety and security, then maybe we would have seen Trump and the Republicans do something about the 330 school shootings that we had last year, which I\u2019m terrified of having two elementary school kids, or about the 1 in 5 kids in this that goes to school hungry and isn\u2019t able to have enough food in their stomachs to be able to get through the day.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo it\u2019s not about safety and security. It\u2019s about politics and that\u2019s what I find just so offensive about this. As someone who is worried about the state of our education system, and we see this right now at a time when, you know, the President Trump is about to try to initiative to gut the entire Department of Education and trying to damage what I believe is a common good in this nation when it comes to our education. So that\u2019s something that I just really wanted to make clear. This is not about safety and security, it\u2019s all about the politics.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN"

            "full_content": "Remember \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the album? Even if you don't, now there's \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the musical, an exuberant blast from the past \u2013 old Cuban music for a new audience. The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.\n\nJustin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"\n\nA scene from the Broadway musical \"Buena Vista Social Club.\" CBS News\n\nThe true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.\n\n\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"\n\nI asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"\n\nWorld Circuit/Nonesuch\n\nThe unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.\n\n\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"\n\n\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"\n\nSinger-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"\n\nFrom the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)\n\nThe play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.\n\nMarco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.\n\nHe was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"\n\nNatalie Venetia Belcon as Omara Portuondo in \"Buena Vista Social Club.\" CBS News\n\nSaheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.\n\n\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"\n\nBrought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.\n\nPlaying yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.\n\nJuan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"\n\nServed up on Broadway: a feast.\n\nTo hear a performance of \"Chan Chan,\" from the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" click on the video player below:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Reid Orvedahl.

Hegseth told reporters in Germany in February that the Pentagon is \u201cnot in the business of climate change.\u201d\n\nActing Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Salesses also made it clear that funding would be cut in a statement last month, saying the Pentagon will \u201ccease unnecessary spending that set our military back under the previous administration, including through so-called \u2018climate change\u2019 and other woke programs.\u201d\n\nBut some officials and experts argue such thinking is short-sighted.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re stuck on the word \u2018climate\u2019 and not seeing the operational impacts,\u201d one US official said, adding that the cuts will pose \u201creadiness issues all around.\u201d\n\nIn response to multiple questions from CNN about military readiness as it relates to climate programs and the cutting of funding to research and other efforts, Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot said the Defense Department \u201cis working closely with DOGE to identify efficiencies and savings across the department on behalf of taxpayers while we restore the warrior ethos and refocus our military on its core mission of deterring, fighting and winning wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate zealotry and other woke chimeras of the Left are not part of that core mission,\u201d Ullyot said.\n\nDr. Ravi Chaudhary, former assistant secretary of the Air Force for energy, installations and environment, told CNN that climate programs are not just important to giving the US military an edge on adversaries like China, but they also help keep service members and their families safe.\n\n\u201cInaction at this point will put our readiness and the lives of our troops and their families at greater risk,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, officials who spoke to CNN pointed to a number of programs within the Defense Department that could technically be tagged as climate-related but have real operational impacts on the military.\n\nMaking military installations more resilient to extreme weather events, for example, could save the Pentagon billions in the long term as wildfires and hurricanes become more common and more intense. In 2019, the Air Force requested $5 billion to rebuild two major bases after hurricanes and flooding caused severe damage.\n\nIn this October 2018 photo, a soldier stands guard at the damaged entrance to Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida, in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael. David Goldman/AP/File\n\nExtreme weather also impacts the ability of service members to train \u2013 one Senate aide familiar with the discussions around climate programs in the Pentagon told CNN there has been an increase of \u201cblack flag\u201d training days, meaning troops cannot train because it\u2019s too hot outside.\n\nChaudhary pointed to an array of other issues caused by changes in climate: Wildfires delaying launch cadences at Space Force bases in the US; melting permafrost in Alaska impacting US runways in the Arctic; building natural and artificial reefs around US installations to protect bases from storm surges; and energy efficiency efforts by the Air Force to reduce drag on US aircraft and save millions on fuel.\n\nWill Rogers, the former senior climate adviser to the secretary of the Army who is now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, also warned the rhetoric coming from senior officials disparaging climate-related efforts could have a \u201cparalyzing effect on critical modernization efforts\u201d related to climate, the impact of which could be felt \u201cfor years.\u201d\n\nOpportunities for China\n\nOutside of protecting US military installations and personnel, sources also warned that ignoring climate issues could damage the US\u2019 national security interests abroad.\n\nChaudhary and the Senate aide both pointed to China\u2019s willingness to fill any gaps left by the US, particularly with Pacific island nations that often consider climate change one of the most pressing threats facing their existence. A former senior Pentagon official told CNN that climate change is a top priority for many Pacific islands \u2013 many of which the US will depend on for facilities such as airplane runways and ports in the scenario of conflict with China. And if the US is unwilling to help those countries with climate resiliency, China will be more than happy to step in, the former senior official warned.\n\nRogers said that concern exists not only in the Pacific, but also in the Horn of Africa and Central and South America.\n\n\u201cIf we say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not interested in climate change,\u2019 our adversaries or near peer competitors \u2013 whatever you want to call them \u2013 are more than happy to slide into [partners\u2019 and allies\u2019] DMs and offer funding at our detriment,\u201d the Senate aide said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just efforts being directly carried out by the Defense Department at risk; Pentagon leadership has also narrowed in on funding for academic research related to climate change and security issues abroad.\n\nIn a video posted on X last week, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell named programs that Musk\u2019s DOGE had identified as wasteful spending within the Degense Depatment.\n\n\u201cHow about this one: $1.6 million to the University of Florida to study social and institutional detriments of vulnerability in resilience to climate hazards in African Sahel,\u201d Parnell said in the video. \u201cYou see folks \u2013 this stuff is not a core function of our military. This is not what we do, this is a distraction from our core mission.\u201d\n\nThe project in question \u2013 more accurately called Social and Institutional Determinants of Vulnerability and Resilience to Climate Hazards in the African Sahel \u2013 does study climate change. But it specifically focuses on how people in the African Sahel could respond, and the risks it could pose not only to their population but also to the security of nations around them.\n\nGirls carry water on their bicycles at a dispensary in Nedogo village near Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in the African Sahel region, in February 2018. Luc Gnago/Rueters\n\n\u201cOur project was attempting to understand how people are responding and with what consequences, right? I mean, if people starve, that\u2019s really bad, obviously \u2026 but if you\u2019re the US government and thinking in totally narrow self-interested terms, it\u2019s also bad if people join radical groups because they are desperate, or migrate en masse to other areas and put pressure on refugee camps and borders or governments,\u201d said Leonardo Villal\u00f3n, the lead investigator of the project and founder of the University of Florida\u2019s Sahel Research Group.\n\n\u2018No communication\u2019\n\n\u201cThere was absolutely no question, no communication, no nothing about it ahead of time,\u201d Villal\u00f3n said. \u201cSo had someone reached out and said could you please explain to us what you\u2019re doing and why this is worth doing, I would have happily spoken to anybody.\u201d\n\nVillal\u00f3n added that despite Parnell\u2019s insinuation that the Pentagon was saving $1.6 million by cutting the program, the majority of their grant had already been spent over the last few years as he and his team conducted research, traveling to the countries they were studying \u2013 which included Senegal, Niger, Chad and Mauritania \u2013 conducting interviews and surveys.\n\n\u201cIn our case,\u201d he said, \u201cthey saved no more than $200,000.\u201d\n\nThe funding was provided under the Minerva Research Initiative, a Defense Department program launched in 2008 that provides academic grants to further social science research on topics \u201cof strategic importance to the US national security policy,\u201d its website previously said. As of Friday, the Minerva Research Initiative\u2019s website was offline.\n\nVillal\u00f3n told CNN last week that multiple other climate-related research initiatives had their funding cut off. A Defense Department news release Friday afternoon said the Pentagon was \u201cscrapping its social science research portfolio,\u201d including research focused on \u201cglobal migration patterns, climate change impacts, and social trends.\u201d The release said the Defense Department expects to save \u201cmore than $30 million in the first year through the discontinuation of 91 studies.\u201d\n\nUltimately, that research is meant to help the Pentagon get ahead of major events that could have serious security side effects, Villal\u00f3n said.\n\n\u201cWe live in a very interconnected world, and the US, like everybody else, has an interest in preventing areas of significant instability and suffering that have repercussions for the rest of the world. \u2026 What we\u2019re trying to do is understand the situations in these places on the premise that a not knowing about it is going to come back and bite us, frankly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have learned that elsewhere in the world \u2013 whether it\u2019s in Central America, Afghanistan, or other places \u2013 we don\u2019t gain by not understanding other parts of the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIgnorance is not a solution.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Editor\u2019s Note:This analysis was originally published in CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in America newsletter. Read past issues and subscribe here.\n\nJD Vance is a different kind of vice president.\n\nHe\u2019s not the Machiavellian master of Washington who works in the shadows \u2013 like Dick Cheney. Neither is he the safe pair of foreign policy hands \u2013 like a George H.W. Bush or Joe Biden.\n\nThe youthful Vance seems instead to have fashioned himself as the personification of his boss Donald Trump\u2019s most extreme social media posts. His provocation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week ignited a diplomatic crisis. He relished traveling to Munich to insult America\u2019s European allies. And Vance was front-page news in Britain after saying Ukraine needed better security guarantees than those offered by \u201csome random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d Vance later said it was \u201cabsurdly dishonest\u201d to say he was talking about Britain and France \u2013 but those were the only allies to publicly volunteer for a Ukraine peace force.\n\nVance knows which way the wind is blowing in the Republican Party. That\u2019s why he ditched his contempt for the President \u2013 after reportedly wondering in 2016 whether Trump might be America\u2019s Hitler. Now, in a party that worships its leader, the vice president is one of the president\u2019s most prominent public admirers.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the infamous Oval Office clash with Trump and Vance in Washington, DC, on February 28. Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nBut Vance is a fascinating character. He rose from a hard scrabble upbringing in the Appalachians to the Ivy League. He\u2019s exceedingly smart \u2013 one reason why his political positioning is often taken as evidence of nefarious calculation. Vance, who briefly served as an Ohio senator, despises traditional media and Washington elites so he\u2019s a natural fit with Trump\u2019s populism. He\u2019s also a US Marine veteran \u2013 so he ought to know better about the contribution of US allies to the war on terror. And he got rich in Silicon Valley and has an in with the big tech barons who\u2019ve moved sharply to the right and embraced Trump in his second term.\n\nThe vice president made his name with \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d a memoir about his childhood in deprived areas of Ohio and Kentucky. The 2016 book explained how deindustrialization fostered poverty and drug addiction and an eventual political backlash against globalized free trade policies. It became a kind of handbook for understanding Trump supporters in his first term.\n\nGiven that background, it\u2019s not surprising that Vance produced the campaign\u2019s most eloquent arguments for an America First economic policy. At 40, he\u2019s a potential heir to Trump \u2013 although the president amusingly refused to anoint him in a recent Fox News interview, unwilling to think about ceding his throne so soon.\n\nVance is the epitome of what many Europeans disdain about America. An isolationist, he sees no vital national interest in Ukraine. His bluntness and hint of smugness irk many foreigners, as does his support for Europe\u2019s far-right \u2013 including Germany\u2019s extremist AfD. A day before confronting Zelensky in the Oval Office, he rebuked Keir Starmer over free speech in the UK \u2013 although the British PM shut him down.\n\nSince Vance is young, ambitious, ideological, and has an apparent chip on his shoulder about establishment intellectuals, there\u2019s one vice president he does remind us of \u2013 Richard Nixon.\n\nWhen Nixon joined Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s ticket in 1952, he\u2019d spent about enough time in the Senate to have a cup of coffee \u2013 just like Vance. And like his 21st century successor, he was a new breed of GOP ideologue \u2013 while the current VP upbraids \u201cwoke\u201d liberals, Nixon hounded supposed communists living in the United States. And like Vance, Nixon had his eye on higher things. His ambitions and penchant for the dark side of politics sometimes caused tensions with his more experienced boss \u2013 a possible omen for the relationship between Trump and Vance.\n\nA tight-lipped outgoing President Harry Truman stands at left as Richard Nixon, right, raises his right hand to be sworn in as vice president of the United States by Sen. William Knowland of California on January 20, 1953, in Washington, DC. WF/AP\n\nNixon used his eight-year vice presidency as a crash course in global affairs that was key to his success as a statesman after he finally won the big job in 1968. Vance however seems unlikely to emulate Nixon\u2019s long global odysseys \u2013 he has political interests back home.\n\nBut don\u2019t underestimate Vance. He\u2019s risen high and fast. But will hubris lead him to fly too close to the sun?\n\nCanadians are about to get a new prime minister\n\nThe Liberal Party will elect a successor to its unpopular leader Justin Trudeau on Sunday and that person will quickly replace him as prime minister. The favorite is Mark Carney \u2013 the former governor of the banks of Canada and England. Former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, whose resignation was instrumental in Trudeau\u2019s fall, hopes to beat him to the top job.\n\nSuddenly, the Liberal leadership looks worth having. Trump\u2019s trade blitzkrieg and demands for Canada to become the 51st state have transformed politics north of the border. Trudeau\u2019s party once looked doomed to defeat by Pierre Poilievre\u2019s Conservative Party in an election due by the fall. But Poilievre\u2019s Trumpy themes left him exposed and Liberal\u2019s deficit in the polls has evaporated.\n\nThe big question now is what is next? Carney doesn\u2019t currently have a seat in parliament, so will have to seek one at the earliest opportunity in a by-election if he becomes PM.\n\nBut might he take a gamble and try to exploit an explosion of patriotism and antipathy towards Trump by calling a snap general election? If he were to lose, he\u2019d become a political punchline. But fortune favors the brave \u2013 and this may be the Liberals\u2019 only chance of a shock rebound."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUsha Vance is a private person in a very public job.\n\nWith her husband JD Vance\u2019s rapid political elevation to President Donald Trump\u2019s second-in-command, she stepped away from a successful legal career and into an unelected and ceremonial role that comes with no manual, an automatic global platform, and plenty of scrutiny from the American public and the media.\n\nShe faces her first test this weekend. After not speaking publicly or participating in any media interviews in the seven weeks of the Trump administration, Usha Vance is embarking on her first major solo trip as second lady, leading the US delegation to the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Turin, Italy, where she is joining athletes, coaches, families and fans in cheering on Team USA. She attended the opening ceremony on Saturday.\n\nShe\u2019s already joined the vice president for a high-stakes trip to Europe, appearing by his side in France and Germany and joining him for meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And behind the scenes, a source familiar told CNN, the second lady is assembling a small team of staff, transitioning her three children to life at the Naval Observatory, and settling into the role, for which she will have her own platform and responsibilities.\n\nWhat those will be, however, remains a mystery.\n\nAs the 39-year-old former Supreme Court clerk contemplates the platform and impact she hopes to have, Vance is described by people who know her as thoughtful, whip-smart and decisive. She is also extremely guarded. CNN reached out to dozens of friends, colleagues and family members; none agreed to speak on the record about her.\n\nWhile JD Vance has emerged as the president\u2019s attack dog \u2014 his interjections, for example, escalated Trump\u2019s Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 his wife has largely stayed under the radar.\n\nBut being a top figurehead in a new administration alongside first lady Melania Trump, who has taken her own approach to the spousal role, is a delicate dynamic she\u2019ll have to navigate.\n\nUsha Vance has appeared with the first lady at major events such as the inauguration and the president\u2019s address to Congress, but it is unclear whether they have substantively engaged, as Melania Trump spent four weeks away from Washington at the start of the new administration.\n\nAsked by Fox News during the campaign whether she had spoken with the first lady about the role, Vance sidestepped the question, saying she had received advice \u201cfrom various friends who found themselves unexpectedly in the spotlight, or, you know, honestly, just faced crises or other situations that really changed their plans for their lives.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for the first lady and second lady did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on their relationship.\n\nWho is Usha Vance?\n\nVance is the youngest second lady to hold the role since the Truman administration and the first to raise school-age children at the Naval Observatory since the Clinton era.\n\nBorn and raised in San Diego by parents who emigrated from India, Vance is also the first person of color to be second lady.\n\n\u201cThat JD and I could meet at all \u2014 let alone, fall in love and marry \u2014 is a testament to this great country,\u201d she said in remarks to the Republican National Convention in July, saying that her husband \u201capproached our differences with curiosity and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nVance attended Yale University, where she majored in history and spent her time outside the classroom tutoring local students, volunteering with the homeless and studying ballet. She spent a year after graduation teaching in China, then earned a prestigious Gates Scholarship to Cambridge University to pursue a master\u2019s in philosophy.\n\nBut it was back at Yale where she met JD Vance, a fellow law school classmate.\n\nRepublican Senate candidate JD Vance, left, hugs his wife Usha Vance, as he prepares to speak to supporters during an election night watch party on May 3, 2022, in Cincinnati. Aaron Doster/AP\n\n\u201cWe were friends first, because \u2014 I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with JD? He was then, as now, the most interesting person I knew. A working-class guy who had overcome childhood traumas that I could barely fathom,\u201d she said during her RNC speech.\n\nAfter their 2013 graduation, the Vances married in June 2014, and JD Vance\u2019s bestselling memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d was published two years later.\n\nLike her husband, Usha Vance appears to have made her own political shift. According to public records, she was a registered Democrat from 2010 until 2014, but clerked for then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 2014 to 2015, and then for conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts from 2017 to 2018.\n\nPressed on her husband\u2019s previous comments disparaging Trump and asked how she felt about the GOP nominee during an August Fox News interview, Vance expressed muted support.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t feel that the ticket, the Trump-Vance ticket, was able to do some real good for the country, then I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she told host Ainsley Earhardt.\n\nIn the spotlight\n\nWhen her husband was selected as Trump\u2019s running mate, Vance resigned from her law firm, where she worked on complex civil litigation, and became a frequent presence at his side on the campaign trail. A noted bookworm, Vance was often observed with her latest read in hand, telling NBC News that she was reading the epic \u201cThe Iliad\u201d to keep up with her oldest son, who was \u201cobsessed with mythology.\u201d\n\nThe Vances\u2019 three small children, Ewan, 7, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3, have also often been along for the ride, including on their February trip to Europe.\n\n\u201cGiving them a stable, normal, happy life and upbringing is something that is the most important thing to us,\u201d Usha Vance told Earhardt during the campaign.\n\nVance has described her advisory role to her husband as the truth-teller.\n\n\u201cI just think he deserves to have someone in his life who hears it straight from him,\u201d she said in the Fox News interview, later adding, \u201cHe treats everything I say with a lot of seriousness and respect. And that becomes a part of the way that he thinks about things.\u201d\n\nUsha Vance speaks on the third day of the Republican National Convention on July 17, 2024, in Milwaukee. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nFor his part, JD Vance credits his wife with encouraging his authenticity.\n\n\u201cThe best advice she gave me when it came to politics is \u2018Don\u2019t let them filter you.\u2019 And in politics, you know, you got consultants, and you got media professionals, you\u2019ve got pollsters, you\u2019ve got a lot of people who try to tell you what to say or how to behave or you know what to do. And Usha just said, \u2018Just be yourself. Be authentic,\u2019\u201d he said during a recent appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nTaking her advice, the vice president joked, has its limits.\n\n\u201cOne piece of advice she gave me, like, a week ago, was \u2018You should be nicer on social media.\u2019 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll take that advice,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nAn \u2018unnatural, natural relationship\u2019\n\nUsha Vance has yet to unveil any key priorities, and speaking to NBC News days before the election, offered scant clues about her interests or goals for her work as second lady.\n\n\u201cThis is such an intense and busy experience that I have not given a ton of thought to my own roles and responsibilities. It\u2019s just something that I\u2019ve never really \u2014 it\u2019s not something I\u2019m terribly familiar with,\u201d Vance told NBC at the time.\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd so I thought, what would I do? See what happens on November 5, and collect some information myself and take it from there. There are certainly things I\u2019m interested in, but I don\u2019t really know how that all fits into this role.\u201d\n\nHer most recent predecessors have approached the amorphous role in different ways. As second lady, Jill Biden kept her job as a teacher, but found ways to support education and military families, launching the \u201cJoining Forces\u201d initiative alongside then-first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nKaren Pence took an active role amplifying an initiative on art therapy, and also continued to work, teaching elementary art at a nearby school.\n\nJD Vance, Vice President Kamala Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Usha Vance arrive for inauguration ceremonies at the White House on January 20, 2025. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff made history as the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president, finding his voice in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel as he sought to speak out against rising antisemitism. During the presidential transition, Emhoff and Vance \u2014 both of whom left legal careers to support their spouses as vice president \u2014 spoke by phone for about 45 minutes.\n\nVance will also have to navigate the \u201cunnatural, natural relationship\u201d between first and second ladies, according to Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist and author who has chronicled America\u2019s first families.\n\n\u201cPresidents and vice presidents and first and second ladies are going to naturally be put together as a foursome \u2014 but it\u2019s completely unnatural. The two spouses are different people with different backgrounds, and in some cases, don\u2019t like each other,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThat was the case for Karen Pence and Melania Trump, Bennett reported in her 2019 biography of the first lady, \u201cFree, Melania.\u201d\n\n\u201cKaren Pence and Melania Trump never really got off on the right foot and stayed that way,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThe difficult dynamic between the two was on display as they traveled together. Pence was not invited to sit in the first lady\u2019s cabin on her plane, seated instead with staff. And more recently, four years after Donald Trump\u2019s supporters called for Mike Pence to be hanged at the US Capitol, Karen Pence kept her head down as both Trumps arrived at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter, declining to exchange pleasantries.\n\nVance, Bennett said, \u201cis very different from Melania Trump in terms of background, career and stage of life. It\u2019s going to be interesting to watch how they work together.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Barry Williams/New York Daily New/TNS/Getty Images\n\nOn her first day as a candidate for mayor, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams signaled she\u2019s not necessarily going to play nice with the seven men already competing for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cThere are people that have truths that have yet to be told,\u201d she said, somewhat ominously, when I asked if she believed any of her rivals had issues that should disqualify them as candidates. \u201cI am not here to judge anyone, but I am here to make sure that all that sexual misconduct and all of that is not a thing that we carry into the future, but something that we will look upon the past not to repeat,\u201d she told me.\n\nThat was an unmistakable reference to the three candidates for mayor \u2014 ex-governor Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Eric Adams, and ex-comptroller Scott Stringer \u2014 who have been sued in civil court for sexual harassment or sexual assault in recent years. All three strenuously deny the allegations, and Cuomo and Stringer have countersued their accusers for defamation, leaving voters with a batch of incomplete court cases to sort through.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s rationale for running \u2014 she plans to campaign simply as Adrienne to avoid being confused with the mayor \u2014 is that the city is in dire straits.\n\n\u201cCity Hall has been shaken. We have a president in Washington right now that is just spewing chaos all over the nation. New York has a target on its back. I cannot sit back and do nothing about it,\u201d she told me.\n\nOn a policy level, she is promising a straightforward expansion of affordable housing stock, building on legislation she shepherded through the council that makes it easier to get projects zoned and financed. She also plans to approach public safety at the precinct level, building trust between cops and communities, and is committed to dramatically expanding services and facilities for homeless and mentally ill New Yorkers.\n\nPolitically, Adrienne\u2019s arrival is the surest sign yet that Eric Adams is losing the battle for Black voters, who supplied his base and margin of victory in 2021. Back then, Adams had the support of 43 percent of Black voters in the closing days of the Democratic primary \u2014 by far the strongest backing of any ethnic or racial group for any candidate that year. It helped that the other Black hopefuls in the crowded field that year \u2014 Maya Wiley, Ray McGuire, and Diane Morales \u2014 were first-time candidates struggling to build name recognition.\n\nFour years later, Eric Adams faces a much tougher situation. Two of his Black challengers, state senator Zellnor Myrie and Adrienne Adams \u2014 are experienced campaigners, and so is Cuomo, an ex-governor who has always been popular with Black voters. Other Black political leaders, embarrassed by Adams\u2019s legal problems and exhausted by the unprecedented level of resignations of top commissioners and City Hall aides, are actively seeking alternatives, despite pointed, dismissive references by Adams to Black critics as \u201cNegroes.\u201d (\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d he spat at his enemies at a recent Black History Month commemoration.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not just political leaders who are done with supporting Adams. The latest Quinnipiac University poll shows that 60 percent of Black voters disapprove of his performance, while 24 percent approve.\n\nThat high level of discontent is echoed by Myrie, who represents Adams\u2019s former district in Brooklyn and is now running against the mayor. \u201cThere is a particular sensitivity Black New Yorkers have watching Eric Adams be embarrassed on national television by Trump\u2019s border czar,\u201d Myrie told the New York Times, referring to a disastrous Fox News appearance in which Tom Holman, the Trump official leading the mass-deportation effrontery, openly threatened Adams that he would show up at City Hall and \u201cbe up his butt\u201d if the city did not cooperate on immigration matters. The interview, said Myrie, caused \u201cshame that the second Black mayor in our city\u2019s history can so obviously be played for a fool for the country to see, disappointment in his lack of integrity in this moment and pain knowing how far back this sets Black leadership.\u201d\n\nAnother crack in the dam came when former state comptroller H. Carl McCall, who in the 1990s became the first Black candidate ever elected statewide, publicly came out for Cuomo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard from Eric since I endorsed him almost four years ago. But he simply is not up to the job now,\u201d McCall told me. \u201cHe\u2019s in trouble, and he\u2019s trying to stay out of jail, and he\u2019s made this terrible agreement with the president. We don\u2019t even know what the agreement is, but we do know that the president is going to enforce the agreement.\u201d\n\nMcCall also dismissed the argument that his contentious 2002 primary fight against Cuomo contained racial overtones.\n\n\u201cAndrew might not make as many friends as we would like to see, but he gets things done,\u201d said McCall. \u201cI was in a position where I could dispel this idea that because Andrew Cuomo ran against me, that Black folks shouldn\u2019t support him. I wanted to take that silly race issue off the table. That should not be what we look at. We should look at what kind of leadership do we need now [and] who can provide that leadership.\u201d\n\nAnother ex-supporter of Adams, former Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr., has switched to Cuomo as well. Multiple Black members of the State Legislature, including state Senator Jamal Bailey and Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn, who double as Democratic chairs of the Bronx and Brooklyn, respectively, are said to be eyeing a switch to Cuomo.\n\nA key power broker, Representative Gregory Meeks, who doubles as chair of the Queens Democratic Party, is a longtime backer of Adrienne Adams who may swing the county organization behind her. (\u201cHe has always supported everything that I do,\u201d Adrienne told me.) Attorney General Letitia James, a powerful ally, is also helping to line up endorsements and donations.\n\nA successful run by Adrienne would make history twice over. She would become the city\u2019s first woman mayor and also break the pattern of every council speaker in the city\u2019s modern history running for higher office and falling short. Ex-speaker Peter Vallone ran unsuccessful races for governor and mayor, Gifford Miller and Christine Quinn, ran for mayor, Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito tried for public advocate and for congress, and Cory Johnson lost a bid for comptroller.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we are talking to those voters that may not necessarily know the work of the council, may not necessarily know who Adrienne Adams is,\u201d she said. \u201cOur campaign is Adrienne for the people because that is the philosophy that I live by. I am a wife, mother, grandmother, the first to be those things [as speaker]. And I expect to expand all of that when I win this race.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Beijing, China CNN \u2014\n\nAs US President Donald Trump ratcheted up economic pressure on China over the past week, Beijing sent back its own message: Its rise won\u2019t be interrupted.\n\nA major political meeting taking place in the capital was the ideal backdrop for Beijing to respond. The \u201ctwo sessions\u201d gathering of China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature and its top political advisory body is where the government reveals its plans and sets the tone for the year ahead.\n\nThe top item on its priority list? Boosting consumer demand to ensure China doesn\u2019t need to rely on exports to power its vast but slowing economy. And the next: driving forward leader Xi Jinping\u2019s bid to transform the country into a technological superpower, by ramping up investment and enlisting the private sector.\n\nBeijing is making these moves as it prepares for what could be a protracted economic showdown with the United States. Trump doubled additional tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% on Tuesday and has threatened more to come \u2013 as well as tighter controls on American investment in China.\n\n\u201cWe can prevail over any difficulty in pursuing development,\u201d China\u2019s No. 2 official Li Qiang told thousands of delegates seated in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People at the opening meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress Wednesday. The \u201cgiant ship of China\u2019s economy\u201d will \u201csail steadily toward the future,\u201d he said.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesperson was more direct when asked about trade frictions on Tuesday: \u201cIf the US insists on waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will fight till the end,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMembers of China's political advisory body, known as the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attend a meeting on March 4. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\nAnd while Beijing\u2019s priorities \u2013 and rhetoric \u2013 may echo those of years past, this time they are coming from a country that is starting to regain its swagger after being battered by its own Covid restrictions, a property sector crisis and by a tech war with the US.\n\n\u201cConfidence\u201d has been an unofficial buzzword of the weeklong event, which ends Tuesday. It was used nearly a dozen times during a press conference held by China\u2019s economic tsars on Thursday, splashed across state media coverage and included in a pointed reminder \u2013 that \u201cconfidence builds strength\u201d\u2013 during the closing lines of Li\u2019s nationally broadcast speech.\n\nThat optimism might be more aspiration than reality. Many in China are looking to the future with uncertainty. They\u2019re more willing to save than spend, while young people are struggling to find jobs and feeling unsure whether their lives will be better than those of their parents.\n\nBut unlike last year, the country is entering 2025 buoyed by the market-moving successes of Chinese firms and technology. And while Trump\u2019s return has Beijing concerned about economic risks, it\u2019s also eyeing opportunity for its own rise.\n\n\u201cBy the end of Trump\u2019s second term, America\u2019s global standing and credibility image will have gone down,\u201d People\u2019s Liberation Army Sen. Col. (ret) Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, told CNN. \u201cAnd as American strength declines, China, of course, will look more important.\u201d\n\nAn electric vehicle by Chinese manufacturer BYD is loaded on a ship in the southeastern Chinese port city of Guangzhou last month. Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConfidence boost\n\nThis mood isn\u2019t just percolating in the halls of power.\n\nOn the streets of the capital, gleaming homegrown electric vehicles weave through traffic, including those from carmaker BYD, which now goes toe-to-toe with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla for global sales \u2013 a reminder of China\u2019s successful push to become a leader in green tech.\n\nThen there\u2019s the box office record-smashing animation \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d and the breakout success of privately owned Chinese AI firm DeepSeek. Its large language model shocked Silicon Valley and upended Western assumptions about the costs associated with AI.\n\nIn Beijing this week, \u201cyou can ask DeepSeek\u201d has been a playful and proud punchline in casual conversation.\n\n\u201cLast year, people may have been impacted by the US narrative that China is declining, that China has peaked,\u201d said Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cWe still have many difficulties. We still have many problems, of course, but it\u2019s not that we\u2019ve reached peak China.\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s focus on economic rivalry with Beijing as he rolls out tariffs on US trade partners appears to some as a mark of how far China has come. On a recent weekday afternoon in downtown Beijing, some passersby interviewed by CNN pointed to competition with the US as a sign of their country\u2019s growing strength.\n\n\u201cChina is developing quickly now and that\u2019s attracted international attention, especially from the United States,\u201d but that may not be a bad thing, said a medical graduate student surnamed Xia. \u201cTrump\u2019s increase on tariffs is competition \u2026 (and) if there\u2019s no competition maybe China\u2019s independent development is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nSecurity personnel stand outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing as China's \"Two Sessions\" gets underway. Tingshu Wang/Reuters\n\nHigh stakes rivalry\n\nBut even as Chinese officials seek to project confidence, international observers say the economic stimulus measures announced this week show Beijing is girding itself for major challenges to come.\n\nPremier Li alluded to that in his opening address. \u201cThe external environment is becoming more complex and severe, which may have a greater impact on the country\u2019s trade, science and technology and other fields,\u201d he said.\n\nChina doesn\u2019t want to deal with that volatility while also grappling with a weak economy at home. That\u2019s one reason why it\u2019s trying to boost consumption and spur growth, setting an ambitious expansion target of \u201caround 5%\u201d this year. Beijing is also aware that trade frictions mean the economy needs to rely less on exports.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that Beijing has thought through the scenarios of Trade War 2.0, but whatever happens, it is clear that China\u2019s growth will have to rely more on domestic demand,\u201d said Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University Singapore and former World Bank country director for China, in a note.\n\nStill, some analysts say Beijing\u2019s initiatives are short on details and much less aggressive than needed to rev up the economy and boost consumer confidence.\n\n\u201cIt adds up to a sense by the leadership that they want to refocus on growth and development, but still a desire to do only as much as necessary in terms of stimulus to get there,\u201d said Michael Hirson, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Center for China Analysis.\n\nXi may also be balancing this goal with another concern: a need to save some firepower to support the economy if China faces \u201ca nasty four years dealing with Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nA humanoid robot entertains the crowd at a robotics exhibition in eastern China's Nanjing last month. Costfoto/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nBeijing also wants to direct resources toward the high-tech transformation of its economy and industries. That\u2019s another key part of the government\u2019s 2025 agenda \u2013 and a long-term objective of Xi, who unlike US presidents is not subject to term limits on his leadership.\n\nBeijing is pushing for innovations in AI, robotics, 6G and quantum computing, announcing a state-backed fund to support tech innovation and even welcoming foreign enterprises \u2013 in a significant tone shift for Xi \u2013 to play a role.\n\nChina is still smarting from the first Trump administration\u2019s campaign to keep its tech champion Huawei out of global mobile networks and from the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to convince allies to join it in cutting Chinese access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nLast month, Washington said it was considering expanding restrictions on US investment in sensitive technologies in China.\n\nBut Beijing this week has also touted its confidence in advancing no matter the barriers.\n\n\u201cBe it space science or chip making, unjustified external suppression has never stopped,\u201d Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters Friday. \u201cBut where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing an ever-expanding horizon for China to become a science and technology powerhouse,\u201d he said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, pictured here in the White House's oval office, has made tariffs a cornerstone of his economic policy. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump threat?\n\nHow much Trump\u2019s policies will challenge China remains an open and urgent question for Beijing.\n\nThe US president has refrained so far from slapping Chinese imports with the blanket 60% or more tariffs that he had threatened on the campaign trail.\n\nHe\u2019s been focused elsewhere, including on unleashing sweeping changes to US global leadership by decimating US foreign assistance, threatening to take control of other countries\u2019 sovereign territory, and upending US alliances in Europe, while pulling closer to Russia at the expense of Ukraine.\n\nThere are potential risks for Beijing in that shake-up. For example, if a Washington-Moscow rapprochement pulls Xi away from Russian President Vladimir Putin, his closest ally, or if an American dial-down of security in Europe allows it to ramp up attention on Asia.\n\nBut Chinese diplomats have also been taking advantage of the changes to play up their country as a responsible and stable global leader, despite criticisms of Beijing\u2019s own aggressive behavior in Asia.\n\n\u201cA big country should honor its international obligations and fulfill its due responsibilities. It should not put selfish interests before principles, still less should it wield the power to bully the weak,\u201d Wang, the foreign minister, said on Friday in response to a question from CNN on Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy. China \u201cresolutely opposes power politics and hegemony,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen it comes to tariffs, observers say Beijing is trying to moderate its response, holding out for a potential meeting between Xi and Trump or perhaps even a deal that could avert an escalating trade war.\n\nA tanker carrying liquefied natural gas sails into a port eastern China's Shandong province last month. FeatureChina/AP\n\nWhile China immediately retaliated against two sets of US tariffs this year, including with levies on US energy and key agricultural goods, it has remained measured in its reprisals.\n\nThe country\u2019s deficit with the US means it will have less room to hit back if a trade war escalates, but Beijing is expected to be calculating other measures like export controls that it could use for leverage.\n\nAnd the view from some parts is that even if tariffs cause the Chinese economy short-term pain, it will be the US which loses in the long run. China is still an indispensable part of global supply chains. It\u2019s also better prepared to weather this trade war than the last one, because it\u2019s sending goods to more markets globally now, data show.\n\n\u201cIf you play (imposing tariffs) with a peer competitor, it actually would not work that well compared to if you\u2019re doing this with small countries or medium powers,\u201d said Zhou in Beijing, who is also the author of the forthcoming book \u201cShould the World Fear China?\u201d.\n\nChina, he said, wants cooperation not friction.\n\n\u201cBut since the US is still the stronger side in this relationship, (it will) decide which kind of relationship this is \u2026 so China has to say \u2018OK \u2013 if this has to be to be one of competition, then we must dare to fight,\u2019\u201d he said."

I\u2019ve seen the president reference many times since then the exchange\u2013I think two blunders: One was the on the issue of NATO,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know the American president expects for all of the trade partners to reach their two percent NATO commitment, and Canada still hasn\u2019t committed to doing that until 2032, so I think that was one problem. And then, yes\u2026 he said that tariffs would result in Canada collapsing, and I think that was the wrong message to convey because it made us sound very, very weak.\u201d\n\nSmith added that Canada\u2019s dependence on trade with the United States is \u201cmutually beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, we are definitely dependent on U.S. trade\u2026 We certainly have more dependence on U.S. trade than in any other market, but it\u2019s mutually beneficial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wish that we\u2019d been able to convey earlier on just how much the Americans benefit from being able to buy cheap and discounted raw materials and intermediate products so they can do the value added to create American jobs and also keep prices lower for consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the partnership that we have. And Canada, in exchange, also becomes the principal buyer of American-produced products. We\u2019re your biggest customers,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I think that we started off on the wrong foot, and now we\u2019ve been trying to get that information out because we really should maintain this tariff-free relationship between our two countries. Our industries are so integrated, and it\u2019s good for both partners.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nTrump signed an executive order Thursday delaying until April 2 the 25-percent tariffs he is imposing on Canada and Mexico. Canadian energy products will face a smaller ten-percent additional tariff when they go into effect next month.\n\nWhen asked whether Trudeau was attempting to use the back and forth with Trump as a means to stay in power, considering he is on the brink of removal, Smith said, \u201cNo, Trudeau\u2019s gone tomorrow.\u201d\n\nShe said to expect \u201ca new prime minister within the next couple of days.\u201d The new prime minister will be tasked with setting an election for the next prime minister and will have \u201cthe latitude to go as long as October before they call an election if they can continue to get support in our legislature.\u201d\n\nShe said the Liberal Party\u2019s Chrystia Freeland or Mark Carney are the likeliest to succeed Trudeau, so one of them would set a date for an election for prime minister. The Liberal Party will hold a vote for their new leader on Sunday.\n\nSmith also contended that the tariff war is harming conservatives\u2019 chances in the upcoming election that will be set by Trudeau\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cAre the Canadian people ready to go back the other way here and go away from the liberal side that we\u2019ve seen under Trudeau and whoever replaces him?\u201d Boyle asked Smith.\n\nHe noted in his question that a conservative prime minister would likely have a better working relationship with Trump than a liberal prime minister.\n\n\u201cBefore the tariff war, I would say yes. I mean, Pierre Poilievre is the name of the Conservative Party leader, and he was miles ahead of Justin Trudeau. But because of what we see as unjust and unfair tariffs, it\u2019s actually caused an increase in the support for the liberals,\u201d Smith responded. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s what I fear, is that the longer this dispute goes on, politicians posture, and it seems to be benefiting the Liberals right now. So I would hope that we could put things on pause is what I\u2019ve told administration officials. Let\u2019s just put things on pause so we can get through an election.\u201d\n\nShe told Boyle that Poilievre, as prime minister, would open the door to a number of opportunities between Canada and the United States.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have the best person at the table make the argument\u2026 and I think that\u2019s Pierre Poilievre, and I do agree with you that\u2026 if we do have Pierre as our prime minister, then I think that there\u2019s a number of things that we could do together,\u201d Smith detailed. \u201cPierre believes in development. He believes in low-cost energy. He believes that we need to have low taxes, doesn\u2019t believe in any of the woke stuff that we\u2019ve seen taking over our politics for the last five years.\n\n\u201cSo I would think that there\u2019d be, there\u2019s probably still always going to be areas that are skirmishes or disputes about particular industries when it comes to the border, but I would say, on balance, the perspective that Pierre would bring would be very much in sync with, I think\u2026the new direction in America,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019d have a really great relationship for the period of time they\u2019re both in.\u201d"
