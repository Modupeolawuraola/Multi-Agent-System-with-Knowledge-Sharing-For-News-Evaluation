            "full_content": "Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, a long-suspected drug lord actively wanted by U.S. authorities, on Wednesday evening accused Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele of being an \u201cimperial puppy and lackey.\u201d\n\nCabello\u2019s vitriol comes in response to the U.S. deporting 238 Venezuelans suspected of being members of Tren de Aragua into El Salvador.\n\nCabello, during the latest broadcast of his weekly socialist talk show Hitting with the Mallet, issued a barrage of accusations against the Salvadoran president. Cabello described Bukele as a \u201cfascist, a creep, and a flatterer of the gringos\u201d and claimed that Bukele is creating \u201cconcentration camps\u201d for \u201cmostly Venezuelan\u201d migrants.\n\n\u201cYou have to be very, very creepy to do what Bukele does,\u201d Cabello said. \u201cI call him so, this is not new \u2014 since he received the presidency I have said that he is a fascist, since he appeared in politics, and what I do is to confirm it now.\u201d\n\nBukele has not publicly commented on Cabello\u2019s accusations at the time of this writing.\n\nThroughout the week, socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and several members of the Venezuelan regime\u2019s top brass have condemned President Donald Trump over his use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport to El Salvador 238 Venezuelans suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua terrorist organization as per the terms of a U.S. agreement signed with Bukele.\n\nThe Maduro regime\u2019s official responses to the deportation of the Venezuelan illegal migrants have included a statement comparing the deportations to \u201cslavery\u201d and \u201cNazi concentration camps,\u201d Maduro publicly vowing to \u201crescue\u201d the migrants \u201ckidnapped\u201d by Bukele, and the opening of a website that allows individuals to denounce the \u201cunjust deportations\u201d of Venezuelan illegal migrants from the U.S., among other local campaigns and events.\n\nAs is customary of Cabello and his socialist talk show, the Venezuelan Interior Minister \u201cdedicated\u201d a Twitter hashtag to Bukele that translates to \u201cBukele Puppy and Lackey\u201d to condemn the Salvadoran president over the deportation of the Venezuelan migrants into his country.\n\nDespite the fact that the Maduro regime banned Twitter from Venezuela in August, Cabello launches new hashtag campaigns on the social media platform every week during the broadcasts of his show to accuse, criticize, or ridicule \u201cenemies\u201d of the Venezuelan socialist regime.\n\nCabello, without presenting proof to substantiate his claims, accused Bukele of allegedly charging $2,000 per each \u201ckidnapped\u201d Venezuelan sent to El Salvador. Cabello threatened Bukele with \u201cjustice in the future\u201d for his actions.\n\n\u201cThey [the United States] pay him 6 million dollars, they paid him right now, but he also charges two thousand dollars for each Venezuelan kidnapped,\u201d Cabello said. \u201cBukele is a kidnapper, he has kidnapped Venezuelans and for them he collects a reward and the world says nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great thing is that we know these characters, and you will see Bukele sooner rather than later in the hands of the U.S. justice. They are going to charge him,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe Venezuelan Interior Minister condemned the United States for allegedly subjecting Venezuelan migrants to \u201charassment, humiliation, mistreatment, persecution with absolutely no respect for anything.\u201d According to Cabello, Venezuelans who have called for human rights sanctions against the Maduro regime also engage in the alleged \u201chumiliation\u201d of Venezuelan migrants.\n\n\u201cAmerican dream? There is no American dream. No, no, no, no, that is not true. What happens is that they always accuse us of not wanting the United States,\u201d Cabello said. \u201cNo, we have nothing against the United States, nor against the people of the United States, much less the people of the United States. Against imperialism, yes. We will be rebels, we will rise up.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday a group of Venezuelans is being subjected to humiliation, humiliation, one could say it, right? To mistreatment, to persecution, they respect absolutely nothing,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere in the United States, here in Venezuela they have their counterpart. There are those who asked for sanctions, asked for the blockade, asked for persecutions.\u201d\n\nCabello further accused the Venezuelan opposition of furthering the \u201cnarrative\u201d that the Maduro regime sent people to other countries to become an \u201carmed wing of the Bolivarian Revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe narrative was made to put Venezuelan men and women in the mouth of the whole world. It is being reversed and will be reversed, you can be sure of that,\u201d Cabello said.\n\nShortly before the start of Cabello\u2019s talk show, dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced the creation of a \u201cCommittee of Relatives of Venezuelans Kidnapped in Concentration Camps in El Salvador.\u201d According to Maduro, the group has contacted \u201cimportant law firms and human rights defenders\u201d in El Salvador to achieve the release of the 238 Venezuelan deportees.\n\n\u201cThis committee will act on the legal side while we act on the diplomatic side, to achieve the goal of freeing these young boys,\u201d Maduro said, calling for Salvadorans and the nation\u2019s Supreme Court to take action to make President Bukele understand that he is \u201ccommitting an illegality that violates human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupreme Court of Justice of El Salvador, magistrates, for the love of God, in the name of Oscar Arnulfo Romero, I ask for justice,\u201d Maduro continued. \u201cThese boys have not committed crimes in El Salvador and must be released and quickly handed over to their families in Venezuela.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s February memo ordering all diversity, equity and inclusion-related content to be removed from Pentagon websites was so vague that military units were instructed to simply use keyword searches like \u201cracism,\u201d \u201cethnicity,\u201d \u201chistory\u201d and \u201cfirst\u201d when searching for articles and photos to remove, and to interpret the directive \u201cbroadly,\u201d multiple defense officials told CNN.\n\nThe implications of Hegseth\u2019s memo were overwhelming, since the Defense Department manages over 1,000 public-facing websites and a huge visual media database known as DVIDS \u2013 with officials expected to purge everything relevant within two weeks. As a result, the manual work of individual units was supplemented with an algorithm that also used keywords to automate much of the purge, officials explained.\n\nOther keywords officials were instructed to search for included \u201cfirsts\u201d in history, including content about the first female ranger and first Black commanding general, as well as the words \u201cLGBTQ,\u201d \u201chistoric,\u201d \u201caccessibility,\u201d \u201copportunity,\u201d \u201cbelonging,\u201d \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201cprivilege,\u201d respect\u201d and \u201cvalues,\u201d according to a list reviewed by CNN.\n\nOne of the articles removed from the US Air Force Air Mobility Command website was about Jaspreet Singh, who was among the first Airmen in the entire US Air Force to be approved to wear a turban as a part of his uniform. The article was also removed from the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst website. Airman 1st Class Briana Cespedes/US Air Force\n\nA defense official acknowledged that, in hindsight, the strict timeline could have been handled differently and said the search terms were suggestions from an internal defense agency to help units meet the secretary\u2019s directive.\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a video posted to X on Thursday that the effort \u201cwas an arduous \u2013 but incredibly important \u2013 undertaking,\u201d with an \u201caggressive timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery now and then, because of the realities of AI tools and other software, some important content was incorrectly pulled offline to be reviewed,\u201d Parnell said. \u201cWe want to be very, very clear: History is not DEI. When content is either mistakenly removed \u2013 or if it is maliciously removed \u2013 we continue to work quickly to restore it.\u201d\n\nOne defense official said of the removal of \u201cfirsts\u201d in the military, \u201cThat\u2019s just history. It\u2019s not really DEI \u2013 it\u2019s literally just history.\u201d\n\nOther keywords to look for included \u201cgender based violence,\u201d \u201ccultural observances,\u201d \u201ccultural awareness,\u201d \u201cAfrican ethnicity,\u201d \u201cAsian ethnicity,\u201d \u201cCaucasian ethnicity\u201d and \u201cHispanic ethnicity.\u201d\n\nOne defense official said every social media post was being pored over to the most minute detail, particularly for things like military partner training abroad. The people tasked with doing so had to determine if a post about a training event for another country\u2019s military that included women, for example, could be tied back to some diversity or inclusion initiative \u2014 or if it was simply because the unit in question was largely made up of women.\n\nMultiple units had to ask for extensions on the deadline because of the amount of content they were combing through in a short period of time, three officials said.\n\nOne of the officials raised concerns with their superior about potential violations of government record retention laws and asked for an extension to ensure everything was in compliance, but their request was denied, according to emails reviewed by CNN.\n\nAnother of the officials said they had to bring in a few other people to their team to help complete it in time, pulling them away from other tasks.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cvalidation teams\u201d are now being dispatched to military bases to ensure that troops are complying with Hegseth\u2019s directive, according to one official and a statement from the Air Force. Multiple officials also confirmed to CNN that a lieutenant colonel has been dispatched from the Pentagon to travel to every combatant command around the world, holding meetings with staff and ensuring compliance with the policy.\n\nThe lack of guidance and the pressure from above to comply has led to a massive \u201covercorrection\u201d and the removal of thousands of articles and images that were either completely unrelated to DEI issues \u2013 like Holocaust remembrance, suicide prevention and the Enola Gay aircraft \u2013 or that commemorated war heroes like World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves and historically significant service members like Jackie Robinson and the Navajo code-talkers.\n\nThis image provided by the US Marine Corps shows World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves during World War II. US Marine Corps/AP\n\nAnd while units made an effort to archive content internally, limitations that exist on various social media platforms made it difficult to do so in the instance officials determined the posts should be brought back. One defense official said Facebook and X, or Twitter, don\u2019t have good archiving tools to keep posts, which meant they were left to take screenshots of them and delete them for good.\n\nThe department is now scrambling to republish some of the content, officials said. But the confusion reflected the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d approach the Trump administration has taken across the federal government that has at times gone too far and forced officials to reverse themselves.\n\nThe time and resources that have been spent on deleting websites and images has also struck officials as at odds with Hegseth\u2019s stated focus on returning the focus of the military to \u201clethality\u201d and \u201cwarfighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf all the things they could be doing, the places they\u2019re putting their focuses on first are really things that just don\u2019t matter \u2026 This was literally a waste of our time,\u201d a defense official said. \u201cThis does absolutely nothing to make us stronger, more lethal, better prepared.\u201d\n\nAnother defense official told CNN on Wednesday that the department is now planning on doubling back and going through the content again with \u201chuman beings\u201d to conduct a more thorough review \u2013 a process that will take even longer to complete."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Thursday and welcome to the start of March Madness. In today\u2019s edition, we explore how Democrats are dealing with calls at town halls to more forcefully push back against President Donald Trump \u2014 and how one lawmaker is stepping into the party\u2019s leadership void. On that note, Jonathan Allen writes that some Democrats are already antsy to get to the presidential primary process started.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\n\ud83d\udea8Breaking news: Trump signed an executive order to begin the dismantling of the Education Department. Completely eliminating the department would require the approval of Congress. Read more \u2192\n\nDemocrats face demands to step up their opposition to Trump\n\nIt isn\u2019t just Republicans getting an earful at local town halls in the wake of President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s federal job and spending cuts, Sahil Kapur, Scott Wong, Brennan Leach and Syedah Asghar report.\n\nDemocrats, too, this week have faced fired-up crowds who want them to step up their fight against Trump. The anger has intensified since Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, prompting questions about whether party leaders are up to the task.\n\nThe most recent example came Wednesday night just outside Denver, where a town hall attendee tore into Sen. Michel Bennet, D-Colo., for voting to confirm some of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. \u201cThe words are great, but I\u2019m really not seeing any action,\u201d the person said.\n\nToward the beginning of the event \u2014 which Bennet held alongside Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo. \u2014 attendees shouted for one full minute as Bennet attempted to calm the crowd.\n\nPressed about whether Schumer should remain Senate Democratic leader, Schumer referred to his call for President Joe Biden to step aside during the 2024 campaign.\n\n\u201cIn dodging your question, let me just say it\u2019s important for people to know, you know, when it\u2019s time to go,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we\u2019re going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\n\nKey numbers: A recent NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats want their elected representatives to stick to their positions and hold the line against Trump, while 32% favor compromising with him. That\u2019s a dramatic shift from Trump\u2019s first term: An April 2017 NBC News poll found that 59% of Democrats favored compromising with Trump, while 33% said lawmakers should stick to their positions.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 leadership void: As Democrats scramble to find an authentic and effective messenger for the second Trump administration, there is a growing desire to elevate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., within the party in some way, according to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists.\n\nAs Ryan Nobles, Melanie Zanona and Jonathan Allen report, some of the initial skepticism among Democrats about the progressive star when she first arrived in Washington six years ago has started to fade as she has established herself as a political player on Capitol Hill and demonstrated a unique knack for communicating with a younger generation.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a Senate primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nStarting Thursday, she is taking her message on the road with a fellow progressive heavyweight, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The pair will hold a series of rallies in swing districts and on college campuses in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado that are expected to draw massive crowds, sparking inevitable questions about her considering a run for higher office \u2014 perhaps even president.\n\nAs for the Republicans: Meanwhile, few GOP lawmakers held town halls this week during the congressional recess after they drew angry and frustrated crowds of their own earlier this year. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised members against holding in-person town halls.\n\nOne who did, though, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., faced a torrent of heckles and boos Wednesday night in Laramie, Wyoming, as she tried to downplay concerns about Trump and Musk, Kate Santaliz and Megan Lebowitz report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with federal government,\u201d Hageman said, adding that the attendees\u2019 \u201chysteria is just really over the top.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats are eager to jumpstart the 2028 primary\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nNikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, can\u2019t wait for the 2028 presidential primaries to get underway.\n\n\u201cThey all need to declare sooner than later,\u201d Fried said of the prospective White House hopefuls. \u201cThey need to get out there. They need to sharpen their knives. They need to excite the base. They need to be able to stand up against what is happening in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nFried said that the energy from campaign events would siphon media attention from President Donald Trump and that she wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the party\u2019s picking its nominee early and all at once.\n\n\u201cWhy not just run and vote in November \u201926?\u201d she said. \u201cForget all of this \u2018Iowa has to go first\u2019 or North Carolina or South Carolina. F--- all that. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nFried isn\u2019t alone in feeling added urgency in the early months of Trump\u2019s term, according to several Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss party strategy. Nor, these officials said, is she the only one who wants to hold primaries and caucuses before the traditional start at the beginning of the election year.\n\nBut it\u2019s too early to begin making decisions about the calendar, three of the officials said. So early, one Democratic National Committee adviser said, that it\u2019s \u201cnot generally on the radar of the leadership of the DNC\u201d yet. And even if the party wanted to change its primary dates, state laws could prevent official contests from taking place before 2028.\n\nAt the same time, new DNC Chair Ken Martin wants to bring back a form of Democrats\u2019 long-abandoned midterm convention in 2026, the DNC adviser said. The party wouldn\u2019t pick its nominee at that time, but it would hold a high-profile conference.\n\nIn small ways, the shadow primary has already begun, with prominent Democrats holding campaign-style rallies, using their elected offices to oppose Trump and, in the case of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, hosting a politics-focused podcast.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s playing this tiptoeing game. [People] know you\u2019re all running \u2014 just go,\u201d Fried said. \u201cThe base wants to know who is our next leader, when can we get out of this funk and start moving on to the next chapter.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udcfa On air: In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Schumer said Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on the judiciary have resulted in a constitutional crisis.

            "full_content": "After having sunk more than a quarter-billion dollars into the 2024 election and then taken a central role in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, billionaire Elon Musk is demonstrating that he\u2019s not done with his efforts to reshape American politics.\n\nMusk, the public face of Trump\u2019s attempts to take a chain saw to the federal bureaucracy, is a constant fixture on White House grounds and on his social media platform, X. Meanwhile, the super PAC he founded is the top outside spender in the April 1 election that will determine the majority on Wisconsin\u2019s state Supreme Court, and he is also demonstrating his willingness to use his wallet to reward Trump loyalists in Congress \u2014 and, some fear, to punish others \u2014 as he closely watches the political landscape.\n\nIt all makes Musk a megadonor without much parallel in modern political history \u2014 someone who not only can fundamentally reshape a campaign with a single check but is also a prominent political figure in his own right, both as a business executive and as the de facto leader of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nIn short, Musk\u2019s prominence, his virtually unlimited bank account and his penchant for controversy are poised to play a big role in upcoming elections \u2014 for both parties, in different ways.\n\nAmerica PAC \u2014 the super PAC Musk started during the last presidential election, which spent more than $261 million primarily on helping Trump \u2014 is the top outside spender in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, having spent about $6.6 million so far on ads and organizing. While the group\u2019s fundraising isn\u2019t public yet, Musk, whose net worth is north of $300 billion, was responsible for the vast majority of the money it raised last year.\n\nThe third-largest outside spender in that race is Building America\u2019s Future, a Republican-aligned nonprofit group to which Musk has previously sent millions of dollars, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Building America\u2019s Future has spent $4.5 million so far in the race, Wisconsin campaign finance documents show, though it\u2019s unclear whether Musk has any current involvement in the effort.\n\nStill, Musk\u2019s past donations and prominent political role have made him a boogeyman in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. A recent ad for Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate running against Republican-backed Judge Brad Schimel, claims that \u201cElon Musk is trying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court because he knows Schimel always helps his big campaign donors.\u201d It\u2019s the first time Musk has appeared in a TV ad in Wisconsin, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending and content, following repeated Democratic mentions of Musk on the trail and in digital ads.\n\nMusk has also been rewarding members of Congress who have expressed support for impeaching judges who issued rulings against elements of Trump\u2019s agenda. A person familiar with Musk\u2019s donations confirmed to NBC News that he gave $6,600 apiece, the maximum campaign donations under federal law, to Reps. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., and Brandon Gill, R-Texas, as well as Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. (Only Van Orden is expected to be running in a competitive race next year.)\n\nThose donations, first reported by The New York Times, were made after the president and his allies railed against a ruling Saturday from Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Boasberg ordered the administration to return flights to El Salvador deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members and return them to the United States. The administration didn\u2019t do so.\n\nTrump has called for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment, while Musk has spent days posting on X in support of efforts to remove judges he perceives to be anti-Trump.\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide said Musk\u2019s direct contributions are \u201cobviously always appreciated\u201d but are \u201cbasically marginal in races like that,\u201d especially when those direct contributions are capped at such a low level, unlike super PAC donations that Musk can make with no limits.\n\nBut it\u2019s \u201cdefinitely beneficial for [Musk] to be involved though,\u201d the aide wrote, adding that Musk was \u201ca huge help in PA and a few other states for us last cycle.\u201d\n\nWhile a handful of $6,600 donations are basically nothing to the world\u2019s richest man, they still send a loud message: He\u2019s watching what congressional Republicans do very closely. And though Musk has focused most of his spending so far on general elections, the notion that he could bankroll an insurgent Republican in a primary race looms large.\n\nMusk said in November that America PAC\u2019s future included playing a \u201csignificant role in primaries\u201d and implied that there\u2019s \u201cno other way\u201d to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d besides funding primary challenges against Republicans who don\u2019t back Trump\u2019s agenda. The warnings aren\u2019t lost on Republicans, including the small sliver who aren\u2019t in lockstep behind Trump.\n\nAt a media availability event this week at the Alaska Legislature, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a critic of some of DOGE\u2019s cuts, lamented that other Republicans may see some of the criticism she has faced from within the party and decide to be \u201czip-lipped, not saying a word, because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to be taken down, they\u2019re going to be primaried.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be that Elon Musk has decided he\u2019s going to take the next billion dollars he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you know what? That may happen, but I\u2019m not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to try to stand up for Alaskans.\u201d\n\nMusk the donor for GOP ads, Musk the character for Democratic ads\n\nMusk didn\u2019t just bankroll America PAC like an ordinary megadonor last year\u2014 he barnstormed swing states on Trump\u2019s behalf, appearing at events held by his group and at rallies alongside Trump as he made the case for the future president. And as he continues to engage on social media and with his political spending, it seems likely he will remain active.\n\nA Trump ally said Musk\u2019s cash would be a huge boost in the 2026 midterm elections \u2014 while noting the GOP could face the typical midterm headwinds, something a check alone wouldn\u2019t be able to fix.\n\n\u201cI think any money is good money to put into these races,\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd it will matter. But what matters more is the environment. If the environment is good, they will need less money. If it\u2019s bad, they will need more.\n\n\u201cWe are in an environment where Republicans have become less reliable voters than Democrats,\u201d this person continued, adding: \u201cWe need to change the composition of the electorate. That\u2019s a much harder task than straight persuasion. And it is a rarity in politics, certainly something that we have not done in decades without Donald Trump on the ballot.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats will have an opportunity, they believe, to use Musk and DOGE\u2019s cuts against the Republican Party \u2014 and to use Musk as a proxy, as in the new TV ad airing in Wisconsin.\n\nThe new NBC News poll found that 39% of registered voters view Musk positively and 51% view him negatively, making his public image worse than both Trump\u2019s and Vice President JD Vance\u2019s. (He\u2019s also far less popular than federal workers, according to the survey.)\n\nVoters are split on DOGE in new NBC News polling, with 46% saying it\u2019s a good idea, 40% saying it\u2019s a bad idea and 14% unsure. But 41% view DOGE positively, and 47% view it negatively. And while a third want DOGE to continue as is, the remaining share of the electorate either want DOGE to slow down or think it\u2019s reckless.\n\nSome of that frustration has fueled criticism at Republican lawmakers\u2019 town halls in recent weeks, energy Democrats believe they can harness.\n\nVoteVets, a progressive veterans group, announced this week it\u2019s launching a six-figure ad campaign criticizing five vulnerable House Republicans with messaging that focuses on Musk and DOGE alone, with no mention of Trump.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans are not going to speak out against Elon Musk buying access to fire middle-class veterans, they\u2019re going to be held accountable to it in the midterms,\u201d said Matt Corridoni, the vice president of communications at VoteVets.\n\nHouse Majority Forward, a super PAC that supports the House Democrats\u2019 political agenda, launched ads and billboards featuring Musk, too, using him as a face of the GOP budget resolution, which Democrats warn could lead to Medicaid cuts. Last month, the group put out messaging guidance telling Democrats: \u201cOn Elon Musk, it is important to focus on how his conflicts of interest as head of DOGE could lead to cuts to Medicare and Social Security and leave the interests of the middle class behind.\u201d\n\nAnd Musk is a fixture in Democratic fundraising ads \u2014 lawmakers like Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Reps. Sean Casten, D-Ill., Robert Garcia, D-Calif., Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., are among those who have launched digital fundraising appeals evoking Musk in recent weeks, according to AdImpact.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re using him as a foil to explain what Republicans are doing \u2014 they\u2019re laying off people, they\u2019re cutting Medicaid benefits, X and Y and Z, and then they are profiting off of that,\u201d said a Democratic strategist involved in House races, explaining the emphasis on Musk. \u201cYou can use Musk as a boogeyman, but you have to relay it back to real-life things that are happening.\u201d\n\nAnother Democratic strategist at a group that\u2019s attacking Musk told NBC News that attacking him serves multiple purposes, both electoral and personal.\n\nIt\u2019s a way to highlight Trump\u2019s \u201cpolicies that are actively harming people,\u201d the strategist said, \u201cand also get under his skin, reminding him he\u2019s not the center of his own show.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get into a mud fight over whether people like Donald Trump, we\u2019ve been shown time and time again that we lose that,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nBut, this person added, \u201cif we show people how these policies are hurting them and we make Trump feel less secure, we win on two planes.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Win McNamee/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn 1994, Democrats lost both chambers of Congress for the first time since 1952 as well as many down-ballot races. Afterward, journalist E.J. Dionne penned a book about the Democratic Party titled They Only Look Dead. Indeed, a comeback began before the ink was dry on this optimistic message. Right now, Democrats are at an emotional low ebb even worse than the one they experienced 30 years ago. After losing the White House and Senate in November, they face an unprecedented onslaught on everything held dear by liberals from a lawless president whose congressional allies have green-lit unimaginable power grabs. And after failing to exploit their one point of leverage over an appropriations bill that consolidated these power grabs, Democrats are at one another\u2019s throats even as a radicalized GOP runs wild and an overwhelmed judiciary seeks to impose some kind of constitutional order on the prevalent chaos.\n\nYes, Donald Trump\u2019s popularity is already flagging, and relief from his reign of terror may lie on the horizon in the midterm elections as his party is very likely to lose its governing trifecta. But with Elon Musk and Russell Vought racing to do permanent damage to the public sector and other institutions that stand in Trump\u2019s way, 2026 seems far away. What can Democrats do right now other than whale at one another? Here are a few ideas.\n\n.\n\nRepublicans were able to enact their spending bill because Senate Democrats (or at least ten of them) decided not to filibuster it to death at the expense of triggering a government shutdown. This sheathing of the filibuster sword was significant because the spending bill was the one clearly identifiable major point of leverage for Democrats, at least until late September (when that spending bill expires). Why? Because most of Trump\u2019s agenda will be advanced through a giant budget-reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered and can pass both Houses on a strict party-line vote.\n\nBut as Bill Scher recently pointed out in Washington Monthly, the threat of a filibuster still matters on those occasions when Republicans want to enact laws that clearly don\u2019t meet the requirements for inclusion in a reconciliation bill:\n\nTwo weeks ago, Senate Democrats blocked a bill that would have banned schools that receive federal funding from allowing transgender girls and women from playing on female sports teams. In January, they derailed a bill that would have put doctors performing emergency late-term abortions at risk of criminal penalties, as well as a bill that would have sanctioned International Criminal Court officials for issuing an arrest warrant to the Israeli Prime Minister. Filibustering those bills was not without political risk for Democrats, but they did so anyway.\n\nThere may be more opportunities in the future: Potentially, a lot of Trump\u2019s agenda items that don\u2019t involve spending or revenues could be ruled out of a reconciliation bill by the Senate parliamentarian (who referees these things) and would thus have to pass through the regular legislative process, which includes the Senate filibuster. Reasserting their willingness to use this weapon where they can is important for Democrats.\n\n.\n\nRepublicans have managed to get two very important bills (the initial budget blueprint and the spending bill) through the closely divided House and Senate with minimal help from Democrats thanks mostly to pressure from the White House. But divisions between House and Senate Republicans still exist. Most crucially, they are not on the same page for the balance between the tax cuts Trump has demanded and the spending cuts necessary to pay for them. There\u2019s potentially an even bigger problem approaching: Senate Republicans are trying to convince the parliamentarian to accept a radical new \u201cscoring\u201d process for tax cuts to pretend the extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 legislation will be \u201cfree\u201d from a budgetary viewpoint. If that fails, they suddenly have a $4.5 trillion hole in the budget to fill.\n\nThe larger point is that there are a variety of fault lines in the GOP\u2019s legislative plans that Democrats should expose, promote, and, where possible, exploit. That could mean siding with Senate Republicans on one issue (e.g., how horrible Medicaid cuts would be) and with House Republicans on another (e.g., how horrible unpaid-for tax cuts for billionaires would be), while encouraging friendly media and activist voices to do the same.\n\n.\n\nThere have been many arguments between Democrats since November about the nature of the anti-Trump message they should be sending, with some focused on the not-so-hidden authoritarianism of the new administration and others insisting on a purely economic pitch. There\u2019s really no time to sort this out, so Democrats may be well advised to adopt a message that includes both the \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cpopulist\u201d angles. Something like: Trump and his lawless band of billionaires led by Elon Musk are breaking laws and the Constitution in order to pull off a massive redistribution of wealth from middle-class Americans to themselves. This has the added advantage of being true.\n\n.\n\nThe best way to signal to Republicans, and to themselves, that the Trump-Musk rampage is undermining whatever limited mandate his narrow 2024 election victory provided is to do well in some special and off-year elections. Quite a few of them are coming up soon, beginning on April 1 when Wisconsin holds a high-stakes, very expensive Supreme Court election and Florida will hold two congressional special elections (which Republicans will likely win but possibly by reduced margins). Later in the year are competitive gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia and much-watched mayoral elections in New York and Pittsburgh, among other cities. Democrats could get early validation of the hypothesis that non-presidential turnout patterns now favor them, particularly without Trump on the ballot.\n\n.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t have the luxury of devoting time to ideological knife fights between progressives and centrists with the wolf quite literally at or even inside the door. The strategic and tactical differences of opinion that afflicted congressional Democrats during the spending-bill struggle need to be resolved quickly (with or without changes in leadership) and should not be conflated with ancient battles between different \u201cwings\u201d of the party. There will be time enough to determine the party\u2019s future shape during the 2028 presidential-nominating contest, which should be wide-open and robust. But it\u2019s not too early to begin thinking about a positive Democratic message and agenda that take fully into account what we have learned about the party\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 particularly the need for a compelling, distinctive approach to inflation, immigration, and government reform. Those weaknesses aren\u2019t just going away, so the time to begin thinking through how to address them begins right now."

            "full_content": "Today, President Donald Trump delivered one of the most influential reforms yet of his presidency: reducing the size of the Department of Education and returning education back to state control. With his Executive Order, President Trump has boldly reimagined what education can \u2013 and should \u2013 look like in our country.\n\nFunding for the Department of Education has more than doubled since 1980 \u2013 yet billions more in funding hasn\u2019t contributed to better education results. In fact, it\u2019s done the opposite.\n\nOver the past 10 years, 8th grade math achievement has dropped two grade levels, while 8th grade reading scores include some of the lowest ever recorded. Over 70 percent of 8th graders are below proficient in reading and math, while nearly one-third of all public school students are behind grade level.\n\nPresident Trump knows that we can \u2013 and must \u2013 do better.\n\nThat\u2019s why I support President Trump\u2019s proposal to return control of our education system to the states, where it belongs. The role of government should be to empower, not over-regulate, and this move will allow for a more localized, innovative, and accountable approach to education that truly serves the needs of our students, families, and educators.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Executive Order will enable long-awaited curriculum and administrative reforms, while expanding opportunities for school choice and educational freedom.\n\nBy returning curriculum to the state and district level, we will finally be able to teach common sense instead of Common Core. It\u2019s time we move past outdated national standardized testing, and instead focus on fresh accountability for academic achievement and new choices for students and parents.\n\nStates will also be able to retool high schools, so that students can get critical work experience in high school. This will enable students to graduate ready for local careers, apprenticeships, or college. Last year, I hosted the National Governors Association on a tour of Southeast Career Technical Academy in Las Vegas, where we saw students graduating ready for careers in construction, the automotive industry, culinary arts, cosmetology, and cybersecurity.\n\nMy fellow governors would agree with me: we desperately need to invest in more vocational high schools and make them more available to more students that wish to pursue that educational path. President Trump\u2019s Executive Order will enable us to do just that.\n\nFor too long, federal mandates, and sometimes partisan politics, have tied our hands and prevented us from implementing school choice programs that empower families. By reducing the size, bureaucracy and power of the U.S. Department of Education, we can create more opportunities for parents to choose the best educational setting for their children. Parents should always have the final say in their child\u2019s education \u2013 not Washington D.C. bureaucrats.\n\nBy removing harmful DEI policies, restoring integrity in women\u2019s sports, and implementing educational freedom, President Trump has already made significant progress in our schools and universities. Returning education to the states is the next critical step in President Trump\u2019s transformational education agenda.\n\nI\u2019m committed to working alongside my fellow governors and President Trump to champion policies that prioritize parental choice, promote accountability and transparency, and put our students first. Education should be about opportunity, and this move will empower states to deliver unprecedented opportunity for every child, regardless of household income or where a child lives.\n\nEducation decisions are best made closest to the student by the people that care most about that student. President Trump understands that, and I\u2019m grateful he took a major step toward improving the lives and preparedness of an entire generation of American children.\n\nJoe Lombardo is the governor of Nevada."

            "full_content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 19 episode of \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes.\u201d\n\nThe movement to resist Donald Trump\u2019s unconstitutional power grab faces two fundamental questions: How bad are things right now? And when is it time to use every possible democratic means to slow his assault?\n\nThis is how democracies end. When independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer joined \u201cAll In.\u201d The interview was clarifying in many ways, but one of my main takeaways is that there is a fundamental difference between how some people view this moment.\n\nSome people think we are in a constitutional crisis \u2014 that there is a plan in place to impose a dictatorship in the United States. On Tuesday\u2019s show, Schumer told me he was not quite ready to declare a constitutional crisis yet. Now, I truly hope Schumer is right, but it makes it very hard to imagine a leader \u201cmeeting the moment\u201d if they don\u2019t believe the moment is even here.\n\nFor me, Trump\u2019s intentions are so clear. He is in the process of attempting to undo the constitutional republic. His executive branch is in the process of overtaking the legislative and judicial branches of government, Congress and the courts, so that he gets to act unilaterally.\n\nEven within his executive purview, this president is purging anything and anyone who falls short of pledging unshakable loyalty to him and his political project. From the FBI to the Justice Department to the Federal Trade Commission, these institutions are being cleared of career officials who may favor the rule of law over Trump\u2019s whims, and they are being replaced with loyalists.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Trump is using the vast powers of the presidency to hobble his political opponents, including bogus investigations into Democratic fundraising platforms and threats to shut down nonprofit organizations he sees as oppositional.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the government or partisan entities. Trump wants to dismantle all forms of public opposition to his power grab, starting with all sources of independent authority. Any institution with credibility must either be bent to Trump\u2019s will or destroyed.\n\nHe has repeatedly threatened independent media outlets, including this one, for coverage he deems to be insufficiently fawning. He is conducting an unprecedented attack on American higher education, including freezing $175 million in federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. And he is seemingly openly defying the Constitution as he tries to deport a legal resident over his protected political speech.\n\nThis is how democracies end \u2014 when independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured. It is clear as day to so many of us, including scholars of authoritarian regimes and especially folks who have lived through those regimes.\n\nI think part of the issue, which is a legitimate concern, is how we got to this point. There is a sense among Democrats \u2014 one that is not totally wrong \u2014 that democracy is not a particularly salient political issue. Democrats spent the entire 2024 election cycle hammering their messaging about the threats to democracy and civil society, but voters were more concerned with pocketbook issues, like the cost of living. Therefore, some Democrats think democracy is a losing issue politically and that we should talk about Medicaid cuts or the effect of Trump\u2019s trade war on the economy.\n\nI understand the instinct to stick to these kitchen-table issues. I don\u2019t think it is necessarily the wrong lesson to have learned from the election. But the terrain has shifted too much since November. Democrats should not be fighting the last war. While that type of resistance worked eight years ago, now is not the time for politics as usual. This is a break-glass moment.\n\n\u2018This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,\u2019 Sen. Chris Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday.\n\nFirst of all, Trump is already underwater on questions about the economy. The state of the stock market is doing a pretty good job messaging pocketbook issues all on its own. But more importantly: Democrats don\u2019t have to choose. It\u2019s all one thing. The threat to democracy has become so much more tangible than it was when folks went to the ballot four months ago, in part because Trump\u2019s entire mad king act is wreaking havoc in every direction.\n\nWith that in mind, a lot of Schumer\u2019s Democratic colleagues believe it\u2019s time to fight back harder, as Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been out there saying.\n\n\u201cThis moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,\u201d Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday. \u201cAnd I get it. A lot of my colleagues said shutting down the government, being in a government shutdown, that\u2019s a risk; that hands power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But how on Earth are we going to ask the American people to take risks for us, right, when there\u2019s a five-alarm constitutional fire and we need them to be out on the streets \u2014 not with hundreds, not with thousands or tens of thousands of people, but with hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 if we\u2019re not willing to take risks ourselves?\u201d\n\nNow is the time to take political risks \u2014 before it is too late. Not to oversimplify, but the whole point of America is that you cannot have one guy in charge of everything, without checks or balances. That is literally the foundational insight upon which the country was built. No kings. Not ever. There is quite possibly nothing that is more fundamentally American."

            "full_content": "A majority of Americans oppose controversial environment, social, and governance (ESG) policies, which state financial officers across the nation have committed to fighting, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.\n\nA survey conducted by TargetPoint, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, found that 56 percent of Americans agree that \u201cESG is a highly subjective, politically charged idea that is forcing progressive policies on everyday Americans resulting in higher prices for nearly everything.\u201d In contrast, 27 percent disagreed with that statement, and 17 percent did not know enough to register an opinion.\n\nEighty-eight percent agreed that the government should focus more on protecting individual rights so that Americans can achieve prosperity, and 86 percent agreed that open debate and civil discourse should be encouraged to find solutions to financial and policy challenges.\n\nESG has become the latest vector through which Wall Street asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Baillie Gifford & Company, and others push companies to adopt leftist policies they otherwise would not back. Asset managers often push companies to adopt policies intended to fight climate change, diversity requirements, and other policies advocating for racial justice.\n\nO.J. Oleka, the CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), said in a statement to Breitbart News that the poll reveals that Americans are increasingly tired of corporations becoming politicized.\n\nHe said:\n\nThis survey shows that most Americans are rooting for what our financial officers are doing. They see state financial officers defending their hard-earned tax dollars from being weaponized against them and their families, whether it\u2019s costly ESG activism or even the CCP. Our financial officers are also leading the fight to stop banks from denying service to American citizens based simply on their political views. It\u2019s no wonder they\u2019ve earned the public\u2019s trust.\n\nWhen asked who they might trust most to make the right decisions on fiscal and financial matters, 47 percent pointed to state financial officers, 31 percent said governors, and 22 percent said congressional lawmakers.\n\nAmericans trust state financial officers more than governors, attorneys general, and legislators when it comes managing a state\u2019s finances, overseeing state investments, ensuring taxpayer dollars are efficiently spent, and ensuring financial transparency.\n\nMany large asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have infamously pushed controversial policies through proxy voting.\n\nHere are some of BlackRock and Baillie Gifford\u2019s most egregious proxy votes:\n\nIn April 2021, BlackRock, which owns 7.5 percent of Abbott Labs, pushed the company to publish a report disclosing the company\u2019s plan to promote racial justice. BlackRock pushed for the move against the wishes of Abbott\u2019s leadership. In a comment about its vote for the proposal, BlackRock commented, \u201cWe recognize the Company\u2019s efforts to date, but believe that supporting the proposal may accelerate company\u2019s progress on material social issues.\u201d\n\nIn May 2021, BlackRock urged United Parcel Services (UPS), of which Blackrock owns 7.3 percent, to issue a report on how the company plans to reduce emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of reducing global temperatures by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius. BlackRock voted for this proposal, commenting, \u201c We are supportive of the company\u2019s efforts to date with respect to this material climate issue but believe that voting in favor may accelerate the company\u2019s progress.\u201d\n\nIn May 2022, BlackRock, which owns 6.8 percent of Home Depot, pushed the company to adopt a shareholder proposal to \u201coversee an independent racial equity audit analyzing Home Depot\u2019s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations, employees, and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed.\u201d BlackRock commented, \u201cWe believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to have access to greater disclosure on this issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nState financial officers have fought back against this sort of leftist encroachment in corporate America.\n\nFor instance, in 2023, 20 state financial officers sent a joint letter to 20 asset management firms and two proxy advisors demanding answers on their approach to shareholders\u2019 proposals.\n\nThe same year, Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ (R) blacklisted 13 financial institutions deemed to be boycotting the energy industry.\n\nIn 2022, Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, banned BlackRock and nine other finance firms from working with the Lone Star State after they declared their hostility to fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cThe environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,\u201d Hegar said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe strong pushback against ESG, in part from state financial officers, led BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in 2023 to lament that he no longer uses the term \u201cESG\u201d as it has been \u201cweaponized.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a mandate to keep fighting to protect the American people\u2019s money from the disaster that is woke political ideology,\u201d Oleka concluded.\n\nUtah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks, the State Financial Officers Foundation national chairman, told Breitbart News, \u201cThese results are certainly encouraging, but not surprising. Families in Utah and nationwide care deeply about their financial security, not just for themselves but for future generations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see radical forces and ideologies being financed with their dollars and rightly expect us to push back. That\u2019s what every SFOF member is doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t rest until these political movements are no longer threatening Americans with our own money to put far-left politics over retirement profits,\u201d he vowed."

            "full_content": "Photo: Paul Christian Gordon/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAcross the country, critics of Elon Musk have taken to town-hall meetings and sidewalk demonstrations to protest the Tesla CEO\u2019s outsize role in the federal government that has resulted in mass layoffs and steep cuts among agencies. But some detractors have escalated their dissent, vandalizing Tesla dealerships and charging stations, many times with arson, to send a message to the world\u2019s richest man and his political partner, Donald Trump.\n\nIn the days since, the Trump administration has rallied behind Musk with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi denouncing the Tesla vandalism as a form of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d and vowing to prosecute the perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law. Bondi made good on her promise on Thursday announcing that the Justice Department has levied charges against three people accused of using Molotov cocktails to destroy Tesla property.\n\n\u201cThe days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\u201d Bondi said in a statement. \u201cLet this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Bondi announces \"severe charges\" aimed at \"wave of domestic terrorism\" against Tesla dealerships/charging stations. pic.twitter.com/e9mL2mgV3p \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) March 20, 2025\n\nOn Friday, Trump jumped in with his own bluster, writing in a Truth Social post that \u201cI look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!\u201d\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s press release, the Justice Department did not name the three individuals but outlined their actions in incidents that occurred in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina. Though the announcement was new, it appeared to be more of a summary of recent actions undertaken by the Justice Department in multiple states over the past few weeks.\n\nIn Oregon, one person was arrested after allegedly throwing multiple Molotov cocktails at a Salem Tesla dealership. Per the agency, they were also armed with a suppressed AR-15 rifle. This account lines up with the arrest of Adam Matthew Lansky, a 41-year-old man whom the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Oregon reported was charged earlier this month with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in South Carolina, 24-year-old Daniel Clarke-Pounder was witnessed spray-painting \u201cF*ck Trump\u201d and \u201cLong Live Ukraine\u201d in red at Tesla charging stations, and reportedly he later used five Molotov cocktails to destroy the chargers. He was arrested and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.\n\nIn Colorado, an individual was arrested after attempting to light Teslas on fire with Molotov cocktails at a dealership, the agency noting that they were found \u201cin possession of materials used to produce additional incendiary weapons.\u201d In February, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Colorado announced 42-year-old Lucy Grace Nelson had been charged with one count of malicious destruction of property.\n\nThe FBI is said to be investigating more recent incidents at Tesla dealerships. On Tuesday, Teslas at a Las Vegas\u2013area center were set on fire and shot numerous times. Musk himself responded to a video of the burning cars on social media. \u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d"

            "full_content": "It isn\u2019t just Republicans getting an earful at local town halls in the wake of President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s federal job and spending cuts.\n\nFrom Colorado to Maryland, Democrats, too, this week have faced fired-up crowds who want them to step up their fight against Trump. The anger has intensified since Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, prompting questions about whether party leaders are up to the task.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers also distanced themselves from Schumer, dumping further criticism on his strategy during the funding fight.\n\nAt a town hall Wednesday evening just outside Denver, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., found himself on the receiving end of anger and criticism from voters for being too passive when it comes to battling Trump.\n\nOne attendee tore into Bennet for voting to confirm several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\n\u201cNone of this feels like you\u2019re fighting for us, for Colorado, for our kids, for our grandkids,\u201d an attendee told Bennet as the crowd cheered. \u201cThe words are great, but I\u2019m really not seeing any action.\u201d\n\nToward the beginning of the event \u2014 which Bennet held in Golden, alongside Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo. \u2014 attendees shouted for one full minute as Bennet attempted to calm the crowd.\n\n\u201cHey. Hey! We\u2019re not going to do it this way,\u201d Bennet yelled, before repeatedly shouting, \u201cStop it!\u201d\n\nBennet was also pressed on whether Schumer should remain Senate Democratic leader. He referenced his call for then-President Joe Biden to step aside during the 2024 campaign.\n\n\u201cIn dodging your question, let me just say it\u2019s important for people to know, you know, when it\u2019s time to go,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we\u2019re going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., was also grilled on how Democrats would confront Trump and Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe need to say \u2018hell no,\u2019\" one attendee told the genteel Ivey at a town hall he hosted this week in Suitland, a suburb outside of Washington. \u201cAnd thank you for being polite with us, but when it comes to fighting these fights, we need you to be a little bit less polite, a little bit more hell no, instead of a little bit no.\u201d\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., called for new Democratic leadership in the Senate. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images file\n\nIn a separate exchange, another attendee repeatedly interrupted the two-term congressman as he tried to answer someone else\u2019s question: \u201cThe House is on fire. It is not business as usual. \u2026 This is outrageous. \u2026 This is bulls---.\u201d\n\nBut Ivey drew loud applause when he became the first Democratic member of Congress to call for Schumer to step down from his post as party leader.\n\n\u201cI respect Chuck Schumer. I think he\u2019s had a great, longstanding career. He\u2019s done a lot of great things, but I\u2019m afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward,\u201d Ivey said.\n\nIn Arizona on Monday, Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego appeared before a less hostile crowd, but faced pointed questions from attendees about how they would protect programs they rely on. Kelly encouraged them to make phone calls and go to the offices of Republican members of Congress.\n\n\u201cYou show up in front of their office, tell them how pissed off you are and how bad this is for our country and how there are people inside the house that you were trying to burn down,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nA Democratic 'tea party' movement?\n\nThe town hall events underscored the increased pressure Democratic members of Congress are under from their base to use every tool possible to block Trump\u2019s agenda, even as they are limited in their role as the minority party in Washington. The scenes mirror the events of 2009, which were directed simultaneously at the Democratic governing trifecta in Washington and at members of the Republican minority who were accused of being too passive in opposition.\n\nA recent NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats want their elected representatives to stick to their positions and hold the line against Trump, while 32% favor compromising with him. That\u2019s a dramatic shift from Trump\u2019s first term: An April 2017 NBC News poll found that 59% of Democrats favored compromising with Trump, while 33% said lawmakers should stick to their positions.\n\nThat\u2019s also led some progressive activists to call for new leadership in Congress. It\u2019s a matter several Democrats declined to directly address this week while offering criticism of Schumer.\n\nAt a town hall in Lowell, Massachusetts, this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Schumer\u2019s decision to allow the GOP funding bill to move through the Senate was \u201cwrong,\u201d but didn\u2019t say whether he should remain the party\u2019s leader.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., dodged a question on Schumer\u2019s future at a news conference in San Francisco, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201copine on internal caucus politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do a lot better the next time a key issue like this comes up,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nFor his part, Schumer canceled a planned book tour this week amid the backlash, citing security concerns. But he has continued to defend his funding strategy in TV interviews, saying that a government shutdown would have resulted in a worse outcome for federal workers and further empower Trump and Musk. And he\u2019s brushed off calls to step down from his leadership position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the best leader for the Senate,\u201d he said Tuesday on CBS Mornings.\u201d\n\nFrustrations mount with lawmakers in both parties\n\nMeanwhile, few Republican lawmakers held town halls this week during the congressional recess after drawing angry and frustrated crowds of their own earlier this year. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised members against holding in-person town halls.\n\nOne who did though, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., faced heckles and boos Wednesday night in Laramie, Wyoming, as she tried to downplay concerns about Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with federal government,\u201d Hageman said, adding that the attendees\u2019 \u201chysteria is just really over the top.\u201d\n\nAnd not every Democrat who has held a town hall in recent days received an icy reception.\n\nAt a Wednesday town hall in Frederick, Maryland, Democratic Reps. April McClain Delaney and Jamie Raskin faced a largely friendly, energized crowd that cheered lines about protecting Medicaid and Social Security and stopping DOGE in the courts, as well as hints of impeaching Trump if Democrats retake the House in 2026. (Raskin is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and any impeachment push would start in his committee.)\n\nStill, several constituents told NBC News they were frustrated by a lack of \u201csubstance\u201d at the town hall.\n\nJuliana Lufkin, 33, a self-employed resident of Hagerstown, said the lawmakers were \u201ctooting their own horns\u201d when she would\u2019ve liked to hear a strategy for combating Trump.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve liked to hear the plan, instead of a little bit of tooting their own horns and saying the things they\u2019re doing and the things that we can do. This is not the leadership that we all hope for,\u201d Lufkin said."

            "full_content": "A series of swatting incidents targeting conservative commentators and journalists have transpired nearly every evening since March 11, according to X posts in which the victims shared video surveillance footage and photos of the events, sparking questions as to who is engaging in what Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) called \u201cdomestic terrorism and attempted murder.\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have also reacted to the wave of dangerous crimes.\n\nThe term \u201cswatting\u201d refers to an anonymous attacker targets someone by making a false call to emergency services \u2014 using anonymous tools like Google Voice or VPNs to make it appear the call is coming from a certain location \u2014 and telling authorities a murder or hostage event is transpiring at a particular address. Swatting is designed to prompt SWAT teams to arrive at the targeted home and descend on unsuspecting victims, which in the past has lead to deadly encounters and murder charges for the offender.\n\nAt the time of this writing, at least 15 figures in conservative politics and media have reported being swatted within the course of one week.\n\nThe string of swatting incidents seemingly began on the evening of March 11, with InfoWars reporter Chase Geiser revealing in an early morning March 12 X post that six to eight \u201cpolice officers used a PA system to call me by name and order me to walk out of my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was handcuffed in the middle of the street, presumably at gunpoint, though I couldn\u2019t tell because of the light being shined on my face,\u201d Geiser recalled. \u201cI was then led into the house where my wife was woken up and we were informed that they received a call from someone pretending to be me and threatening to kill my family.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nGeiser told Breitbart News that he was swatted \u201ctwice in one day, so I was bracing for the second one.\u201d He also noted that the incident occurred \u201cjust days after our reporter Jamie White was murdered.\u201d\n\nThe InfoWars journalist further surmised the swatting attacks are \u201ccoordinated\u201d adding that he believes they are \u201cconnected to antagonism toward Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese violent times have violent ends,\u201d Geiser said, adding, \u201cTo hell with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe following night, independent journalist Nick Sortor announced his family was swatted after his sister received a menacing email.\n\n\u201cBoth my dad and my sister were swatted tonight,\u201d Sortor wrote in an X post published in the early morning hours of March 13. \u201cA dozen cops attempted to kick my dad\u2019s door in at gunpoint. This is literal fucking terrorism. And the FBI should treat it as such.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore calling in the swat, this dumbshit sent my sister an email calling me a Nazi, of course. So the motive is clear,\u201d the journalist continued. \u201cIn my dad\u2019s case, the caller told police my dad was killing my entire family, requiring them to intervene with deadly force.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is nothing short of attempted murder. They wanted the police to kill my father,\u201d Sortor asserted.\n\nThe journalist suspected the attacker\u2019s motive was to encourage him to end his work in conservative media.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for the swatter, I WILL NOT stop. I WILL NOT shut up. And you WILL NOT win,\u201d Sortor declared. \u201cIf anything, my family is behind me even more than they were before. Because they just got a first hand look at the forces I\u2019m fighting with on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nConservative commentator Gunther Eagleman \u2014 who boasts 1.3 million followers on X \u2014 also took to social media to reveal he had been swatted the following day.\n\n\u201cSome ignorant fuck called in a fake hostage situation,\u201d Eagleman said. \u201cFortunately, I have good relations with law enforcement, and extra patrols will be added. I don\u2019t tolerate threats and will find the culprit.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up post, Eagleman shared photos of authorities outside his home, and praised them for \u201cquickly\u201d realizing the incident stemmed from a false report.\n\n\u201cWe have one hell of a SWAT unit out here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThankful for their commitment to ensuring safety and glad they QUICKLY understood what happened.\u201d\n\nEagleman told Breitbart News that the swatting unfolded with his family being held at gunpoint by authorities until his house was cleared, but noted the matter was rapidly deescalated.\n\nThe conservative commentator added that pizza his family never ordered was sent to his residence \u201ca few months ago,\u201d cash on delivery, \u201cthen the swatting on Thursday with another pizza order 30 minutes after the swatting.\u201d\n\nLike others who have been targeted, the receipt for the pizza included specific instructions for the delivery driver to \u201cbang on door.\u201d\n\nAs the multiple swatting incidents began circulating on social media, nationally syndicated conservative radio talk show host Joe Pagliarulo revealed in a March 13 X post, \u201cI was swatted two nights ago.\u201d\n\nPagliarulo shared video footage of the incident, explaining he had initially decided to refrain from disclosing the attack because he didn\u2019t want to give it \u201coxygen,\u201d but changed his mind after seeing it was not an isolated event, and hoping that shedding light on the matter may help others being targeted.\n\nThe conservative radio host explained that at 2:35 a.m. he received an alert on his phone notifying him that a home security camera sensed \u201cmovement at the front door.\u201d\n\nPagliarulo said that upon examining the footage, he saw \u201ca guy holding an AR-15, with a cap on, looking in my window,\u201d and was not immediately certain that the armed man outside his home was an officer.\n\n\u201cNow, at that point, you say to yourself, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got a rifle, too,'\u201d Pagliarulo said, adding that he instead decided to call the police on the off chance he was being swatted.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nThe radio host said the 911 dispatcher confirmed police were at his residence and informed him authorities had received a report claiming \u201cdogs have been shot, people were bleeding, and people were hiding\u201d inside his house.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018None of that\u2019s happening, please tell them to stand down. I\u2019ll come out with my hands up while I have you on the phone with me, and I\u2019ll explain what\u2019s going on,'\u201d Pagliarulo recalled.\n\n\u201cThankfully, one [of the officers] knew that it was me, and we had a conversation,\u201d the radio host added.\n\nPagliarulo deemed the swatting incident \u201ca tactic of the left.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tactic of those who don\u2019t like my politics,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir hope is to either scare you \u2014 or have you come out and confront the police officers and get killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I would have grabbed my AR-15 or my pistol and walked out the front door, I would have been dead in my doorway,\u201d Pagliarulo asserted. \u201cHad I taken any other action, I might have been killed at my house that night \u2014 and maybe that\u2019s the result they want.\u201d\n\nLater that evening, conservative commentator and host of LFA TV\u2019s UNGOVERNED Shawn Farash announced, \u201cI\u2019m being swatted right now\u201d in an X post.\n\nIn a follow-up post, Farash revealed that multiple pizzas he did not order were delivered to his address from at least two separate establishments.\n\n\u201cNow Dominoes showed up to the house,\u201d the conservative commentator wrote in a post one hour after his swatting announcement, adding, \u201cWe did not accept the pizza.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow Papa John\u2019s showed up,\u201d Farash revealed in a follow-up post, to which Eagleman replied by sharing that he, too, had received an unwanted pizza delivery surrounding his own swatting incident.\n\nFarash elaborated on the incident in a video posted to social media, stating, \u201cOfficers said they received a phone call that somebody murdered somebody in the house and was planning a suicide by cop,\u201d adding that he and his wife \u201ccooperated with police.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were very nice,\u201d Farash said. \u201cThey were not aware that this was going on across the country.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cIf not for the professionalism of our Sheriff\u2019s Department in Rutherford County, Tennessee, it could have been much worse,\u201d Farash told Breitbart News. \u201cBoth my wife and I have never had guns pointed at us before and that changed on Thursday, March 13th.\u201d\n\n\u201cI absolutely believe these attacks are coordinated due to the fact that many people who have been swatted had identical experiences, similar 911 calls, and the delivery of pizza to their homes with the same instructions to \u2018bang on the door\u2019 as well,\u201d Farash added.\n\nWhen asked if he noticed any patterns regarding those who are being targeted via swatting attacks, Farash \u2014 like Geiser and Pagliarulo \u2014 surmised it may have something to do with conservatives\u2019 commentary about Ukraine, adding, \u201cbut that hasn\u2019t been confirmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal here I believe is to scare people in to silence, much like the \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019 label scared parents away from school board meetings in 2021 and 2022,\u201d Farash presumed.\n\n\u201cWhile this will be difficult to trace, I believe it can and will be done thanks to new leadership at the FBI and the seriousness of these attacks,\u201d he added. \u201cThankfully, we remained safe and I hope that others can say the same thing if it happens to them. I believe those behind this will be caught and punished to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\nThe night after Farash\u2019s home was targeted \u2014 during the early morning hours of March 14 \u2014 independent investigative journalist Walter Curt proclaimed, \u201cWas just swatted\u201d in a 3:30 a.m. X post.\n\nCurt shared video footage of the incident and advised others to \u201csimply comply\u201d with authorities if they find themselves in a similar situation.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nCurt told Breitbart News that while he was surprised he was targeted, he fortunately \u201cdid not panic\u201d when he awoke in the middle of the night to find himself being swatted, as he had \u201cjust written an article about the swattings earlier in the evening\u201d and \u201cit was still fresh in my mind.\u201d\n\nThe journalist was nonetheless perplexed as to \u201cwhy exactly\u201d he was attacked, citing having only around 50,000 X followers at the time of the incident, and being \u201ca small account in comparison to the others who were targeted.\u201d\n\nCurt added that he believes this is a coordinated attack stemming from \u201ca single group\u201d using similar voice changers when placing fake calls to authorities across the country.\n\nLike the others who were assailed, Curt noted having been sent unordered pizza, adding that he and others have noticed a pattern of \u201creceiving pizzas within one day of the swatting, and all of them are the exact same order, and the phone numbers all link back to the local PD dispatch.\u201d\n\nCurt also told Breitbart News he believes it is unlikely that swatting targets are being chosen based on their Ukraine-related commentary, as \u201cthe list of people is growing daily,\u201d and while all of the victims are conservative, everyone\u2019s political commentary involves a wide range of topics.\n\n\u201cThe only link truly appears to be the X platform,\u201d Curt said, surmising the attacks could perhaps be adjacent to the left\u2019s targeting of Elon Musk, whose Tesla dealerships and vehicles have been blitzed with arson in recent months.\n\nThe same night Curt was attacked, the popular X account Catturd \u2014 who boasts 3.6 million followers on Musk\u2019s platform \u2014 revealed in a 3:45 a.m. post, \u201cI was just swatted again for the 4th time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live in the middle of nowhere and know all the cops here (because of the past swattings),\u201d Catturd explained. \u201cThey knew what it was immediately and just called me and sent one officer who I just had a great conversation with. Really nice guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the number they called from and will turn all the info over to the FBI today,\u201d Catturd added. \u201cMy last two swatters are sitting in prison right now, this new one will be joining them soon.\u201d\n\nConservative writer Mike Engleman responded to Catturd\u2019s post, declaring that he, too, was swatted that night \u2014 at 1:30 a.m.\n\nOn Friday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel addressed \u201cthe alarming rise in \u2018Swatting\u2019 incidents targeting media figures\u201d in an X post, declaring, \u201cThe FBI is aware of this dangerous trend, and my team and I are already taking action to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d Patel continued. \u201cWeaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers. That will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to working with local law enforcement to crack down on these crimes,\u201d the FBI director added, promising, \u201cMore updates to come.\u201d\n\nThen on Saturday night, conservative commentator Matt Van Swol announced in an X post, \u201cI am being swatted right now,\u201d later adding, \u201cA call was made saying that I had murdered my wife and I was hiding in the basement with a gun.\u201d\n\nVan Swol shared footage of the incident, imploring his followers to \u201cwatch and understand how this could have gone horribly wrong if this was you and your home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nLike other swatting victims, Van Swol also noted a \u201cpizza delivery has arrived,\u201d adding, \u201cThe phone number used to place the order was the number for our police department.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up post, Van Swol revealed he had a long phone call with one of the police officers who responded to the swatting call, adding, \u201cHe was so upset. We both acknowledged how the situation could have gone terribly wrong, for both of us.\u201d\n\nThe officer \u201calso informed me that two ambulances, a fire truck, and nearly every cop on duty that night in the entire county was staged or rushing to stage at our home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough it was scary for us, it was also absolutely terrifying for the police force in Western North Carolina as well,\u201d Van Swol added. \u201cI want to commend the officer who calmly assessed the situation under extreme stress, his level head saved lives.\u201d\n\nVan Swol told Breitbart News the police record from the swatting attack was \u201chorrifying to read,\u201d explaining that police had falsely believed multiple men were inside his house, shooting people.\n\n\u201cI have three kids who were asleep in their beds at the time of the swatting,\u201d he added.\n\nVan Swol said that before being targeted, he was already aware of swatting attacks transpiring across the country, and had therefore personally walked into his local police department to warn them of a potential false report.\n\n\u201cI thought I was crazy for even doing it, and even I did not expect it to happen to me,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cthe information was not passed along to the officers working that evening and it was a complete surprise to everyone,\u201d Van Swol said.\n\nLike Curt, Van Swol also surmised the swatting attacks have \u201conly to do with voices on X.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Townhall columnist Dustin Grage took to X to reveal that he and his family had been swatted on Saturday night as well, adding, \u201cShortly after, we were also delivered pizzas we never ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot every victim of swatting has the same relationship with law enforcement as our family, nor may they have as excellent police departments,\u201d Grage said. \u201cSome aren\u2019t as fortunate, and innocent people lose their lives as a result.\u201d\n\nThe Townhall columnist went on to say, \u201cWe aren\u2019t taking this lightly. We are treating this threat seriously and see it no differently than an intentional attack on the lives of my wife, our young children, and myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery law enforcement resource available will be used to track down whoever is responsible for these swatting attempts,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will also be lobbying the highest levels of government to ensure justice is served and to push for stronger deterrents against future acts of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThen on Sunday evening, Sean George \u2014 an elected delegate for the state of Nebraska and coffee company owner, known as Beard Vet on social media \u2014 proclaimed, \u201cWelp\u2026 Add me to the SWATTED List\u201d in an X post.\n\nGeorge told Breitbart News the incident occurred during the early hours of Sunday morning, at 2:43 a.m.\n\n\u201cI hope they find the perpetrators behind this and charge them with the highest crime they can,\u201d George said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s definitely a domestic terrorism, attempted murder case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have full faith in the authorities, and hopefully they can track these people down and bring them to justice,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the meantime, swatting attacks against conservatives continued into the following week, according to columnist Larry Taunton and Trump campaign media surrogate Chad Caton, who both reported becoming targets during the early hours of Monday morning.\n\n\u201cI was in bed, but noticed Ranger, my German shepherd, was on the prowl, his ears up,\u201d Taunton recalled. \u201cI then saw a flicker of light on my BR door. Ranger went to investigate, I got my gun.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI saw the silhouette of a man on my deck with an AR15,\u201d Taunton continued. \u201cI could hear whispers and saw two other men also in body armor, heavily armed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI turned on a light and told them to identify themselves,\u201d the conservative columnist explained. \u201cThey did as you\u2019ll see, by I kept my weapon. It de-escalated from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe officers told me they\u2019d received a call from someone claiming to be in my home and hiding while I shot people,\u201d Taunton added of the fake 911 call.\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cThese were good guys, just doing their jobs,\u201d Taunton stressed, but reminded his followers, \u201cThis might have been a bloodbath\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for \u201crestraint on both sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was an attempt to get me and my wife killed. It ended in smiles, handshakes,\u201d Taunton said.\n\nTaunton told Breitbart News, \u201cThis is fundamentally who leftists are these days. It\u2019s like what you\u2019re seeing with the burning of Teslas and the burning of cities in 2020. When they don\u2019t get their way, they adopt terrorist tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is. This is terrorism,\u201d Taunton continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to assassinate people by proxy. They\u2019re weaponizing local police and sheriff\u2019s departments as proxy assassination squads. And they don\u2019t care who gets killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care if police officers, deputies get killed, if I get killed, my wife and children,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re creating, very knowingly, a highly combustible atmosphere where this could happen.\u201d\n\nTaunton also pointed out that more lives in other parts of town could be put at risk due to police departments putting all of their resources into addressing false swatting calls.\n\n\u201cNot only can [fake 911 calls] get me or police killed, but let\u2019s say you live on the other side of the county or town, and you have a genuine emergency, and all resources are over at my house chasing down a bogus call, that\u2019s terrible,\u201d he said.\n\nCaton, meanwhile, shared photos of a similar event transpiring at his house the same night, telling Breitbart News the incident unfolded at 3:00 a.m. when he \u201cheard a bang at the door\u201d followed by his dog barking.\n\n\u201cI reached for my sidearm, of course, thinking I\u2019m being broken into, but then I remembered all my buddies had been getting swatted,\u201d Caton said. \u201cI put my gun down and walked in my living room. My glass door was filled with lights and an officer yelling at me to put my hands up.\u201d\n\nFrom there, police ordered Caton to walk to his door and open it slowly, \u201cThen they put me in handcuffs and asked who else was in the house. I said my wife was still in the house, and my dog,\u201d he said.\n\nCaton explained that his wife was then ordered to come to the door with her hands up.\n\n\u201cI will never forget standing behind one of the officers with a rifle trained on my door, and seeing my wife open the door with a rifle pointed at her head. And I just kept saying to him, \u2018Please don\u2019t shoot my wife,'\u201d Caton told Breitbart News.\n\nOnce Caton and his wife were outside, \u201call the officers lined up at the front door with their hands on each other\u2019s shoulders and their rifles trained inside my house, they then, just like the movies, went through and cleared my whole house,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir dog, who Caton\u2019s wife had locked in a separate room for safety measures, was then let out so that officers could clear that room as well. After authorities decided the area was secure, they removed the handcuffs and explained why they had arrived.\n\n\u201cThey said that they got a call from me, Chad Caton, that I was in my house, hiding, and that there were armed gunmen in my house,\u201d Caton told Breitbart News of the fake 911 call.\n\nLater that day, at around 6:00 p.m., \u201cI started getting pizzas delivered to my house, constantly,\u201d Caton added. \u201cThat\u2019s their [the attackers\u2019] calling card. They send pizzas after the swatting.\u201d\n\nAfter that, former nurse and alleged Bill Clinton rape victim Juanita Broaddrick \u2014 who announced on Friday that three pizzas she did not order were delivered to her house, also with instructions to \u201cbang on the door\u201d \u2014 revealed on Monday night that she, too, had been swatted.\n\n\u201cAbout ten police and swat team showed up,\u201d Broaddrick said. \u201cThey said the caller said there were two masked men and people inside had been shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shit needs to stop,\u201d she added.\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cWhoever is doing this needs to face justice,\u201d Elon Musk said in response to Broaddrick\u2019s post.\n\nThe latest swatting incident occurred on Tuesday night, according to InfoWars reporter Owen Shroyer, who shared harrowing footage of himself being detained by authorities outside his house after a fake call was made to police.\n\nShroyer shared several videos from the incident, including one captured on his cellphone that showcased how the swatting unfolded.\n\n\u201cI assure you, this is a nonstarter, gentlemen,\u201d the InfoWars journalist says to police, who respond by ordering him to remove his shirt and walk backwards, toward the officers, with his hands on his head.\n\nWhile approaching the officers, Shroyer adds, \u201cJust so you guys know, I\u2019m home alone.

Officers can then be seen descending on Shroyer\u2019s now-empty house, shouting, \u201cAustin Police Department, make yourself known! Come to the front door!\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cHere come the pizzas,\u201d Shroyer declared in an X post the following afternoon, sharing multiple videos of the bizarre pizza deliveries that infamously arrive before or after each swatting attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi reacted to the swatting crisis in an interview with Fox News, calling the incidents \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d adding that the Department of Justice is taking the matter \u201cvery, very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking into all of these swatting investigations,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cThey are not practical jokes. They are meant to terrorize the individuals within the homes, and they risk the lives of law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino also responded to the swatting incidents, declaring in a Wednesday night X post, \u201cCommunication and transparency are my priorities. We work for you, the American citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur teams are actively working on the Tesla incidents and the swatting incidents, along with our other responsibilities to keep the Homeland safe,\u201d Bongino added.\n\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will not sit idly by as conservative new media and their families are being targeted by false swatting,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a Wednesday X post.\n\nNoem added that the Department of Homeland Security \u201chas the ability to trace phone numbers and track location information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will use it to hunt these cowards down. This is an attack on our law enforcement and innocent families and we will prosecute it as such,\u201d Noem said.\n\n\u201cSwatting is domestic terrorism and attempted murder,\u201d Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) said on Monday. \u201cToo many of my constituents are being targeted by Leftists, hoping to silence their speech.\u201d \u201cThis is not a game. It\u2019s political violence. Someone could get killed. Congress must act NOW,\u201d Ogles added.\n\n\u201cAnyone found guilty of swatting someone else regardless of political affiliation should be tried for attempted murder,\u201d Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ) declared on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis needs to be investigated and prosecuted as a RICO conspiracy,\u201d Sen.

            "full_content": "Anti-immigrant activist and presidential adviser Stephen Miller speaks to Trump in the Oval Office. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump campaigned in 2024 on a promise to launch the \u201clargest mass deportation in history\u201d of undocumented immigrants. It was one of his more popular promises, too, though polls show varying degrees of support for this effort depending on how sweeping it is and how much collateral damage to rights (and to the economy) is involved.\n\nFor all the noise and heat ICE raids are generating, large-scale deportations of illegal immigrants are rolling out slowly because they will require both significant new dollars that Congress has yet to provide, along with major requisitions of state and local law-enforcement resources. But at the same time, the administration is also challenging legal immigration, and those who have benefited from it in the past. Here are the four different avenues the administration appears to be pursuing to go after people legally in this country.\n\n.\n\nThe Trump administration is targeting people who have Temporary Protected Status, which protects them from deportation, because they are refugees from war-torn or tyrannical countries. During the campaign, Trump talked a lot about Venezuelan and Haitian migrants who were supposedly terrorizing American cities. But it still came as a surprise to Venezuelans \u2014 many of them avid Trump supporters \u2014 who at one fell swoop lost their TPS status when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled it on February 1. This action stripped 348,000 Venezuelan refugees of their right to stay in the country as of April.\n\nThe exposure to mass deportations of previously legal Venezuelan refugees has been fuzzed up significantly by the administration\u2019s claims that the people ICE is rounding up and flying to prisons in El Salvador are all members of violent gangs (claims that have produced a potentially catastrophic collision with the federal judiciary). But the TPS revocation applies to everyone, criminal or noncriminal, and represents a major restriction in legal immigration.\n\nVenezuelans are just the first group to lose TPS status; a previous extension for this group happened to expire earliest. On February 20, Noem also canceled TPS for Haitians beginning in August. That will expose about 300,000 legal immigrants to deportation.\n\n.\n\nIn recent weeks there have been reports of the Trump administration deporting immigrants who have permanent-residence status (known as a \u201cgreen card\u201d) or are in the country legally on various visas. The deportations have mostly been justified on national-security grounds, though nearly all of them are being challenged in federal courts. As my colleague Chas Danner explained, legal or illegal immigration status appears to have been disregarded entirely in such cases:\n\nThese incidents have come as President Trump cracks down on all kinds of immigration and as international tourists are reportedly canceling or reconsidering their U.S. travel plans in response to various administration policies. But it can be difficult to determine whether these are isolated cases of routine enforcement or whether they presage a new era of arbitrary punishment. Last week\u2019s arrest of green-card holder and former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was clearly political \u2014 which he is now calling attention to \u2014 while other cases seem more happenstance.\n\nRecent deportees have included those holding student visas, \u201chigh-skills\u201d H1-B visas, and even tourist visas. Again, these are not the \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants Trump promised to deport; they are fully documented. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\n\n.\n\nOn his very first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that purportedly ended \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d though the 14th Amendment says quite clearly, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d The administration is advancing a fringe argument that the children of undocumented immigrants are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. Trump\u2019s order would also deny birthright citizenship to anyone whose parents weren\u2019t at least permanent residents. As NPR explained, this is a deliberately provocative decision:\n\nAlready, three federal judges in three different states have blocked Trump\u2019s executive order voiding birthright citizenship, and three separate appeals courts have refused to unblock those court orders. Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee in Washington state, was the first judge to block Trump\u2019s executive order, calling it \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nBut Thursday, in three separate \u2014 but nearly identical \u2014 filings, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to narrow the lower court orders, which apply nationwide, so that the administration could begin planning to put into effect its new policy against birthright citizenship.\n\nThe administration may have put a toe in the water on this issue via the deportation of a 10-year-old citizen who was in the country to secure life-saving medical treatment, as NBC News reports:\n\nA family that was deported to Mexico hopes they can find a way to return to the U.S. and ensure their 10-year-old daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, can continue her brain cancer treatment.\n\nImmigration authorities removed the girl and four of her American siblings from Texas on Feb. 4, when they deported their undocumented parents.\n\n.\n\nStill another frontier in restricting legal immigration was initially broached during the first Trump administration: revoking naturalizations. This harkened back to a Cold War\u2013era drive to denaturalize communist citizens, as USA Today explains:\n\nThe Supreme Court put an end to politically driven denaturalization campaigns in 1967, ruling that the government could only revoke an immigrant\u2019s citizenship in the case of fraud or \u201cwillful misrepresentation.\u201d\n\nIn the quarter century before Trump first took office, from 1990 to 2017, the U.S. government targeted an average of 11 naturalized citizens per year, according to Frost\u2019s research.\n\nMost of those had committed war crimes or other atrocities, then lied about their past to obtain citizenship.\n\n\u201cIn the first Trump administration, we saw quite a large increase in the number of denaturalization proceedings,\u201d Burke Robertson said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear his (new) administration seems to be starting where they left off.\u201d\n\nNow Axios reports that denaturalization is back on the front burner:\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be on the horizon are denaturalization cases,\u201d said Mike Davis, a close White House ally and founder of the conservative Article III Project.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have Hamas supporters who have been naturalized within the last 10 years, and they are eligible to lose their status as citizens and get deported,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nGiven what we know about this administration\u2019s rather broad definition of \u201cHamas supporters,\u201d a lot of people are probably going to lose their citizenship along with their First Amendment rights."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nSummary The used Tesla market is struggling, with searches decreasing 16% while prices fall at double the rate of average used cars.\n\nSome Tesla owners report buyer's remorse amid vandalism concerns and personal feelings about CEO Elon Musk's government role.\n\nData shows Tesla loyalty declining in Democratic-leaning states while slightly increasing in Republican-leaning states.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have publicly supported Tesla, with Trump offering to purchase one at full price.\n\nAnalysts attribute Tesla's challenges to increased competition, with 76 used electric vehicle models now available compared to 58 last year.\n\nAs Elon Musk continues to take an outsized and controversial role in the US government, reports of harassment of Tesla owners and vandalism of showrooms and vehicles are on rise. That may, in part, be contributing to plunging resale values and interest in used Teslas in the United States.\n\nThough Tesla has enjoyed the attention of President Donald Trump, its stock price has erased all of its gains since Election Day. It reported its first-ever drop in global sales last year, and it faces stiff competition in China and slumping sales in Europe. In the United States, Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, has faced blowback for his cost-cutting actions in the federal government.\n\nDespite the record low prices for a Tesla on the used market and a prominent advertisement by the president of the United States, the cars have been having a tough time finding buyers, according to a March survey from Cars.com.\n\nSearches for used Teslas decreased 16% over the past month, while demand for used non-Tesla electric vehicles has increased 28% over the past year.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just internet searches. CarGurus, a car-buying site, found that used Tesla prices are falling at more than double the rate of the average used car price. The Cybertruck, the controversial steel-sided pickup, fared the worst of any Tesla vehicle, with a resale value 58% less than its original price, according to CarGurus.\n\nDemonstrators hold anti-Tesla posters during a protest encouraging people to boycott Tesla outside the Tesla Centre Park Royal in London, Britain, March 15, 2025. Chris J Ratcliffe/Reuters\n\nTesla owners who want to sell are also having a hard time finding buyers, much less ones that will buy for a decent price. Some Tesla owners say they have buyers\u2019 remorse amid reports of vandalism and protests against Musk, as well as their personal feelings toward the CEO.\n\n\u201cI would sell it in a heartbeat if somebody offered me a decent price, but the chances of that happening probably not the case,\u201d Pam Perkins, who\u2019s from Northern California, told CNN this month.\n\nJennifer Trebb, from Ohio, traded in her Tesla Model Y a few weeks ago and took an $18,000 to $20,000 financial hit.\n\n\u201cIt did lose a vast amount of value in the short two years that I had it. It only had 10,000 miles on it,\u201d she said. But Musk\u2019s role in the government \u201cdoesn\u2019t fall in line with my morals, my beliefs, and every time I looked at the car, that\u2019s what I thought of.\u201d\n\nLose some, win some\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether the politics of Musk, its CEO, have impacted new Tesla sales in the US, and there\u2019s a lot of compounding reasons why customers could be turning away from even used, cheaper Teslas.\n\nOutside of anecdotes, there hasn\u2019t been a definite connection made between the string of attacks against Tesla vehicles and facilities and any potential loss of sales. The company was booted from a Vancouver auto show over safety concerns.\n\nThe S&P Global Index broke down sales data based on \u201cred states\u201d where Republicans won four straight presidential elections and \u201cblue states\u201d where Democrats did. It showed Tesla loyalty was waning in blue states \u2013 there, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% the next year. Repeat Tesla buyers in red states increased slightly, from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% at the end of 2024.\n\nTrump, Musk\u2019s biggest political ally, and his administration seem to be taking it on themselves to protect the brand\u2019s reputation.\n\nTrump this month hosted a de-facto advertisement for Tesla on the White House South Lawn, where he said he would purchase a Tesla at full price. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the attacks on Tesla are \u201cnothing short of domestic terrorism,\u201d and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the \u201cDemocrats were big supporters of Tesla and of electric vehicles until Elon Musk decided to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk deliver remarks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nIt may be easy to look at public outrage and say the brand is weakening, Ike Silver, assistant professor of marketing at University of Southern California told CNN, but the reality is more complicated: As it\u2019s losing followers in one demographic, it could pick up fans in another.\n\n\u201cThe noise, the protests, make it seem as if the brand is sort of dropping, but the brand is strengthening among a different target audience, which is people on the right,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThe question is will the number of new customers being brought in on the right outweigh the number of angry customers who are leaving on the left.\u201d\n\nPrices don\u2019t tell a simple story\n\nDemand for used Teslas has been falling since last summer after peak interest hit the brand in May 2024, because of more inventory and Cybertrucks hit the used market, David Greene, Cars.com analyst told CNN.\n\nOne major reason the Tesla hype has faded isn\u2019t because of politics at all, but rather because of more competition. Cars.com counted 76 used EV models on the market in February, compared to 58 the year prior.\n\n\u201cTesla has to compete with all of those cars in a marketplace that they basically helped to define,\u201d Brian Moody, executive editor of car marketplace Autotrader, told CNN.\n\nThe used car market follows the new market, where Tesla has also initiated price cuts to better compete. If a car dealer is \u201csitting on your lot of used EVs, you can\u2019t sell it at the same high price you could have last week when you know all the brands just cut their prices on the new cars.\u201d Greene said.\n\nGreene also said about 70% of new EVs were leased, which could mean a bunch of used Teslas are hitting the market around the same time.\n\nAnd as far as price goes, electric vehicles tend to depreciate in value 11% more rapidly than a gasoline-powered car, Moody said. That\u2019s because customers tend to think of EVs more as technology than simple transportation, and they\u2019re more worried about battery health and whether they\u2019ll miss out on the latest updates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things happening at once (for Tesla) that it\u2019s difficult to point to any one cause,\u201d Moody said."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s the most powerful position in world sport with high stakes, high expectations and high consequences.\n\nIts occupant holds huge sway in shaping the global sporting landscape and narrative, wields extraordinary political clout, and presides over a multi-billion-dollar budget.\n\nOn Thursday, Kirsty Coventry became the latest occupant to hold this great responsibility when she was elected as the 10th President of International Olympic Committee (IOC), becoming the first woman and African to ever hold this position.\n\nCoventry, who will also be the youngest ever to assume the role at age 41, will follow in the footsteps of outgoing President Thomas Bach, who during his 12-year term has overseen one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the Olympic movement.\n\nCoventry \u2013 who will officially take the reins in June \u2013 will arrive at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe, question marks over the direction of the Olympic movement in the 21st century, and more scrutiny than ever on issues concerning gender identity and equality, among others.\n\nThe Olympic flag is raised during the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games Francois-Xavier Marit/Pool/Reuters\n\nRussia reintegration\n\nWith less than a year to go until the 2026 Winter Games in Milan-Cortina, one of the first items on the agenda will be whether and how to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes back into the Olympic fold\n\nFollowing Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the IOC imposed a blanket ban on athletes from both countries from participating in its events.\n\nJust over a year later, though, the organization approved allowing said athletes to take part in international sports tournaments as neutrals in March 2023, provided they met strict eligibility criteria.\n\nIn total, 32 athletes \u2013 17 Russian and 15 Belarusian passport holders \u2013 ended up accepting the IOC\u2019s invitation to compete under the Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) flag at last year\u2019s Paris Games.\n\nBach recently told CNN Sports that any decision moving forward should continue to be made with the best interests of the athletes and not their nationality or ongoing geopolitical events in mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Russia. It is about the athletes. Everybody who is following the rules has to have the right to participate in the Olympic Games, full stop,\u201d he told CNN Sports\u2019 Amanda Davies.\n\nRussia has already said it will fight for its participation in 2026, while Ukraine has urged the Olympic movement to hold firm and keep Russian and Belarusian athletes at bay.\n\nWith qualification events already underway for next year\u2019s showpiece event and the war in Ukraine still rumbling on, time will be of the essence.\n\nTrump presidency\n\nThen there is navigating the contentious and unpredictable Trump administration in the lead up to the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Bach has played up the relationship between the IOC and President Donald Trump and his hopes that LA will \u201cexpose the US as a sports-loving country,\u201d the US president\u2019s direct, disruptive style of leadership may severely test that resolve.\n\nTrump, perhaps more than any other world leader in Games gone by, will want to put his own stamp on proceedings.\n\nAs the host nation\u2019s head of state, he will likely help formally open the Summer Olympics on July 14, 2028.\n\nPresident Trump will likely play a role in the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cDonald Trump becomes the single most important player, the single most important figure outside of the Olympic movement,\u201d said CNN Sports analyst Christine Brennan. \u201cThis is a man who loves sports and wants to insert himself in sports every way he can.\n\n\u201cI see him being a huge force within that, and I also see him being a very disruptive force within that.\u201d\n\nTrump has already warned that visas could be denied to LA-bound competitors based on their nationality and who don\u2019t meet the administration\u2019s gender interpretations, among others.\n\nWith teams having already been denied entry into the US and relations having soured in recent months between the US and some of its long-time allies, the two-time gold medal-winning Olympic swimmer will need to tread a fine line between maintaining the IOC\u2019s principles of neutrality and universality, while also providing a pragmatic approach to ensure all 206 National Olympic Committees, plus the Refugee Olympic Team, are all present at the Athlete\u2019s Village.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback IOC President Thomas Bach talks about Trump and the 2028 Olympics 06:41 - Source: CNN IOC President Thomas Bach talks about Trump and the 2028 Olympics 06:41\n\nDSD and transgender rules\n\nAs it stands, there is currently no clear, unified approach or framework between the IOC and its International Federations (IFs) regarding the participation of athletes with differences in sex development (DSD) and transgender athletes from the local through to the national and global stage.\n\nIFs have been able to decide their own participation rules \u2013 based on fairness, inclusion and scientific evidence \u2013 following a revised framework put in place by the IOC in November 2021.\n\nSome IFs, like World Athletics, have subsequently adopted tighter regulations with stricter thresholds or additional requirements for DSD athletes, while others, like World Rugby, have taken a stronger position in banning transgender athletes from competing in elite women\u2019s competitions, citing competitive advantage and safety concerns, among others.\n\nThe lack of universal rules has been criticized for creating confusion among athletes and stakeholders.\n\nThis was especially evident during last summer\u2019s Paris Games when boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting became the targets of misinformation about their gender, triggering an onslaught of online, transphobic abuse toward athletes\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon of our world. What does social media do in such cases?\u201d Bach recently told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou had all sorts of people from all walks of life who were jumping on this without having any idea. We need to dig a little bit deeper how in this world you can really expose the facts and then discuss these facts \u2013 and then how to interpret these facts.\u201d\n\nChanges made by Coventry, who is currently Zimbabwe\u2019s sports minister, could include the implementation of standardized rules for all sports based on firm scientific evidence, with universal eligibility criteria that will help to simplify policies and subsequently help reduce current confusion.\n\nNew frontiers\n\nCoventry\u2019s eight-year mandate will run all the way through to 2033.\n\nAll Games in that window have already been picked \u2013 even the 2034 Winter Olympics, which will be staged in Salt Lake City.\n\nWith the next decade secured, attention will turn to the selection of the host for the Summer Games in 2036.\n\nIt will be the first time a decision has been taken since human rights commitments have been added to the Olympic Charter.\n\nFurthermore, the IOC has also modified its selection criteria changing the host from a single city to multiple cities, regions, or countries.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback New data: Many cities will become too warm for summer Olympics 02:51 - Source: CNN New data: Many cities will become too warm for summer Olympics 02:51\n\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, India and Indonesia, among others, have already all expressed an interest in hosting the Games.\n\nWhile there is no set timetable currently in place for a decision, the expectation is that an announcement won\u2019t be made until after 2025.\n\nWith climate concerns becoming an increasingly prominent consideration in decision-making, a review of the global sports calendar for both Summer and Winter Games could also be undertaken to allow for more interested parties to bid for the Games.\n\nSeoul 1988 and Sydney 2000, for example, hosted the summer edition of the Games in the window between September and October.\n\nAside from taking the Games to new corners of the world, the Olympic movement may also start to see a diversification of sports to cater for a younger, digital-minded audience.\n\nWith the inaugural Olympic Esports Games being held in Riyadh in 2027, a push for new forms of delivering the Games to audiences around the world in a rapidly changing entertainment-scape could also see the IOC embrace a push for technological transformation, the likes of which it has never seen before."

Department of Education\n\nPresident Donald Trump is poised to sign an executive order today to begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education, two administration officials told CNN. Last week, the DOE announced it was cutting 50% of its workforce, a move decried by unions representing federal workers and teachers. The department\u2019s civil rights office, which combats antisemitism, islamophobia, racism and discrimination against students with disabilities, was among the hardest hit. Nearly half of its staff was laid off and its regional offices in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco were closed.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP lawmaker explains why he supports dismantling the Department of Education 02:06 - Source: CNN GOP lawmaker explains why he supports dismantling the Department of Education 02:06\n\n2. Pentagon purge\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s order to remove \u201cdiversity\u201d content from all of the Pentagon\u2019s platforms has led to a massive purge of information. Tens of thousands of articles about cancer awareness, the Holocaust, the 9/11 terror attacks, sexual assault and suicide prevention were removed as was content about women, LGBTQ people and people of color \u2014 including baseball legend Jackie Robinson, who served in the US military during World War II. The automated process has led to \u201ca high level of irresponsible collateral damage,\u201d one defense official said. Separately, the Pentagon is considering making significant cuts to the top of the US military, according to a briefing document obtained by CNN and a US defense official. The plans under consideration include consolidating combatant commands, possibly eliminating a directorate that oversees development, training and education for the joint force and halting the expansion of US forces in Japan.\n\n3. Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military launched a new ground offensive in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday in an effort to \u201cexpand the security zone and to create a partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza.\u201d The move comes just one day after Israel broke a 2-month-old ceasefire with Hamas by conducting airstrikes in Gaza that killed at least 400 people, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Hamas described the latest offensive as a \u201cnew and dangerous breach,\u201d and said it remains committed to the ceasefire deal signed in January. Additional Israeli airstrikes overnight claimed at least 40 more lives, the European Hospital said.\n\n4. Taxpayer data\n\nThe IRS and the Department of Homeland Security are engaged in discussions about sharing highly confidential taxpayer data to help authorities ramp up deportations. Currently, undocumented immigrants can register with the IRS and pay taxes \u2014 and the agency is required to keep their private information confidential, except in very specific circumstances specified in the tax code. Two immigrant rights groups have already filed suit to block the effort, but on Wednesday, a district judge declined to issue an emergency order blocking the IRS from sharing the data.\n\n5. Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nScientists examining the brains of people destined to develop Alzheimer\u2019s dementia say there may be a way to keep symptoms at bay in certain patients. A new study published in the journal Lancet Neurology found that the risk of symptoms developing was cut in half if the participants had been taking an amyloid-lowering drug for about eight years. Beta amyloid plaques are known to collect between neurons in the brain and disrupt cell function. It\u2019s \u201cthe first data to suggest that there\u2019s a possibility of a significant delay in the onset of progression to symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Eric McDade, a professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis, who led the study.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSpring has officially sprung!\n\nThe vernal equinox has arrived.

And Steve Kornacki on the teams he\u2019s watching for in the opening round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know today.\n\nTrump to sign order shuttering the Education Department\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to close the Education Department today, fulfilling a yearslong pledge to dismantle the federal agency, the White House confirmed. The order will direct Education Secretary Linda McMahon to \u201ctake all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order will also direct McMahon to ensure the agency\u2019s funds do not go toward programs that advance DEI goals or gender ideology.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nMcMahon earlier this month cut the department\u2019s workforce in half, calling the job terminations the first step in shutting down the department. She vowed in her Senate confirmation hearing to work with Congress to advance Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the department.\n\nFormally closing the department requires an act of Congress. Trump has suggested that he could garner enough congressional support to do so. But even without formally shutting down the department, the administration could make it nearly impossible for employees to carry out their work, as it has done with USAID.\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s $268 billion appropriations last year represented just 4% of the federal budget. The department does not dictate curricula used in classrooms; it is largely a funding and civil rights enforcement organization, distributing money for schools with high rates of impoverished students and assisting children with disabilities. It also runs the public student loan program.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nUkraine agrees to move forward with partial ceasefire with Russia\n\nUkraine has agreed to move forward with a partial ceasefire with Russia, the Trump administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday after a phone call between the two leaders.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said that after Trump spoke to Zelenskyy by phone, the two leaders agreed \u201con a partial ceasefire against energy,\u201d according to a joint statement released by the White House. Rubio and Waltz\u2019s statement did not mention that the ceasefire would apply to civilian infrastructure as Zelenskyy suggested, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to answer questions at an afternoon news briefing asking for clarification about the discrepancy in details. The White House also rejected Kremlin demands that the U.S. stop sending intelligence and weapons to Ukraine. Read the full story here.\n\nWebsite maps Tesla owners and their personal information\n\nSome Tesla owners said they are worried that they could be targeted for vandalism after a map containing their personal information was published this week. The online map went live Monday, displaying the names, addresses and contact information of some Tesla owners and dealerships and members of the Trump administration in an attempt to whip up further backlash against Elon Musk. The website encourages visitors to commit vandalism and pushes Tesla owners to sell their vehicles.\n\nNBC News spoke to six Tesla owners or their representatives who confirmed that at least some of the information on the website was accurate, though some said that in some cases, phone numbers or addresses were out of date.

Those calls seemed to be loudest among Black people, whose dedication to the cause was the inspiration for this article. Reporter Claretta Bellamy and I spoke to nearly two dozen Black people of various ages from across the country who are boycotting retailers like Target, Walmart and Amazon about why they are abstaining from shopping at these stores. \u201cWhere you spend your money, it\u2019s an indication of where your values lie,\u201d one of those people said. \u2014 Janelle Griffith, national reporter\n\nNBCU Academy: How Keith Morrison perfects his \u2018Dateline\u2019 voice\n\nSometimes considered the \u201cgranddaddy of true crime,\u201d Keith Morrison has one of the most famous voices on television.

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: YouTube/Mark Rober\n\nThis week, engineer and practical joker Mark Rober, best known for a series in which he pranks package thieves with glitter bombs, released a characteristically elaborate two-part video. In the first section, he sneaks a lidar camera into Disney\u2019s Space Mountain to get a 3-D scan of the ride\u2019s design. In the second \u2014 the segment that has drawn much more attention \u2014 he runs a series of tests pitting a lidar-equipped test vehicle against his Tesla, which uses traditional cameras for its driver-assist and self-driving features.\n\nRober\u2019s Tesla does not come out ahead. It fails to automatically brake in multiple scenarios where the lidar-equipped car succeeds, thwarted by thick smoke, heavy spraying water, and a fake road superimposed on a foam wall. Getting a self-driving car to fall for a Wile E. Coyote trap is a pretty good bit, and Rober\u2019s video was hugely popular with his 65 million YouTube followers and beyond. It was also immediately controversial, with critics arguing that the tests were unfairly stacked against Tesla and suggesting that Rober, a former NASA engineer and Apple product designer whose past videos have contained misleading material, had rigged the result to make the company look bad. Setting aside the experiment\u2019s exact results, the video is clearly intended as a criticism of Tesla\u2019s choice to move away from technologies like lidar \u2014 a \u201cfool\u2019s errand,\u201d according to Elon Musk \u2014 in favor of cheaper but less reliable camera-based systems. Tesla\u2019s legion of online defenders has responded accordingly. \u201cMark Rober *just* DEFRAUDED Tesla [Lawsuit Likely],\u201d reads the headline of one popular response video. \u201cMark Rober Just Ended His Career,\u201d reads another.\n\nBut whatever one makes of Rober\u2019s experiment, his video marks the next stage of a subtle but significant shift on YouTube, a place where, in different but arguably no less significant ways than Twitter, the reputations of Tesla and Musk were built. For years, overlapping clusters of massively popular tech and science YouTubers \u2014 most of them studiously apolitical, or at least coy about their beliefs \u2014 have enjoyed a productive informal partnership with Musk\u2019s car company, sharing with their massive audiences their interest in and affection for the brand. This made sense: For relatively young audiences interested in engineering and science, Musk was a well-known and fairly accessible figure; for YouTubers who built audiences reviewing and talking about consumer tech, gadgetlike and novelty-rich Teslas were a great fit, as natural a subject for their channels as new iPhones or VR headsets.\n\nYouTuber Marques Brownlee, known as MKBHD (over 20 million combined subscribers), interviewed Musk and toured Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory in 2018, later calling the Tesla Model S Plaid \u201cthe best overall car in the last decade\u201d and using one as his daily driver. MKBHD competitor Zack Nelson, a.k.a. JerryRigEverything (over 9 million subscribers), gradually acquired four Teslas and made videos with and about them. For tech reviewers, science explainers, and project YouTubers, Teslas were a rich subject and source of engagement. Among an influential blob of YouTubers, they were also the default car. Linus Sebastian, who runs Linus Tech Tips (over 16 million subscribers), incorporated Teslas into his videos and walked subscribers through his (slightly reluctant) purchase. Unbox Therapy (over 24 million subscribers) bought a Model S Plaid. Engineer Simone Giertz chopped her Tesla into a \u201cTruckla,\u201d poking gentle fun at the company for its own delayed truck plans. For his part, Rober, who used his own Tesla for his new video, has spoken admiringly of Musk on numerous occasions:\n\nI feel like @elonmusk makes some announcement or demo that would be an amazing lifetime achievement for one person/company about every week. \u2014 Mark Rober (@MarkRober) May 4, 2017\n\nTech YouTube\u2019s relationship with Musk started to fray with his acquisition of Twitter in 2022, by which point Musk had become divisive in ways that many cautious general-audience YouTubers likely saw as risky. By 2024, Musk\u2019s heel turn had manifested in product form. YouTubers swarmed the release of the Cybertruck, reviewing and buying them for tests and stunts. Tesla had once again produced a vehicle that was good for engagement, and YouTubers got a lot out of it. Nelson shot his with a gun, while Brownlee reviewed his and concluded it was \u201ciconic\u201d but dangerously attention-grabbing. Elsewhere on YouTube, in a sign of things to come, criticizing and destroying Cybertrucks became a genre unto itself. Trollish, MAGA-dabbling YouTuber Cody Detwiler, a.k.a. WhistlinDiesel (over 9 million subscribers), subjected the Cybertruck to one of his over-the-top \u201cdurability tests\u201d that ended with a disabled truck and unusually harsh and earnest words for Tesla. The video supplied countless mega-viral clips to TikTok and Instagram Reels. (A second part came out two months ago; a segment in which Detwiler ripped a glued metal panel from the truck with his bare hands presaged a sales halt for a related issue this week.)\n\nMusk is now one of the most polarizing people in the country, making it difficult to talk about Tesla\u2019s products \u2014 even in the context of a gadget channel \u2014 without addressing his ownership. Brownlee, who sold his Plaid in early 2024, ditched his Cybertruck for a Rivian; despite efforts not to make too much of a spectacle of his choice, Musk took notice:\n\nNelson, meanwhile, recently released a video in which he stress tests (and destroys) his Cybertruck \u2014 a video that, like Rober\u2019s, was criticized by fans, Tesla, and Musk for being unfair. Maybe so, but it was revealing regardless: In 2024, getting your hands on a new Cybertruck was a shortcut to massive engagement; in 2025, within the YouTube economy, the shortcut to engagement is destroying your Cybertruck. (Nelson has since pledged to get rid of all his Teslas.)\n\nRober\u2019s recent video isn\u2019t explicitly anti-Tesla and doesn\u2019t call out Musk, but it has been widely perceived and treated as though it is and does. At the very least, it taps into an ambient interest in and anger about its owner \u2014 there\u2019s a real chance that some Teslas, or Tesla dealerships, are still smoldering as you read this \u2014 which is the sort of thing any successful YouTuber is acutely aware of and capable of exploiting.\n\nThat a handful of loosely affiliated popular YouTubers have adjusted their strategies around Tesla may not be hugely significant on its own. But if we\u2019re suddenly interested in who young men are listening to online, YouTube\u2019s cheery and mostly politics-averse ecosystem of tech and science personalities should be in the conversation. Their intuitions about their influential sector of the attention economy say something. Tesla used to be good for business. Now, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that."

            "full_content": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin CNN \u2014\n\nBackstage in a dressing room drinking a can of diet Mountain Dew as 900 people filled a theater in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he wouldn\u2019t be there if not for \u201cthe void.\u201d\n\nThe void is deep for Walz, who only in the last few weeks has begun to publicly address his and Kamala Harris\u2019 2024 loss with what he called \u201cthe most unsatisfying \u2018I Told You So\u2019 tour in the history of politics.\u201d He says too many Democratic leaders are still not truly grappling with how bad things are politically for them, what he believes is President Donald Trump\u2019s march toward authoritarianism or the anger and frustration at both parties building across the country.\n\n\u201cOur leadership\u2019s not going to be the charismatic DC leader or whatever. It\u2019s going to be the person who\u2019s reading the room the best of where these people are at,\u201d Walz told CNN.\n\nAs many Democratic voters have moved since November from dejection, to panic, to curdling anger at party leaders who haven\u2019t come up with a better way of fighting back, Walz\u2019s answer is a tour of Republican House districts to listen to stories of desperation, call on Democrats to lay out a policy agenda with clearer direct benefits for voters and try to build a new sense of community that he says he hadn\u2019t realized his party had lost so much.\n\nWalz has not made a final decision on running for a third term as governor next year, though he feels compelled to, if only to push back on Trump. And while he said he\u2019d feel \u201ca sense of allegiance\u201d to back Harris if she ran for president again in 2028, he tensed up a little as he answered, saying he didn\u2019t think the question was quite fair. He has deflected 2028 talk of his own, saying things like he thinks the next Democratic nominee should be young enough to have hair, but people who\u2019ve spoken to him acknowledge that running is not completely out of the question in his unexpected political journey.\n\nThat speculation is less important to him than addressing the reality of Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get very dark,\u201d Walz said, running through speculation that ranged from Trump soon ordering the arrest of a political opponent to trying to anoint a son as his successor in the White House.\n\nWhile the administration denies it defied a judge\u2019s order halting deportation flights to El Salvador over the weekend, the episode is proof to Walz that judges are set to be ignored and impeached going forward. Tuesday\u2019s statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts rebuking the president\u2019s rhetoric on impeaching judges, without naming Trump, tells Walz that Roberts is also \u201cscared of where things are going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty low-key, middle of the road guy on this stuff. And I\u2019m telling you, this is real,\u201d Walz said. \u201cMy one skill set is to see over the horizon a little bit of what\u2019s coming, and this is what\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nHope for Democratic revival, doubts about Schumer\u2019s leadership\n\nWalz was in Wisconsin not just because GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden isn\u2019t holding town halls himself, which the governor says is proof the congressman can\u2019t defend Trump\u2019s actions, but because the state has a state Supreme Court election on April 1.\n\nBoth parties have rushed to nationalize the race to determine the majority make-up of the bench \u2013 the Republican posing with a giant inflatable Trump balloon over the weekend and promising to be part of the backlash to judicial pushback on Trump, the Democrats running ads featuring Trump and Elon Musk (who\u2019s spending millions of his own money on the race) with a chainsaw.\n\nIf Democrats win in Wisconsin and then in the Virginia governor\u2019s race in November, Walz claimed, Trump\u2019s power will begin to erode as Republicans distance themselves. How that will happen when Trump is barely into a four-year term and already exerting executive power in unprecedented ways, and how Democrats keep their spirits up when even their chance at getting more power in the midterms is 18 months away, Walz is not sure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any limit to where he goes. The limit will be what the American public will put up with and when they push back,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThis has happened everywhere when these authoritarians have come in. One day it looks like they\u2019re absolutely infallible and in total power, and the next day they and their entire families are gone.\u201d\n\nWhat Walz is sure of is that Democrats who are counting on Trump overreaching or the pendulum just swinging back are delusional \u2013 and that it\u2019s not enough from the Democratic leaders basing their pitches around saying that what Trump is doing is not why people voted for him or that prices still haven\u2019t gone down.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re missing the people who stayed home that don\u2019t see us as any different. And I think just saying \u2018Trump did all that,\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that necessarily helps us,\u201d Walz said.\n\nWalz says he\u2019s also sure that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer didn\u2019t measure up with the way he handled last week\u2019s spending fight.\n\nThough he wouldn\u2019t answer if he has faith in the Senate minority leader going forward, Walz dismissed Schumer\u2019s talking point that he knows what to do because he\u2019s won Senate races before, including during the first Trump term.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a danger \u2013 and I would argue I did it maybe during the campaign \u2013 of fighting the last battle instead of the next one,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThis is a whole different opponent fighting a whole different battle. And all of our past history that tells us how we should have approached this, I don\u2019t think holds true.\u201d\n\nTrump-district Democrats worry about Walz\u2019s \u201cred district tourism\u201d\n\nThe House GOP campaign arm taunting Walz ahead of his Eau Claire stop and Trump\u2019s campaign manager Chris LaCivita challenging him to a fight on X aren\u2019t the only skeptics.\n\nSeveral Democratic operatives associated with candidates who did better than the presidential ticket last year told CNN they are annoyed and confused by Walz\u2019s assessment that most Trump 2024 voters are lost causes for Democrats. Some feel the same way about his tour, arguing that he\u2019s bringing a kind of politics that didn\u2019t work and is already of the past to parts of the country where Democrats are only going to win by creating distance.\n\nBut in a measure of how much even disgruntled Democrats still personally like Walz, several told CNN they didn\u2019t want to go public with those concerns.\n\n\u201cProgressive donors and consultants loved the Coach Walz persona, but it didn\u2019t actually land with the rural voters and men it was designed to win over. I think it looked like a performance trying to distract from the Biden record he and Harris never distanced themselves from,\u201d one House Democrat who won in a district Trump carried told CNN. \u201cThere were Democrats who won over Trump voters to win their races and will again in the future, but Tim, it\u2019s time for you to go home. This red district tourism is giving all the wrong signals to the voters you lost.\u201d\n\nRebecca Cooke, the top Democratic prospect who has already announced a repeat run against Van Orden for next year, did not attend Tuesday\u2019s event in her district.\n\nBut a Walz advisor told CNN that the governor has already received over 1,000 invitations for more appearances.\n\nNo clear plan for the future as last year\u2019s loss still haunts him\n\nOnly two Harris-Walz camo hunter\u2019s caps, which the campaign had been so proud to unveil the night he was picked for the ticket, were visible in the crowd in Wisconsin.\n\nFour-and-a-half months after he came within about 230,000 votes in three battleground states of being elected vice president, Walz doesn\u2019t even have a super PAC to handle logistics or costs, leaving aides on their off hours coordinating with staff at state parties for what he\u2019ll be doing and where.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz campaigns at State Fair Park on November 4, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nAs much as clips of Walz\u2019s best quips so far have raced around dejected Democrats \u2013 one from Eau Claire where he said he\u2019d added Tesla to the stock market app on his iPhone so he could get \u201ca little boost\u201d from watching the share price go down (he also suggested owners pulling the \u2018T\u2019 emblems off with dental floss), drawing an almost immediate response from Musk on X \u2013 there is no greater plan in play. Hundreds of people are showing up to see him at each stop, with several telling CNN after he finished in Eau Claire that their impression of him had improved, but he isn\u2019t even taking down their contact information, as most politicians who are keeping their options open tend to do.\n\nPart of the story of the 2024 campaign is how Harris picked Walz in large part for how much she liked his public demeanor, then because the new people around her running the campaign worried he\u2019d overshadow her, that guy effectively disappeared.\n\nBut it\u2019s the pre-running mate Walz who has been showing up at these town halls, ripping Musk as \u201ca dipshit,\u201d digging in deep on the relevance of Department of Education or Veterans Affairs programs for special needs, coming up with a line that Democrats should take back the Gadsden flag to tell Republicans to stop treading on them and responding with both sympathy and rage to a woman in Eau Claire who told him she\u2019d been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s at the age of 51: \u201cWe need to ask your member of Congress here why he doesn\u2019t care about this woman\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nWalz says now he should have been doing events all through last fall. He says he offered, but was told no, and in his bewildered daze, he decided to be a team player.\n\nWalz knew they lost early on election night. Sitting around a table in a suite at the Mayflower Hotel that he had walked into thinking he\u2019d be leaving as the vice president-elect, he could feel the mood shift among his staff as soon as the Virginia results started coming in soft for Harris.\n\nThey wanted to fly back that night. Gwen Walz, the governor\u2019s wife, told CNN that one of the things that sticks with her is that the Harris-Walz logo was already off the charter plane by the time they got to the airport.\n\nThese days, Walz said that thinking they were going to win \u201cfeels like an unforgivable sin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit jaded now, knowing how tough this is because of that,\u201d he said, then hearing the noise of the crowd waiting inside, said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see how these folks are.\u201d\n\nAfter he finished his hour on stage by asking the crowd to call out ideas for standing up to Trump, Walz participated in a line of photos \u2013 not backstage with donors, but with whoever from the crowd wanted to wait to climb up the stairs to be with him.\n\nAsked what he saw of where those folks were, Walz said that it felt like \u201ca little group therapy session of what they wanted to see out of Democratic leadership,\u201d adding, \u201cand look, it\u2019s good for me too, because I\u2019ve seen the energy still out there.\u201d"

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nLarry Taunton was in bed around 1 a.m. on Sunday in his Alabama home when he noticed his dog, Ranger, getting worked up.\n\n\u201cHis ears were up and moving like satellite dishes,\u201d Taunton told CNN in an interview.\n\nHe noticed a flicker of light, and then the German Shepherd headed toward the front door. Taunton grabbed his gun and followed, leaving the lights off. When he got to the kitchen, all he could see in the darkness was a figure in body armor holding a semi-automatic rifle trying to open his door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, if that man comes through my door, I\u2019m going to light him up,\u201d Taunton said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re just thinking, \u2018Somebody\u2019s here to murder me and my wife.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt turned out to be three officers, guns drawn. Police told Taunton that they received a call saying three men in hoodies were \u201cmoving throughout the house, executing everybody.\u201d\n\nHe had been swatted.\n\nTaunton, who has more than 177,000 followers on X and more than 140,000 YouTube subscribers, is one of at least a dozen influencers who have been \u201cswatted\u201d in the last two weeks. Swatting is a crime that involves making a bogus emergency call claiming a horrific emergency is taking place \u2013 often a shooting \u2013 to draw police and first responders to a person\u2019s home.\n\nAlmost all the influencers who have publicized their recent swattings are conservative supporters of President Donald Trump. Many have also interacted with top Trump adviser and donor Elon Musk on X over the years, with Musk either replying to them or reposting their X posts. The swattings are happening as Tesla owners and dealerships are experiencing a wave of vandalism in backlash against the company\u2019s billionaire CEO, and his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security say they\u2019re investigating this latest rash of swattings, which these influencers say could easily turn deadly.\n\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will not sit idly by as conservative new media and their families are being targeted by false swatting,\u201d Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem wrote on X on Wednesday. \u201c@DHSgov has the ability to trace phone numbers and track location information. We will use it to hunt these cowards down. This is an attack on our law enforcement and innocent families and we will prosecute it as such.\u201d\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X last week that the FBI is \u201calready taking action to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics\u2014weaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\u2018I just fell to the ground\u2019\n\nErin Derham lives in Western North Carolina with her husband, Mat Van Swol, and three children. Like Taunton, she was in bed early Sunday when she heard loud banging on her door at 1:30 a.m.\n\nDerham had an idea what might be happening. She and Van Swol had seen reports of other influencers getting swatted and warned their local police department that they might be a target. Van Swol, who says he\u2019s a former liberal, has become known alongside his wife as an activist calling for more aid to North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. Van Swol, who has more than 198,000 followers on X, has often interacted with Musk on the social media platform.\n\nBut Derham was not prepared to see someone holding a gun, banging at her door.\n\n\u201cI could hear loud sirens blaring down the street,\u201d she said to CNN. \u201cWe found out later four police officers and cars came to our house, but also there was a fire truck, two ambulances and all the county on-duty police officers flying towards my house.\u201d\n\nDerham chose to answer the door instead of sending her husband, believing she would look less threatening \u201cin my little polka dot pajamas.\u201d\n\n\u201c(The police) came in and I yelled, \u2018Matt, we\u2019re being swatted!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 and I kept yelling, \u2018We have three kids upstairs, we have three kids upstairs, do not (do anything), nobody is here.\u201d\n\nSomeone had called the police pretending to be her husband, Derham learned. During the call, the person claimed to be Van Swol and said Derham had been killed and he had been shot twice in the stomach.\n\nShe was also told the caller sounded like an older man and responses were slightly delayed, leading her to believe computer-generated manipulation may have been involved.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was going to pass out most of the time that they were in the house,\u201d Derham said. \u201cI held it together until they shut the door, and then I fell, like I literally just fell to the ground.\u201d\n\n\u2018A cheap form of terrorism\u2019\n\nSwatting is a form of harassment that\u2019s considered a crime at the federal and state levels.\n\nAnd it can be deadly. In 2017, police killed Andrew Finch after a group of online gamers \u2014 who were later imprisoned \u2014 called 911 to report that a man had shot his father in the head and was holding his mother and brother at gunpoint, while threatening to set their home on fire.\n\nFinch was shot by police when he dropped his hands as officers told him to raise his arms when he came out of the house, according to the US attorney.\n\nA 60-year-old Tennessee man reportedly died of a heart attack after police, responding to a swatting call, told him to come out of the house with his hands up during an incident in 2020.\n\nAnd swatting, which has been on the FBI\u2019s radar for decades, can be a tough crime to prosecute. Online methods make it easy to spoof a phone number and a voice.\n\nMany of the conservative influencers targeted in recent days are gun owners. Taunton said it was good sense from police, as well as \u201cgood trigger discipline on both parts,\u201d that kept his situation from turning into a tragedy.\n\nThe responding officers have in some cases been impacted, too. Derham said she and her husband have been in touch with the first officer who responded to the swatting call targeting their home. He has been \u201cvery affected,\u201d by the incident she said, considering he could have unintentionally harmed her, or her children, had the night gone differently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cheap form of terrorism, or it could be something else, we don\u2019t really know,\u201d Derham said. \u201cBut it is causing so much damage, way beyond my household.\u201d\n\nAnd the harassment hasn\u2019t stopped. Since the swatting, Derham said they are now getting pizza deliveries they have not ordered at all hours of the day and night. Some of the delivery people say the notes on the orders ask them to knock loudly, which Derham says is a scare tactic.\n\n\u201cThis was humiliating and terrifying,\u201d Derham said. \u201cAs it\u2019s happening, you\u2019re so scared and you just think, what if this is a dry run? This is really, really scary.\u201d\n\nBut despite the fear and trauma, many of the affected influencers say swatting has only further motivated them to continue speaking out on politics.\n\n\u201cTo the person/entity swatting people \u2026 you are not changing hearts and minds by doing this,\u201d Van Swol posted on X. \u201cIf the goal is to frighten people into silence, that won\u2019t work.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer/ANDRII BILETSKYI\n\nJim Acosta, the frequent Donald Trump antagonist who was all but pushed out by CNN earlier this year, may not be the type of person you\u2019d suspect would be a hit on Substack. In fact, when he signed off from his CNN show for the final time at the end of January, he barely knew what it was. \u201cI thought Substack was a place where people posted their articles and opinion pieces,\u201d he said. He could be forgiven for his mistake. When Substack took off in 2020 amid the newsletter boom \u2014 which came and went, then came back again, perhaps this time for good \u2014 it positioned itself as an email service.\n\nBut in the years since, Substack has transformed into something else: a platform for live videos and podcasts, a burgeoning social-media network, and a starter pack for fledgling newsrooms. Every day for the past six weeks, Acosta has been filming himself talking about the horrors of Trump\u2019s second term and posting the video on Substack. To his surprise, there\u2019s an audience for it. Each episode gets between 150,000 and 200,000 views and he has amassed about 280,000 subscribers, more than 10,000 of which are paid.\n\n\u201cThe response has blown me away. I did not anticipate this when I left my old job,\u201d Acosta told me recently, speaking from a hiking trail near Sonoma (working for yourself has its perks). \u201cI don\u2019t know where this is going to go,\u201d he added, noting that he was still adjusting to post-CNN life and had just bought his first personal laptop in 20 years. He is, as he says, \u201cliving in the moment,\u201d which \u201cmay sound too Gwyneth Paltrow for some people.\u201d\n\nAnd this is Substack\u2019s moment, it seems. Thanks to a combination of forces \u2014 the decimation of Twitter, the collapse of the media industry, the explosion in demand for video and audio content, and the reemergence of Trump \u2014 Substack has escaped its humble newsletter beginnings to become a juggernaut collective of independent voices. If you\u2019re looking to start a media operation, it\u2019s now the place to do so: The Free Press, The Bulwark, Zeteo, and The Ankler are among those housed there. If you\u2019re an established journalist or personality looking for your next act \u2014 Paul Krugman, Joy Reid, Taylor Lorenz, etc. \u2014 do it on Substack. Pete Buttigieg all but announced his future presidential run on there. In a sign of the times, Allure recently announced it is joining Substack to launch a newsletter called The Beauty Chat, even though readers of Allure could presumably get their Allure content from Allure itself.\n\n\u201cWhen I started my newsletter in 2021, I thought it was an email tool. I was like, Great, it\u2019s a very-easy-to-use MailChimp,\u201d said Rachel Karten, a social-media consultant who used to run social media at Bon App\u00e9tit and now writes the Link in Bio newsletter. \u201cAnd slowly and slowly it\u2019s become a lot more of a social-media tool \u2014 there\u2019s now live video and algorithms.\u201d\n\nSubstack today has all of the functionalities of a social platform, allowing proprietors to engage with both subscribers (via the Chat feature) or the broader Substack universe in the Twitter-esque Notes feed. Writers I spoke to mentioned that for all of their reluctance to engage with the Notes feature, they see growth when they do. More than 50 percent of all subscriptions and 30 percent of paid subscriptions on the platform come directly from the Substack network. There\u2019s been a broader shift toward multimedia content: Over half of the 250 highest-revenue creators were using audio and video in April 2024, a number that had surged to 82 percent by February 2025.\n\nSubstack initially rolled out livestreaming in September as a feature available only to publishers with a lot of subscribers; in January, it made live video available to everyone. There\u2019s a collaboration feature that allows you to co-host streams with up to three people, \u201cessentially what is one step up from a public FaceTime call,\u201d says Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie. \u201cIt lowers the barrier to entry to saying something important in public; it\u2019s also kind of fun.\u201d Acosta has kept his videos free for now, but others are offering the feature only to paid subscribers, as Tina Brown has for recent conversations with Maureen Dowd and Janice Min.\n\n\u201cEmail is something that we will absolutely never abandon,\u201d said McKenzie, noting it\u2019s \u201cimportant as a guarantor of that direct owned relationship that the writers and creators can have with their audience.\u201d But by limiting yourself to just email, \u201cyou\u2019re tying one of your hands behind your back.\u201d When someone like Acosta goes live on Substack, they announce that they\u2019re doing so to their entire email list, who can then jump on and watch. At the end of the stream, they are presented with the full video, which they can then blast out to their Substack followers as well as post on other social platforms.\n\nBut even those who\u2019ve resisted new features and kept their newsletters largely text based continue to see an uptick, like journalist Max Read, who writes the twice-weekly Read Max newsletter. \u201cTo the extent there\u2019s been a Trump bump in the media, it\u2019s all going to Substackers. I cover tech, not really politics. But I saw incredibly fast growth \u2014 it seems to finally be plateauing \u2014 between late October/the election last year and two or three weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI was growing twice as fast as I\u2019d been in the months before that.\u201d\n\nSports journalism has basically migrated to the platform, and food media seems not far behind \u2014 if not already there. In the past few months, renowned cookbook author and restaurateur Yotam Ottolenghi joined Substack, as did Ballerina Farm influencer Hannah Neeleman. \u201cThat\u2019s just such a clear indicator to me of how much money there is to be made,\u201d said chef and writer Clare de Boer. \u201cThere\u2019s no one that is too big for Substack.\u201d Live video seems particularly suited for the food category. Substack last week hosted a live three-day food festival called Grubstack featuring top food writers and chefs like de Boer, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, Ottolenghi, Caroline Chambers, and David Lebovitz participating in live conversations, cook-alongs, and virtual tastings.\n\nSubstack as a whole this month celebrated 5 million paid subscriptions \u2014 including 2 million to outlets that publish video \u2014 less than four months after it crossed the 4-million milestone. And it is intent on cracking new territories. \u201cSubstack\u2019s bread and butter has been journalists and analysts and academics and bloggers, which is a really elite class and very influential, but it\u2019s small in its total size compared to where most of culture is happening right now, which is on Instagram and TikTok and YouTube,\u201d said McKenzie. Substack saw opportunity amid the looming TikTok ban, offering a $25,000 prize to the creator who produced the most convincing video inviting their TikTok audience to Substack. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rescue the smart people from TikTok!\u201d Substacker co-founder Chris Best wrote.\n\nThe winner of that competition was Aaron Parnas, a 25-year-old D.C.-based creator who used to practice law but now practices Substack. \u201cMore or less my audience has followed,\u201d said Parnas, noting the \u201cbiggest thing has really been just introducing this new platform to them,\u201d because \u201ca lot of folks don\u2019t really know what Substack even is.\u201d He posts two to three videos a day in which he basically talks through the day\u2019s big headlines. Around 370,000 people subscribe \u2014 \u201c98, 99 percent of those subscribers are in the past two months,\u201d he says \u2014 and more than a thousand are paid. He typically reserves livestreams as a perk for paid subscribers.\n\nThe initial dream that Substack sold of individual journalists making a living through subscriptions has been eclipsed by a new hybrid model. More and more, people aren\u2019t on there to make money at all but to promote their stories and books and engage with fellow media types without being trolled by Elon-worshipping Nazi bot accounts (though Substack has its own Nazi problems). Meanwhile, money can feasibly be made from sources other than subscriptions. \u201cI felt like Substack was against brands and advertising early on. Now that more brands are joining, it does seem like it is welcoming them,\u201d said Karten, pointing out that Substack had hosted a joint event with luxury resale platform The RealReal at the Manhattan restaurant King on Tuesday evening. \u201cAs a user, it makes me wonder if we might start to see ads in Notes. As a marketer, I see the opportunity \u2014 but it can be a slippery slope.\u201d\n\nThe cynical take is that Substack \u2014 which takes a 10 percent cut of the paid subscription revenue \u2014 has shifted to trying to make money off only high-profile people. But the reality is there aren\u2019t many other places offering the kind of new venture that Substack has made possible for so many big names.\n\n\u201cWriters were not the obvious sexy customers to be building the tech company around,\u201d said McKenzie. But early on, he remembers talking with Best about how different it\u2019d look if \u201csocial networks had been built on subscription models rather than advertising,\u201d and how one day Substack could organically develop into its own ecosystem \u2014 which it now seems like it has. \u201cAs we matured and got more people using Substack over time,\u201d McKenzie said, \u201cthese wild imaginings became much more like plans.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is stepping into the Democrats\u2019 leadership void, picking up her powerful megaphone to channel the base\u2019s anger \u2014 toward both President Donald Trump and her own party.\n\nSome of the initial skepticism in the party around the progressive star when she first arrived in Washington six years ago has started to fade as she has established herself as a political player on Capitol Hill and demonstrated a unique knack for communicating with a younger generation.\n\nAs Democrats scramble to find an authentic and effective messenger for the second Trump administration, there is a growing desire to elevate Ocasio-Cortez, 35, within the party in some way, according to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists \u2014 especially after last week\u2019s government spending showdown left the base enraged.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was one of the most outspoken Democrats in torching Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for allowing a Republican funding bill to advance in the Senate to avoid a shutdown. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nStarting Thursday, she is set to take her message on the road with a fellow progressive heavyweight, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has also been critical of current Democratic leadership. The pair will hold a series of rallies in swing districts and on college campuses in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado that are expected to draw massive crowds, sparking inevitable questions about her considering a run for higher office \u2014 perhaps even president in 2028.\n\n\u201cShe would walk into any event in America and draw a significant crowd,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, a political adviser to Sanders. \u201cWhether they like her or not it doesn\u2019t even matter. There are people interested in what she has to say.\u201d\n\nSome of her Democratic colleagues once viewed Ocasio-Cortez as an attention seeker who was more interested in social media stardom than substantive policy. Others believed she fell into the job only accidentally after her upset primary win at age 28 and were skeptical she would be around for long.\n\nBut now Democrats across the ideological spectrum are starting to recognize that Ocasio-Cortez can grab the spotlight in a way that few others in the party can.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got boundless promise as the party leader in our country. But the question is who will have the language to express to America where we need to go,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order for anybody, but I would say she\u2019s definitely a contender. I don\u2019t know that anybody else seems to be a more obvious young candidate for that position.\u201d\n\nThere are still plenty of reservations among Democrats about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s becoming the face of the party. She is a frequent target of conservatives, who portray her as an out-of-touch extremist and often use her as a villain in campaign ads and fundraising efforts.\n\n\u201cHer politics are just too far left for this party,\u201d a chair of a state party that sends a large number of delegates to Democratic presidential conventions, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Ocasio-Cortez as a potential national candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with most of her policy positions, but she\u2019s showing fight, which a lot of people are looking for their members of Congress to do, and they\u2019re just not seeing it.\u201d\n\nStill, her ability to connect with the public is something her Democratic colleagues are starting to embrace. Recently, she conducted a presentation for her colleagues on how to reach influencers and use social media. She showed House Democrats a video she produced around the theme \u201cWhat\u2019s in my bag?\u201d in which she also discussed politics and policy. A Democratic lawmaker recalled the video got more than 2 million views.\n\n\u201cTwo million people, right?\u201d said a lawmaker who listened to the presentation. \u201cIf you added all of mine up together and multiplied them by 10, I wouldn\u2019t get to 2 million.\u201d\n\nA moderate House Democrat told NBC News that, despite not being a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of Ocasio-Cortez, they privately voted for her to be the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee when she unsuccessfully ran for the post last year. The moderate Democratic lawmaker said the reason is that \u201cshe is one of the top-tier communicators\u201d in the party and the Oversight Committee job is primarily a \u201cmessaging and marketing\u201d role.\n\nBut the lawmaker didn\u2019t wish to reveal the vote publicly, a sign there is still wariness about how Ocasio-Cortez might appeal to more centrist and independent voters.\n\nOcasio-Cortez ultimately landed a spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which deals with a host of issues she cares about related to climate change and income inequality. Her evolution from an outside agitator to an inside player in the party has fueled widespread speculation among Democrats about her political ambitions.\n\nOcasio-Cortez isn\u2019t entertaining the idea of seeking higher office. Her closest advisers reject the premise that Sanders is handing the baton to her as the titular leader of the progressive movement. They also insist she isn\u2019t plotting to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat in 2028, mount a run for governor of New York in 2026 or start organizing a bid for the White House. But they also aren\u2019t ruling anything out.\n\nOcasio-Cortez declined a request for an interview.\n\n\u201cThere is no 10-year plan,\u201d said a close Ocasio-Cortez adviser, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal planning. \u201cShe is going to be who she is. She is the last person to think about how a decision is going to impact her down the road, which candidly can be a little frustrating to those of us who are advising her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can move quickly and authentically in a way few other elected leaders can,\u201d the adviser added. \u201cIf she jumps into anything, it will be because she truly believes she can make real change.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic leaders said Ocasio-Cortez should keep all potential opportunities open.\n\n\u201cI think AOC has a massive future in front of her, and that\u2019s a decision that she\u2019s going to make. I mean, obviously you see lots of conversation about her running for Senate, her running for president. I think all of those options, if I was her campaign manager, are probably going to be on the table,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s association of state party chairs.\n\nIn the short term, her colleagues in the House believe her best play is to keep her focus on the job at hand.\n\n\u201cShe has matured and evolved as a political leader in remarkable ways,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cShe has gone from being a huge outside force to being a huge inside force.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Former Vice President Al Gore championed the development of the internet so enthusiastically that one of the first myths of the online era was that he claimed to have invented it.\n\nIt was in those early days of the world wide web that one of Gore\u2019s successors came of age.\n\nJD Vance grew up with chat rooms and email and instant messaging. He graduated into young adulthood at the dawn of blogging. He entered politics with a millennial\u2019s fluency in social media.\n\nNow, at 40, he is the nation\u2019s third-youngest vice president \u2014 and, nearly a quarter-century after Gore left office, the nation\u2019s first very online vice president. It\u2019s a pioneering distinction that reflects the serious time and thought, as well as the debate-me vibes, that Vance puts into his interactions with others.\n\n\u201cI tend to err on the side of openness,\u201d Vance said in a recent interview aboard Air Force Two. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a generational thing, right? I come from a very tech-forward generation.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s unfiltered use of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, sets him apart from many of his political peers \u2014 and certainly from past vice presidents who were older, far more restrained and far less eager to slide into your mentions.\n\nWhere other elected officeholders rely on staff to send out tightly crafted messages, Vance estimates that, even with a full White House portfolio, he writes 98% of his posts himself. And where President Donald Trump and his hit-and-run blasts have pushed social media into new frontiers of political communication and confrontation, Vance has pushed further. Unlike Trump, he engages directly in conversations with his allies and fights with his critics. He also sticks around to watch reactions pour in, replying when it suits him.\n\nAt times, Vance is in on the joke. His recent Oval Office upbraiding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ignited a raft of memes in which Vance\u2019s face was edited into a variety of images \u2014 flattering or unflattering, depending on the poster\u2019s opinion of him. Vance contributed to the discourse by sharing an image of his face in the well-traveled Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme \u2014 a winking acknowledgement that he was enjoying all of the online fuss.\n\n\u201cIt can become very addictive, right?\u201d Vance said of social media. \u201cSo I try to limit myself. We limit our kids\u2019 screen time. I try to limit my screen time, too.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s posts at times veer into hostility. Last month, after he called for the rehiring of a federal employee who had resigned over making racist remarks online, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., scolded Vance, noting how they are both fathers of Indian American children.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cRacist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don\u2019t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.\u201d\n\nHe accused Khanna of \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d before concluding: \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d\n\nWhile Vance and his advisers characterize his social media persona as a worthy effort to foster authentic discussion and debate, his detractors view it as abrasive and performative.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with him being active on social media and engaging in conversation with critics,\u201d Khanna said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not hoping here for Lincoln-Douglas. I wish he were using it to have an actual substantive exchange instead of trying to own the libs in every tweet.\u201d\n\nAboard Air Force Two, Vance wrestled with his social media habits, at one point calculating how much time he spends online and at another volunteering that he is trying to read more books.\n\n\u201cI actually try not to look at it most of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in my office in the West Wing, I usually have my phone in a secure box, because people come in, there\u2019s classified information flowing everywhere. I sort of assume the Chinese or somebody else are hacked into my phone.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s tough to resist a morning or afternoon scroll.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 15 minutes just to make sure I\u2019m staying up to date on the news and I know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI\u2019m probably a little bit more active after the kids go to bed, right between 8 and 11.\u201d\n\nStormy posts, \u2018Always Sunny\u2019 memes\n\nSince being sworn in as vice president two months ago, Vance has posted from his personal @JDVance X account more than 140 times, including reposts and replies to other accounts.\n\nIn that same period, the official @VP handle that is managed by his office has posted roughly 250 times, with a heavy concentration on traditional statements, as well as reposts of content from other Trump administration officials and White House-affiliated accounts.\n\nWhile he averages fewer than three posts a day from his personal account, Vance often maximizes them by taking advantage of the unlimited characters he\u2019s afforded as a verified user. He is known for seeking out thought leaders and others whose beliefs place them outside the bounds of Trump\u2019s right-wing ideology and his reluctance to involve the U.S. in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nOver two days last month, Vance tapped out more than 850 words in a pair of posts that chided Niall Ferguson of the Hoover Institution, a hawkish vestige of the old-guard Republican economic and foreign policy establishment. Ferguson had slammed Trump\u2019s approach to the war in Ukraine. Ferguson did not mention Vance in his original post, but the vice president nevertheless locked in on it, decrying it as \u201cmoralistic garbage.\u201d\n\nOn Presidents\u2019 Day, Vance replied to former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, who had referred to Vance\u2019s rebuke of European free speech laws and asked if he was aware of the White House limiting access to Associated Press reporters.\n\n\u201cYes dummy,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between not giving a reporter a seat in the WH press briefing room and jailing people for dissenting views. The latter is a threat to free speech, the former is not. Hope that helps!\u201d\n\nAnd though Vance said he locks his phone away for much of the workday, several of his more colorful missives have come on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhen Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a clip of a recent CNN appearance in which he accused the White House of being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Vance clapped back with a Monday morning \u201cCharlie Conspiracy\u201d meme from the sitcom \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore politicians should be accessible and responsive,\u201d said Khanna, who, like Murphy and Vance, is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a waste of time or a disservice. It\u2019s the manner in which he\u2019s doing it. \u2026 That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nA reply guy is born\n\nVance has always been eager to express himself online.\n\nIn the aughts and early 2010s he dabbled as a blogger \u2014 first as an amateur Blogspot author during his days in the Marines and at Yale Law School, later at a site led by former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum.\n\nHis earliest days on social media are tougher to excavate. Vance acknowledged during his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio that he had deleted his old tweets, including those critical of Trump.\n\n\u201cIn 4 years, I hope people remember that it was those of us who empathized with Trump\u2019s voters who fought him most aggressively,\u201d Vance wrote in a since-scrubbed post from 2016.\n\nThe posts Vance wrote and interacted with in those days, when he was best known for his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d previewed the range he would offer as his political instincts developed. His tweets then were a mix of lighter fare in line with the childless young professional he was at the time \u2014 he goofed on an Obama White House post playing off the Disney film \u201cFrozen\u201d \u2014 and the punchiness he would hone as he made his sharp right turn.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty insane tweet,\u201d he wrote in response to a December 2016 post by liberal columnist Paul Krugman that suggested Trump could benefit from a 9/11-style attack.\n\nVance\u2019s online posture became more combative as he transitioned from anti-Trump Republican to Trump-backed candidate and U.S. senator.\n\nWhile disparaging Democratic leaders as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d in 2021 \u2014 an attack that came back to haunt him in his early days as Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 Vance fired off a tweet that included Krugman in the smear. In the years since, he has embraced the role of reply guy.\n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t such a humorless scold you might be a senator right now,\u201d he tweeted at Jason Kander, a past Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri who had mocked a photo of Vance pointing a rifle toward the sky in 2023 as a Chinese spy balloon flew over the U.S.\n\nAnyone who wondered whether Vance would change his freewheeling ways after winning the vice presidency got their answer soon after November\u2019s election. When Grace Chong, an associate of influential MAGA movement leader Steve Bannon, criticized him for missing a Senate vote on then-President Joe Biden\u2019s judicial nominees, Vance fired back.\n\n\u201cGrace Chong,\u201d he wrote on X, in a post that he later deleted, \u201cis a mouth breathing imbecile who attacks those of us in the fight rather than make herself useful.\u201d\n\nThe angel on Vance\u2019s social media shoulder\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance has urged her husband to be nicer on social media \u2014 advice he is not always keen to take, he told activists at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\n\u201cI take it sometimes!\u201d he said when reminded of the comment on Air Force Two.\n\nIf his wife is the angel on his social media shoulder, who is the devil? The second lady, who was seated across from her husband on the plane and until that point in the interview had quietly kept her head down, looked up in amusement after hearing the question.\n\n\u201cI guess I have a few,\u201d Vance responded, after repeating it.\n\n\u201cThe only time that my staff ever tweets for me,\u201d he continued, nodding toward his communications director, William Martin, \u201cis if I\u2019m in a speech and I say, \u2018Hey, Will, can you just make sure a clip of this gets out in real time?\u2019 Or if I\u2019m in meetings all day, \u2018Hey, can you say something about this, and say it like that?\u2019 That happens probably 2% of the time. The other 98% of the time, it\u2019s all me. So I guess I don\u2019t have anybody else to blame when I get something wrong.\u201d\n\nVance has copped to being wrong, at least in his opinion, about Trump in 2016. Yet he has been more stubborn about his unsubstantiated claim last fall on X that Haitian migrants were abducting and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. When reporters confronted him about the absence of evidence, Vance made no apologies and instead took credit for drawing attention to other problems that immigration had stirred up in his home state.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conspiracy theories, some of which turn out to be legitimate, some of which turn out to be totally bats---,\u201d Vance, speaking broadly about the social media landscape, said aboard the plane. \u201cAnd I guess I just think openness is really important.\u201d\n\nHow does he muster the confidence to plow ahead with takes that may be proved wrong?\n\n\u201cBeing wrong is OK,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cI\u2019d rather be open with people and wrong than overly cautious, never take any risks in the service of never getting anything wrong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to change your mind. \u2026 I guess my confidence comes from the fact that, if I can argue somewhat successfully with my wife, I assume I can argue well with anybody.\u201d\n\nThe second lady, Vance admitted, wishes he would \u201cbe a little bit more gentle\u201d online.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s also encouraged me not to filter myself and not to just become a kind of creature of consultant guidance,\u201d he added. \u201cPoliticians, they get way too comfortable with slogans. Yeah, sometimes you need to hammer home a message, but you can\u2019t just do that, or you become a total robot.\u201d"

            "full_content": "TORONTO \u2014 China executed four Canadians in recent months, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister said Wednesday. Such executions of Westerners are relatively rare.\n\nForeign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said she and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked for clemency in the drug-related accusations involving the dual citizens.\n\nBeijing\u2019s embassy in Ottawa said the executions were due to drug crimes and noted that China does not recognize dual citizenship.\n\n\u201cWe strongly condemn the executions,\u201d Joly told reporters in Ottawa. \u201cI asked personally for leniency ... They were all dual citizens.\u201d\n\nJoly said Canada consistently asks for clemency for Canadians facing the death penalty abroad. She said the families have asked the government to withhold details of the identities of the four individuals.\n\nGlobal Affairs spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said the government continues to provide consular assistance to families and requested that the media respect their privacy. She said Ottawa continues to advocate for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian who was sentenced to death for drug smuggling.\n\n\u201cChina always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said. \u201cThe facts of the crimes committed by the Canadian nationals involved in the cases are clear, and the evidence is solid and sufficient.\u201d\n\nChina is believed to execute more prisoners each year than the rest of the world combined, though the total is a state secret. Executions are traditionally carried out by gunshot, though lethal injections have been introduced in recent years.\n\nThe embassy spokesperson said Beijing \u201cfully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned,\u201d and urged Canada\u2019s government to \u201cstop making irresponsible remarks.\u201d\n\nThe two countries have some tensions. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports earlier this month, after Canada imposed duties in October on Chinese-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminum products. The tariffs add to global trade tensions amid rounds of tariff announcements by the United States, China, Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cChina is sending us a message that we have to take steps if we want to see an improvement in the relationship,\u201d said a former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques.\n\nIan Brodie, a former chief of staff to former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, posted on social media that it turns out \u201cagricultural tariffs weren\u2019t the worst part of the PRC response to EV tariffs.\u201d\n\nAnd opposition Conservative lawmaker Michael Chong said \u201cexecuting a number of Canadians in short order is unprecedented, and is clearly a sign that Beijing has no intention of improving relations with Canada.\u201d\n\nChina is Canada\u2019s second-largest trading partner, but relations have been bad since Canadian authorities in 2018 arrested a former Huawei executive whom the U.S. had charged with fraud.\n\nChina jailed two Canadians shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, on a U.S. extradition request. They were sent back to Canada in 2021, the same day Meng returned to China after reaching a deal with U.S. authorities in her case.\n\nMany countries called China\u2019s action \u201chostage politics,\u201d while China described the charges against Huawei and Meng as a politically motivated attempt to hold back China\u2019s economic and technological development.\n\nAmnesty International condemned the executions and noted that China executed thousands of people in 2023.\n\n\u201cThese shocking and inhumane executions of Canadian citizens by Chinese authorities should be a wake-up call for Canada,\u201d the group\u2019s head for English-speaking Canada, Ketty Nivyabandi, said in a statement Wednesday."

            "full_content": "A federal judge on Thursday ruled the Trump administration could not deport Georgetown fellow Badar Khan Suri, who the university said was detained by the Department of Homeland Security as the Trump administration continues its immigration clampdown.\n\nUS District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said that while she reviews Khan Suri\u2019s petition in court challenging his detention, the administration is not to remove him from the country unless she issues another ruling to the contrary, according to the order.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s attorney, Hassan Ahmad, says he and his team are working \u201cdiligently\u201d to secure his client\u2019s removal from a detention facility in Louisiana where he has been since Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe welcome Judge Giles\u2019 ruling,\u201d Ahmad said in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt is the first due process Dr. Khan Suri has received since he was snatched away from his family on Monday night.\u201d\n\nKhan Suri is an Indian national who is in the US on a visa \u201cto continue his doctoral research on peace building in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d a court filing said.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity and we have not received a reason for his detention,\u201d the letter continued. In a statement to CNN, a university spokesperson said, \u201cWe expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier letter obtained by CNN, Georgetown University Interim President Robert Groves told its Board of Directors that Khan Suri had been detained by DHS and his visa had been revoked.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s detention comes as President Donald Trump continues to crack down on students who engage in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest case in a series of arrests and deportation proceedings the Trump administration has brought against people associated with US colleges and universities, sending shockwaves across the academic community and raising concerns about the protection of free speech.\n\nKhan Suri is married with children, but his family has not been given any information about his detention, his sister, Khushnuma Khan, told CNN. That includes their parents who live in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Khan said.\n\n\u201cWe know only as much as anyone else, which is what is reported in the media. We are currently confused about how and why this is happening to him,\u201d she said.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s petition, filed earlier this week, alleged that his \u201ctargeted, retaliatory\u201d detainment is tied to a broader effort by the Trump administration to allegedly revoke the visas of individuals \u201cpurportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech.\u201d\n\nSuch an approach is unconstitutional, his lawyers allege.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s sister added, \u201cMy brother\u2019s wife is from Gaza. So maybe that is why this is happening.\u201d\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s wife, Mapheze Saleh, is Palestinian, the petition notes, and a former employee of the Qatari-based news network Al Jazeera who had been \u201csmeared\u201d by an online group that \u201cspreads misinformation and seeks to discredit American Muslims,\u201d according to the court filing.\n\nA court declaration filed on Thursday by Saleh said she posted on social media to show her support of the people of Gaza after the start of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nSaleh notes that she was born in the US and moved to Gaza at age 5, according to her declaration. Her father, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as Deputy of Foreign Affairs in Gaza until 2010, the filing said.\n\nIn February, Saleh says she started to feel unsafe, as online websites falsely accused her of having ties to Hamas, according to her declaration.\n\nKhan Suri met Saleh\u2019s father on two occasions \u2013 once during a humanitarian visit to Gaza and a second time to ask for Saleh\u2019s hand in marriage, according to the filing. The couple moved to New Delhi in 2013 and Badar never returned to Gaza, the declaration adds.\n\nWhile the filing does not mention Saleh\u2019s father by name, The New York Times reported that Ahmed Yousef \u2013 a former adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh \u2013 confirmed in a voice message that he was Suri\u2019s father-in-law. Yousef told The New York Times that he had left his position with the Hamas-run government more than a decade ago, and that his son-in-law was not involved in any \u201cpolitical activism.\u201d\n\nGeorgetown University in Washington, DC, seen on October 18, 2024. Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters/File\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a Wednesday post on X that Khan Suri was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. Khan Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming unfortunately emblematic of this administration to conflate the acknowledgement of Palestinian humanity with Hamas propaganda,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, Khan Suri\u2019s attorney.\n\nWhen asked about Khan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, Ahmad said, \u201cI\u2019m only aware of one, possibly two times, that he\u2019s met his father-in-law.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the administration to say that it\u2019s a close tie to a known and suspected terrorist, well, where\u2019s the evidence? No administration official has put forth a shred of evidence that my client Dr. Khan Suri has been involved or is affiliated with any known or suspected terrorist,\u201d Ahmad told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday.\n\nKhan Suri is being detained in southern Louisiana, Ahmad told CNN.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still fasting as an observant Muslim during Ramadan and trying to keep his spirits up,\u201d Ahmad added. \u201cHe understands that he is a political prisoner. Those are his words and and he\u2019s grateful for the outpouring of support that he has received.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the DHS for further clarification. On Thursday, at an event in Florida, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem did not answer questions asked by reporters about Khan Suri.\n\nMcLaughlin also said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on Saturday that \u201c[Khan] Suri\u2019s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\u201d under an obscure legal statute that gives the secretary of state authority to act if he or she believes a non-citizen would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\n\nThe State Department declined CNN\u2019s requests for additional comment.\n\n\u201cI will say that seeing our government abduct and jail another innocent person is beyond contemptible,\u201d Ahmad said in an email to CNN earlier this week. \u201cAnd if an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar.\u201d\n\nAhmad wrote in a court filing that Khan Suri was targeted because of his wife\u2019s \u201cidentity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech,\u201d the Associated Press reported. She is an American citizen, according to the filing.\n\nDHS provided no evidence that Khan Suri has committed any crimes and his detention violates his free speech and due process rights, Ahmad wrote in the court filing.\n\nThe postdoctoral fellow \u201ccares deeply\u201d about human rights and peace, another attorney for Khan Suri said.\n\n\u201cDr. Khan Suri is a loving husband and father of young children. He was a distinguished faculty member of the prestigious Georgetown University, who specializes in peace and conflict studies, someone who cares deeply about human rights, dignity, peace, and safety for all people,\u201d Nermeen Arastu, an attorney on Khan Suri\u2019s legal team and associate professor of immigration law at CUNY School of Law told CNN.\n\nWhen DHS officers came for Khan Suri they were \u201cbrandishing weapons\u201d and wore black masks covering their faces, Arastu said.\n\n\u201cICE agents came in the night, took him captive, taking him from his wife and children, and hauled him away to an unknown location before transferring him to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, far from his family and attorneys,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is every family\u2019s worst nightmare. And let\u2019s be clear, this happened to him simply because President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his.\u201d\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, was arrested earlier this month after the Trump administration accused Khalil \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 of being a terrorist sympathizer and supporting Hamas. Khalil faces possible deportation until his case is heard. Khalil was arrested under the same statute used to detain Khan Suri.\n\nAccording to Khan Suri\u2019s bio page on the university\u2019s website, he is a fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown\u2019s school of foreign service. He was teaching a class this spring on majoritarianism and minority rights in South Asia.\n\nCNN\u2019s Evan P\u00e9rez, Tierney Sneed, Aleena Fayaz and Amanda Musa contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Barely two months into his second term, President Donald Trump has already become a consequential president. Unfortunately, no matter how good are his ends, he too often chooses maladroit and even destructive means. He has roiled international commerce, tanked domestic markets, turned friendly populations hostile, and staged embarrassing retreats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUp next may be yet another excessive attempt to immanentize one of his worst passions, hostility toward immigration. The administration apparently is preparing a much-expanded travel ban. Eight years ago he targeted seven Muslim-majority nations, halting political and religious refugees midflight. Among his victims were Iranian Christians, who had abandoned their homes and fled to Europe, awaiting entry into America, for which they had been vetted. The ill consequences of Trump\u2019s arbitrary diktat undermined his attempt to overhaul immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection has triggered a replay. In January he froze refugee admissions: \u201cThe order closed the country to 700 Iranian Jews who had applied for refugee [through a special Iran program],\u201d the Times of Israel reported. \u201cThese Jews were among more than 13,000 applicants from other religious minorities in Iran, including Christians, Baha\u2019is, Sabean-Mandaeans and Zoroastrians.\u201d Who, other than the Islamic extremists who dominate Iranian politics, benefits from this policy?\n\nThe administration apparently is developing a much larger travel prohibition. The purpose, Trump declared in a January Executive Order, is to protect Americans \u201cfrom aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\u201d Although the planning is more serious than in 2017, the means looks no less flawed.\n\nOf course, the government should screen foreigners coming to America, but the standards should be narrow and substantive. Domestic terrorism is a very low probability event. Governments routinely abuse the concept of national security. For instance, at the extreme, Hong Kong now deems essentially any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, or local CCP apparatchiks to \u201cendanger national security.\u201d\n\nPunishing \u201chateful ideology\u201d opens a Pandora\u2019s Box. Today the administration is targeting criticism of Israel. The next Democratic administration might use the rule to bar any foreigner who espouses a MAGAesque philosophy. Malevolence is in the eye of the beholder. That standard could apply to many red and blue activists alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually important, the means should be tailored to the end. First, standards should be looser for visitors than immigrants. The latter settle permanently, ultimately helping to shape what America is and becomes. In contrast, personal character, temperament, behavior, political views, and the like matter little for transitory contact. Absent a desire and ability to do harm, there are few reasons to prevent people from visiting for a specific purpose and a limited time.\n\nSecond, restrictions should be tailored to the threat, which is usually the result of individual, not national, characteristics. A ban rarely makes sense. There may be legitimate reasons to restrict travel, but rare is the justification for an absolute ban. Indeed, openness can boost national security. Meeting adversaries whose governments have poor relationships with the U.S. government can be useful, even vital. The right kind of contact can help subvert authoritarian regimes. At least one of Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s aides had long before visited the US.\n\nThe administration reportedly plans a three-tier system. At the bottom, countries would be given 60 days to meet complaints such as \u201cfailing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries.\u201d The tentative list has 22 nations: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Vanuatu, and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe group includes a rogues\u2019 gallery of authoritarian, corrupt, and hostile governments, failed states, and conflict-ridden lands. However, some democratic, reasonably liberal states, such as Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia, also are included. They are a category apart from many of the other targeted nations. Corruption and crime are issues for these governments, but their citizens aren\u2019t likely to pose a major threat to Americans. These nations should not be treated the same.\n\nFor countries which fail to meet the administration\u2019s standards, the response should be careful scrutiny rather than absolute prohibition. People have reason to flee the endless war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and religious violence in the Republic of the Congo (where Christians are most at risk). Political repression is high in Chad, Zimbabwe, and Angola. Washington should not trust their authorities, so a review of current practices may well be warranted. However, the abuses of these governments are an important reason not to shut off travel by their oppressed and persecuted peoples.\n\nThe administration plans to tightly restrict visas for ten countries: Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Turkmenistan. This list is also a curious mix. Turkmenistan and South Sudan compete to be the least free nations on Earth, rated worse than North Korea; Eritrea is another ruthless dictatorship, tied with the North on the Freedom House Freedom in the World index. In contrast, Sierra Leone is rated partly free and holds regular multi-party elections. It has serious problems, but nothing like the preceding states. Haiti is in violent chaos, Myanmar has descended into countrywide civil war, Pakistan is a faux democracy run by the military and pervaded by Islamic radicalism. Laos is a sleepy communist dictatorship. Belarus is allied with Russia, which is the target of an allied proxy war over Ukraine, but with which the Trump administration wants to improve relations.\n\nUndoubtedly, the president doesn\u2019t want to trigger another wave of mass migration from Haiti, but America should be willing to offer sanctuary to those most seriously threatened by violence. The totalitarian states are nasty but pose no meaningful security threat. South Sudanese continue to kill each other, not Americans. Similar is Myanmar/Burma. Isolating the Burmese people does not punish Myanmar\u2019s generals. Pakistan is a continuing source of radical Islamists, but Americans, in and out of government, should maintain a dialogue with more liberal Pakistanis. And given the dismal state of Washington\u2019s relations with Moscow, the U.S. needs more, not less, contact with the people of Russia and Belarus. While Washington won\u2019t easily drive Moscow and Beijing apart, the U.S. could at least stop driving them together.\n\nFinally, there are eleven countries from which all travel would be prohibited. The eternally damned are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. A full travel ban should require a compelling justification. However, that is largely absent in these cases. To start, Bhutan? Nestled between China and India, this Himalayan country has a population under 800,000 and is rated free by Freedom House. A few Bhutanese have been found to be living illegally in America, 17 in 2022, but that hardly constitutes a crisis. (Perhaps one of the president\u2019s factotums was denied a tourist visa to the mountainous kingdom and decided to use this opportunity to exact massive retaliation.)\n\nThe president apparently wants to restart negotiations with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Although there likely would be few visitors from the North, at least in the near term, Washington should encourage enhanced contacts. Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela are highly repressive and regime opponents might find America to be the only alternative to prison. Trump also is seeking talks with Iran, which would be advanced by allowing its people to visit America. Libya, Somalia, and Sudan are in various degrees of chaos, violence, and competing governments. While Washington has good reason to be careful in granting visas amid shambolic violence, it should not forbid all travel. Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban was recently at war with America, but dwelling on the past will not improve the future. The only certainty is that refusing to engage the ruling regime is not going to liberate anyone. Finally, the U.S. is fighting an undeclared war with Yemen. Ansar Allah might pose a terrorist threat, but, again, it is foolish to say never to Yemeni visitors.\n\nEight years ago Trump\u2019s hastily and carelessly drafted \u201cMuslim ban\u201d had to be twice rewritten, and even then its botched execution bedeviled the administration throughout the president\u2019s term. This time, at least, his officials appear to be debating the issue before crafting new rules. However, more work is necessary, assuming the leaks reflect reality. Ban travel from Bhutan? How would this protect America? And if Trump hopes to warm American relations with Russia and North Korea, how does prohibiting their people from traveling to the U.S. help? Instead, Washington should maintain a generally open door for visitors. Since its founding the U.S. has grown, prospered, and dominated because of its attraction to others. The president needs to reconsider his approach to other nations. Today more than a quarter of Canadians view America as their enemy, an astounding number. Trump needs to stop repelling and start persuading. Toward that end, his administration should continue to welcome visitors from around the world."

Anthony Pro-Life America, as part of its initial $1 million investment in the race. The PAC is specifically sending the mailer to people who voted for President Donald Trump, as well as pro-life voters in the Badger State, encouraging them to reject Dane County Circuit Judge Crawford and vote for former conservative Wisconsin Attorney General and Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Brad Schimel.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and Brad Schimel Agree: on the issue of abortion, the people decide, not judges,\u201d the mailer reads. \u201cBut Susan Crawford is an extreme abortion activist, not an impartial judge.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Exclusive \u2014 Eyes on Wisconsin: State Supreme Court Race That Could Bring Trump\u2019s Agenda to a Screeching Halt\n\nThe mailer further points out that Crawford represented abortion giant Planned Parenthood as a lawyer and that she is endorsed by pro-abortion groups like Planned Parenthood and EMILY\u2019s List.\n\n\u201cThousands of lives are at stake! Don\u2019t let Susan Crawford use Wisconsin\u2019s highest court to impose abortion on demand with no limits!\u201d the mailer concludes.\n\nThe mailer, along with text messages, are going out at the beginning of early voting, which goes through March 30. It comes after the Women Speak Out PAC deployed students in the state to knock on doors and encourage voter turnout. The door-knocking effort began on March 6 and finished over the weekend, with canvassers completing 152,000 visits.\n\n\u201cThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is being viewed as a bellwether for Donald Trump and his first 100 days. The results will impact whether Trump continues to have Republican majorities and whether the Wisconsin people will determine abortion policy or four activist judges,\u201d Political Affairs Communications Director for SBA Pro-Life America Kelsey Pritchard told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cLives depend upon Brad Schimel defeating Susan Crawford, a radical Planned Parenthood lawyer who calls abortion \u2018health care.\u2019 Our student canvassers have reached more than 152,000 voters at their doorsteps to sound the alarm on Crawford\u2019s radical abortion record,\u201d she continued. \u201cTheir conversations have changed minds in this close race and energized voters to show up on or before April 1 to elect Brad Schimel.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Left-Wing Megadonors Supercharge High-Stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court Race\n\nThe 2025 race follows a blowout Wisconsin Supreme Court election in 2023, in which liberal-leaning Janet Protasiewicz beat conservative candidate Dan Kelly and flipped the balance of the court 4-3 majority liberal. While conservatives have the chance to take back the majority once more with the retirement of liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, Democrats view the battle as a chance to push policy and redraw legislative maps that could ultimately lose Republicans two U.S. House seats and help them close in on the Republicans\u2019 slim majority.\n\nLike every election since the Supreme Court overturned the invented federal right to abortion in 2022, Democrats and left-leaning media are largely framing the election as another referendum on abortion. When Roe v. Wade was struck down, Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion restriction went into effect, but was put on hold in December 2023 and is expected to come before the state\u2019s high court later this year.\n\nAs a candidate, Crawford has declined to say how she would rule on the law, but she did say in an interview that the government should not regulate abortions, according to a New York Times article with the headline \u201cOne of 2025\u2019s Biggest Battles Over Abortion Rights Has Already Begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe as a woman that I should be the one to make decisions about my own body and my health care, together with my doctors,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust other women to make those same decisions.\u201d\n\nIn February, AdImpact Politics reported that 62 percent of Crawford\u2019s broadcast airings have mentioned abortion, surpassing Protasiewicz in 2023, who also campaigned on the issue.\n\nIn an article for Breitbart News, Pritchard wrote that Crawford \u201cfought against a law for women\u2019s safety requiring abortion businesses to have hospital admitting privileges\u201d and \u201crepresented the abortion industry in fighting a law to prevent women from being coerced into abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrawford has been publicly grieving the end of Roe v. Wade, the case that is responsible for the deaths of 63 million unborn babies. Maybe most disturbingly of all, she uses the same euphemisms as the abortion industry, calling abortion \u2018health care,'\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have wholeheartedly embraced Crawford\u2019s extremist history and are campaigning based on her clear messages of how she will rule in abortion cases,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis mirrors their efforts two years ago when the party lined up behind the liberal Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz who ran her campaign almost completely on the issue of abortion.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also view the race as a pathway to power in D.C. An email invitation obtained by Breitbart News to a briefing on Jan.13 with Democrat donors, Crawford, and Wisconsin Democrat Chairman Ben Wikler had a subject line that read: \u201cChance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut winning this race could also result in Democrats being able to win two additional US House seats, half the seats needed to win control of the House in 2026,\u201d the email reads.\n\nThe two seats are currently held by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) in the 1st Congressional District in southeast Wisconsin and Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) in the 3rd Congressional District in the western part of the battleground state.\n\n\u201cThey got caught saying the quiet thing out loud, and they revealed what they\u2019re up to. This is, as it was in 2023, a power play to attract enormous amounts of money from partisan donors and turn that into results on the court,\u201d Schimel told Breitbart News in an exclusive phone interview, referring to the email.\n\n\u201cThis is going to affect not just Wisconsin, this will affect the nation,\u201d Schimel continued. \u201cWhen people talk about the timeline that President Trump has to push his goals, that timeline will be cut short or even shorter if they use the Wisconsin Supreme Court to gerrymander the maps as a court and change our representation in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Crawford told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she \u201chas never publicly or privately commented on congressional redistricting at any time and did not at this meeting.\u201d\n\nCrawford previously told the publication: \u201cI got into the Zoom and introduced myself, told the group why I was running, that I pledged to be fair and impartial, to pursue common sense justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. After speaking for a few minutes, I exited the Zoom. I was not there to hear the rest of their agenda.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Complaint Filed Against Dem WI Supreme Court Candidate over Email Touting Chance to Put U.S. House Seats \u201cin Play\u201d\n\nThis race is expected to be even more expensive than the 2023 election, which shattered national spending records for a judicial contest at $56 million and brought in massive out-of-state spending.
