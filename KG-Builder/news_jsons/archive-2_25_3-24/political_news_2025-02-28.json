            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Friday! Somehow it is already the last day of February. In today\u2019s edition, we break down the fallout at home and abroad from today\u2019s White House meeting between Donald Trump, JD Vance and Volodymyr Zelenskyy that devolved into a shouting match.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe Oval Office showdown heard round the world\n\nA White House meeting that was intended to kick off negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals devolved this afternoon into a remarkable confrontation, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn\u2019t grateful enough to the United States, Rebecca Shabad and Nnamdi Egwuonwu report.\n\nThe Oval Office shouting match has for now shattered hopes for the minerals deal, which Trump and his allies had presented as an important step forward for Ukraine on the road to peace with Russia more than three years after the war began.\n\nA White House official told NBC News that Trump and other U.S. officials felt disrespected and asked Zelenskyy to leave the White House, saying that he was not welcome back on Friday. Zelenskyy abruptly departed and a planned joint news conference between the two leaders was called off.\n\nThe exchange underscored the tension that has emerged between the United States and Ukraine \u2014 along with many of its European allies \u2014 over the tougher line that Trump has taken toward the country since coming into office. (More on what this all means for Zelenskyy below.)\n\nVance\u2019s role: As Henry J. Gomez notes, it was a comment from Vance that sparked the unexpected, full-blown, high-volume argument for the world to watch.\n\nIt was a sign of how Vance, who as a senator was known for his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine, is asserting himself on matters of foreign policy immediately as vice president. Earlier this month, Vance made waves at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that took sharp aim at other world leaders. And on Thursday, the day before tangling with Zelenskyy, Vance mixed it up in an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 albeit in a much lighter tone.\n\nA source familiar with the planning for the Trump meeting said there was no predetermined strategy for Vance to confront Zelenskyy the way he did. Vance, the source added, felt compelled to respond after finding Zelenskyy needlessly provocative in his demeanor.\n\n\u201cNo one expected Zelenskyy to come in there and act entitled,\u201d said this person, who added that the expectation was the Oval Office meeting would go off like a typical bilateral meeting.\n\nHow Republicans are responding: GOP lawmakers largely rallied around Trump and Vance. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been a staunch supporter of aiding Ukraine, said he doesn\u2019t know if Trump and Zelenskyy can \u201crepair the damage\u201d and resume peace talks.\n\n\u201cHe either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change,\u201d Graham said of Zelenskyy.\n\nA few more moderate House Republicans, though, struck a different tone. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told NBC News that the heated exchange was \u201ca bad day for America\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called the meeting a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for both countries and said \u201cthe only winner of today is Vladimir Putin.\u201d And Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., called the day\u2019s events \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and said both sides should return to the negotiating table.\n\nHow Democrats are responding: Democrats universally slammed Trump and Vance, accusing them of kowtowing to Putin. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said during an interview on MSNBC that \u201cthis is the beginning of the end. Putin starts not only walking all over Ukraine, but walking all over Europe.\u201d\n\nAn earlier meeting Friday between Zelenskyy and senators was \u201cvery bipartisan and very supportive,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. Asked about the more rancorous tone in the Oval Office, Whitehouse said: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for letting Vance in the room.\u201d\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s dilemma on display in Oval Office clash\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nThe heated clash between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office has raised new questions about the prospects for peace in Ukraine. And it underscored the dilemma facing Zelenskyy as he tries to end his country\u2019s three-year war with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy has tried to stress the need for American support, while also warning that Ukraine must be involved in any peace negotiations and that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted.\n\nWhen I sat down with Zelenskyy earlier this month, he made it clear that the stakes are high.\n\n\u201cIt will be very, very, very difficult,\u201d Zelenskyy said when asked if Ukraine could survive without U.S. military support. \u201cAnd, of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance, low chance to survive without support of the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd the Ukrainian president seemed to choose his words carefully during our interview when asked if Trump was negotiating in good faith, saying, \u201cI hope so. Yes, I count on it. I count on it very much.\u201d\n\nBut today, Zelenskyy was defiant, with tensions between him and Trump reaching a boiling point at the White House.\n\nThe confrontation left more questions than answers about the path forward for peace in Ukraine. Will the U.S. still be involved in any potential ceasefire negotiations? Can those talks succeed if the U.S. is not involved? And could Ukraine lose the U.S. as an ally?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think that we will not be strategic partners,\u201d Zelenskyy told me earlier this month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it because it will make a pressure on morale \u2014 morality of Ukrainians and it will be worst thing from the very beginning of the war.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Oval Office clash also raises questions about the future of U.S. alliances with its traditional European partners, many of whom rallied around Ukraine.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed solidarity with Ukraine in social media posts after the meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron said, \u201cI think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so. And when I say \u2018we,\u2019 I mean the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others.\u201d\n\nWe will explore all of this and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83d\udcdd Next up: Trump is expected to sign an executive order aimed at making English the official language of the U.S. It would be the first time in history the country would have an official language.

            "full_content": "European allies were quick to stand up for Ukraine after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance openly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a sharply contentious Oval Office meeting Friday.\n\nZelenskyy and his Ukrainian team were told to leave the White House earlier than planned Friday and an important minerals agreement went unsigned, a White House official said, after a heated exchange in which Mr. Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being insufficiently grateful for U.S. support. The president told Zelenskyy he's \"gambling with World War III\" and did not acknowledge Russia's role in its assault on Ukraine.\n\nRussia immediately praised the president and vice president's admonishments of Zelenskyy. After the televised showdown, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia's security council, backed Mr. Trump on X: \"The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,\" the Russian official said of Zelenskyy. \"And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'\"\n\nEuropean allies leapt to defend Ukraine, and Zelenskyy reshared on X over 20 of their social media posts and thanked them.\n\n\"Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\" wrote Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council. \"Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You will never be alone, dear President @ZelenskyyUa.\"\n\n\"There is an aggressor: Russia,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X, in a translated post. \"There is a people under attack: Ukraine. We were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago and to continue to do so.\"\n\n\"Luxembourg stands with Ukraine,\" wrote Luc Frieden, prime minister of Luxembourg.\n\nThank you for your support. https://t.co/8miNebF718 \u2014 Volodymyr Zelenskyy / \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (@ZelenskyyUa) February 28, 2025\n\nCongressional Republicans have mostly fallen in line behind Mr. Trump, denouncing Zelenskyy's demeanor in the Oval Office meeting, while others have remained silent.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has been supportive of Ukraine, condemned Zelenskyy. Graham said he spoke with the Ukrainian leader Friday morning and warned him \"don't take the bait.\"\n\n\"I don't know if we could ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham told reporters outside the White on Friday. \"He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Washington, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, echoed the call for Zelenskyy to resign \"for the good of his country.\"\n\n\"Whatever your view on what happened in today's bizarre televised WH diplomatic meeting, the West needs US and Ukrainian leadership trust on confronting Russia. After today, that likely requires a new Ukrainian leader,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nRepublican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, however, defended Ukraine.\n\n\"A bad day for America's foreign policy. Ukraine wants independence, free markets and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West,\" he told CBS News. \"Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, a staunch Ukraine ally who serves as co-chair of the House Ukraine Caucus, said the meeting was \"heartbreaking\" to watch.\n\n\"It is time to put understandable emotions aside and come back to the negotiation table. This can and will be fixed,\" he said in a statement. \"I am confident that the parties will reconvene in pursuit of a mutually agreeable solution that best serves the interests of the United States of America and Ukraine. This is the only acceptable outcome.\"\n\nRepublican senators who have been supportive of Ukraine and not shy against disagreeing with Mr. Trump have yet to share their opinions, including Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nThe House or Senate were not in session Friday, making it more likely that lawmakers will be asked about the meeting in their districts or states over the weekend or when they return to the Capitol on Monday.\n\nDemocrats in Congress widely criticized Mr. Trump, calling him \"a useful idiot for Putin\" and \"an embarrassment.\"\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was among the bipartisan group of senators who talked with Zelenskyy just before his White House visit and posted a hopeful picture before the fateful White House meeting.\n\nReally good bipartisan meeting before President Zelensky heads to the White House. We stand with Ukraine.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 pic.twitter.com/s5NJx0BcKZ \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) February 28, 2025\n\nAfterward, Klobuchar responded to Vance on X that \"Zelenskyy has thanked our country over and over again both privately and publicly.\"\n\n\"And our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of Europe,\" she added. \"Shame on you.\"\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had thrown \"a temper tantrum in the Oval Office.\"\n\n\"This is just the latest in a string of alarming gestures made by Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin \u2014 excluding Ukraine and our allies from negotiations, refusing to hold Russia accountable for its invasion, parroting Kremlin propaganda, attempting to extort Ukraine at gunpoint, and siding with Russia at the UN. It's a dangerous pattern of deference to a dictator who seeks to undermine democracy worldwide,\" Meeks said.\n\n\"It is not President Zelensky who disrespected the United States in the Oval Office,\" he continued. \"It was Donald Trump-behaving exactly like the two-bit mob boss we've known him to be.\"\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, characterized Mr. Trump's conduct as \"downright un-American.\""

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nDuring a remarkably combative Oval Office meeting on Friday, both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he was insufficiently thankful.\n\n\u201cYou have to be thankful. You don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said, adding a bit later, \u201cYou gotta be more thankful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you said thank you once this entire meeting?\u201d Vance asked.\n\nTrump might have been referring to Zelensky\u2019s posture toward Trump in particular, as Vance appeared to be. But as their heated exchange with Zelensky reverberates around the world, it\u2019s worth noting that Zelensky has thanked the United States on numerous occasions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 \u2013 expressing gratitude to Trump and President Joe Biden, to members of Congress from both parties, to US defense companies and their employees, and to the American people.\n\nAfter Zelensky left the White House on Friday, he wrote on X: \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\u201d\n\nHere are 33 previous examples of Zelensky thanking or expressing gratitude toward the United States, its officials or its people for their support. This is not a comprehensive list. Notably, we did not review Zelensky\u2019s many domestic remarks in Ukrainian.\n\nJanuary 21, 2022, on X: \u201cThank you @POTUS for the unprecedented (American) diplomatic and military assistance for (Ukraine).\u201d\n\nJuly 1, 2022, on X: \u201cI commend US historic decision to provide UA with new security assistance package, including modern air defense systems. Thank you @POTUS for your continued leadership and support of UA in its fight against the aggressor. Together towards the victory!\u201d\n\nAugust 19, 2022, on X: \u201cI highly appreciate another (American) military aid package in the amount of $775 million. Thank you @POTUS for this decision! We have taken another important step to defeat the aggressor. (Ukraine) will be free!\u201d\n\nDecember 21, 2022, meeting with Biden: \u201cThank you so much, Mr. President. Of course thanks bipartisan support. Thanks Congress. And thanks from our, just, ordinary people to your ordinary people, Americans. I really appreciate.\u201d\n\nDecember 21, 2022, address to US Congress: \u201cNow, on this special Christmastime, I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people. I thank President Biden and both parties, at the Senate and the House, for your invaluable assistance. I thank your cities and your citizens who supported Ukraine this year, who hosted our Ukrainians, our people, who waved our national flags, who acted to help us. Thank you all, from everyone who is now at the front line, from everyone who is awaiting victory.\u201d And: \u201cFinancial assistance is also critically important, and I would like to thank you, thank you very much, thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us with and the ones you may be willing to decide on.\u201d\n\nSeptember 21, 2023, meeting with Biden: \u201cThank you so much, Mr. President, so warm and strong words to all the Ukrainians from you.

And we greatly appreciate that vital assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine to combat Russian terror, really terror.\u201d\n\nSeptember 21, 2023, address at the National Archives: \u201cThere is not a single soul here today who would not care what happens to freedom. And there is not a soul in Ukraine that does not feel gratitude to you, America. To you \u2013 the people who help us not because you have to, but because your heart cannot let you do otherwise. Thank you. That is humanity. This is what makes us Ukraine. That\u2019s what makes you America.\u201d And: \u201cThank you, America!\u201d\n\nNovember 20, 2023, on X: \u201cI am grateful to @POTUS Joe Biden, US Congress, and the entire American people for the new military aid package announced today.\u201d\n\nNovember 23, 2023, on X: \u201cOn behalf of all Ukrainians, Olena @ZelenskaUA and I wish all Americans a happy Thanksgiving. We thank you, the people of America. We know how many of you sincerely sympathize with our struggle and wish Ukraine victory.

Thanks to American support and global leadership, millions of Ukrainian lives have been saved. Ukraine is grateful to you!\u201d\n\nDecember 6, 2023, on X: \u201cI am grateful to @POTUS Joe Biden, Congress, and the American people for the new military aid package announced today.\u201d\n\nDecember 11, 2023, on X: \u201cI met with leaders of US defense companies and expressed my gratitude to every American worker who manufactures weapons that help us safeguard our people and defend our land.\u201d The post included a video clip from a Zelensky meeting with US defense industry executives, in which he said, \u201cI want to thank you, all of you, and your partners, and of course please pass from me messages to your workers, people who really work \u2013 and they did a lot for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nDecember 11, 2023, speech at the National Defense University: \u201cI want to start by saying thanks to (Defense) Secretary (Lloyd) Austin. A huge man, big friend of Ukraine. Thank you very much for your \u2013 personal \u2013 no really, thank you for your personal leadership during this time, for supporting us, supporting Ukraine, and defending all free world.

            "full_content": "After watching the Oval Office exchange on Friday between President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and their invited guest, Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 I\u2019m feeling some unusually visceral thoughts about my country. Betrayal, anger, embarrassment. Shame.\n\nTrump and Vance\u2019s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light.\n\nWe already know the post-World War II order is over. The U.S. voted against its allies \u2014 and with the dictatorships of North Korea and Belarus \u2014 at the United Nations this week, opposing a resolution condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and occupying about 20% of its land. We\u2019ve already heard Trump praise Russian President Vladimir Putin (many times) and call Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator.\u201d At a Cabinet meeting this week, Trump dismissed pleas from our NATO allies, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to provide a \u201cbackstop\u201d security guarantee in Ukraine, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have Europe do that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and Vance\u2019s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light, making it plain that our government is no longer a worthy ally to liberal democracies around the world.\n\nZelenskyy expressed his appreciation to Trump for what he described as a \u201cfirst step toward real security guarantees\u201d for Ukraine, while also insisting there should be \u201cno compromises\u201d with the \u201ckiller\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d Putin. Shortly after, Trump said that Zelenskyy ought to be more \u201cgrateful\u201d and that his \u201chatred\u201d for Putin makes it \u201ctough to make a deal.\u201d\n\nDeclaring himself a peacenik, Trump wrongly claimed his position \u2014 which is essentially to pre-emptively hand over Ukraine\u2019s bargaining chips at the negotiating table, give Putin whatever he wants and take him at his word that he won\u2019t reinvade \u2014 is more in line with Europe and the world\u2019s sentiments than Zelenskyy\u2019s.\n\nTrump, typically incoherent, rambled and repeated himself, so his vice president helpfully stepped in, saying Putin invaded Ukraine because then-President Joe Biden was weak and \u201cthe path to peace and prosperity is diplomacy.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy, armed with facts to counter Vance\u2019s MAGA rhetoric, noted that Putin first invaded Ukraine in 2014 (Trump incorrectly tried to correct him, saying it was 2015), and that he occupied Crimea and had been aggressing on Ukrainian territory ever since, including the four years of Trump\u2019s first term. He also noted that Putin\u2019s brutal 2022 invasion was itself a violation of a previous ceasefire \u2014 bringing further absurdity to the idea that Putin\u2019s promises for \u201cpeace\u201d can be trusted.\n\nThat was when Vance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media. Vance barked that he should be thanking Trump and not attacking the administration that is \u201ctrying to prevent the destruction of your country.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy, remarkably, kept his cool, trying to get in a word over the shouts of Trump and Vance, warning them that even though the U.S. has an ocean between itself and Europe, that the country would \u201cfeel\u201d the consequences of capitulating to Russia \u201cin the future.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when it completely went off the rails.\n\nVance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as \u2018disrespectful\u2019 for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media.\n\nTrump bellowed, \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III\u201d and attempted to humiliate Zelenskyy by saying \u201cyou don\u2019t have the cards.\u201d (The Ukrainian president replied that he\u2019s not playing cards, he\u2019s fighting a war.) Trump did a mock impersonation of Zelenskyy saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want a ceasefire!\u201d Vance said Zelenskyy should have raised his objections in private and not in front of the media, adding, \u201cWe know that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump what would happen if Putin broke a future ceasefire, the leader of the free world replied, \u201cWhat if a bomb drops on your head right now?\u201d before going on another incoherent rant about how Putin himself had suffered through the \u201cphony witch hunt\u201d and blamed the \u201cRussia Russia Russia\u201d investigation on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and \u201cshifty Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nHe then turned to Zelenskyy and said, \u201cI\u2019ve empowered you to be a tough guy and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be a tough guy without the United States,\u201d adding that if he doesn\u2019t \u201cmake a deal\u201d with Putin \u2014 the U.S. is \u201cout.\u201d Then Trump abruptly ended the press conference, noting \u201cthis is going to be great television.\u201d As reporters were shunted out of the room, Vance reassuringly patted his boss on the arm.\n\nMinutes after the meeting ended, Trump posted to his social media site Truth Social: \u201cI have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\u201d Trump also reportedly kicked Zelenskyy out of the White House.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s nominal president during the four years from 2008-12 when Putin pretended he wasn\u2019t actually in power, posted to X: \u201cThe insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is \u2018gambling with WWIII.\u2019\u201d\n\nThose few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 who sat silently next to Vance during the Oval Office fiasco \u2014 in February 2022 tweeted: \u201cThe people of #Ukraine are tough people who will NEVER accept being ruled by #Putin \u2026 Men, women, children, the elderly, they are going to fight \u2026 And they are going to maim & kill alot [sic] of Russians.\u201d Now that he works for Trump, Rubio posted this on Friday: \u201cThank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not one for extensive self-flagellating over America\u2019s many flaws. There are sins committed by this country\u2019s government and its people, both recent and historic, that can never be fully atoned for \u2014 but which we should always be working to understand and strive to never repeat. Still, I don\u2019t walk around life thinking the United States is irredeemable. \u200b\u200bFar from it, actually. On the ledger of history and in broad terms, I believe we\u2019ve been more right than we\u2019ve been wrong.\n\nAnd yet, those few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nOur president, for almost a century known as the \u201cLeader of the Free World,\u201d has abandoned that post. We, as represented by our government, offer support only in mafia-esque transactional terms (\u201cYou give us your nation\u2019s natural resources, and we\u2019ll protect you, maybe\u201d). Our leaders parrot the propaganda of an imperialist dictator who has acted as one of America\u2019s primary adversaries over the past two and a half decades. And a democratic ally that has miraculously survived an existential attack by its nuclear-armed neighbor for three years was humiliated on the world stage and essentially blamed for fighting back against Putin\u2019s aggression.\n\nMost perversely, the president\u2019s admirers call this \u201cdiplomacy\u201d and acting toward \u201cpeace.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say \u201cwe\u2019re the bad guys,\u201d but it\u2019s not at all too soon to say \u201cwe\u2019re on the side of the bad guys\u201d \u2014 and historic alliances and mutual values mean nothing to us anymore. The \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d is a gangster\u2019s paradise. It\u2019s a shameful day for America."

I say this because every day, me and my children have said a prayer for the Holy Father. We pray for his health, and we pray for his comfort as he deals with what appears to be a pretty serious health crisis,\u201d he said, continuing to extend grace to the pope and expressing that he does not need to be brought into every \u201cculture war\u201d in American politics.\n\nPope Francis, 88, has been hospitalized for two weeks with pneumonia and is reportedly in critical condition. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni paid him a visit at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome last week, Breitbart News reported.\n\nExplaining how Trump\u2019s foreign policy is aligned with the Catholic faith, Vance highlighted the administration\u2019s striving for peace and religious freedom:\n\n\u201cOne of the most important parts of President Trump\u2019s policy, and where I think President Trump\u2019s policy is most in accord with Christian social teaching and with the Catholic faith, is that more than any president of my lifetime, President Trump has pursued a path of peace,\u201d Vance stated. \u201cAnd we very often, I think, ignore the way in which our foreign policy is either an instrument or impediment to people all over the world being able to practice their faith.\u201d\n\nBringing up how Christians all over the world are being persecuted, namely in Nigeria, Vance said, \u201cThe Trump administration promises you, whether it\u2019s here at home with our own citizens, or all over the world, we will be the biggest defenders of religious liberties and the rights of conscience.\u201d\n\nVance also highlighted the need to \u201cprotect the religious liberty of Christians\u201d when dealing with conflicts in Europe and the Middle East:\n\nWhen President Trump talks about the need to bring peace, whether it\u2019s in Russia and Ukraine, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East, we of course have to recognize that as a policy oriented toward saving lives and carrying out one of Christ\u2019s most important Commandments. But I think we also must recognize that as an effort to protect the religious liberty of Christians, because over the last 40 years, it has often been historical christian communities who bare the brunt of failed American foreign policy and that is in my view, perhaps the most important way in which Donald Trump has been a defender of Christian rights all over the world.\n\nSpeaking on the \u201camazing\u201d thing that happened to him in November 2024, Vance brought up his young son\u2019s baptism as the most exciting event he experienced \u2014 even more so than winning the election:\n\nAnd when I think about the deep things, the things that really matter, there was something really amazing that happened to me in November of 2024. All my friends were there, all my family was there, we were gathered together in a great moment of celebration. And of course, I\u2019m talking about when my seven-year-old chose to be baptized into the Christian faith. \u2026 As amazing as it was to win the election, of course, in November of 2024, and as amazing as it was to know that President Trump would become president again and would get to accomplish so many good things for the American people, the thing that I was most excited about in November of 2024, is that the week after we won the election, my son chose to be baptized in the Christian faith.\n\nEmphasizing his interfaith marriage with second lady Usha Vance, the vice president described how much it meant to him when his seven-year-old son, Ewan, chose to be baptized into the Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cAs many of you know, I am part of an interfaith marriage. My wife, though she comes to church with us almost every single Sunday, she is not Catholic herself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd so, the bargain that we have struck is that we will raise our kids Catholic, but we will let them choose the moment that they want to ultimately become baptized.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if that\u2019s terrible sacrilege, blame the Dominicans because they\u2019re the ones who came up with this scheme,\u201d he joked."

            "full_content": "Drama in the Oval Office. Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe may never know whether Friday\u2019s bizarre contretemps in the Oval Office involving Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy was totally planned, entirely spontaneous, or something in between. From a transactional point of view, it sure looked like Vice-President Vance was determined to pick a fight with the Ukrainian president, or at least underline the contention that Ukraine did not adequately understand its unique debt to Trump or the folly of other American presidents. But did the incident serve any useful purpose to anyone? Is Trump privately dressing down Vance for spoiling a nice mineral-deal signing, press conference, and photo op?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Whatever the moment meant in terms of the rapidly evolving strategic situation of Russia and Ukraine, and the prospects for some kind of sustainable peace, the brouhaha nicely served the Trump administration\u2019s domestic political needs. It helped dramatize the ongoing MAGA effort to get Americans to stop thinking of Ukraine and its leader as courageous victims of Russian aggression, and start thinking of Ukrainians as disrespectful ingrates. Vance repeatedly browbeat Zelenskyy for failing to adequately thank the American people for their past support of Ukraine (support that Trump angrily denounced as the work of a \u201cstupid president\u201d named Biden) even as the Ukrainian president tried to cite his many expressions of gratitude.\n\nThe Oval Office setting was perfect for this projection of Trump as the generous host whose uncouth guest had tracked mud onto the carpet and wiped his grubby paws on the ornate sofa. This impression was reinforced by a nasty question to Zelenskyy from Brian Glenn of the very Trump-y Real America\u2019s Voice network demanding to know why the leader of that war-torn country wasn\u2019t wearing a suit:\n\nUkraine\u2019s enemies, of course, piled on immediately:\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova: \"How did Trump and Vance hold back from smacking that bastard \u2013 it's a marvel of restraint\" \u2014 max seddon (@maxseddon) February 28, 2025\n\nBut Trump fans brayed about the president\u2019s courage in the face of such incredibly rude insolence:\n\nThank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America First. America is with you! \u2014 Secretary Marco Rubio (@SecRubio) February 28, 2025\n\nAnd even more telling, at least one prominent Republican backer of a U.S.-Ukraine alliance got the memo and back-peddled madly, as The Hill reported:\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, who has been one of the most outspoken advocates for supporting the Ukraine war effort, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the heated exchange between President Trump, Vice-President Vance, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Friday \u2026\n\nGraham said it\u2019s now a major question whether the United States can continue to support Ukraine if Zelenskyy remains president.\n\n\u201cThe question for me is, \u2018Is he redeemable in the eyes of Americans?\u2019 Most Americans witnessing what they saw today would not want Zelenskyy to be their business partner, including me, and I\u2019ve been to Ukraine nine times since the war started,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what happens now; Trump left the door open for a resumption of talks if Zelenskyy got his head screwed on straight:\n\nNew statement from Trump: \"...I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America\u2026 \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) February 28, 2025\n\nBut the incident and the Trumpworld spin on it are significant steps toward a revolution in perceptions wherein Ukraine is seen as the world\u2019s great trouble-maker even as the U.S. and Russia work toward peace. All those Americans with Ukrainian flags hanging from their porches can expect some fresh contempt from their MAGA neighbors."

            "full_content": "On a Monday in August 2013, I sat for coffee with a colleague from The Washington Post when suddenly my phone buzzed. Our paper had been sold to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. We were shocked \u2014 and uncertain. How would Bezos run a newspaper? How much control would he expect over our coverage? Would he replace us all with Amazon Echos?\n\nBezos, though, promised no upheaval. \u201cThe values of The Post do not need changing,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Post employees that same day. \u201cThe paper\u2019s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.\u201d And for years that proved true. Through the end of my time at the Post\u2019s Opinions section, in 2022, I cannot recall a single instance of interference in the section\u2019s product.\n\nBut more than a decade on, Bezos has decided that \u201cthe values of The Post\u201d do need changing. Its duty will no longer be to its readers, but to his private interests \u2014 and to propping up a myth about capitalism and freedom.\n\nIt is entirely fitting that Bezos would ignore the free market even as he praises it.\n\nThe last several months have been a turbulent time for the Post, and particularly its Opinions section, with several controversies concerning readers and staffers alike. Just days before the presidential election, Bezos blocked the editorial board\u2019s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. Last month, my colleague from that August 2013 coffee \u2014 cartoonist Ann Telnaes \u2014 resigned after Opinions editor David Shipley declined to run her cartoon of billionaires, including Bezos, bowing to Trump. Two weeks later, Bezos joined other tech oligarchs in prominent seating at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, he declared a new party line for the paper\u2019s Opinions section, prompting Shipley\u2019s resignation. \u201cWe are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,\u201d Bezos announced. \u201cWe\u2019ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\u201d\n\nThe focus on \u201cfree markets,\u201d however, is especially ironic. Washington Post customers already signaled they do not want what Bezos is selling. His hires for executive positions have been largely failures. NPR reports that despite \u201caggressively\u201d wooing new subscribers since the spiked endorsement, the Post has suffered \u201ca net loss of a couple hundred thousand subscribers\u201d \u2014 a larger number than all but a handful of American newspapers. And as Shipley reportedly reminded Bezos, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page already fills the \u201cliberty and free markets\u201d viewpoint that Bezos claims is \u201cunderserved.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ratings and traffic for liberal opinion media (including MSNBC) are rising. Wired magazine added more than 60,000 subscriptions in just the first two weeks of February thanks to its aggressive coverage of Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nYet it is entirely fitting that Bezos would ignore the free market even as he praises it, because he has risen and thrived under a capitalist system that pays lip service to free markets but is far from that in practice.\n\nBezos and his ilk want to cement the status quo that enrages so many Americans.\n\nAmazon and other technology titans, from Microsoft to Apple to Meta to Tesla, thrive not in the face of competition but because of the lack of it. None of these companies are complete monopolies, but they all dominate one or more sectors and can leverage their sheer scale against competitors and even customers. The very model of Silicon Valley venture capital firms \u2014 which have produced far more failed startups than successes \u2014 depends on the idea that when a venture does succeed, it doesn\u2019t just capture some good business; it captures all or nearly all of that market.\n\nAnd when that private sector power isn\u2019t enough, Bezos and other oligarchs leverage their influence to get your dollars \u2014 more specifically, your taxpayer dollars. Federal contracts provide billions of dollars to Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud computing division that generated more than half of Amazon\u2019s profits in 2023. Author Ed Niedermeyer points out that Elon Musk\u2019s companies have received more in government subsidies, loans and contracts than Tesla, his only profitable company, has created in income in its entire existence. As for government regulators, those weren\u2019t already captured are being torn down.\n\nIf not \u201cfree markets,\u201d then what is Bezos arguing for? As the Bulwark\u2019s Jonathan Last argued earlier this week, the tech oligarchs are trying to bring the \u201cwinner take all\u201d (or \u201cnearly all\u201d) mindset to politics. \u201cDemocracy represents competition,\u201d Last wrote, \u201cand they are \u2014 quite openly \u2014 anti-competitive.\u201d\n\nBezos and his ilk want to cement the status quo that enrages so many Americans: what Martin Luther King Jr. called \u201csocialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.\u201d An independent press, Bezos has decided, is an obstacle to that goal. And if that decision entails torching the credibility of a paper that once took down a president, he\u2019ll happily pay that price to hoard his wealth."

            "full_content": "Senators Ron Wyden and Mike Crapo don\u2019t see eye to eye about how to \u201cscore\u201d tax cuts. Photo: Shuran Huang/The New York Times/Redux\n\nAside from the ongoing smash-and-grab operations by which Elon Musk and DOGE are seeking by fiat to create a federal government to their liking, the main drama in Trump\u2019s Washington right now involves tortured efforts to make the fiscal arithmetic of his agenda add up to something other than a catastrophe. The single biggest problem facing congressional Republicans is how to find ways to pay for Trump\u2019s tax-cut promises, which could add as much as $10 trillion to a national-debt burden they already profess to be intolerable. Yes, they can and will cut federal spending as much as the political market can bear and will hope to pocket any savings wrung from federal programs and personnel by DOGE. But it won\u2019t be enough.\n\nSo Senate Republicans, who are particularly invested in Trump\u2019s tax-cut agenda, are eyeing one very big gimmick \u2014 perhaps more accurately called a lie \u2014 to hide the cost, as NBC News reports:\n\nRepublicans are considering a far-reaching change to the budget process that would obscure the deficit impact of extending President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar tax cuts in order to avoid paying for them.\n\nIt comes as part of a massive bill to advance Trump\u2019s agenda that Republicans are seeking to pass on a party-line basis. If the tactic is successful, it would upend long-standing precedent and change the accounting process for current and future lawmakers, with major policy stakes.\n\nExtending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in 2017, would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the official nonpartisan scorekeeper. That\u2019s under the \u201ccurrent law\u201d metric that has traditionally been used, as the tax cuts are slated to expire at the end of this year. But Senate Republicans want to use a different scoring method called the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline, which would assume that extending tax cuts costs $0 because they\u2019re already law.\n\nIn other words, close to half of the cost of Trump\u2019s tax agenda would magically become free.\n\nThe argument that the 2017 tax cuts are baked into the cake of the federal budget is seductive, but there\u2019s a big problem: When they were first enacted, they were made temporary in order to avoid busting the budget egregiously. They weren\u2019t \u201cfree\u201d then and thus cannot be \u201cfree\u201d now. Extending them will, in fact, cost trillions of dollars more than letting them expire, which is exactly what current law provides.\n\nThe fiscal watchdogs of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget call changing the treatment of the tax cuts scheduled to expire \u201cnihilistic, ahistorical, and inaccurate.\u201d But the switcheroo sounds good to Republicans struggling to make the math work. In particular, the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by Mike Crapo of Idaho, is promoting the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d scam because it makes his assigned task of bringing Trump\u2019s tax agenda to fruition immensely easier. And though Democrats are howling about the deception (the Finance Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Oregon\u2019s Ron Wyden, called it \u201ca phony, fake concept\u201d), they may in their heart of hearts hope it happens in order to reduce the pressure for spending cuts.\n\nPartisan opposition aside, there are multiple obstacles to the realization of this GOP scheme. Most important, the Senate parliamentarian could rule that it violates the \u201cscoring\u201d rules governing the congressional budget process. In theory, the Senate majority can overrule such decisions, but it rarely, if ever, happens and, in this case, stealth would likely be necessary to achieve a sudden multitrillion-dollar shift in the assumptions underlying the enactment of the Trump administration\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\nAnother possible problem is that deficit hawks within the GOP could object to a cost-free package of tax cuts. The NBC News story on the scam quoted the ever-irascible Texas representative Chip Roy as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like gimmicks, so I\u2019m trying to wrestle with that.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the biggest problem with wishing away the costs of Trump\u2019s tax cuts is that the real-world arbiters of fiscal matters and their impact, like the Federal Reserve Board and the financial markets, generally are not going to be fooled by it and could take countervailing actions to hedge against the presumably inflationary effect of more deficit and debt. Two plus two does not, in fact, equal nine, and pretending it does is a really bad idea, particularly when the goal is high-end tax cuts that aren\u2019t popular anyway."

Photo: Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAt congressional town halls across the country over the past few weeks, Republican members of Congress have been met with anger from voters over the hastily applied cuts to federal agencies and mass layoffs led by Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nThe scenes, which have taken place in ruby-red districts from Georgia to Missouri, quickly prompted comparisons to the tea-party movement of the late aughts or the early years of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, in which the opposition party rode waves of palpable voter discontent to improved margins in subsequent elections.\n\nBut those public displays could soon be coming to an end if Republican leaders have their say. The Wall Street Journal reports that Representative Richard Hudson, the head of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, warned members in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday that the protests will likely get worse and urged them to move away from in-person town hall events. Per Punchbowl News, the NRCC chair suggested utilizing tele-town halls, claiming that Democrats can use the in-person gatherings to stage a viral disruption.\n\nWhile counseling members to avoid such scenes, Republican leaders are also downplaying them \u2014 and getting conspiratorial. During a CNN interview last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that Democrats are actually to blame for the rancor.\n\n\u201cThe videos you saw of the town halls were for paid protesters in many of those places. These are Democrats who went to the events early and filled up the seats,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson continued, \u201cThis is an old playbook that they pulled out and ran, and it made it look like that what is happening in Washington is unpopular. But I\u2019m gonna tell you, Kaitlan, the American people are behind what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, Punchbowl News reported that some of the protests appear to have been organized by MoveOn.org and Indivisible, two progressive organizations that stand in clear opposition of Trump\u2019s and Musk\u2019s joint ambitions. But there\u2019s currently no evidence of paid attendees at these events.\n\nIt seems some Republicans have already had enough. On Saturday, Representative Roger Marshall of Kansas ended a town hall in his district early after being grilled on the recent federal cuts, calling the assembled crowd \u201cone of the rudest audiences I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) ends his constituent town hall early today after being pressed about DOGE firing veterans. pic.twitter.com/s8U0w7Gxgq \u2014 Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) March 1, 2025\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if congressional Republicans will heed their leaders\u2019s advice. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sunday that several Georgia members still planned to hold in-person town halls even after their colleague Rich McCormick\u2019s event went viral in late February due to anger from voters in attendance."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nA remarkable shouting match broke out in the Oval Office Friday as President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, an extraordinarily fractious display that only underscored the deeply uncertain future of American assistance to Kyiv.\n\nNever before has an American president verbally attacked his visitor like Trump did Zelensky, leading to an almost real-time breakdown in relations between Washington and Kyiv. Trump at one point threatened to give up on Ukraine entirely.\n\nCastigating Zelensky for not demonstrating enough gratitude for American support, Trump and Vice President JD Vance raised their voices, accusing the besieged leader of standing in the way of a peace agreement with Russia. Later, he was essentially kicked out of the White House and departed with a grim look on his face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right now, not really in a very good position. You\u2019ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,\u201d Trump told the Ukrainian president. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing cards,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What Kaitlan Collins saw during fiery Trump-Zelensky argument 01:55 - Source: CNN What Kaitlan Collins saw during fiery Trump-Zelensky argument 01:55\n\nRaising his voice, after more back-and-forth, Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Vance accused Zelensky of being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d toward his American hosts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not acting all that thankful,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\u201cHave you said \u2018thank you\u2019 once?\u201d Vance asked Zelensky.\n\nAfterward, Trump huddled with his key advisers inside the Oval Office to assess the situation, including Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThat was when Trump ultimately decided Zelensky was \u201cnot in a place to negotiate.\u201d He directed Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver the message: it was time for Zelensky to leave.\n\nThe Ukrainians were holding nearby in a separate room, which is standard when a foreign leader visits the White House. Typically, they go to other rooms, then reconvene for lunch.\n\nBut the Ukrainians wouldn\u2019t be dining at the White House Friday. Plates of spring green salad, rosemary roasted chicken and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e went untouched by the Ukrainian guests.\n\nAs the prepared food sat nearby on carts in a hallway outside the press secretary\u2019s office, the Ukrainians were instructed to leave.\n\nThe White House official said the Ukrainians protested and wanted to continue the talks. But they were told no.\n\nZelensky left shortly thereafter. He has canceled his planned afternoon speech at the Hudson Institute, an official with the think tank announced to attendees.\n\nA scheduled joint press conference was scrapped and Zelensky departed the White House in his black SUV without signing a planned agreement on providing US access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals. Trump posted online that his counterpart was not welcome back until he was \u201cready for peace.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration moved quickly on Friday to try to turn the diplomatic uproar into a sign of strength, dispatching allies like South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham to the cameras outside the West Wing to call on Zelensky to apologize. The White House issued a statement saying: \u201cPresident Trump and VP Vance are standing up for Americans.\u201d\n\nNow, Zelensky will leave Washington with the fate of his country, and his own future as its leader, in doubt.\n\nAhead of his arrival, Trump had already voiced open hostility toward Zelensky, whom he termed a dictator. Yet he seemed to moderate his tone a day earlier, declining to repeat the criticism.\n\nBut the tense 10-minute exchange in the Oval Office went well beyond any of the usual diplomatic rifts, allowing the gulf between the men to play out publicly in front of television cameras. It was about as angry as Trump has ever allowed himself to be seen in public.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either going to make a deal or we\u2019re out,\u201d the US president said, adding later: \u201cIf we\u2019re out, you\u2019ll fight it out. I don\u2019t think it will be pretty.\u201d\n\nVance, who has often sat silently in Oval Office meetings during the opening weeks of his vice presidency, sparked tension with the visiting Ukrainian leader. Before joining Trump on the ticket last year, the freshman Ohio senator was among the loudest GOP critics of assistance to Ukraine \u2013 skepticism that he has carried into the White House.\n\nThe fiery exchanges Friday served as a stark example of the dramatic whiplash in American foreign policy since Trump and Vance assumed office last month. The tensions escalated dramatically during a session that began with a series of pleasantries as Trump waxed aloud about his legacy.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'A coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet': Rep. Moulton on Trump's meeting with Zelensky 01:59 - Source: CNN 'A coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet': Rep. Moulton on Trump's meeting with Zelensky 01:59\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m going to be remembered as a peacemaker,\u201d Trump said as he looked ahead to the prospect of finalizing a broader peace deal with Russia and Ukraine.\n\nBut the acrimony that burst into full view raised questions about the prospects of reaching a peaceful solution, raising fresh alarm across Europe, where leaders have worked for weeks to warn Trump of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s past actions and potential future intentions with Ukraine.\n\nAgain and again, Trump has sided with Putin. But with voices raised in the Oval Office, Trump unleashed years of pent-up frustration toward Russia and Ukraine, which led to his first impeachment.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump said in a Truth Social post that Zelensky could come back to the White House \u201cwhen he is ready for peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\u201d\n\nFor the sake of diplomacy, it was a catastrophic end to a week that began on a hopeful note at the White House, where French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited in hopes of paving the way to a security agreement with Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s meetings with the pair of European leaders were awash in pleasantries to prepare him for his one-on-one session with Zelensky, which ended as no one could have imagined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve empowered you to be a tough guy,\u201d Trump said to the Ukrainian leader. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be a tough guy without the United States.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with reporters after a TV appearance at the White House, Graham said Zelensky \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again. I think most Americans saw a guy that they would not want to go into business with. The way he handled the meeting, the way he confronted the president was just over the top,\u201d Graham said.\n\nGraham said he had spoken to Zelensky Friday morning.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take the bait,\u201d Graham recalled saying. \u201cPresident Trump was in a very good mood last night.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats placed the blame on Trump and Vance.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the meeting \u201ca political ambush and a shameful failure of American leadership\u201d in a statement. The Rhode Island Democrat said the day\u2019s \u201ccruel and callous display does great harm to U.S. standing in the world. Trump and Vance are communicating to the world that the United States is not to be trusted. Adversaries and allies alike will take note.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler and Lauren Fox contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nFrom slaps to envelope mix-ups, it\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen at the Academy Awards. The most glamourous night in Hollywood unfolds during three-and-a-half hours of live television, nearly ensuring some sort of unexpected shocker.\n\nBut this year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 CEO Bill Kramer is really hoping the drama unfolds only in the Oscar race itself.\n\n\u201cMany of the races are wide open,\u201d Kramer told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cA lot of our possible winners are really up for grabs. It\u2019s going to be an exciting night.\u201d\n\nThis award season has embraced a flurry of sporadic winners, showcasing few consistent shoo-ins, particularly in the best picture category.\n\nThe campaign for the film \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which leads with 13 Oscar nominations, was upended by past offensive tweets from the film\u2019s star Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n. A source told CNN that Gasc\u00f3n is still expected to attend the ceremony on Sunday night, though it\u2019s unclear where she\u2019ll be seated and if she\u2019ll walk the red carpet.\n\nWhen asked if the Academy considered rescinding Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s individual nomination, Kramer deflected and instead highlighted the groundbreaking nature of Gasc\u00f3n being the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an acting Oscar.\n\n\u201cAll of our nominees are invited to attend the Oscars,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what\u2019s so important this year, we have over 200 nominees,\u201d Kramer continued, adding, \u201cWe need to celebrate all of (them).\u201d\n\nSo, what will happen on Oscar Sunday? Here, the Academy CEO previews what to expect:\n\nConan O\u2019Brien will bring the laughs, but won\u2019t make celebrities cry\n\nWhy was Conan O\u2019Brien the perfect choice to host the show this year?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lovely person, number one. He\u2019s a humanist. He\u2019s apolitical,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cHe invites everybody in to enjoy, and he\u2019s so smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, tonally, Conan strikes the perfect balance,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe never punch below the belt. That\u2019s key. This is not about making fun of people in a way that\u2019s cruel. It\u2019s not about making fun of our film industry. Conan stays above the fray.\u201d\n\nWill \u2018Wicked\u2019 open the show?\n\nThis week, major musical performers were announced for the Oscars, including Queen Latifah, Raye, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, plus Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\n\nFor the 2025 Oscars, these superstar artists will perform as yet unannounced songs, replacing the tradition of performing the nominated best original song onstage. Instead, the songwriters nominated in the category will be recognized in a pre-produced segment that shares more of their backstories and accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWicked\u201d stars Grande and Erivo are confirmed to perform, but Kramer didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries regarding what song or songs they will sing and whether they will open the show.\n\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande attend the \"Wicked\" New York Premiere in 2024. Theo Wargo/Getty Images/File\n\n\u201cYou will see. You have to tune in,\u201d he allowed.\n\n\u201c\u2019Wicked\u2019 is an undeniable smash,\u201d Kramer added. \u201cCynthia and Ariana are such incredible performers. We are so thrilled that they\u2019ll be on the show this year as performers, and I think all fans of \u2018Wicked\u2019 and beyond will love what they have planned.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect politics to take center stage\n\nHollywood celebrities are known to make political statements at award shows, but Kramer said he hopes the night will \u201cabsolutely\u201d steer clear of politics.\n\nOf course, no one can predict what a winner will stay when they get up to the podium, but Kramer shared that guidelines are suggested to anyone taking the stage, in an effort to avoid any controversial statements.\n\n\u201cWe do talk to them about keeping things focused on the work, but this is really a moment for the artist to have for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nGet ready for surprise A-list reunions\n\n\u201cFilmmaking is a collaborative art \u2013 more so than almost any other art form,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe Academy represents all components of filmmaking. We want to bring them into the show and celebrate the community of people who make movies \u2013 so reunions is one great way to do that.\u201d\n\nWhen prodded for any names, Kramer stayed mum, but ensured CNN that viewers will be surprised to see some famous familiar faces back together.\n\n\u201cWell, I obviously can\u2019t tell you any surprises today, but know that there are going to be incredible surprises on the show this year,\u201d he teased.\n\nThe Oscars will raise funds for LA wildfire rebuilding efforts\n\n\u201cWe will be celebrating Los Angeles\u2019 resilience,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be celebrating our community \u2013 not just our community of filmmakers, but the community of Los Angeles. LA has attracted filmmakers and creative visionaries for well over a century. This is a moment to really celebrate that.\u201d\n\nHe added that there will be an element to raise funds, just like the Grammy Awards did earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWe will be encouraging people to join us in supporting relief efforts throughout the night,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nRuntime\n\nEvery year, critics say that the Oscars telecast is too long. Kramer isn\u2019t blind to the criticism, but he explained that it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d to the Academy for \u201call disciplines to be celebrated on the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year we had all of the awards on the show and we came in under time. We were under 3 hours and 30 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to do this in a way that\u2019s entertaining, and we will continue to evolve the show and to think about that.\u201d\n\nThe Academy Awards will air live on ABC and stream live on Hulu on Sunday beginning at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nForeign adversaries including Russia and China have recently directed their intelligence services to ramp up recruiting of US federal employees working in national security, targeting those who have been fired or feel they could be soon, according to four people familiar with recent US intelligence on the issue and a document reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe intelligence indicates that foreign adversaries are eager to exploit the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to conduct mass layoffs across the federal workforce \u2013 a plan laid out by the Office of Personnel Management earlier this week.\n\nRussia and China are focusing their efforts on recently fired employees with security clearances and probationary employees at risk of being terminated, who may have valuable information about US critical infrastructure and vital government bureaucracy, two of the sources said. At least two countries have already set up recruitment websites and begun aggressively targeting federal employees on LinkedIn, two of the sources said.\n\nA document produced by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service said the intelligence community assessed with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that foreign adversaries were trying to recruit federal employees and \u201ccapitalize\u201d on the Trump administration\u2019s plans for mass layoffs, according to a partly redacted copy reviewed by CNN.\n\nIt added that foreign intelligence officers were being directed to look for potential sources on LinkedIn, TikTok, RedNote and Reddit.\n\nAt least one foreign intelligence officer directed an asset to create a company profile on Linkedin and post a job advertisement, and to actively pursue federal employees who indicate they are \u201copen to work,\u201d the NCIS document says.\n\nThe adversaries think the employees \u201care at their most vulnerable right now,\u201d another of the sources said. \u201cOut of a job, bitter about being fired, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of imagination to see that these cast aside federal workers with a wealth of institutional knowledge represent staggeringly attractive targets to the intelligence services of our competitors and adversaries,\u201d a third source familiar with the recent US assessments told CNN.\n\nThe intelligence seems to confirm what was previously a hypothetical fear for current and US officials: that the mass firings could offer a rich recruitment opportunity for foreign intelligence services that might seek to exploit financially vulnerable or resentful former employees. The Justice Department has charged multiple former military and intelligence officials for providing US intelligence to China in recent years.\n\n\u201cChina has always been committed to developing relations with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d said Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu. \u201cWe oppose groundless speculation on China without factual basis.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as well as the embassy of Russia in Washington for comment.\n\nOfficials have been discussing the risk\n\nCareer officials at the CIA have been quietly discussing that risk and how to mitigate it in the recent weeks, current and former intelligence officials previously told CNN. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard earlier this week suggested that those discussions represented a \u201cthreat\u201d made by disloyal government employees \u2014 rather than a clinical warning of the potential risks posed by President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting strategy \u2014 and that those involved should be penalized.\n\n\u201cI am curious about how they think this is a good tactic to keep their job,\u201d Gabbard told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re exposing themselves essentially by making this indirect threat using their propaganda arm through CNN that they\u2019ve used over and over and over again to reveal their hand, that their loyalty is not at all to America. It is not to the American people or the Constitution. It is to themselves.\n\n\u201cAnd these are exactly the kind of people that we need to root out, get rid of so that the patriots who do work in this area, who are committed to our core mission can actually focus on that,\u201d she said.\n\nMultiple current officials across national security agencies who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity expressed frustration at the administration\u2019s response to what they see as very real warnings \u2014 not partisan swiping.\n\n\u201cEmployees that feel they have been mistreated by an employer have historically been much more likely to disclose sensitive information,\u201d said Holden Triplett, who served as director of counterintelligence at the National Security Council in the first Trump administration and is a former FBI attach\u00e9 at the US embassies in Moscow and Beijing. \u201cWe may be creating, albeit somewhat unintentionally, the perfect recruitment environment.\u201d\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t reality TV\u2019\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t reality TV,\u201d said another former intelligence official. \u201cThere are consequences.\u201d\n\nThe CIA and Defense Department are weighing significant staff cuts. The Pentagon said in a memo last week that over 5,000 probationary employees, who in most cases have been in their job a year or less, could be fired in the short term. And the CIA has already fired more than 20 officers for their work on diversity issues, many of whom are now challenging their dismissal in court.\n\nThe CIA also aggressively seeks to recruit disaffected government employees in adversarial countries \u201call the time,\u201d noted a former intelligence official \u2014 using similar tactics. The agency has released a series of public recruitment videos aimed at persuading disgruntled Russian government employees to spy for the United States, videos that detailed ways to securely contact the agency.\n\n\u201c\u2019Domestic political turbulence in your country? Sign up with us to help us help your country!\u2019\u201d the former official paraphrased the US efforts, adding that those efforts deeply aggravate foreign governments.\n\nThe CIA may have already inadvertently put some American secrets within the grasp of foreign spies and hackers. In an effort to comply with the executive order to downsize the federal workforce, the CIA earlier this month sent the White House an extraordinarily unusual email listing all new hires that have been with the agency for two years or less \u2014 a list that included CIA officers who were preparing to operate under cover \u2014 over an unclassified email server.\n\nSome of those officers, who have had access to classified information about the agency\u2019s operations and tradecraft, may now be terminated as part of the layoffs.\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed reporting."

            "full_content": "Trump\u2019s good at ordering people around but not so good at arithmetic. Photo: rancis Chung/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s congressional allies have a very big fiscal arithmetic problem that has yet to become entirely visible to debt-and-deficit hawks, financial markets, and the public at large. He has promised, and his party\u2019s donor base really wants, an extension of the tax cuts he pushed through Congress during his first term. That will cost a minimum of $4.5 trillion over ten years, if they are made permanent, according to the center-right, business-friendly Tax Foundation, and with interest costs, would add $5.4 trillion to the national debt. Much as tax cuts often sound like dessert to voters, they seem to want Congress to eat broccoli first, according to a USA Today\u2013Suffolk poll taken just before Trump took office:\n\nTrump has said that one of his first legislative initiatives will be to extend and expand the tax cuts passed in his first term, now set to expire after this year.\n\nBut in the survey, a 53% majority of voters said Congress should focus on cutting the federal budget deficit, even if it meant not extending the tax cuts. Just 28% said Congress should extend the tax cuts even if it means increasing the deficit. \u2026\n\nEnthusiasm for tax cuts was relatively restrained even among Republicans: 46% put a higher priority on cutting taxes, and 38% on curbing the deficit.\n\nTo the extent that the 2017 tax cuts showered the most benefits on wealthy individuals and the corporations they run, it\u2019s worth noting that polls regularly show voters across party lines believe these beneficiaries of Trump 1.0 largesse are not bearing their fair share of the tax burden. Now it\u2019s true that on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump promised additional tax cuts that are popular among people who could not possibly get across the security barriers at Mar-a-Lago. He proposed eliminating federal income taxes on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits. Unfortunately, the deficit-focused Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates these swing-voter-pleasing tax cuts could cost as much as another $5 trillion. Trump is also backing, and key House Republicans are demanding, more federal income-tax deductions for state and local tax expenditures. These could cost as much as $1.2 trillion more, according to CRFB.\n\nKeeping all these promises without ballooning the federal budget deficit to unprecedented levels is made more complicated by the Trump-GOP drive to increase spending on national defense and border security, priorities reflected in both the House and Senate budget resolutions already passed.\n\nOf course, congressional Republicans and the administration agree on the desirability of domestic spending cuts that don\u2019t contradict Trump\u2019s pledges not to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, or perhaps even Medicaid benefits, depending on which promises you actually believe. Republicans even hope they can pocket some of the savings wrung out of the federal bureaucracy by Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE raids on agency programs and personnel, though these, too, are becoming more unpopular every day.\n\nSo Republicans in Congress are very interested in fresh ways to make it all add up. And Trump has a ready suggestion: tariffs! Despite considerable conservative and business-sector opposition to the 47th president\u2019s long-standing protectionist trade agenda, those worried about debt and deficits are listening, as Politico reports:\n\nGOP leaders and President Donald Trump are strategizing over how to incorporate revenue from new tariffs in their massive party-line domestic policy bill, with the goal of arguing the multitrillion-dollar legislation doesn\u2019t add to the national debt.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other senior Republicans discussed the topic during their White House meeting Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Republicans are still planning to keep the tariffs outside the final reconciliation package. But the group discussed how to score and eventually count the revenue as part of their plans for a deficit-neutral bill.\n\nIn other words, congressional Republicans won\u2019t take on a battle to enact new tariffs, but they\u2019ll be happy to claim the revenues from tariffs Trump imposes via presidential orders to help meet his tax-cut promises. And sure enough, as the same Politico story reports, Trump followed up his meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune by announcing that new 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico will go into effect on March 4.\n\nThis gambit may help with the GOP\u2019s fiscal arithmetic, but it doesn\u2019t help with the politics. Trump may believe that \u201ctariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d but aside from the deep hostility to tariff wars felt by free-market economists and multinational corporate interests, the public\u2019s not that jazzed. Polls show there is significant support for tariffs on China, but not so much on Canada, Mexico, or Europe. And despite Trump\u2019s claim that tariffs will be paid by foreigners, polls also show that solid majorities of Americans agree with economists that increased tariffs will boost consumer prices right here in the United States. Given the extreme sensitivity of Americans to the cost of living \u2014 arguably the preeminent issue that returned Trump to the presidency in 2024 \u2014 this is one Trump priority that is especially dangerous.\n\nBeyond the unpopularity of tariffs as a way to pay for relatively unpopular tax cuts, there\u2019s a logical problem as well: If tariffs work to win concessions from foreign countries or succeed in convincing companies to relocate operations to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, then they won\u2019t raise the revenues Republicans are already counting upon. If they do raise revenues, they will be paid not by foreign companies but by the American consumers who will pay increased prices for both foreign goods and for domestic goods that will be insulated from low-cost competition. If Trump tariffs work economically, they won\u2019t work fiscally. So as an answer to the Republican craving for offsets to tax cuts, they don\u2019t fill the bill. And in the longer run, tariffs will reinforce the extremely dangerous impression that Trump is bent on replacing progressive income taxes with highly regressive levies on everyone who goes to Walmart and expects lower prices for items America just doesn\u2019t produce efficiently anymore."

            "full_content": "The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued an impassioned condemnation of President Donald Trump on Friday after he announced a plan to impose an extra ten-percent tariff on Chinese goods in March in response to China\u2019s role in the American fentanyl crisis.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is a major global supplier of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, a deadly opioid fueling a dramatic rise in drug-related deaths in North America. The U.S. government estimates that 150 people die in the United States every day as result of fentanyl and other opioid overdoses, a problem worsened by drug dealers lacing other drugs, such as cocaine, with traces of fentanyl that users often do not know are present and are often enough to kill the user.\n\nAs a result of China\u2019s outsized role in producing fentanyl and helping its traffickers, President Trump announced shortly after taking office that he would impose tariffs on Chinese goods after being inaugurated, along with tariffs on Canada and Mexico in response to their failure to secure their U.S. borders. Trump has yet to impose the tariffs, extending the deadline in response to rapid action by the Canadian and Mexican governments, but he repeated the threat on Thursday, announcing a plan to impose the tariffs on March 4.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to the announcement with ire on Friday, insisting that the fentanyl crisis is not a Chinese problem and accusing Trump of \u201cblackmail.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina deplores and opposes this move, and will take what is necessary to firmly defend its legitimate interests,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters, without elaborating on those interests.\n\nLin went on to insist that fentanyl is not an issue for China but, out of the Communist Party\u2019s alleged generosity, it has agreed to help Washington with solving it.\n\n\u201cThe fentanyl issue is the U.S.\u2019s own problem. China has given support to the U.S.\u2019s response to the fentanyl issue in the spirit of humanity,\u201d Lin claimed. \u201cChina has conducted counternarcotics cooperation with the U.S. side in a broad-based and in-depth way. The remarkable progress is there for all to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fentanyl issue is just an excuse the U.S. uses to impose tariffs on, pressure and blackmail China, and they punish us for helping them,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis will not solve their concerns. It is only counterproductive and will deal a heavy blow to the dialogue and cooperation with China on counternarcotics.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese regime propaganda outlet, further accused America of \u201cingratitude\u201d on the fentanyl issue, demanding that Washington be grateful to China to its performative actions in response to concerns about China\u2019s role in the fentanyl trade.\n\n\u201cChina is one of the world\u2019s toughest countries on counternarcotics both in terms of policy and its implementation. The fentanyl crisis is primarily a US issue,\u201d the Times repeated, echoing the Foreign Ministry. \u201cIn the spirit of humanity and goodwill, China has given support to the US in its response to this issue.\u201d\n\nContrary to the Chinese government\u2019s insistences, ample evidence exists that China play a protagonist role in the development and trafficking of fentanyl. In his 2024 book Blood Money, investigative journalist Peter Schweizer revealed that China aids in the trafficking of fentanyl precursors to North America and helps Mexican drug cartels produce and distribute the drug.\n\n\u201cWhile we debate domestic politics to address the fentanyl crisis, the reality is that Beijing is deeply involved at every stage of the drug\u2019s production and distribution in the United States,\u201d Schweizer wrote in the book.\n\n\u201cBased on leaked US national security documents, Mexican government hacked emails or correspondence, and Chinese corporate records, we know that the fentanyl operation is under Chinese control from start to finish,\u201d he reported.\n\nIn response to China\u2019s role in the crisis, Trump has proposed imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump initially proposed a ten-percent tariff on China and 25-percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, which he postponed in response to conversations with those governments.\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump announced that the tariffs would go into effect on March 4 and that he would add an extra ten-percent tariff on China.\n\n\u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and supplied by, China,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. \u201cMore than 100,000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cAs scheduled. China will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date. The April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.\n\nThe contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"\n\nLater in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy.\n\n\"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.\n\nZelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration Putin violated the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which had been signed by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\"\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance.\n\nVance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.\n\n\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.\n\nZelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.\n\nVance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.\n\n\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.\n\nZelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"\n\n\"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"\n\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.\n\nZelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.\n\n\"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\"\n\nMr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"\n\nZelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.\n\n\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\"\n\nMr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.\n\n\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.\n\nAmid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?\n\n\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"\n\nEarlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.\n\n\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.\n\n\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nA White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"\n\nThe meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"\n\n\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"\n\nZelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.\n\nAfter his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\n\nZelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.\n\nAs Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.\n\n\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"\n\nAdministration sources on next steps\n\nHigh-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.\n\nWhen Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.\n\nNo phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.\n\nZelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nRegarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.\n\nThe sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.\n\nWhat to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit\n\nMr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.\n\nPresident Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives at the White House on Feb. 28, 2025. Getty Images\n\nIn a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"\n\nMr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.\n\n\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.\n\n\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"\n\nMr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.\n\n\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.\n\nTop Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.\n\nReferring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"\n\nThe president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.\n\n\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"\n\nBut after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.\n\n\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.\n\n\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion."

Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images\n\nThe United States and Ukraine are trying to hammer out a natural resources agreement that would give Washington access to Kyiv\u2019s untapped mineral riches in exchange for investment and what Ukraine hopes would be concrete security guarantees.\n\nWhile US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a deal has been made and that he was \u201chappy\u201d about it, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been more cautious, saying the agreement could be a \u201cbig success\u201d \u2014 but that it depended on Trump.\n\nHere is what we know \u2014 and don\u2019t know \u2013\u2014about the agreement:\n\nWhat\u2019s in the deal? The draft agreement seeks the establishment of a \u201creconstruction investment fund\u201d that would be jointly managed by the US and Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stressed the deal would exclude existing \u201cdeposits, facilities, licenses and royalties\u201d tied to Ukraine\u2019s natural resources. The draft agreement goes beyond just minerals and rare earths. It spans Ukraine\u2019s other natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as any infrastructure connected to the sectors, such as ports or LNG terminals.\n\nWhat does Trump want from the deal? Trump said over the weekend that he\u2019s \u201ctrying to get the money back,\u201d referring to the aid provided to Ukraine under the previous administration.\n\nWhat does Ukraine want from the deal? Ukraine\u2019s mineral riches have long been eyed by its allies \u2014 and Kyiv has made them part of its appeal for support. Zelensky has made it clear he wants security guarantees to be part of the deal.\n\nWhy is Trump so keen on this deal? Materials such as graphite, lithium, uranium and the 17 chemical elements known as rare earths are critical for economic growth and national security. They are essential to the production of electronics, clean energy technology, including wind turbines, energy networks and electric vehicles, as well as some weapons systems. The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs, many of which come from China, which has long dominated the market. Experts have long warned that relying on China for strategic materials is risky, but the latest trade tensions between Washington and Beijing make it even more important for the US to look for alternative suppliers.\n\nHow large are Ukraine\u2019s resources? Ukraine doesn\u2019t have globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals, but it does have some of the world\u2019s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. But while Ukraine does have large reserves of these minerals, little has been done to develop the sector. It is unlikely that Kyiv would be able to extract these resources without foreign investment.\n\nCNN\u2019s Victoria Butenko, Nick Paton Walsh and Gul Tuysuz, Christian Edwards, Svitlana Vlasova, Dariya Tarasova-Markina, Lauren Kent, Betsy Klein, Michael Williams contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nLast week, Akamai, a cloud computing company with a popular content-delivery network product, reported solid earnings that beat expectations. Soon after, its stock plunged by more than 20 percent and stayed there. What were investors so worried about? They were concerned, it turns out, about Akamai\u2019s relationship with a much better-known company: TikTok. ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, is one of Akamai\u2019s biggest customers. One concern is that TikTok is working to become less reliant on contractors like Akamai. Another is weirder and bigger: TikTok is still sort of illegal, and working with TikTok is still sort of against the law.\n\nTo recap as quickly as possible: During his last term as president, Donald Trump helped lead a campaign to ban TikTok, starting with executive orders and ending during the Biden administration with a bipartisan law. Trump flipped on the issue during the 2024 campaign, but the law still stands. That is a problem for companies like Apple and Google, which host TikTok in their app stores and are directly implicated in the law as written. It\u2019s also a problem for firms like Akamai, which provide infrastructure services that keep TikTok working. Trump issued an executive order asserting, with unclear authority, that the ban was paused, and the Justice Department has been offering TikTok\u2019s partners assurances that they won\u2019t be prosecuted.\n\nThis was enough to convince Akamai \u2014 with Oracle, Apple, Google, and others \u2014 to help restore TikTok, but the app and its partners are now stuck in a sort of legalish limbo. Is the plan for Vice-President J.D. Vance to oversee a sale? To just leave things as is and muddle along? To contrive some other arrangement and simply insist that it meets the law\u2019s requirements? Apple and Google have stayed conspicuously quiet on the situation, successfully avoiding confrontation with the administration. Akamai, however, disclosed its risks \u2014 and to a great extent, theirs \u2014 in an annual report to the SEC. While \u201cthe Attorney General has since determined that our provision of services to this customer has not violated the law and that we can continue providing services,\u201d the company said, \u201c[i]t is difficult to predict whether the passed legislation will ultimately be enforced and whether any future judicial challenges brought against the executive order will be successful.\u201d The company goes on:\n\nEven though President Trump has extended the enforcement deadline for a ban on the Chinese application, there is no assurance that we will not be exposed to liability and we may be exposed to significant fines, litigation, indemnification claims, negative publicity, reputational harm, diversion of management attention, interruptions in our operations, financial loss and other similar harms by continuing to provide services to the Chinese application.\n\nSome of these risks are fairly straightforward. The fines attached to the law are catastrophically severe, and the reason they\u2019re not being levied is, basically, because Donald Trump and Pam Bondi say so. Business leaders frequently complain about regulatory uncertainty, arguing that it makes planning for the future and allocating resources more difficult. The TikTok situation both resembles and exceeds the sorts of things they\u2019re usually referring to. It\u2019s not just TikTok\u2019s legal status that\u2019s up in the air \u2014 it\u2019s the entire relationship between different parts of the government and companies that operate on its watch and under its jurisdiction. Akamai\u2019s \u201cother similar harms,\u201d in other words, involve questions like: Can the president unilaterally decide which laws are enforced? Can the president unilaterally write new laws? What is law, really, anyway?\n\nThis is a strange and miniaturizing lens for what appears to be a much broader potential constitutional crisis and isn\u2019t likely to be the matter that ultimately triggers it (all eyes are on DOGE for that). Most people don\u2019t know or care about Akamai, the TikTok ban was never especially popular, and the prospect of just sort of ignoring a strange and unprecedented law banning a popular app isn\u2019t the sort of thing that\u2019s likely to get too many people riled up. But as a matter of process, the situation is both surreal and potentially instructive. Among the risks implied but not elucidated in the filing is the possibility that as quickly and arbitrarily as the executive branch can choose not to enforce a law, it can choose to enforce it again. It\u2019s easy enough to imagine what a motivated government led by a man who negotiates with threats might do with such leverage over a basic internet infrastructure firm like Akamai \u2014 without it, for example, TikTok couldn\u2019t go back online. But it\u2019s even easier to imagine what use such leverage might be when applied to Apple and Google, two of the largest and most influential tech companies on earth."

            "full_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nA businessman who pumped $75 million into the Trump family-backed crypto token finds himself in a fortunate position this week as federal securities regulators are hitting pause on their civil fraud case against him.\n\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justin Sun, a 34-year-old Chinese crypto entrepreneur, asked a federal judge to put the agency\u2019s case on hold, citing the interests of both sides and \u201cthe public\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nThe pause is a 180 for the SEC, America\u2019s top financial regulator, which two years ago charged Sun and his companies \u2014 Tron, BitTorrent and Rainberry \u2014 with selling unregistered securities and fraudulently manipulating the price of digital token Tronix. Sun and his companies sought to have the case dismissed.\n\nSun is a polarizing figure within the world of crypto, in which he has become one of the most prominent investors in the World Liberty Financial crypto project, backed by the Trump family. Sun\u2019s $75 million purchase of World Liberty tokens, which he\u2019s touted in social media posts, could set the Trump family up to eventually collect tens of millions of dollars, as the family is entitled to 75% of the tokens\u2019 revenues, according to the company. Sun is also an official adviser to World Liberty, which lists President Donald Trump as its \u201cchief crypto advocate\u201d and his son Barron as its \u201cDeFi visionary.\u201d\n\nWorld Liberty is just one of several crypto projects the president and his family have set up in recent months, raising concerns about potential corruption. By its nature, crypto offers a particularly easy way to, anonymously or otherwise, funnel money into assets that directly benefit the president and his family.\n\n\u201cNow anyone in world can essentially deposit money into bank account of President of USA with a couple clicks,\u201d tweeted Anthony Scaramucci, former Trump White House communications director, after Trump launched a digital token known as a memecoin last month. \u201cEvery favor \u2014 geopolitical, corporate or personal \u2014 is now on sale, right out in the open.\u201d\n\nThe SEC declined to comment. Neither the White House nor Sun responded to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThis is, I guess, going to be the new approach \u2014 hands off crypto, not enforcing fraud \u2026 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to end well,\u201d Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and an ethics lawyer for the George W. Bush administration, told me. \u201cThe SEC is going to back off \u2014 because that\u2019s what the Trump administration wants \u2014 on whatever enforcement they are able to do. I think it\u2019s a very worrisome situation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a widely expected move, the SEC on Thursday officially dropped its enforcement action against US crypto exchange Coinbase, citing \u201cthe Commission\u2019s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry.\u201d\n\nCompounding conflicts of interest\n\nThe Sun case comes as the Trump administration appears to be opening the door to potential corruption beyond crypto. Critics across the political spectrum say it\u2019s a troubling trend for a president and a White House that is ditching guardrails at an alarming speed and gutting the government\u2019s ability to combat corruption.\n\nSince returning to office over a month ago, the president has paused all investigations into corporate foreign bribery and fired inspectors general from more than a dozen federal agencies. His Justice Department has moved to suspend its case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, whom prosecutors had accused of soliciting bribes from Turkish nationals (allegations Adams denies). Trump pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who spent eight years in prison on multiple corruption charges, including scheming to sell a vacant Senate seat. And earlier this month, Trump said that Elon Musk\u2019s financial disclosures would be kept confidential even as Musk wields power over federal agencies and contracts that directly impact his own business empire.\n\nThe president has also come full circle on crypto, which he once dismissed as a scam.\n\nThat\u2019s been a mixed blessing for the industry, which has been working to shed its well-earned reputation for illicit activities. On one hand, crypto advocates seeking to establish a legitimate regulatory framework have welcomed Trump\u2019s broadly positive rhetoric on digital assets. But Trump\u2019s memecoin ventures \u2014 along with his pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road criminal enterprise, and the SEC\u2019s heel-turn on its case against Sun \u2014 are the kind of fringe causes that reinforce the industry\u2019s association with bad actors.\n\nWithin crypto, Sun is a polarizing figure. While the Tron community sees him as a visionary, his detractors see him as an opportunist who thrives on hype, said Gareth Rhodes, managing director at advisory firm Pacific Street. \u201cBoth supporters and detractors can agree he wields substantial influence in crypto,\u201d he added.\n\nSun, who garnered headlines last year for his $6.2 million purchase of a banana duct-taped to a wall, is \u201camong the least sympathetic litigants in the industry,\u201d Eric Soufer, a political adviser to major crypto companies, told me Thursday.\n\nThe SEC and Sun\u2019s lawyers, in their letter to the judge, proposed submitting a status report 60 days after a stay, at which point there would likely be more details about the case\u2019s resolution, including any possible settlement.\n\n\u201cObviously his connections to Trump Coin are going to raise questions,\u201d Soufer added. \u201cBut we need to see what the actual settlement looks like before we can judge just how much politics may have played a role.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Elon Musk throwing up a Nazi-style salute on Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day. Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux, New York Magazine\n\nNot since Woodrow Wilson screened The Birth of a Nation at the White House in 1915 has a president been the source of such openly racist propaganda as Donald Trump. Other presidents may have presided over worse racial inequality or used dog whistles to signal their sympathy with racists, but none have been so explicit in their demagogic appeals to white people\u2019s most chauvinistic impulses.\n\nWith the help of Elon Musk, Trump has conducted an all-out assault on the government in order to eradicate the supposedly pernicious influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which has led him to blame the deadly plane crash over the Potomac River in January on the presence of minorities in the aviation industry and to fire General Charles Q. Brown, the second Black person in history to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He has called for the \u201cresettlement\u201d of Afrikaners facing purported anti-white discrimination in South Africa while appointing speechwriter Darren J. Beattie, who tweeted that Black people are \u201cferal\u201d and need to be sterilized, to the State Department. In response to Trump\u2019s threats and directives, the Department of Defense has outlawed Black History Month for servicemembers, and the Maryland National Guard canceled a parade for Frederick Douglass\u2019s birthday. Following the White House\u2019s lead, Missouri is suing Starbucks for hiring too many minorities.\n\nAnd these are just some of the most palpable proofs of the Trump administration\u2019s bigotry. Political discourse is now saturated in racism in a way that would have been shocking not so long ago, with the vice-president of the United States, whose wife and children are of Indian descent, defending a 25-year-old DOGE staffer named Marko Elez who was revealed to have posted racist comments like \u201cNormalize Indian hate,\u201d \u201cYou could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity,\u201d and \u201cI was racist before it was cool.\u201d Musk\u2019s social-media platform, X, is rife with white-supremacist and Nazi content, some of which has been boosted by Musk himself who, in addition to claiming that his native South Africa is committing \u201cgenocide\u201d against whites, has also supported Germany\u2019s far-right AfD. This is a political moment in which blatant racism is tolerated, Nazi salutes are flung from public podiums by presidential surrogates, and the purported low IQs of minority populations is a subject of wide discussion \u2014 not to mention the rank racism that permeates the administration\u2019s posture toward foreign immigrants and the people in Gaza.\n\nPerhaps most striking of all is how muted the public response has been \u2014 no mass protests, half-hearted objections from the opposition party. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a massive shift toward racism as much as an expanded indifference toward it,\u201d the historian Robin D.G. Kelley told me. \u201cPeople are just kind of like, \u2018Well, what can we do?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe assumption of the generations that came after the civil-rights movement has been that the quest for racial equality would move \u2014 however fitfully, however slowly \u2014 in the direction of progress. There have been myriad setbacks, as well as longstanding wrongs that have never been corrected, but these were often accompanied by genuine accomplishments. Indeed one such setback was the election of Donald Trump in 2016, which was partly a backlash to the election of the first Black president \u2014 a setback that seemingly was halted by his ouster in 2020, which was partly propelled by the George Floyd uprising and the change it promised. But now Trump is back, and his brand of MAGA racism is more entrenched than ever before, raising the possibility that racial norms that have been painstakingly shaped and amended over decades are just as susceptible to being dismantled as government bureaucracy and the rule of law.\n\nThe current atmosphere of vitriol and chaos has made it hard to determine exactly how destructive the next four years could be. As usual with Trump, there is a fine line between menace and plain incompetence, the latter of which could turn out to be a saving grace. \u201cWe know they\u2019re not interested in merit,\u201d said Kelley of the sycophants the president has tasked with purging America\u2019s workforce of allegedly unqualified Black and brown hires. \u201cThey got the dumbest people in their cabinet.\u201d At the same time, the risks of complacency could not be higher, say organizers and others who\u2019ve spent the past decade leading the fight against racism even as complacency seems to be the tenor of the hour.\n\n\u201cI think it does matter that this time he won the popular vote,\u201d said the broadcaster Margaret Kimberley, who wrote the book Prejudential: Black America and the Presidents. \u201cI hate the term \u2018mandate,\u2019 but he realizes that with a weak opposition he can do what he wants.\u201d The scale of Trump\u2019s triumph in November has been overstated (he won the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points). But the inroads he made with young and male voters across racial groups are real enough that Democrats have been frightened into submission. \u201cWhat leverage do we have?\u201d complained House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in February when asked about voters calling on Democrats to do more to oppose Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s their government.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t have much support in the streets either. The party was in an equally weak governing position in 2017. But it was motivated by an outraged public and a sense that Trump\u2019s victory was an anomaly. \u201cYou had millions of people who mobilized outside the electoral system,\u201d said Kimberley. Between the Women\u2019s March, the Black Lives Matter movement, and scattered protests like those against the president\u2019s Muslim ban, popular dissent drove the party to electoral victories in 2018, 2020, and beyond.\n\nThat coalition fell apart in 2024 in the face of the threat of Trump\u2019s return. The supporters of criminal-justice reform were marginalized and scapegoated by the party. \u201cRather than see Palestine as a human-rights issue that people get behind, they did everything they could to suppress it,\u201d said Kelley. When Republicans smeared Kamala Harris as a feckless \u201cborder czar,\u201d Democrats retorted that it was in fact Trump, with his claims about \u201cillegal-alien gang members\u201d escaping the \u201cdungeons of the third world\u201d and invading America\u2019s suburbs, who was too soft on immigrants. The result has been a leadership vacuum felt from Capitol Hill to Main Street, and a post-election consensus that \u201cwokeness\u201d is what cost Democrats the election. The sense of political crisis engendered by past protest movements \u2014 and which is still America\u2019s most successful blueprint for fighting ethno-fascism \u2014 has been replaced by craven appeals to conservatism.\n\nActivists and organizers on the ground are struggling to regroup in their own ways. \u201cThere\u2019s been a divide,\u201d said Samuel Sinyangwe, whose data analysis on police violence underpinned much of the past decade\u2019s activism. \u201cI\u2019m sensing from a lot of people \u2014 some of whom had positions in the previous administration and some of whom were informing those people \u2014 an apathy, or almost like, \u2018We told you so.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s also a feeling that they couldn\u2019t get the message out even if they wanted to. Ten years ago, social platforms like Twitter were information-sharing and strategy hubs for Black activists; today, the newly renamed X is a Muskian echo chamber that many of the same activists have abandoned. \u201cFolks underestimated the level of disinformation and misinformation that has been proliferating over the last eight, nine years online and how much it\u2019s seeped into the collective consciousness of our friends, our family,\u201d said the Florida-based organizer Phillip Agnew. \u201cInstead of a stronger movement toward left politics, you\u2019ve got podcasts and streamers saying, \u2018Hey, the problem is that you need to double and triple down on capitalism. Get your crypto up. Get your money up.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe policy consequences of such apathy could be severe. Trump and Musk wish to gut entire knowledge reserves \u2014 literal terabytes of information that tracks how policies disparately impact minorities, for example, which line the hard drives of the agencies they\u2019re plotting to abolish. (\u201cI don\u2019t want to tip off the administration,\u201d Sinyangwe replied when I asked him what he\u2019s most afraid of losing in the DOGE purges.) And beyond that, who knows? Maybe Trump aims \u201cto reinstate second-class citizenship,\u201d as Kelley put it, or \u201cto disappear Black people from public life altogether,\u201d according to Kimberley.\n\nIn the meantime, we are left living in a country in which both official and casual racism are being re-normalized, where young and old will be exposed to more bigotry on social media and on their podcasts, and where it\u2019s more uncertain than ever that schoolchildren will learn the basic lessons of the civil-rights movement \u2014 lessons that have undergirded American civil society since the 1960s. The post-civil-rights period in the U.S. has failed to make good on the movement\u2019s promise in a number of ways, but at the very least, its statements of purpose and legal accomplishments have mapped a legible course toward equality, from the Oval Office down to the workplace. Even if Trump does not fully succeed in reestablishing legal second-class citizenship, he is spearheading a culture shift in which American history\u2019s horrors are widely dismissed or forgotten, and where racial inequality is no longer regarded as a leading cause of our country\u2019s problems but the answer."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nIn early February, John Schwarz, a self-described \u201cmindfulness and meditation facilitator,\u201d proposed a 24-hour nationwide \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d of major chains on the last day of the month.\n\nSchwarz urged people to forgo spending at Amazon, Walmart, and all other major retailers and fast-food companies for a day. He called on them to spend money only at small businesses and on essential needs.\n\n\u201cThe system has been designed to exploit us,\u201d said Schwarz, who goes by \u201cTheOneCalledJai\u201d on social media, in a video to his roughly 250,000 followers on Instagram and TikTok. \u201cOn February 28, we are going to remind them who really holds the power. For one day, we turn it off.\u201d\n\nSchwarz, 57, has no background in social or political organizing. Until early this year, he almost exclusively posted videos of himself offering inspirational messages and motivational tips sitting in his home, backyard and shopping mall parking lots.\n\nHe had low expectations for his boycott message gaining traction. \u201cI thought maybe a handful of my followers would do it,\u201d he told CNN in a phone interview this week.\n\nInstead, Schwarz\u2019s call rapidly spread online. His video has been shared more than 700,000 times on Instagram and viewed 8.5 million times. Celebrities such as Stephen King, Bette Midler and Mark Ruffalo have encouraged people to participate. Reporters wrote and aired TV pieces about the boycott, propelling it further.\n\nThe \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d effort is relatively uncoordinated and nebulous. Experts on consumer boycotts and corporate strategy are dubious that it will make a dent in the bottom lines of the massive companies it targets, let alone the vast US economy. Effective boycotts are typically well organized, make clear and specific demands and are focused on one company or issue.\n\nBut this boycott has gained strength online because it has captured visceral public anger with the American economy, corporations and politics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the sense that a lot of people want to do something. Doing something in the American context has often meant using pocketbook politics,\u201d said Lawrence Glickman, a historian at Cornell University and author of \u201cBuying Power: A History of Consumer Activism in America.\u201d \u201cThis a way of engaging in a form of collective action outside of the electoral arena that makes people feel some connection and sense of potential power.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon fulfillment center. The boycott Friday targets Amazon, Walmart and large chains. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nPeople online say they want to join the boycott for many different reasons. Some are commenting about high prices and the cost of living. Others are angry about the power of large corporations and billionaires such as Elon Musk. Some are pushing back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to gut federal programs and fears about an autocracy in America. Yet others want to boycott companies rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.\n\nSchwarz scrambled as a result of the response to create a group. He called it The People\u2019s Union and describes it on its new website (that is frequently down) as a \u201cmovement created by the people, for the people to \u201c(take) action against corporate control, political corruption, and the economic system.\u201d He has raised around $70,000 in donations on a GoFundMe page that solicits funds for social campaigns, legal advocacy and other efforts. He has also called for more targeted boycotts in the coming weeks against specific companies, including Amazon and Walmart. (Walmart declined to comment to CNN. Amazon did not respond to comment.)\n\nAlthough the response online appears to be strongest from the political left, Schwarz has no ideology that could be considered consistently progressive or conservative, at least along the traditional US political spectrum. He does not belong to either political party, but he supports Bernie Sanders. In recent posts, has advocated for the end of federal income tax, term limits in Congress, universal health care and price caps.\n\nThe boycott has \u201cspread so well because people have just had enough and they\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re tired,\u201d Schwarz said.\n\nBacklash against Target\n\nSchwarz\u2019s boycott call has coincided with a more organized effort to punish retailers that have retreated on DEI, particularly Target.\n\nDozens of Fortune 500 companies have backtracked on their diversity programs in response to pressure from activists and right-wing legal groups, and, more recently, the Trump administration\u2019s threats to investigate what it characterizes as \u201cillegal DEI,\u201d including potential criminal cases against companies.\n\nMuch of the anger has been directed toward Target. Target is under more heat than companies like Walmart, John Deere or Tractor Supply because it went further in its DEI efforts, and it has a more progressive base of customers.\n\nTarget was a leading advocate for DEI programs in the business world in the years after George Floyd was murdered by police in the company\u2019s home city of Minneapolis in 2020. Target also spent years building a public reputation as a progressive employer on LGBTQ issues.\n\nBut days into the Trump presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it remained committed to \u201ccreating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities\u201d and also stressed the need for \u201cstaying in step with the evolving external landscape.\u201d\n\nA protest outside of Target's headquarters in Minneapolis last month. Target has faced backlash for changes to its DEI policies. Ellen Schmidt/AP\n\nTarget\u2019s retreat sparked anger from customers and boycott calls, particularly Black consumers.\n\nRev. Jamal Bryant of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, has called for 100,000 people to begin a 40-day boycott of Target on March 5 to coincide with the start of Lent. Participants are encouraged to purchase products from Black-owned businesses during this period.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations,\u201d the petition says. \u201cThe greatest insult comes from Target.\u201d\n\nTarget did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThere are signs that the blowback from Target\u2019s move may be impacting the company.\n\nCustomer visits to Target, Walmart and Costco have slowed over the last four weeks, but they have dropped the most at Target, according to Placer.ai., which uses phone location data to track visits. The slowdown could also be attributed to weather, economic conditions and other variables, Placer.ai cautioned.\n\nDuring the week of February 10, the latest week available, foot traffic to Target dropped 7.9% and 4.8% to Walmart. Foot traffic to Costco, which has stood by its DEI policies, increased 4.8%.\n\nThe data \u201cshows a clear drop in traffic in late January into mid-February following the company\u2019s step back from DEI,\u201d Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a note to clients this week.\n\nBoycotts hard to sustain\n\nDespite the recent slowdown at Target, boycotts tend to be short-lived and rarely do financial damage to companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to sustain anything longer than a few weeks,\u201d said Young Hou, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business who has studied consumer boycotts. Consumers are typically fickle and don\u2019t want to disrupt their routines for extended stretches, he said. Boycotts can also spark a counterreaction, leading supporters of a company to mobilize and increase their spending, negating the impact.\n\nA boycott campaign against Target may be hard to sustain because other chains that consumers might switch to like Walmart or Amazon have also rolled back DEI programs.\n\nThe most successful example of a boycott in recent years has come on the right.\n\nIn 2023, Bud Light\u2019s parent company A-B InBev lost as much as $1.4 billion in sales because of right-wing backlash to Bud Light\u2019s brief partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n\nBoycotts and protests can force companies to make changes. In 1997, Stanford University students and faculty protested Nike CEO Phil Knight's visit to campus over Nike's labor practices. John Todd/AP\n\nEntertainer Kid Rock posted a video of himself shooting a stack of Bud Light cases. Other popular right-wing activists like Ben Shapiro and Candace Ownens and Republican politicans, including now-Vice President JD Vance and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, publicly supported the boycott. The brand also angered left-leaning customers because of its conciliatory response to right-wing attacks.\n\nOne of the key reasons the Bud Light boycott was successful was because it was very easy for customers to replace Bud Light with Coors Light or Miller Lite or another beer without much sacrifice.\n\nStill, consumer boycotts and protests can raise public awareness about an issue, pressure companies to make changes or hurt their public reputations.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, for example, protests on college campuses over Nike\u2019s use of sweatshop labor forced the company to raise the minimum age for hiring new workers at shoe factories to 18 and allow human rights groups to inspect factory conditions in Asia. After the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in 2018, consumers and activists successfully pressured Delta, Avis, MetLife and other companies to sever ties with the National Rifle Association and end discounts to NRA members.\n\n\u201cThe more specific the reason to boycott, usually the more effective those boycotts have a chance of being,\u201d said Cornell University\u2019s Glickman. \u201cBoycotts rarely cripple incredibly powerful companies, but they can put them on the defensive.\u201d"

Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.\n\nSupporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.\n\n\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.\n\nThe Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nIowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.\n\nSexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.\n\nIowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \u201cI transitioned to save my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d\n\nAbout half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination, but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.\n\nIowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nSeveral Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court."
