And President Trump prods Ukraine and Russia toward peace.\n\nOvernight, the U.S. pounded Iranian-backed Houthi targets in Yemen again. And the backlash grows over the Trump administration's deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. We will talk to White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, the head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut's Jim Himes.\n\nMeanwhile, members of Congress may have been happy to head home for recess last week, but now they may be eager to get back to Washington.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMAN: Do you share a concern that we're careening toward an authoritarian country?\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As elected officials on both sides of the aisle got an earful from angry constituents.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMAN #1: The message that was sent by Democrats in Congress with the C.R. catastrophe was clear. It's not that you're in the minority. It's that you aren't even working together on a shared strategy. And that is failure!\n\nMAN #2: Why do you believe that President Trump is above the law? Why have you not spoken out for it?\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, measles infections have now been reported in 18 states. We will consult with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb about that and talk about the impact of Trump's cuts on medical research.\n\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nThere is a lot to cover on the home front, but we begin first on national security. In just a few hours, U.S. officials will be holding talks with Ukraine and tomorrow a separate round with Russia in pursuit of a 30-day cease-fire.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is ramping up the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, sending a second aircraft carrier to the region.\n\nWe begin this morning with White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nGood to have you here.\n\nMIKE WALTZ (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, the Iran-backed Houthis, they continue to fire at Israel. What has the last week of bombing achieved? And if you're holding Iran responsible, what's next?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, we have taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer. We have hit their headquarters. We have hit communications nodes, weapons factories, and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities just in the last couple of days.\n\nPresident Trump has decided to hit the Houthis and hit them hard, as opposed to, in the last administration, where literally weeks or months would go by with these kind of one-off pinprick attacks. And, as a result, we have had one of the world's most critical sea lanes get shut down.\n\nI mean, these guys are like al Qaeda or ISIS with advanced cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and some of the most sophisticated air defenses, all provided by Iran, Margaret. Just to \u2013 so everybody understands the impact here\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 the last time one of our destroyers went through the straits there, it was attacked 23 times; 75 percent of our U.S.-flagged shipping now has to go around the southern coast of Africa, rather than going through the Suez Canal.\n\nAnd keeping the sea lanes open, keeping trade and commerce open\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 is a fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration was not effective.\n\nThe Trump administration and President Trump have decided to do something much harder, much tougher, and much \u2013 and what \u2013 we will see, but I think will be much more effective.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said he's going to hold Iran responsible as well. Envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview that Iran had responded to this U.S. outreach via multiple channels in regard to a letter sent by the president.\n\nWitkoff described it as an offer to Iran to create a verification program so nobody worries about weaponization of nuclear material. Can you clarify, is the U.S. seeking the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program or verification, like what President Obama put in place back in 2015 and President Trump pulled out of?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Full dismantlement.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see.\n\nAnd this is \u2013 look, as President\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have they said they're interested?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: As President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table.\n\nAnd it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear weapon. That \u2013 and they will not and cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapons program.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have they responded to the president's call for these talks?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: That's enrichment, that is weaponization, and that is its strategic missile program.\n\nCan you only imagine?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We have seen the death and destruction that they're doing through its proxies, between Hezbollah, the Assad regime, the Houthis and what have you. If they had nuclear weapons, the entire Middle East would explode in an arms race.\n\nThat is completely unacceptable to our national security. I won't get into what the back-and-forth has been, but Iran is in the worst place it has been from its own national security since 1979, thanks to Hezbollah, Hamas, the Assad regime and its own air defenses being taken out by the Israelis.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So there's still a chance for diplomacy? I know you won't get into\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, of course.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: The president has all options on the table, but we want to be clear.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This isn't some kind of \u2013 kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration or Biden.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This is the full program. Give it up or there will be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, closer to home, what has been happening here with Tren de Aragua, TDA, we're going to call them, which have been designated by the Trump administration as terrorists.\n\nLast Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador; 137 of them were deported using this rarely used 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first if they come from countries at war with the U.S.\n\nIn the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people, one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum-security prison, the other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all.\n\nHow does that kind of high-consequence mistake happen?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs, we will deal with on an individual basis.\n\nBut, Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge there?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I \u2013 I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases.\n\nBut what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one.\n\nAnd, number two, the Alien Sedition Act fully applies because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have \u2013 I'm sorry, just to clarify on that, this is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We are saying \u2013 we are saying \u2013 we are saying that TDA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien Sedition Act applies. And we cannot have district judges interfering with the commander in chief's actions to take care of in the way he deems necessary a terrorist organization.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And I got to tell you, we can \u2013 we can debate on Article II, Article III. That's a fair debate.\n\nHowever, in this case, the commander in chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fashion.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 in a proxy manner to influence and attack the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's different \u2013 that's so different\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But that's how\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela.\n\nI know the attorney general said on another network\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Sure. That's fine. But\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: No, but, Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to \u2013 by, with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We have taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard.\n\nAnd we're making a Washington, D.C., distinction\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 when the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs. But there is concern\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats on the other side.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: It sounds like in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around full of gang members that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's \u2013 man's prison, and El Salvador said no.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I mean, OK.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you're suspending the ability to have a day in court\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, I can't speak to the those individual details, if you want to\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you get the list right, right\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you can verify that these people are gang members.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 look, every one of them were here illegally.\n\nSo, first of all, we had every right and every \u2013 and should deport every one of these individuals. If you want to make a special case for one, that's fine.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported. They were sent to the prison.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But underlying that \u2013 underlying that is the Alien Act that has determined the commander in chief has the absolute authority to do this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure.\n\nI need to get to Ukraine with you because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease-fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said only holding back on energy infrastructure.\n\nWhat's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes, well, first, we're moving closer and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back.\n\nWe then \u2013 Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility conducting proximity talks.\n\nAnd the progression will be, we have this cease-fire on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease-fire, so that both sides can move grain, fuel and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea.\n\nAnd then we will talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines. And that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are, and then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace and a lasting peace, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about or have talked about as security guarantees.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program\u2026\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 by Russia to Russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia.\n\nWhy did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University program. And they said \u2013 the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who want to know why. Do you know why?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with the goal.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But I can say that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call.\n\nAnd he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly first and foremost in kind of confidence-building measures.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But, again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back.\n\nJust a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We were in an endless stalemate here. And now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence-building measure? Is that what you meant?\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence-building measures. That's one of them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you, Mike Waltz.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thank you. All right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee. And he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky.\n\nGood morning to you, Senator.\n\nBecause\u2026\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.\n\nBecause of your role in on Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court, but there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all.\n\nDo these concern \u2013 does any of this concern you, along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there are some big legal questions here.\n\nOn the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy and you can be deported.\n\nSo, really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court's going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years or are they going to defer to Congress?\n\nIf you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said, we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question? And I think they should have ruled based on\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and then the president issued an executive order that defied the congressional \u2013 what Congress did.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Right. Right.\n\nBut my point is, is, I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision and you had to guess what the Supreme County is going to do, my guess is, they will uphold the Alien Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it.\n\nSo it's at least debatable on both sides who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 oh, it's constitutional chaos, there's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority on the one hand that's been around for over 200 years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nBut just \u2013 we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now and what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done essentially in the cover of night. This seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side.\n\nBut we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except when the president wants to deport people. So, these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision-making.\n\nOn the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question. And I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings.\n\nSo I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions. And the only way they begin is by a challenge.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So, on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It just sounds \u2013 I mean, these are debates for law professors, certainly. But, in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nAre you comfortable, as the man with oversight as chair of the committee, with what's being done?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you're comfortable with it?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think you're going to be able to deport people \u2013 so, no, I \u2013 well, I don't think \u2013 you're answering for me.\n\nI think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And, while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court, and there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.\n\nI want to ask you about some congressional business. I have seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed.\n\nDo you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back, and we approve the cuts through rescission?\n\nAnd this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people \u2013 can Secretary Rubio pause the spending?\n\nOn that issue, I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment. And I think the courts so far have said it has to come back\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 unless, as the Trump administration argues, that the Impoundment Act is unconstitutional.\n\nSo this one's headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk.\n\nHe seemed enthusiastic it can be done. No Democrats \u2013 you have to realize\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 no Democrat will cut one penny from any spending anywhere.\n\nBut can we get all the Republicans is the real question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think the president is going to have \u2013 the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not a given that Republicans will stand \u2013 will vote for this.\n\nWe tried it once in the first administration.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, I remember.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: It was only $15 billion. And we lost. We lost two Republicans.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two Republicans.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: But my suggestion to the Trump \u2013 my suggestion to the Trump administration is, come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them in advance.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Don't put it in their lap. Bring them $500 billion. And if they say, this $10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're going to have to pre-negotiate the rescissions package.\n\nBut I think you could get there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education.\n\nStates, as everyone, I think, knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title I programs, which are low-income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate.\n\nHow are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two-thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two-thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: So, it's been an utter failure. What I'd like to \u2013 let me finish.\n\nI'd leave it back to the states. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or, better yet, never take it from the states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states.\n\nI think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing, they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching to national testing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But when we looked at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives $2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide $2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I'd rather \u2013 well, no, I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math.\n\nThe amount of dollars \u2013 look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success. And I have talked a lot about this. I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers and we pay them more.\n\nI would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers, teach the entire country, if not the entire world.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who would run that, the Education Department?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: And some of them \u2013 no, what you would find is, they'd be selected out state by state, across the nation.\n\nLook, people say, oh, without the Department of Education, we would have no testing. I was in school before then. We did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: You don't need the Department of Education for any of that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: But what I can tell you is, the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: But they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time because it would be presented through the Internet, with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nWell, I'm sure we will be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with the top Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Greenwich.\n\nGood morning to you.\n\nI want to jump right into it on the conversation about this Venezuelan gang. You have said some of your fellow Democrats have been too quick to use the term constitutional crisis. But because of the use of the Alien Enemies Act and this gang, you have started to become concerned that's where we are. Can you explain that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, that's right, Margaret, and thanks for having me.\n\nYou know, constitutional crisis is a - a sort of broadly used term. Lots of people have different definitions for it. It's a lot of stuff you don't like.\n\nI'll tell you what I know is a constitutional crisis. If the president of the United States decides to ignore the orders of a court - we have not seen that since Andrew Jackson did that in 1834. When that happens, you have a supine on its back Congress of the United States, completely beholden to the president, not acting as a check. And if the president says, I don't care what the court - courts say, which, by the way, he has not said, but which Tom Homan, his czar for deportation has said, now you have a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nSo, I think these next couple of days, as we see how this administration goes after the many judges and the many courts - many of these judges appointed by Republican presidents who are stopping the wild and illegal actions of this administration, we're going to see whether we are in a true, you know, Jacksonian constitutional crisis.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because of your role on the Intelligence Committee, I know you have some visibility into the assessments of U.S. intelligence. \"The New York Times\" reported that the intelligence community said, with moderate confidence, that the gang, TDA, that we've been talking about, is not directed by the Venezuelan government. However, the national security advisor just told us on this program, TDA is acting as a proxy of the Venezuelan government. Why does that distinction matter?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, well, it doesn't matter. And I'll come back around to that.\n\nBut look, what - what - what people worry about is that this administration acts with an unbelievable kind of cocktail of incompetence and illegality. When you fire all of the people at the Department of Energy who look after our nuclear weapons and then say, oops, we need to hire you back, that's incompetence.\n\nI listened to Mike. Mike is a friend of mine. I have respect for Mike. But what he did was dodge your question. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read the first paragraph of the Aliens Enemy Act, which says very clearly that the authority that this administration claims is dependent on a declaration of war.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Not on acting as a proxy. So, Mike distorted the law. And, you know, I read \"The New York Times\" article, too. I haven't seen specific intelligence about whether there's any connection whatsoever between Venezuela and the TDA gang.\n\nBut you're right, \"The New York Times\" - and, by the way, I'll get an answer on this tomorrow and I'm going to have some questions for Mike. \"The New York Times,\" of course, reported that there's - that the intelligence community believes that there's not a meaningful connection between Venezuela and the TDA gang. So, again, it's a bizarre combination of acting incompetently because maybe there's a Venezuelan hairdresser, a gay Venezuelan hairdresser with no connection to TDA. And if he's in this country illegally, fine, deport him. But to do it in this way under authorities that are not legal is not the way to do this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nYou're - you're referring there to some reporting in \"Time\" magazine about what happened to some of these - one particular detainee. On Friday, the Justice Department announced a criminal investigation into what they described as the leak of classified intelligence about this group, TDA. The deputy attorney general said they won't \"tolerate politically motivated efforts by the deep state to undercut President Trump's agenda by leaking false information\" to \"The New York Times.\"\n\nDo you have any concern - or is there concern within the intelligence community about these leaks?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's always concerns about leaks, Margaret. As ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, I don't care who a leak benefits. Whether it benefits Joe Biden or Donald Trump or whatever, they are not OK. They are violations of the law.\n\nIt's very interesting though that characterization that you just read, that we will not tolerate leaks that are inconsistent with President Trump's agenda. And this gets at one of my worst fears with respect to the national security operates under Donald Trump. Everything is about Donald Trump, right? And where I work, inside and overseeing the intelligence community, it is absolutely essential that the intelligence community be about one thing and one thing only, which is giving Donald Trump and other national leaders unvarnished, unbiased advise. And if this is all about serving the president's agenda, that is a notion that is completely at odds with what the intelligence community and what we spend $90 billion on making sure that policymakers, the president chief amongst them, has good information.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I was listening to a town hall that you did this past Thursday in Connecticut, and you were asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is. You threw out some of the sort of known entities, governors out there, but you said, \"while the party's not leaderless, Hakeem Jeffries is young and untested and Leader Schumer is not a wartime president.\"\n\nDo you think that your party can afford to stay the course with the existing leadership they have?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, I think we can do a lot better job with the leadership that we had. What I was acknowledging in the town hall meeting - and I will tell you, I've seen a lot of town hall meetings. I saw Chuck Grassley's town hall meeting. I saw my colleagues from Wyoming - ruby red Wyoming's time in the barrel.\n\nAnd people are outraged. They're outraged mainly, by the way, because they're coming to understand what Medicaid cuts are going to look like for them, what it means to obliterate programs that so much of the country - 70 million people in the case of Medicaid - rely on. So, there's an immense amount of anger.\n\nWhat I do know is that it was not a good look for the two congressional Democratic leaders to be on opposite sides of the continuing resolution. That created a great deal of adjita (ph) out there, and legitimately so. So, I am quite certain that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer have learned from this experience and are going to, at a minimum, be unified going forward here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will see.\n\nCongressman Jim Himes, we'll be watching you and that worldwide threat briefing that will be happening this coming week.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to America's health care system and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's also a board member at Pfizer.\n\nWelcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, measles is now in 18 states, as I understand it. Mostly Texas and New Mexico. But we have seen a growing number of infections, particularly in children.\n\nWhat do parents need to know and are adults protected?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Adults who have been vaccinated should be protected. This vaccine provides durable immunity. And there's no recommendation that anyone who's already been vaccinated, had the full schedule of two doses of vaccine when they were children, would need to get another booster. But if people are concerned, they can check their titers (ph). The only recommendation that CDC makes is people who are taking care of those with measles, perhaps health care workers, might consider an additional booster later in life.\n\nThe bigger challenge is with children. So, children get vaccinated, as you know, at one year, and then again when they're entering school at around age four. There's a window where children probably don't have a lot of immunity. So, a child born, has some immunity passed from their mom up until about six months. But there's a window between six and 12 months where they are largely unprotected. Typically, we don't vaccinate at six months because babies don't have developed immune systems where they can develop a durable immunity from an immunization like this. But there's some recommendations now that children, between the ages of six and 12 months, might get a first dose of vaccine. They would still require a second dose at age one and a third dose at age four.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the former CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, was talking about that this past week.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The current secretary of HHS, Secretary Kennedy, has said he wants anyone who desires the vaccine MMR to be able to get one. But he also describes himself as a, quote, \"freedom of choice person.\" I want to get your analysis of what seemed to be a suggested alternative treatment.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (HHS Secretary): They are getting very, very good results they report from Budesonide (ph), which is a steroid. It's a 30- year-old steroid. And they're - and erythromycin (ph) and also cod liver oil, which has high - high concentrations of vitamin a and vitamin d. And they are seeing what they describe as almost miraculous, instantaneous recovery from that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are those viable alternatives?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: They're not viable alternatives to vaccination. And I'd much prefer if he made a full-throated recommendation to parents to get kids vaccinated, especially in a setting of the regions where there's virus now spreading. He's talking about steroids and antibiotics. Those will use in the setting of a child who has developed pneumonitis, who's hospitalized, has respiratory distress. And so you might dose them with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. And steroids can reduce some of the inflammation in the lungs. The hope is children don't get into that kind of distressed situation because they've been vaccinated.\n\nAs far as vitamin a is concerned, there's really scant evidence that it's effective in this setting. It's used in the setting of malnourished children where it might provide some benefit. But I think talking about those kinds of therapeutics in this context creates a false impression that there's treatments available for measles when, in fact, there's not. The only way to prevent measles and prevent the sequelic (ph) from measles is to get vaccinated.\n\nYou know, it's the same way people may consider whether or not they choose to get vaccinated for influenza, for the flu. Some people might make a decision not to get vaccinated because they know therapeutics are available. I certainly would recommend that - that they do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think everyone should get vaccinated for influenza. But some people might make that choice. There is no choice in this setting. There's nothing effective at mitigating the effects of measles once you get it. So, the only way to do that is to get vaccinated.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the CDC website describes vitamin a as supportive care, but vaccination the best defense. So, thank you for explaining that.\n\nThere's no CDC director right now. The administration had to pull their nominee, as you know, because they couldn't get enough votes. Alex Tin (ph) here at CBS is reporting Florida's surgeon general and a former Texas congressman, Michael Burgess, are both being floated for the job. How important is it to get someone confirmed and in the role quickly?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I think it's very important, especially when you see what's going on around the country with this measles outbreak in west Texas. We may have more measles cases this year than we've had in 25 years. And so having leadership at the CDC that can direct that response is exceedingly important.\n\nMike Burgess ran the health subcommittee on energy and commerce, worked closely with the FDA when I was there. He was very good, very effective. He did a lot - a lot to advance our interdiction work in mail facilities to stop opioids from flowing through those facilities. He was very dedicated to that effort. Actually visited the mail facility in New York at JFK Airport to see firsthand the operation before he led a charge in Congress to help provide more funding to get more inspectors into the facilities. He has a lot of experience in a lot of the areas where CDC has a very relevant mission.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And they'll have to face a potential vote once the president makes a selection here.\n\nI want to ask about some of the byproducts and some of them deliberate cuts from the president's so-called belt-tightening here. There have been impacts at, for example, Johns Hopkins, an institute that does medical research and receives USAID grants. There are also deliberate cuts that have been vowed at Columbia and UPenn, two universities that get federal funding and do health research. Do you have any insight into how many health programs or the significance of the health programs that will be affected?\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think anyone has insight into it yet. I think this is still playing out. These impacts are happening across a couple of different domains. There is restrictions on the ability to go forward with new grants because of limitations, for example, posting things in the federal register. There's new grant making policies that are being implemented. So, certain entities, certain countries are being added to lists where you can't do research. There were recently some grants canceled that coincided with research that would be done in conjunction with China. They're terminating certain grants on the basis of policy considerations, like whether or not they have a certain DEI component and however they are defining that.\n\nAnd then you see the institutional wide cuts. I think that's what happened to Johns Hopkins with respect to the USAID cuts. It's also what happened to Columbia with respect to that $400 million cut - federal cut that impacted a lot of research. There's - so there's multiple domains where they're being impacted right now. This is - this isn't all DOGE led.\n\nI think we need to be very careful when it comes to research programs where patients are involved.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, if you make a mistake with a program like a website that you took down, you can always put it back up. But when you cut a grant to a program where patients are involved, where continuity of care is really important to those patients, you need to make accommodation for that, or not make those cuts in the first place.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSCOTT GOTTLIEB: I do know - I've had some conversations - I think DOGE is aware of that and trying to be mindful of those impacts.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No, it's a - it's an important point to be strategic when it comes to medical care.\n\nDr. Gottlieb, thank you for your insight.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to the Venezuelan deportation case. And for what's next, we're joined by our Justice Department correspondent, Scott Macfarlane and our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez.\n\nIt's good to have you both here.\n\nCamilo, you did some extraordinary reporting this week and obtained the names of the migrants who were sent to El Salvador. That's information that the administration refused to share with a federal judge, but you got it.\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We're still investigating every single case on this list of 238 Venezuelan men who were sent to El Salvador to be imprisoned there, but this is what we know. We know that according to court filings and also our own findings here at CBS News, some of the people on this list do have criminal histories in the U.S. or abroad in countries like Peru, Chile and Columbia. But we also know that, according to the government, many of these people do not have any criminal record in the U.S. And we have received documents from lawyers and attorneys and also the family members of the deportees who say that these people, some of them, do not have any criminal history in the U.S. But the administration is accusing all of them of being part of this transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua.\n\nBut how that accusation is being made is at the center of this story. The administration says they have U.S. intelligence and other techniques to identify these people as suspected TDA members, but their relatives and their lawyers say that some of these men were identified as TDA simply because of tattoos.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that is really where we get to the legal nub of the argument is, can you, as - as Senator Paul was saying, bypass the right to a day in court on the basis of someone having some tattoos?\n\nSo, Scott, the Trump administration is going to have this appeal tomorrow, as I understand it. You were in federal court Friday when the judge said it was, quote, awfully frightening how the administration stretched the law. They are looking for this fight. Why?\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: There's two different fights they're looking for. The legal is one of them. They are going to be in the appeals court tomorrow. They'll go to the Supreme Court potentially eventually, trying to consolidate power to make it an 18th century reality right now where you can expel people who are locked up currently on U.S. soil without having to go through the courts, even though the courts are trying to catch mistakes and make sure nobody's scooped upper erroneously.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even though you could deport them anyhow?\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: You can still deport them anyhow. That's one fight they're looking to fight.\n\nThere's also the political one, Margaret. There is so much political upside\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: To all of this for the Trump administration. And you heard that from the national security advisor a few moments ago when he told you this is a D.C. distinction. That the administration is not exactly concerned about looking too aggressive in deporting suspected gang members. There's all kinds of wins there.\n\nAnd then there's the other one, Margaret. The villainization of Washington, D.C., federal judges, which can galvanize the conservative base and the Trump base. And you saw that Friday in the courtroom with the judge, James Boesberg, pushing back on the president's allegations that he just wants to set these gang members free. The judge said, they are still locked up. You can deport them the normal way without invoking this 18th century law. Let's see how much more pushback there is from the president to the judge. There was more overnight on Truth Social.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They're - yes, he's spoken about it. He's posted about this judge, raising other concerns.\n\nCamilo, though, you actually have reported out what was done behind the scenes to bring this all to a head, to set up this fight. What did you learn?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What I can tell you is that based on conversations with DHS sources, the administration was actively preparing for this operation well before the president actually signed this proclamation, unbeknownst to the public last Friday before the White House actually published the actual proclamation on Saturday, March 15th and before those planes took off -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning do it as quickly as possible?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. They staged a roundup across the country of suspected TDA members and transferred those people to a Texas detention center. And by the time the judge held the first emergency hearing on this case, there were already two planes in the air and another one ready to take off.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Knowing that they might have to face a fight back in the courts.\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, the president has issued at least three executive orders that we have clocked impacting private law firms who represented clients at odds with President - or then Mr. Trump. That's bad for private business. One of those law firms cut a deal, $40 million. What's the impact here?\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: I talked to one of the lawyers who's been targeted by one of these actions. He says, they're trying to take me off the playing field. They're trying to take others off the playing field as we continue to challenge the administration in course. A chilling affect to make it harder to file these lawsuits that have been the firewall so far on the Trump administration.\n\nBut there's a distinction in the latest round of actions prohibiting these law firms based in Washington from doing business in government buildings or with government employees. That is a death sentence for a Washington, D.C. law firm. And, in fact, one of those firms, Perkins Coie, the ones challenging this in court, said as much to the judge, this would kill us. And the judge here in Washington has, for now, held off on the Trump executive action to strip Perkins Coie. But we'll see how long that protection lasts.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And this has knock=on affects for others seeking legal services but also, as you said, makes them hard to just function.\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: Especially the stripping of security clearances, Margaret. That makes it harder for a whistleblower at the FBI, or the CIA, or the Pentagon to find a lawyer to blow the whistle. It makes it possible such whistles will not be blown.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they need to seek counsel who have ability to deal with classified information.\n\nSCOTT MACFARLANE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Camilo, the administration announced Friday they're revoking legal status of half a million migrants who came here legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela during President Biden's term. This is another fight they wanted to have. But if the intention - the stated intention is to go after the worst of the worst and deport them, why focus on people who bothered to be here legally?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the administration would argue that the Biden administration abused its immigration executive authority to create this program without Congress and that the people who came here under this policy are undercutting American workers and that they are essentially illegal immigrants as well. And now they are turning them into illegal immigrants by stripping them of their legal status, their work permits, their deportations protection. Right now they have, for the next 30 days, a chance to self-deport through a smartphone app. If they don't do that, DHS is warning that they will be found, arrested and deported from the country.\n\nAnd this crackdown on immigration by the administration is also extending to other parts of the immigration system. We also know that the administration is suspending funding \u2013 federal funding for legal services providers and lawyers to help - who help migrant children, who have left federal custody, or who are still in federal custody and who are facing deportation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And this is all intentional, the taking funding away, even from migrant kids?\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes, this administration does not believe that federal funds should be used for people who are in the country illegally or without legal permission.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, you're going to be busy. Thank you for breaking it all down for us. I appreciate it.\n\nMACFARLANE: Thank you.\n\nCAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)"

He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation. We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st. Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile. He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day. We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss.

It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years -- so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller. We grieve with Brett, Jessica, Hunter, and their community of family and friends in mourning the loss of Miller, who had a spark in his eyes, an outgoing and feisty personality, and a warm and loving nature.

            "full_content": "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 23, 2025.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, and he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, because of your role in Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court. But there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all. Do these concern- does any of this concern you? Along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?\n\nSEN. PAUL: There are some big legal questions here. On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien and Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy, and you can be deported. So really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court is going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years, or are they going to defer to Congress? If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question Congress--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Right and then the president issued executive order that defied the- what Congress did--\n\nSEN. PAUL: Right, right. But my- my point is- is I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision, and you had to guess what the Supreme Court is going to do, my guess is they'll uphold the Alien and Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it. So it's at least debatable on both sides, who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say, oh, it's constitutional chaos. There's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority. On the one hand, it's been around for over 200 years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, but just- we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now. And what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done, you know, essentially in the cover of night, this seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court. Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?\n\nSEN. PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side, but we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except for when the president wants to deport people. So these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision making. On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question, and I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings. So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions, and the only way they begin is by a challenge.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah\n\nSEN. PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It just sound- I mean- these are debates for law professors, certainly, but in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction. Are you comfortable as the man with oversight, as chair of the committee, with what's being done?\n\nSEN. PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process. I don't think you are going to be able to deport people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you are comfortable with it?\n\nSEN. PAUL: So no, I- well, I think you're answering for me. I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien and Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court. And there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. I want to ask you about some congressional business. I've seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed. Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?\n\nSEN. PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back and we approve the cuts through rescission, and this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people, can Secretary Rubio pause the spending. On that issue I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment, and I think the court so far has said it has to come back, and less as the Trump administration argues that the empowerment Act is unconstitutional. So this was headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is, send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk. He seemed enthusiastic. It can be done. No Democrats- you have to realize, no Democrats will cut one penny from any spending anywhere. But can we get all the Republicans, is the real question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?\n\nSEN. PAUL: Well, I think the president's gonna- the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it. It's not a given that Republicans will stand, will will vote for this. We tried it once in the first administration it was only--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Right, I remember--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --15 billion, and we we lost. We lost two Republicans. But my suggestion to the Trump-, my suggestion to the Trump administration is come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them, in advance, don't put it in their lap. Bring them 500 billion. If they say this, 10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're gonna have to pre negotiate the rescissions package. But I think you could get there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education. States, as everyone I think knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title One programs, which are low income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate. How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?\n\nSEN. PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency? So it's an utter failure\u2013\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?\n\nSEN. PAUL: What I'd like to- let me finish, I'd leave it back to the States. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or better yet never take it from the States. About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states. I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching-\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Right--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --teaching to national testing. The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But when we look at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives 2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide 2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.\n\nSEN. PAUL: I'd rather well, no, what I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math. The amount of dollars, look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially, and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success, and I've talked a lot about this, I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers, and we pay them more. I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers teach the entire country if not the entire world--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Who would run that? The education department?--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --And some of them- no what you'd find is they'd be selected out state by state across the nation. Look, people say, oh, without the department education, we'd have no testing. I was- I was in school before then, we did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --You don't need the Department of Education for any of that. But what I can tell you is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids. What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more, but they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time, because it would be presented to the internet with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm sure we'll be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back."

The IRS has encouraged undocumented migrants to file taxes, a process that includes providing the agency with their addresses, employers and earnings.\n\nCNN reported earlier this year that DHS had circulated a draft memo to the IRS that represented a sweeping request for information about suspected undocumented immigrants, including the home addresses of several hundred thousand individuals who paid federal taxes based on their individual taxpayer identification numbers, according to a source with direct knowledge of the document.\n\nPrivacy experts say that would be a violation of the strict disclosure laws that the IRS operates under which prohibit the release of tax information by an IRS employee.\n\nThe draft the person described Sunday appears to be a narrower version of the earlier draft. Under the current iteration, the IRS would confirm migrants\u2019 addresses rather than provide the information to ICE.\n\nStill, it would amount to a major shift by the agency. Requests would need to be submitted by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem or acting ICE director Todd Lyons, and must include the name and address of the taxpayer, and the date of their removal order, which would allow the IRS to confirm the information.\n\nTwo immigrant rights groups in Chicago sued the Treasury Department and IRS earlier this month and asked a judge to block the agency from sharing taxpayers\u2019 identifying information with ICE or DHS, as Trump pushes for more deportations.\n\nThe groups claimed federal law \u201cforbids\u201d the IRS from giving this data to immigration authorities, because ICE and DHS aren\u2019t listed as exceptions to the confidentiality rules in the tax code."

Rubio said Rasool was a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates the US and Trump.\n\nRubio\u2019s post linked to a story by the conservative Breitbart news site that reported on a talk Rasool gave on a webinar organized by a South African think tank. In his talk, Rasool spoke in academic language of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdowns on diversity and equity programs and immigration and mentioned the possibility of a US where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.\n\n\u201cThe supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white,\u201d Rasool said in the talk.\n\nOn his return home Sunday, he said he stood by those comments, and characterized them as merely alerting intellectuals and political leaders in South Africa that the US and its politics had changed.\n\n\u201cIt is not the US of Obama, it is not the US of Clinton, it is a different US and therefore our language must change,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cI would stand by my analysis because we were analyzing a political phenomenon, not a personality, not a nation, and not even a government.\u201d\n\nHe also said that South Africa would resist pressure from the US \u2014 and anyone else \u2014 to drop its case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump administration has cited that case against US ally Israel as one of the reasons it alleges South Africa is anti-American.\n\nThe Breitbart story Rubio cited when announcing Rasool\u2019s expulsion was written by South African-born senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak, who is Jewish and an ally of the Trump administration. Pollak is also a contender to be the new US ambassador to South Africa, according to South African media.\n\nSome of the supporters welcoming Rasool, who is Muslim, home to Cape Town waved Palestinian flags and chanted \u201cfree Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we stand here, the bombing (in Gaza) has continued and the shooting has continued, and if South Africa was not in the (International Court of Justice), Israel would not be exposed, and the Palestinians would have no hope,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice the Palestinians\u2026 but we will also not give up with our relationship with the United States. We must fight for it, but we must keep our dignity.\u201d"

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that politicians are \u201cnot being honest\u201d when they say they won\u2019t touch Social Security.\n\nHis comments come as President Donald Trump has said his administration was \u201cnot touching\u201d Social Security and town hall attendees have expressed concerns about potential Social Security cuts. Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut spending, has vocally criticized Social Security, prompting concerns from some Trump allies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not being honest when we look people in the eye and say we\u2019re not going to touch it. If we don\u2019t touch it, it touches itself,\u201d Curtis told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cYou know that, right? That\u2019s not being honest with the American people, and I think that\u2019s one of the things that makes them not trust us, when we say something that they just know is not true.\u201d\n\nCurtis said the government does not \u201cneed to impact the people that are in Social Security,\u201d but instead can have a conversation about what Social Security looks like for younger generations that are further away from retirement, like 20- and 30-year-olds.\n\n\u201cWe all need to say, those in retirement and those near retirement, we\u2019re not going to touch it, you\u2019re safe. But let\u2019s have that conversation, because my kids don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why can\u2019t we have a conversation with them about moving some of the variables around, and the sooner we do it, the less dramatic it has to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it, we have worse decisions thrust upon us,\u201d he added.\n\nCurtis said he plans to introduce a change to Social Security in a few months. A spokesperson for the senator declined to preview the bill.\n\nSocial Security, which includes retirement and disability benefit programs, has been referred to as the \u201cthird rail\u201d of politics, meaning it is considered untouchable because of its widespread popularity.\n\nCurtis has previously been vocal about wanting to reform Social Security, saying last year that he told then-prospective GOP Senate leaders to \u201cuse me as your tip of the spear\u201d in discussions on Social Security reform, according to NBC affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City.\n\nRepublicans have frequently voiced concerns about the federal deficit and made government cost-cutting a centerpiece of the second Trump administration. As part of these efforts, DOGE has moved to close some Social Security offices and alter telephone services.\n\nAsked about Musk's involvement in decisions to cut federal programs, contracts and the federal workforce, Curtis said it was a \"false narrative\" that someone could not get involved in the government.\n\n\"President Trump can consult anybody he wants to,\" Curtis said. \"Elon Musk is not making any cuts. He's only suggesting the cuts, and then President Trump is making the cuts.\"\n\nAn NBC News poll this month indicated that 46% of registered voters believed creating DOGE was a \"good idea\" but that 47% hold negative views of DOGE and 51% hold negative views of Musk.\n\nCurtis was also asked about Trump ally Steve Bannon's comments in a NewsNation interview that he believes Trump will run for and win a third term, which the 22nd Amendment prohibits.\n\n\"I wouldn't have supported a third term for George Washington,\" Curtis said, confirming he would not support a third term for Trump, either.\n\nThe Trump administration is in court battles over deportations under the rarely invoked Alien Enemies Act. A judge had told a government lawyer to instruct his clients to turn around planes involved in deportations under the act, but the planes were later revealed to have landed in El Salvador. The timing of the flights and questions about the administration's responses to the judge are the centerpieces of a high-profile court battle.\n\nAsked about the legality of the Trump administration's action, Curtis noted that he was not a lawyer, adding, \"Let's let this play out.\"\n\n\"I think that's the beauty of the courts, is having confidence that it will play out and we'll get to the right answer,\" he said."

            "full_content": "Central Germany CNN \u2014\n\n\u201cDo you think you can trust Putin?\u201d German Brig. Gen. Ralf Hammerstein asks with a wry smile.\n\nIt\u2019s a rhetorical question to which most of Europe would give the same answer \u2013 no.\n\nAs the Trump administration continues to pursue a deal to end the war in Ukraine \u2014 one that may end up being more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv \u2014 Europeans, for the first time in decades, are focusing on their own military might.\n\nNowhere is that shift as prominent as in Germany. Its armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr, have been the victim of years of underinvestment \u2013 but that is set to change.\n\nPresumptive Chancellor Friedrich Merz has decided that now is the moment for Germany to invest in its military, on levels not seen since the Cold War.\n\nGermany has just passed a major reform to its constitutional debt brake, unlocking billions of euros in funding. One model shared with CNN suggested that over a 10-year period, with Germany spending 3.5% of GDP, it could amount to \u20ac600 billion ($652 billion).\n\nCNN spent the day with the Bundeswehr at an undisclosed location in central Germany as five NATO allies took part in training exercises. The simulation was an attack by a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d on another member of the alliance.\n\nSpeaking at the makeshift headquarters for the simulation, Hammerstein told CNN: \u201cGermany is a capable nation in Europe, and has to be a partner for other nations. We are a responsible partner in Europe and a big nation. We (have) got to step up, and we will do that.\u201d\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was a seismic moment for the continent. War had returned and the detente that had existed since the fall of the Iron Curtain was over.\n\nIn Berlin, it kickstarted the period known in German as the \u201cZeitenwende\u201d \u2013 or \u201cturning point.\u201d In effect, it was the beginning of the effort to step up military spending once again.\n\nOlaf Scholz, the now-outgoing chancellor, said the country needed a new defense and security policy \u2013 and that the Bundeswehr needed special attention.\n\nHe established a one-off \u20ac100 billion fund for \u201ccomprehensive investment\u201d into the Bundeswehr. To do so, Scholz had to amend the Basic Law \u2013 essentially, the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe change to the constitution could unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of debt just on military spending. Matthies Otto/CNN\n\nEven though that fund was welcomed, the implementation of the policy has been lackluster, and government squabbling and in-fighting ultimately led to Scholz losing his job.\n\nMerz now is looking to supercharge the \u201cZeitenwende.\u201d\n\nSudha David-Wilp, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank, told CNN that \u201cMerz and (his) coalition need to accelerate this\u2026 There\u2019s now a lot of great power competition and hard power is the currency of international politics.\u201d\n\nAs the simulated attack was unfolding, back in Berlin Merz was outlining his new vision for the armed forces. \u201cWe have believed in a deceptive security in our society for at least a decade, probably much more\u2026 This is now the paradigm shift in defense policy that lies ahead of us.\u201d\n\nSince the middle of the Cold War era, Germany\u2019s military expenditure as a percentage of GDP has dropped dramatically. Peaking at 4.9% in 1963, it fell to an all-time low in 2005 of just 1.1%.\n\nOnly as recently as 2024 did Germany meet the NATO threshold of 2% spending on defense \u2014 marking the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nHammerstein acknowledges that \u201cevery army in the world, in history and also in the future, will always claim not to have enough.\u201d But he equates Germany\u2019s current situation as a reliance on the \u201cpeace dividend\u201d from the 1990s that \u201cwas a decrease for all the militaries in the world, in Europe especially.\u201d\n\nHe thinks that Germany is on the right track now. Last year, for the \u201cfirst time, (we) were able to spend the 2% GDP NATO criteria, and we\u2019ll additionally spend money, like the \u20ac100 billion we did in 2022, and this will continue, and the new chancellor is absolutely dedicated to that.\u201d\n\nMerz may be committed to beefing up Germany\u2019s projected military power and putting its defense on a more secure footing, but a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, Eva H\u00f6gl, suggested the work to be done was significant.\n\nReleased last week, the report outlined that the Bundeswehr didn\u2019t meet recruitment targets, had an aging fighting force, with barracks and basic infrastructure lacking. Addressing journalists at its launch, she said, \u201cthe Bundeswehr still has too little of everything.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Germany committed to boosting its standing forces to 203,000 by 2025 \u2014 a target date that was later revised to 2031. As the report states, \u201cthe Bundeswehr once again failed to achieve its original target.\u201d H\u00f6gl said that the current Bundeswehr fighting force is 181,174 personnel.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Germany\u2019s standing army size has declined dramatically to over 500,000 to just over 180,000 in 2024. Matthies Otto/CNN\n\nAsked about how the figure should be reached, Hammerstein, who joined as a conscript in 1992, called for a period of military service. Germany officially put conscription into abeyance in 2011.\n\n\u201cI was convinced by the law to join the military. So, I think some kind of obligatory service has to be in place to increase the numbers in the way we want to see it,\u201d Hammerstein said. \u201cIt will not happen overnight - but the increase we will see\u2026 starting this year.\u201d\n\nThe H\u00f6gl report also highlighted the serving age of the army, saying servicemen and women are \u201cgetting older and older.,\u201d The average age in 2019 was 32.4, but has now increased to 34.\n\nPerhaps the most damning section of the report came with a bill attached. It said \u20ac67 billion were required for infrastructure projects, and described barracks and properties as \u201cstill in a disastrous state.\u201d\n\nFor Hammerstein, though, it isn\u2019t always about money. He insists that Germany has a sound platform to launch from, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s about the quality and what I see here during the training is that we have a good substance. We have really highly motivated soldiers\u2026 and that keeps me very optimistic that the substance is good, and now we have to increase it.\u201d\n\nBrig. Gen. Ralf Hammerstein joined the German Bundeswehr as a conscript in 1992. He says that armies have and will always seek more financing, but feels Germany\u2019s military is heading in the right direction. Matthies Otto/CNN\n\nThere is also a shift in the national psyche towards the Bundeswehr. While Germans are usually very image-conscious over their military, particularly given the country\u2019s history, polling suggests many now hold a more positive opinion.\n\nA survey conducted by German public broadcaster ARD in March found 66% of respondents believe it\u2019s right to increase spending on defense and the Bundeswehr, while 31% said spending should remain the same or be cut further.\n\nIt also found that 59% of those surveyed agreed that Germany should significantly increase its debt in order to \u201ccope with upcoming tasks, especially in defense and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAs Merz embarks on turning around the German juggernaut, he is confident that he is setting Germany on the right track towards a more secure and prosperous future.\n\n\u201cGermany is back,\u201d he declared a week ago in Berlin. \u201cGermany is making a significant contribution to the defense of freedom and peace in Europe.\u201d"

            "full_content": "The South African ambassador who was expelled from the United States and declared persona non grata by the Trump administration has been given a hero\u2019s welcome on his return home\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African ambassador who was expelled from the United States and declared persona non grata by the Trump administration was given a hero's welcome on his return home Sunday, when hundreds of supporters gathered at an airport and sang songs praising him.\n\nThe crowds at Cape Town International Airport surrounded Ebrahim Rasool and his wife Rosieda as they emerged in the arrivals terminal in their hometown, and they needed a police escort to help them navigate their way through the building.\n\n\u201cA declaration of persona non grata is meant to humiliate you,\" Rasool told the supporters as he addressed them with a megaphone. \"But when you return to crowds like this, and with warmth ... like this, then I will wear my persona non grata as a badge of dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not our choice to come home, but we come home with no regrets.\u201d\n\nRasool also said it was important for South Africa to fix its relationship with the U.S. after President Donald Trump punished the country and accused it of taking an anti-American stance even before the decision to expel Rasool.\n\nThe U.S. president issued an executive order last month cutting all funding to South Africa, alleging its government is supporting the Palestinian group Hamas and Iran, and pursuing anti-white policies at home.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t come here to say we are anti-American,\u201d Rasool said to the crowd. \u201cWe are not here to call on you to throw away our interests with the United States.\u201d\n\nThey were the ex-ambassador's first public comments since the Trump administration declared him persona non grata over a week ago, removed his diplomatic immunities and privileges, and gave him until this Friday to leave the U.S.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the U.S. to expel a foreign ambassador.\n\nRasool was declared persona non grata by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a post on X on March 14. Rubio said Rasool was a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates the U.S. and Trump.\n\nRubio's post linked to a story by the conservative Breitbart news site that reported on a talk Rasool gave on a webinar organized by a South African think tank. In his talk, Rasool spoke in academic language of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdowns on diversity and equity programs and immigration and mentioned the possibility of a U.S. where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.\n\n\u201cThe supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the U.S.A., the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the U.S.A. in which the voting electorate in the U.S.A. is projected to become 48% white,\u201d Rasool said in the talk.\n\nOn his return home Sunday, he said he stood by those comments, and characterized them as merely alerting intellectuals and political leaders in South Africa that the U.S. and its politics had changed.\n\n\u201cIt is not the U.S. of Obama, it is not the U.S. of Clinton, it is a different U.S. and therefore our language must change,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cI would stand by my analysis because we were analyzing a political phenomenon, not a personality, not a nation, and not even a government.\"\n\nHe also said that South Africa would resist pressure from the U.S. \u2014 and anyone else \u2014 to drop its case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump administration has cited that case against U.S. ally Israel as one of the reasons it alleges South Africa is anti-American.\n\nThe Breitbart story Rubio cited when announcing Rasool's expulsion was written by South African-born senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak, who is Jewish and an ally of the Trump administration. Pollak is also a contender to be the new U.S. ambassador to South Africa, according to South African media.\n\nSome of the supporters welcoming Rasool, who is Muslim, home to Cape Town waved Palestinian flags and chanted \u201cfree Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we stand here, the bombing (in Gaza) has continued and the shooting has continued, and if South Africa was not in the (International Court of Justice), Israel would not be exposed, and the Palestinians would have no hope,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice the Palestinians ... but we will also not give up with our relationship with the United States. We must fight for it, but we must keep our dignity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP news on the Trump administration: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump"

Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics.\n\nTrump\u2019s almost daily attacks on Canada\u2019s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump claims that Canada isn\u2019t a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen,\" Carney said.\n\nThe governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in January and Trump declared a trade war. Carney has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate.\n\n\u201cThe next election will be one of the most consequential in our lifetimes,\u201d he posted on social media overnight.\n\nThe election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days. While other parties are running, the Liberals and the Conservatives are the only two that have a chance to form a government. The party that commands a majority in Parliament, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.\n\nCarney replaced Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.\n\nTrump put 25% tariffs on Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products \u2014 as well as all of America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 on April 2.\n\nPierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney\u2019s main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada\u2019s federal election this year until Trump\u2019s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.\n\nPoilievre said he will stand up to Trump but Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a conservative ally, said in an interview Poilievre would be \u201cvery much in sync\u201d with the \u201cnew direction in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will insist the president recognizes the independence and sovereignty of Canada. I will insist he stops tariffing our nation,\" Poilievre said as he launched his campaign.\n\nPoilievre said he doesn't respect \u201cthe treatment that he has meted out to our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people are worried, angry and anxious. And with good reason as a result of the president\u2019s unacceptable threats against our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are worried about your job and the sovereignty of our nation. And you are angry at the feeling of betrayal that these unacceptable words and tariffs have made us all experience. I share your anger and I share the worry about our future.\"\n\nCarney still hasn\u2019t had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney\u2019s name.\n\nCarney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England \u2014 helping to manage the impact of Brexit.\n\nPoilievre, 45, for years the party\u2019s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put \u201cCanada first.\u201d He vows to defund Canada\u2019s public broadcaster and he won\u2019t allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe White House, through an outside event production company called Harbinger, is soliciting corporate sponsors for this year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll, which is prompting major concerns from ethics experts and shock from former White House officials from both parties.\n\nThe sponsorship offers range from $75,000 to $200,000, with the promise of logo and branding opportunities, according to a nine-page document sent to potential sponsors and obtained by CNN.\n\nThe Egg Roll, which began during the Rutherford B. Hayes administration in 1878, has long been privately funded without taxpayer dollars, largely through the American Egg Board, which also provides tens of thousands of eggs for the occasion. And all money raised by Harbinger will go to the White House Historical Association.\n\nBut the solicitation for sponsorships marks an unprecedented offering of corporate branding opportunities on White House grounds running counter to long-established regulations prohibiting the use of public office for private gain.\n\n\u201cThis is an enterprise. This is not your grandmother\u2019s Easter Egg Roll where people lined up outside the gate and go and roll an egg and get a little gift bag and walk out,\u201d said a former official involved in planning the event, which has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years.\n\nThe pitch document laying out sponsorship opportunities includes logos for both the White House and Harbinger, which previously produced the event during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term and is offering \u201cinitial planning\u201d and \u201cevent day execution\u201d for sponsors that sign on. It features imagery of Trump, first lady Melania Trump, members of the Trump family, the Easter Bunny, and the White House press corps, including CNN correspondent Kaitlan Collins.\n\n\u201cSponsors of WHEER [White House Easter Egg Roll] provide financial support, activities, and giveaways to enhance the event while gaining valuable brand visibility and national recognition,\u201d reads the document.\n\nGuests participate in the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nAmong the offerings for prospective sponsors: \u201cNaming rights for key areas or elements,\u201d \u201cSponsor logos featured on event signage,\u201d \u201cCustom-branded baskets, snacks/beverages, or souvenirs,\u201d \u201cMentions in official event communications and social media posts,\u201d \u201cAcknowledgment in printed or digital event programs,\u201d and \u201cInclusion in press releases and media interviews.\u201d Sponsors can also gain access to an \u201cinvite-only brunch hosted inside the White House by FLOTUS,\u201d tickets to the event, and a private White House tour.\n\nUpon viewing the pitch document, Richard Painter, who served in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office under President George W. Bush, told CNN that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t have gotten through Counsel\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would have been vetoed in about 30 seconds in my day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not running this like a football stadium where you get all logos all over the place for kicking in money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Trump White House has openly flouted norms and rules from the South Lawn. Earlier this month, the president touted a selection of Tesla vehicles accompanied by the company\u2019s CEO Elon Musk. In 2020, the Republican National Convention was held in part on the grounds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Elon Musk deliver remarks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nAll money raised by Harbinger\u2019s efforts will be placed into an account run by the White House Historical Association, a private nonprofit organization.\n\n\u201cFor many presidencies, the White House Historical Association has collaborated with White House staff to facilitate a public gathering such as the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. And as we do with other gifts to the White House collection, we receive contributions and in-kind gifts that are used on the grounds that day,\u201d the association\u2019s president, Stewart McLaurin, told CNN.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for a production company like Harbinger to be involved. The company, founded by former Mitt Romney campaign staffers in 2013, has produced large-scale corporate and government events, including Egg Rolls during Trump\u2019s first term, March for Our Lives, media spin rooms at presidential debates, and Pope Francis\u2019 2015 visit to the US.\n\n\u201cThere is a certain level of expectation by the public that these be amazingly grand affairs \u2013 memorable affairs \u2013 and every year, you try and top it with something new and different. But to do that, clearly, you need professional production companies. It\u2019s beyond the White House Visitor\u2019s Office and their little team of six people,\u201d the former official involved in planning the event said.\n\nPrivate contributions cover activity booths, artists, music, vendors, staging, equipment and d\u00e9cor, said a source familiar with the planning who was granted anonymity to detail specifics of the funding mechanisms. Any excess funding raised, that source said, will go toward other similar White House events, such as Halloween festivities and the Fourth of July. So far, one sponsor has been identified for the April 21 event, with other \u201csuccessful conversations\u201d underway, according to the source, who noted that the National Park Service, which oversees White House grounds, will be responsible for vetting prospective donors before gifts are accepted.\n\nThe White House, the office of the first lady, Harbinger, the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nIn the past, according to another official involved in the planning of previous Egg Rolls, there was an agreement on reimbursement for the event\u2019s cost between the National Park Service, the American Egg Board, the White House Historical Association and the White House. There have also been smaller-scale partnerships with organizations like NASA, the LEGO Foundation, and Disney. But any branding, the source said, was extremely limited due to severe constraints from the White House counsel\u2019s office.\n\nAsked for comment, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board told CNN that it plans to be involved in the Egg Roll this year.\n\n\u201cThe specific details are being finalized now with the White House,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that details of the board\u2019s partnership with the White House \u201care not shared publicly.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what social media channels would be used for the promised \u201cmentions in official event communications and social media posts,\u201d and whether they would be sent from official White House accounts. It\u2019s also unclear whether the White House Counsel\u2019s Office signed off on the solicitation document.\n\nPainter argued the move runs counter to free enterprise. The Trump administration, he said, \u201cjust have a different attitude\u2026 that \u2018America First\u2019 somehow requires the United States to pick winners and losers in the private sector.\u201d\n\nDonald Sherman, the chief counsel and executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), said he had \u201cnever seen anything like this before\u201d associated with a White House.\n\n\u201cI understand that there are corporate sponsors for the Easter Egg Roll,\u201d Sherman told CNN. \u201cWhat I have not seen before is sort of the outright solicitation and the use of the imprimatur of the White House to give corporate sponsorship.\u201d\n\nPrevious egg rolls have been a source of tension between those involved with planning and the Counsel\u2019s Office. Multiple administrations had to tell Coca-Cola that thousands of Dasani water bottles donated for the event could not be served in Coke-branded coolers, for instance, because of the branding restrictions placed by the White House lawyers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting agita thinking of the conversations I used to have with the Counsel\u2019s Office,\u201d said the first former official involved in planning the event. \u201cSometimes it went too far \u2013 yeah \u2013 but their goal is to protect the president.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nThere\u2019s a new war within the liberal intelligentsia, and it\u2019s got to do with a funny word: abundance. Is it good or bad to be abundant? Does it symbolize dynamism or shadow libertarianism? What ills will so-called zoning reform actually fix?\n\nTwo new books are at the heart of this struggle. One is called, of course, Abundance, by Ezra Klein, the star New York Times columnist and podcaster, and Derek Thompson, a journalist at The Atlantic. The other, Why Nothing Works, comes from Marc J. Dunkelman, a fellow at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. All three writers are Democrats or sympathetic to the Democratic cause. All dislike Donald Trump. All want blue cities, blue counties, and blue states from coast to coast.\n\nBut each man has riled up a certain number of left-leaning Democrats for somewhat similar reasons. One overriding issue is that many on the left are annoyed or even angered that such a debate is happening right now, against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s assault on the federal bureaucracy and democratic norms. Why care about abundance when the president is threatening judges and trying to deport legal residents for their political beliefs? It\u2019s a fair argument, as is the reality that such an agenda \u2014 making government better at building and doing \u2014 isn\u2019t an automatic salve for the Democratic woes in the heartland, or anywhere, really.\n\nWhat has become obvious, though, is that the United States, despite its inordinate wealth, is not matching its 20th-century dynamism. Could this government \u2014 Republican or Democratic run \u2014 build another interstate highway system? A network of railroads? Could this Department of Defense effectively invent the internet? There will be an America after Trump, and a republic, too, and it\u2019s worth mulling the greater arc of our nation. Not all issues are bound to electoral cycles, team red against team blue. If we are going to save our climate or guarantee every American an affordable place to live, these debates must be had \u2014 now.\n\nThe Klein-Thompson duo argues that an \u201canti-growth\u201d mentality has constrained the left for the last several decades. NIMBYism and aggressive regulations have strangled housing supply and innovation. As government support for research and development dried up, science produced fewer societywide breakthroughs. Once, we built whole subway systems in a decade, sent human beings to the moon, and created the internet. Klein and Thompson do blame neoliberalism \u2014 a long-running retreat from government investment and a foisting of responsibilities on the private sector \u2014 for this, which should make many progressives nod along. But they\u2019d prefer lighter zoning and environmental laws to speed up growth. Can the Green New Deal come to fruition if NIMBYs can always sue to halt new solar plants and transmission lines?\n\nDunkelman\u2019s thesis is similar. For New Yorkers, there\u2019s plenty in Why Nothing Works to devour. He begins with the great b\u00eate noire of the modern left, Robert Moses, and argues \u2014 as I have \u2014 that the master builder\u2019s legacy is somewhat misunderstood. Or, at least, we\u2019ve overlearned the lessons of the Moses era. Moses, of course, ran roughshod over much of New York, ramming highways through thriving neighborhoods and thwarting the expansion of mass transit. He behaved like a tyrant and cared little for conventional democracy. Politicians couldn\u2019t move him, nor could protest. For 40 years, he was emblematic of an imperial approach to governing, and it was Robert Caro\u2019s The Power Broker which exposed, finally, many of his excesses.\n\nBut Dunkelman, with a half-century of hindsight, is able to tell another story: Moses wasn\u2019t merely a villain. Harnessing the collective powers of the federal, state, and local governments, he built enormous amounts of public housing and parkland. He transformed the Valley of Ashes of Great Gatsby lore into Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park. He dreamed up Jones Beach and Riverside Park. He built Lincoln Center and the United Nations. He finished what was, at that time, the largest suspension bridge on earth. His public-housing developments ensured hundreds of thousands of working-class people could permanently reside in New York, no matter how expensive it became. Under Moses, the government could be unfeeling \u2014 but it worked. And it was not Moses-style development that triggered New York\u2019s decline in the 1970s, as Caro strongly intimated. Rather, it was the collapse of the manufacturing sector, white flight, and fiscal mismanagement. The public works Moses left behind were necessary for New York\u2019s post-fiscal-crisis renaissance.\n\nDunkelman frames American views of governance as a centuries-long clash between Hamiltonians, who argue for stronger centralized authority, and Jeffersonians, who are wary of government overreach. Both, in his view, have a point. In the 20th century, urban planning could go awry, leading to interstate highways obliterating vibrant, walkable downtowns. Ignoring the will of ordinary people had dire consequences. But the trouble began when the Jeffersonians kept winning. Beginning in the 1970s, skepticism of government power began getting baked into both political parties. Conservatives, of course, longed to dismantle the New Deal legacy: They wanted lower taxes, weaker unions, and more influence for private enterprise at the expense of federal oversight.\n\nThe left\u2019s role in this push is more poorly understood, and Dunkelman is a wonderful guide to this dispiriting stretch of history. Beginning with Watergate, which taught a generation of young progressives to distrust federal power, the left began to favor hamstringing government whenever possible. Numerous new choke points, some of them well-meaning, were invented, from arcane local laws to community boards that could stifle building that alienated locals. Preservationists warred to freeze urban neighborhoods in place, hoping to avoid catastrophes like the obliteration of the old Penn Station \u2014 but they also, in their zeal for saving the old, helped to ensure these cities would grow less affordable. Building new affordable housing, commuter railways, or any other type of large infrastructure project became far harder in the era of community control.\n\nHow to make America dynamic again? How to build here like they do in China and Japan, where it\u2019s routine to throw up new high-speed rail lines every decade? And if we solved these problems, would it be enough? David Sirota, the founder of Lever News and a former Bernie Sanders speechwriter, summed up one stinging progressive critique of the whole project: \u201cAbundance\u2122 being defined as \u2018kill zoning laws and corporate regulation\u2019 but not \u2018give everyone decent medical care\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s the tell, and you\u2019re the mark.\u201d It\u2019s true that this is not a focus among the advocates of abundance. Relaxing zoning laws won\u2019t do anything to bring us universal health care or bolster the social safety net. It may not even, in the short term, do enough to create affordable housing. One of the great divides within the YIMBY movement, which can be folded into the abundance push, is how much regulation should exist around what people pay in rent. Some YIMBYs do back stronger tenant protections and versions of rent control while others, like Klein ally Matthew Yglesias, plainly do not. Yglesias is also skeptical of lifting the federal law that effectively bans the construction of new public housing.\n\nAbundance, then, can hold different meanings for different advocates. If the belief is that a robust, efficient federal government should do more to help working-class Americans, then we need a new program of mass home-building like what we saw in the 1930s and 1940s. Without the New York City Public Housing Authority, the largest city in America would probably have an unfathomably large number of unhoused people, the tent cities in the five boroughs making the Tenderloin and Skid Row look like minor, quasi-pastoral encampments. If you believe zoning reform is enough \u2014 and the government need only get out of the way \u2014 then how much housing must be built, exactly, for rents to start falling enough that a family making well under $100,000 can comfortably afford a market-rate apartment? Turning New York (or any city) into Tokyo is easier said than done.\n\nWhat abundance advocates do get right is that governments \u2014 federal, state, and local \u2014 must do far better. We have fallen a long way from the 20th century; we led the world in building and innovation until we didn\u2019t. We are still a remarkably wealthy nation, and we must find a way, as we persevere in this new century, to beat back stagnation. Otherwise, the future is going to be much more frustrating."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDavid Bailey, a longtime Bitcoin investor and evangelist, had tempered expectations in early 2024 when he first pitched Donald Trump\u2019s campaign on the political upside of embracing cryptocurrency. Even after Trump pledged over the summer to make the US a Bitcoin haven and the industry spent tens of millions of dollars supporting his presidential bid, Bailey suspected Trump\u2019s overture might be a fleeting appeal for crypto voters rather than a lasting commitment.\n\nYet since returning to office, Trump has upended the federal government\u2019s wary stance toward cryptocurrency just as he said he would. Earlier this month, he signed an executive order directing the Federal Reserve to hold Bitcoin alongside gold\u2014a move long sought by crypto advocates and once considered improbable.\n\n\u201cIf a year ago you put me into hypnosis and said, \u2018Describe to me your deepest dreams of what could happen,\u2019 this would be straight-up fantasy,\u201d said Bailey, who owns the Bitcoin conference where Trump first stepped out as a pro-crypto candidate. \u201cI never would have believed it could happen.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s return to power was achieved in part through an unorthodox coalition-building strategy. He courted groups who might\u2019ve been overlooked by Republican candidates, like Bitcoin enthusiasts, making direct appeals with policy promises tailored to specific audiences.\n\nFor those who played along, the rewards have come swiftly.\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina, for instance, had reliably voted Democratic in presidential elections for decades. But an eight-year pursuit by Trump for the battleground state\u2019s predominant native group \u2013 culminating with his promise last fall to grant the tribe much-coveted federal recognition \u2013 appeared to resonate at the ballot box. In Lumbee-rich Robeson County, where Barack Obama twice won handily, Trump secured a 28-point victory, his largest margin across three races.\n\nThree days after taking office, Trump signed a memorandum declaring it US policy \u201cto support the full federal recognition\u201d of the Lumbee Tribe, the strongest statement to date from the Oval Office.\n\nTransactional? Perhaps, but that\u2019s politics, said Lumbee Tribe Chairman John Lowery, who told CNN, \u201cIt feels good to be courted.\u201d\n\nIn this October 2024 photo, Abigail Blue, a member of the Lumbee Tribe, walks by the stage during a campaign event in support of Donald Trump in Red Springs, North Carolina. David Yeazell/AP/File\n\n\u201cEveryone is in their lane and they\u2019re not going to get out of it. You\u2019re either hardcore this or that,\u201d Lowery said. \u201cWe are hardcore for those who are showing the effort and putting in the work to get our vote. And we have a tendency to reward that more than any ideological view. There\u2019s something about good old retail politics. Trump has done that on this issue.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s unconventional approach extended to union workers, a longtime Democratic stronghold. Amid the outreach, and with many of his members increasingly leaning toward Trump, Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien stunned Democrats by delivering a primetime address at the Republican National Convention (getting a lukewarm response from the GOP audience). Later, the union withheld an endorsement in the presidential race for the first time in decades, a considerable blow to the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe strategy paid off for Trump: He won 45 percent of the vote from union households, according to a CNN exit poll, a striking watermark for a GOP candidate.\n\nFor O\u2019Brien, the calculated risk proved worthwhile during a Nov. 21 visit to Mar-a-Lago, where he advocated for Lori Chavez-DeRemer, then a Republican lawmaker from Oregon, to lead the Department of Labor. After three hours of intense discussions, Trump agreed to nominate Chavez-DeRemer and, most critically, vowed not to relent in face of expected pushback from business groups who saw her as too sympathetic to unions, O\u2019Brien told CNN. The next day, his transition team announced Chavez-DeRemer as his pick for Secretary of Labor and she was confirmed earlier this month.\n\nThe episode solidified the Teamsters as \u201cone of the most influential unions in the country,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cWe know we got criticized by our peers in organized labor, but we\u2019ve watched our organization do the same thing every single campaign and expect a different result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to take that approach.\u201d\n\nPresident of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Sean O\u2019Brien speaks on stage at the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 15, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nTrump\u2019s early efforts to appease key constituencies comes as his political operation is already plotting how to motivate his unconventional coalition to show up for Republicans in next year\u2019s midterm elections. While some in Trump\u2019s movement have predicted a more permanent political realignment is in the offing, the White House remains concerned that the president\u2019s appeal to certain groups may not translate to GOP congressional candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, for example, whether Libertarian voters and supporters of ex-presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can be convinced Trump needs to keep Republican majorities in Congress, a White House official told CNN. Trump appealed to both groups during the campaign \u2013 a calculation his political team made early after watching the Libertarian candidate siphon votes from him in 2020.\n\nTrump\u2019s effort to court Libertarians last summer\u2014including a speech at their national convention where he endured boos before promising to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned founder of an illicit online market called Silk Road\u2014seems to have worked. The Libertarian ticket garnered its smallest share of the vote since 2008. A day after taking office, Trump fulfilled his pledge to pardon Ulbricht.\n\nSimilarly, Trump named Kennedy Secretary of Health and Human Services shortly after the election after vowing the prominent vaccine skeptic would have a role overseeing health issues in his administration.\n\nAngela McArdle, the Libertarian Party chair at the time, has publicly insisted giving Trump a platform at the convention has paid off for her members.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect perfection,\u201d she posted on X this week. \u201cTake the wins!\u201d\n\nBut not everyone is pleased with the arrangement. Steven Nekhaila, the current party chairman, called Ulbricht\u2019s clemency a \u201cgood transaction from the libertarian movement,\u201d but added that Libertarians were naive if they thought Trump wanted \u201canything more than our vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more naive to think we won\u2019t be discarded when we\u2019re no longer convenient the same way Rep. Thomas Massie was cast aside when he was no longer in line,\u201d Nekhaila said, referring to Trump\u2019s threat to primary the conservative Kentucky congressman after he defied the president on a vote to fund the government.\n\nTrump\u2019s early actions on cryptocurrency have also drawn some criticism, including from supporters within the industry who have balked at his growing financial interests in digital assets. Once a vocal opponent of Bitcoin, Trump\u2019s change in tune last year came as his family launched a crypto venture spearheaded by his sons. Days before his inauguration, Trump also announced a new meme coin capitalizing on his name, presenting new conflicts for a president who already has more than any modern predecessor.\n\nWhen Trump unveiled his family\u2019s new digital asset business, Nic Carter, a crypto investor who supported the Republican, said, \u201cAt best it\u2019s an unnecessary distraction, at worst it\u2019s a huge embarrassment and source of (additional) legal trouble.\u201d\n\nBailey, speaking to CNN en route to a dinner at the White House for donors, dismissed the conflicts as examples of Trump\u2019s \u201centrepreneurial spirit.\u201d Regardless, Bailey believes the former president has forced the political class to take the cryptocurrency community seriously.\n\n\u201cOur voter bloc is big and growing quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it will be up to the parties to speak with us.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s early actions have earned plaudits from the groups his campaign targeted, their leaders also suggest there\u2019s more to be done to fully satisfy his commitments to them. Trump has yet to say, for example, how much Bitcoin the Federal Reserve should stockpile. The Teamsters is closely watching how labor fares in early decisions under Trump by the National Labor Relations Board and whether his administration stands by union provisions in existing federal contracts.\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe still needs an act of Congress to access the federal benefits granted to other federally recognized American Natives. Lowery said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d Trump can champion a legislative push, but if Republicans with full control of government can\u2019t get it to his desk, Lumbee voters may swing back toward Democrats.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember us,\u201d Lowery said, \u201cand you can\u2019t take us for granted.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nAmerican men and boys are in trouble, we are told. The internet is replete with tales of controlling husbands and boyfriends who neglect their hygiene and play video games all day. The stories aren\u2019t purely anecdotal; the data suggest there is a crisis. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2024 that although more women ages 25 to 34 have entered the workforce \u201cin recent years,\u201d the share of similarly aged working men \u201chasn\u2019t grown in a decade.\u201d Many young men still live at home with their parents rather than striking out on their own and say they have trouble making friends and finding dates. Their suicide rates are rising, leading some observers to attribute their struggles in part to a lack of purpose or meaning. \u201cYoung Hispanic men, and really young men in general, they want to feel valued,\u201d Rafael Struve of the conservative Bienvenido group told the Associated Press not long after Donald Trump won reelection. A few weeks later, Richard V. Reeves of the nonpartisan American Institute for Boys and Men told the Journal, \u201cThe sense a lot of young men have is not being sure that they are needed or that they are going to be needed by their families, by their communities, by society.\u201d\n\nMale loneliness is an opportunity for misogynist influencers like Andrew Tate. He tells millions of followers that masculinity is theirs to reclaim through the brutal oppression of women. Donald Trump offers a less explicit version of the same argument, telling young men that their prospects are threatened by \u201cDEI,\u201d which he defines as the advancement of women, LGBTQ+ people, and racial minorities. In 2024, young men again drifted right and toward Trump, a trend that helped put the would-be strongman back in the White House. Democrats know they have a problem. During the first episode of California governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s podcast, the California Democrat told MAGA star Charlie Kirk that his son is a fan. Others are recalibrating their rhetoric and policies to better address the male plight. Maryland governor Wes Moore has announced a new initiative to help men and boys. \u201cOn every single indicator we care about, young men and boys are falling off,\u201d he told Washingtonian. Last month, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan appealed directly to men and boys in a speech, saying, \u201cThe last thing any of us wants is a generation of young men falling behind their fathers and grandfathers.\u201d\n\nThe crisis is real, to an extent. Men are in trouble, and that means everyone else is in trouble too. The return of Trump and the growth of misogyny are real political problems for women, for the economy, and for democracy itself. Alas for all of us, the debate over men has become detached from material reality. Men may lack purpose, but that dilemma is not unique to them, as women also struggle for meaning and value. The real culprit is a political economy that renders everyone powerless and insecure. As long as it endures, purpose remains a loose concept, and that allows snake oil to flourish. Sometimes this is literally true: The Black Forest supplement company promises men more than berberine and something called \u201cturkesterone.\u201d It also advertises community. \u201cTogether, we can continue to defy the forces that seek to suppress our true nature and empower one another to embrace our inherent masculinity,\u201d the website says. Whether a man imbibes Tate or turkesterone, he is taking poison. He needs an antidote, and fast, but he finds it in short supply.\n\nThe answer to male pain isn\u2019t masculinity, but a new political order, where no man or woman is an automaton or object. As analysts like Reeves have argued, it is possible to champion men and boys without sacrificing women and girls to the right-wing. Yet some liberals would rather appease violent masculinity than defeat it. Newsom didn\u2019t just interview Kirk; he praised the far-right activist, and attacked trans athletes and \u201cwoke culture\u201d in the same episode. Democrats like him agree that wokeness has gone too far, that trans rights and immigration are destabilizing the country and alienating male voters. In searching for common ground with Trump, they align themselves with the same reactionary forces that sell men hierarchy and call it freedom. Join us, the right-wing says, and you can use slurs. But the liberty to insult others is an ersatz version of the real thing.\n\nNowhere is this clearer than in the Trump administration. On Monday, the Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor railed against immigration during an appearance at the White House, a few months after an Irish court ordered him to pay almost \u20ac250,000 to a woman who says he beat and raped her in 2018. At the same time, the administration defended the deportation of more than 200 Venezuelan men on the basis that they were all gang members and abusers of women. Trump\u2019s masculinity is bound up with white nationalism, which has long promised white men and white women a measure of power in exchange for their obedience. A man can serve in the military, but if he is Black, he can also expect to see his contributions erased. After the Pentagon temporarily removed a story about Jackie Robinson and his military service from its website, press secretary John Ullyot said in a written statement that so-called DEI programming \u201cDivides the force, Erodes unit cohesion, and Interferes with the services\u2019 core warfighting mission.\u201d Some masculinities matter more than others, while imaginary threats hide real predators from scrutiny. There is no freedom here, only levels of tyranny.\n\nThe right-wing offers men a purpose of a sort but asks him to derive his meaning from the subjugation of others. It\u2019s an old bargain. When I was an Evangelical girl in the \u201990s, thousands of men flocked to the Promise Keepers movement, which offered them camaraderie and fellowship while promoting male authority over women and denouncing homosexuality. When I later entered an Evangelical college, many classmates fawned over John and Stasi Eldredge, a pair of Christian authors who taught \u201ccomplementarian\u201d theology, or the idea that men should lead their homes and churches while women lovingly submit to them. In Wild at Heart, his 2001 best-seller, John claimed that men are innately aggressive, and that they all long for \u201ca battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to love.\u201d The Christian church had failed men by asking them to deny their true nature, he argued. \u201cEvery man wants to play the hero,\u201d he added.\n\nEldredge did not invent complementarian theology but popularized ideas that I and millions of others had already heard in our church sanctuaries and our living rooms. Now reactionaries of all stripes make similar arguments. In a February piece for The Free Press, the writer Chris Arnade claimed that \u201call men need to feel like the hero\u2014if not over the course of their lifetime, then at least every now and then.\u201d Most men \u201cget their sense of worth from rescuing, protecting, building, solving \u2014 and for being appreciated for doing so,\u201d he added. When society fails to grant them that opportunity, \u201ca black market in unapproved, antisocial ones will pop up; these usually involve proving your worth through crime or violence.\u201d Arnade blamed liberalism, which, he said, \u201cfavors the individual over the community\u201d and tells men and women that they \u201ccan create a bespoke identity, like a tailor-made suit,\u201d again at the expense of their true natures.\n\nAbsent from so much contemporary discourse about the crisis of men, and from centuries-old defenses of traditional masculinity, is the labor and purpose of women. Wild at Heart made the incredible claim that slavery was ended through the strength of men. (Who needed Harriet Tubman?) \u201cApartheid wasn\u2019t defeated by women,\u201d Eldredge added. Arnade\u2019s notion of heroism is about doing, making, protecting, all of which he associates with masculinity. In real life, women find meaning in the same ways. The work of caregiving is typically carried out by women: by unpaid daughters and granddaughters and by underpaid domestic workers, who are mostly women of color. Changing a diaper is a form of protection and as necessary to society as firefighting, but a woman is rarely called heroic for doing it. Her loneliness and her need to feel valued go mostly unacknowledged. \u201cWanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that\u2019s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all,\u201d the late Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in her 1988 essay \u201cThe Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\u201d\n\nPerhaps heroism itself is part of the problem. \u201cI am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off,\u201d Le Guin wrote. \u201cHowever I don\u2019t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so.\u201d It is, she added, \u201cone of those damned things you have to do\u201d in order for society to go on. Our customary definitions of heroism, and with it, our concepts of purpose and meaning, often urge men to commit acts of socially permissible violence or subject themselves to exploitation at work. But many dislike their options. At Liberal Currents, Toby Buckle wrote in response to Arnade that \u201cheroic\u201d professions are still available to men, if they\u2019re interested. \u201cThe Army aggressively recruits; really any young man at any point can join. The vast majority don\u2019t,\u201d Buckle pointed out. \u201cMen fantasise about being in combat scenarios but, by and large, don\u2019t seek them out.\u201d Liberalism never shut men out of these roles, he added, or prohibited them from the stereotypically male pleasures of grilling meat or fathering children with a stay-at-home wife. Society has not feminized nearly as much as the reactionaries claim.\n\nNevertheless, Arnade is right about one thing, if not for the reasons he thinks. Liberalism has failed men as much as it has failed women, though \u201cbespoke identity\u201d has nothing to do with it. By leaving intact the very political economy that breaks men down, liberals undermine the best and most egalitarian aspects of their political project. \u201cLiberal freedom isn\u2019t just about finding the life that best suits you, it\u2019s a grand experiment in us all finding the best ways we can care for one another,\u201d Buckle wrote. That admirable vision can\u2019t survive in a country in thrall to the almighty free market. Our economic system depends on violence, even celebrates it, a reality that liberalism tries to dodge by inventing friendlier versions of capitalism while society fractures around them. They tell voters they will make it easier to climb the ladder when the problem is the ladder itself. Well-off men like Trump and his allies cling to the highest rungs and beat back every perceived threat with violent force. Men who are not well-off may look up at men who are and think prosperity is only possible through brutality, and they aren\u2019t entirely wrong. Though men do bear moral responsibility for the way they vote and behave, they are operating within a system that ultimately restricts them.\n\nMen can still join the Army, but the pursuit of meaning through violence is a dead end \u2014 both for men, who risk death, maiming, and moral injury, and for the victims they injure and kill. A man can still go to work and provide for his family, but unless he has a union job, he has few rights and little freedom. Even if he sends emails for a living and makes a comfortable salary, he is at the mercy of an employer who can probably fire him at any time for any reason. Even Eldredge complained in Wild at Heart that \u201ccorporate policies and procedures are designed with one aim: to harness a man to the plow and make him produce.\u201d The male soul, he added, \u201clongs for passion, for freedom, for life.\u201d If his wage can\u2019t pay the rent, or cover a child\u2019s medical bill, he might well get angry. Reactionaries will tell him to blame the advancement of women and immigrants, not his boss or the hand of the market. Too often, liberals agree, opening the door for someone like Eldredge or worse. Tate tells men they deserve not just sex but wealth, as if the hustle could save them.\n\nFeminists have always argued that patriarchy damages men in addition to women, though it is more reliably fatal for the latter. Tate once said that if a woman accuses him of cheating, \u201cIt\u2019s bang out the machete, boom in her face and grip her by the neck. Shut up bitch.\u201d At the softer end of the scale, writers like Eldredge say they reject abuse but add that women prefer the domestic sphere because of God or their biological essence. They are all pushing a trap that will not cure loneliness but increase it. Their advice, if taken, dooms women to male domination and men to lives without friendship and love. As far as Tate is concerned, \u201cwomen and property are viewed simply as financial assets,\u201d Zoe Hu wrote in Dissent. \u201cThere is no marriage or romance, however false and abusive, in Tate\u2019s world \u2014 just girlfriends who are allowed to stay with him for \u2018extended periods of time.\u2019\u201d There are no easy solutions to the reactionary\u2019s appeal or to liberalism\u2019s failures. Misogyny is older than capitalism, and if we burned it all down tomorrow, some men would still beat their wives. Yet no one benefits from the gender debate we\u2019re having now. When housing and health care are unaffordable for so many, and most workers lack the protection of a union, people will look for security wherever they believe they can find it. Even the wealthy suspect their power is fragile, and the accumulation of riches will never guarantee anyone the meaning we all seek. Salvation does not lie in the hustle or in heroism, but in the hard and unglamorous work of keeping society together.\n\nSIGN UP TO GET THIS COLUMN IN YOUR INBOX Sarah Jones covers politics and labor.

            "full_content": "After his election, Donald Trump told NBC News that \u201cwe\u2019re not touching Social Security,\u201d other than to make it more efficient. But Elon Musk, who now wields enormous power in his role cutting government spending, has recently made comments critical of the program that are coming into conflict with Trump\u2019s promise and worrying members of the president\u2019s own party.\n\nThose concerns have prompted some Trump allies to question whether the billionaire should continue to do so many media interviews, four people familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nA particularly problematic remark came during Musk\u2019s conversation with media personality Joe Rogan in late February, in which he described Social Security as \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d A couple of weeks later, the billionaire once again went after Social Security, this time in an interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. Musk, when discussing entitlement spending he deemed wasteful or fraudulent, said the program was \u201cthe big one to eliminate.\u201d\n\nMusk pointed to a 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office that estimated the entire federal government could lose between \u201c$233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements, so that\u2019s the big one to eliminate,\u201d he said.\n\nA Trump adviser acknowledged that they were aware of \u201coutside concern\u201d around Musk\u2019s comments. Trump allies \u2014 including some on Wall Street, in corporate America and Congress \u2014 have conveyed to the White House and even the president directly that Musk either has to be taken off air or needs to be more scripted.\n\nA White House official who, like others in this article, requested anonymity to speak candidly, said they were sympathetic to the views of some Republicans who see Musk\u2019s comments on Social Security as potentially problematic and worrying to some senior citizens.\n\n\u201cOf course they don\u2019t want their Social Security cut,\u201d the person said. \u201cSo if they hear something on the news that Elon Musk is saying that we should do something with Social Security \u2014 of course there might be some concerns. But the only concern they have to worry about is what the president of the United States is saying and what he\u2019s doing. We haven\u2019t touched Social Security. We\u2019re not going to touch Social Security.\u201d\n\nThe White House official said Musk\u2019s personal opinions about Social Security have no impact on Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, President Trump has full trust in Elon Musk\u2019s decisions,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe reality is everything that Elon is doing when it comes to Social Security is just to improve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cThe sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only. \u2026 DOGE has already identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers, and President Trump will continue to direct this effort until our government is truly for the people, and by the people.\u201d\n\nA Republican lawmaker who was not familiar with the calls to the White House said Musk\u2019s disparagement of Social Security has unnerved people nevertheless.\n\n\u201cIt does need to be reformed,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cWithout reforming Social Security and Medicare, both programs will collapse and take the government down with it. But the last thing we need to talk about is disparaging the system. It\u2019s not a Ponzi scheme; it\u2019s just an entitlement program that needs to be reformed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more of these Musk interviews, the more discussion we\u2019ll have. I think the entire 2026 campaign will be a referendum on Musk\u201d if the billionaire\u2019s poll numbers continue to drop, this person added. \u201cYou will see ad after ad with the chainsaw.\u201d\n\nMusk and his U.S. DOGE Service have taken a chain saw to plenty in the federal government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Education. But Social Security is a tougher target.\n\nLong known as the \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics, the popular retirement and disability program has now been hit by Musk\u2019s downsizing effort as DOGE closes some Social Security offices and curtails telephone services \u2014 moves that even Republicans are beginning to push back on. Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating as Musk opens a new political front that pops in their own polling.\n\n\u201cSocial Security is the most successful government program in American history,\u201d said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s an earned benefit that people paid into over their entire lives. If Elon and Trump go after it, I promise you this will be their undoing.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic firm Blueprint tested 20 different political messages about Musk, and the four that were most \u201cconcerning\u201d to registered voters were all about Social Security. The top two were about Musk\u2019s proposals to fire Social Security Administration employees and dismantle phone services. By contrast, voters said the messages least concerning to them were about his personal life, such as Musk fathering children with five different women. The survey was conducted last week and released Thursday.\n\nPolicy experts close to the White House said despite Musk\u2019s rhetoric and proximity to the president, Trump remains sensitive to the political risk of touching Social Security. He\u2019s been so unequivocal about maintaining benefits that even administration officials who would like to retool or cut the program are not challenging his edict.\n\n\u201cEven beyond the president, the White House itself has made crystal clear that they\u2019re not touching Social Security,\u201d one former Trump White House official said.\n\nAnother former top Trump aide also said given Musk\u2019s prominent role in the administration, the administration needs to consistently remind voters of Trump\u2019s own promise not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits and that Musk\u2019s opinions are not the official policies of the Trump administration.\n\nBut the former official said Trump may be more amenable to tweaks that can be sold as eliminating waste, fraud and abuse \u2014 a sentiment the president hinted at in falsely asserting to a joint session of Congress that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security checks. That assertion came after Musk promoted similar misinformation online. The billionaire White House adviser has also claimed hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security payments are being funneled to undocumented immigrants \u2014 framing that could appeal to Trump.\n\nMusk\u2019s promise to cut $1 trillion to $2 trillion in federal spending is virtually impossible without touching entitlement spending. And while Trump insists he wants to root out fraud, that\u2019s unlikely to dent the program\u2019s spending. The Social Security inspector general found that improper payments from fiscal year 2015 to 2022 totaled less than 1% of benefits paid over that time \u2014 and most of those were overpayments.\n\nThe rhetoric has been matched with policy shifts at the agency \u2014 even though Trump\u2019s pick to serve as commissioner has yet to be confirmed. Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner, recently outlined his vision in a lengthy memo to staff members, talking up exploratory efforts to incorporate artificial intelligence into its phone services and enhance its anti-fraud efforts.\n\nThe agency is also moving forward with a plan to no longer allow beneficiaries to change their bank information over the phone, necessitating a visit to the office or the creation of an online account \u2014 which Social Security employees told NBC News would make it more difficult for some elderly recipients to maintain their benefits.\n\nAlready, Dudek and the Social Security Administration have had to backtrack on a couple of unpopular decisions after public outcry.\n\nThe agency scrapped plans to end phone service for filing disability and retirement claims entirely, The Washington Post reported. Dudek also rescinded and apologized for an order that would have no longer allowed parents in Maine to sign up for their newborns\u2019 Social Security numbers at hospitals, instead having them register at federal offices.\n\nThe one-two punch of office closures and new limits on phone service have drawn concerns across the political spectrum. On Thursday, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., described the choice to close a Social Security hearing office in his district as \u201ca slap in the face to thousands of my constituents who rely on these services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis office handles over 2,000 backlogged cases and conducts hundreds of in-person hearings every year,\u201d Lawler, who represents a swing district, added in a statement. He said it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d to tell his constituents that they need to travel farther to receive the same service.\n\nOther Republicans are publicly warning Musk and DOGE to tread lightly when slashing Social Security employees, as that carries negative impacts for seniors.\n\n\u201cFirst, we are not going to cut Social Security benefits. Secondly, we need to be so cautious [about] how we cut the workforce because customer service is inadequate now as it is,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents an Omaha-based swing district and is a perennial Democratic target, told NBC News. \u201cOur goal needs to be improving the customer service. I know this firsthand. We had a death on our family and it has been hard to get someone to stop the payments.\u201d\n\nYet amid those concerns, Republicans said they did not remember Social Security being a subject of conversation in private meetings with Musk. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he did not recall Musk bringing up Social Security with senators during the billionaire\u2019s closed-door meeting with them last month. A senior Senate GOP aide echoed Cramer, saying he did not think Musk \u201chas really addressed Social Security much with senators at all.\u201d\n\nSocial Security employees who spoke with NBC News, meanwhile, said Musk\u2019s entitlement rhetoric and the administration\u2019s recent moves have them increasingly concerned the administration will move to privatize Social Security.\n\n\u201cThe stuff that [Musk is] saying is untrue, and he must know that what he\u2019s saying is untrue, but he\u2019s saying it to move the needle and turn public sentiment against Social Security so that privatization or vastly downsizing the workforce will seem like a good idea,\u201d said one employee at the agency, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal.\n\nA second Social Security employee said wait times are increasing for services, and employees are telling people to try and get any bank information changes in as soon as possible.\n\nThis person noted that elderly Social Security recipients who might not be tech-savvy and live far from a Social Security office are going to be most affected by the changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to prevent people from getting their benefits,\u201d this person said, adding that the effort amounts to \u201ca very stealthy, very covert hostile takeover.\u201d\n\nNancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, argued that the Trump-Musk moves to slash and overhaul the Social Security Administration can do grave harm to benefits \u2014 even if Congress doesn\u2019t act to change the program.\n\n\u201cWhat I see happening is that Donald Trump gets the politics, which is why he flooded the swing states with flyers saying he wouldn\u2019t cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Altman said. \u201cSo what is happening is an effort to undermine Social Security from within \u2014 with the idea that the benefits could be disrupted. It\u2019s with the endgame, certainly, of outsourcing and privatizing the administration of it.\u201d\n\nAltman said giving Musk\u2019s \u201cDOGE teenagers and 20-year-olds in control of the Social Security Administration\u201d access to seniors\u2019 personal data creates data safety concerns that leave the program vulnerable to hackers and scammers \u2014 \u201ca con artist\u2019s dream,\u201d she said. She argued that new rules requiring in-person office visits to register could mean that seniors who are disabled or immobile don\u2019t end up getting benefits. And she warned that the removal of Social Security Administration workers will lead to weaker customer service and longer wait times for benefits.\n\nAt a time of division for Democrats, the battle to prevent Trump and Musk from shrinking the Social Security Administration is a unifying force.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday in Brooklyn, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., faced questions about his disagreements with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the GOP funding bill, but he said they\u2019re united on protecting Social Security.\n\n\u201cWe all align on the fights that are in front of us on behalf of the people that we represent here in Brooklyn and New York City and across the country,\u201d Jeffries told reporters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s saving Medicaid, saving Social Security, saving Medicare \u2014 all of which Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the Republicans, they want to take a chain saw to Medicaid. They want to take a chain saw to Social Security.\u201d\n\nFirst-term Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., who flipped a competitive district last fall, said she\u2019s hearing from constituents who are anxious about Social Security changes, office closures and potential impacts to their benefits due to Musk\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s good for billionaires like him, but it isn\u2019t good for my constituents,\u201d Bynum said. \u201cAnd we have an unelected billionaire trying to cut what we know is an essential program for millions of Americans.\u201d"
