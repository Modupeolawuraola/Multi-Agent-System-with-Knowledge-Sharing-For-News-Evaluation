            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the closing weeks of last year\u2019s presidential campaign, House Speaker Mike Johnson quickly walked back remarks he made while standing alongside a vulnerable Republican member in New York.\n\nJohnson had pledged to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act if Donald Trump became president \u2014 a position he quickly realized was not popular in battleground districts and could hurt his members\u2019 re-election bids.\n\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act is not on the agenda for repeal,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that soon followed his October comments.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nFast-forward to Tuesday, and Trump, now president, made a request of Johnson on camera during a nationally televised speech before a joint session of Congress: Repeal the CHIPS Act.\n\n\u201cYour CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing,\u201d Trump said, weaving at Democrats after noting a Taiwanese semiconductor company\u2019s recently announced an investment in the U.S. \u201cWe give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that was important to them was they didn\u2019t want to pay the tariffs,\u201d Trump continued, before addressing Johnson directly. \u201cYou should get rid of the CHIPS Act. And whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt. Or any other reason you want to.\u201d\n\nWhile Johnson proceeded to stand and clap following Trump\u2019s suggestion, the reception on Wednesday from other Republicans was far icier. Though Republicans were aware of Trump\u2019s opposition to the legislation, senior lawmakers weren\u2019t given a heads up that Trump would make those demands during his joint address, and they have no plans to take up a repeal of the law anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe have too many other items to deal with that are higher on the list,\u201d one top Republican leadership aide said. \u201cI highly doubt this will be addressed in any upcoming package.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a huge appetite for that,\u201d echoed a senior Senate Republican aide.\n\nThe legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. It allocated $280 billion in new funding to boost the domestic production of semiconductors and chips, and to bolster research and development. Funding has been awarded to projects in roughly two dozen states, according to the Commerce Department\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly what he was getting at there,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. \u201cThere are some questions around what that statement meant, but there certainly are ways we ought to be able to take all these restrictions off how the money is being spent. He\u2019s right about that, there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\n\nTrump, as well as some conservatives, have criticized the legislation as offering subsidies for wealthy companies, with the president suggesting that tariffs would be far more effective in getting semiconductor companies to open up shop in the U.S.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Wednesday, Johnson said there is \u201cwork we need to do to address the CHIPS Act,\u201d voicing concerns with the Biden administration\u2019s implementation of the law.\n\nHe added that Republicans will \u201cwait on\u201d Trump\u2019s upcoming budget proposal to \u201csee how he handles\u201d the CHIPS Act before making any decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk and discussion about it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nYet Republican senators who supported the legislation were caught by surprise by Trump\u2019s remarks during his Tuesday address.\n\nSen Todd Young, R-Ind., said Wednesday that they conflicted with assurances he was given by Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees in an effort to secure his vote for their confirmation.\n\n\u201cI have to admit, I was surprised,\u201d Young, the lead Republican on the legislation, told reporters. \u201cHis comments seemed in tension with the reassurances I had received privately and publicly from his now-Cabinet [members], reassurances which I sought in order to be supportive of certain nominees.\u201d\n\nYoung said he\u2019s reached out to the White House after the address.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with them, seeking clarity,\u201d he added. \u201cI remain hopeful and frankly my expectation remains that we will be actively working on them to improve the program, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m looking to the future.\u201d\n\nSeventeen Senate Republicans voted to support the legislation in 2022, though some of those members are no longer senators. In the House, 24 Republicans voted for final passage of the bill.\n\nThe legislation has been largely considered a successful effort to jump-start chip manufacturing in the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to happen,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Wednesday when asked if he would support a repeal of the legislation, which he backed in 2022. \u201cThe origins of that program started back in his administration, and I think what they produced is huge investments made in the United States at TSMC, Samsung, and Micron and other companies, and it\u2019s made it possible now for the president to announce this additional huge investment by TSMC for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a fellow supporter of the legislation, said he would be curious to see what Trump has in mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see what he\u2019s going to replace it with,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally speaking, I want to bring chip manufacturing here, but if he\u2019s got a different way to do it, I\u2019m open-minded.\u201d\n\nA second senior GOP Senate aide said Republicans were unlikely to even be able to repeal the CHIPS Act in the coming weeks, given pressing needs around spending and reconciliation bills.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be time with what we need to do on the floor,\u201d this person said. \u201cCHIPS will be complicated to actually unpack too because it has financial hooks already in the states.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a lead author of the legislation, said in a statement Wednesday that the legislation was supported by members of both parties \u201cbecause we need it to strengthen our national security, stay ahead of China, bolster our supply chains, and bring manufacturing back home from overseas.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are already feeling the positive impacts and new economic energy in their towns in every corner of America, from Ohio to Arizona,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI do not think the president will find much support in Congress for undermining these CHIPS investments and the massive amount of jobs they are creating.\u201d\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said the CHIPS Act was predicated on lessons learned during the first Trump administration \u201cthat when we didn\u2019t have our supply chains here, there were enormous disruptions in things for which there was a global demand and that we didn\u2019t make here, and it jeopardized our national security as well as our health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that was sound policy, that helped us economically, and we should stand behind it,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nThe law was passed under the 60-vote threshold, meaning it\u2019ll require 60 Senate votes to repeal. Republicans hold 53 seats.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing this administration with great regularity flout the Congress. \u2026 We could see some of that in this dimension, too,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting we will. I\u2019m just saying, we\u2019ve already seen that in other arenas.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s backtracking last fall came as he was in the district of a member who was seeing benefits from the legislation, then-Rep. Brandon Williams, R-N.Y., highlighting the potential political backlash for seeking to undo the legislation.\n\nAfter Johnson said Republicans were likely to repeal the CHIPS Act, Williams stood next to him and vowed to \u201cremind\u201d Johnson \u201cnight and day\u201d about the importance of the law.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s an important thing for your district, you need this guy there to make that case,\u201d Johnson replied.\n\nSoon after their public comments wrapped, Johnson released a statement saying the legislation may not be on the chopping block but that \u201cthere could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill \u2014 to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements.\u201d\n\nWilliams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after the event and that the speaker \u201capologized profusely, saying he misheard the question.\u201d\n\nWilliams ultimately lost his House race. In January, Trump nominated him to be the Energy Department\u2019s undersecretary for nuclear security.\n\nCORRECTION (March 6, 2025, 11:52 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the number of House Republicans who voted for final passage of the CHIPS Act. It was 24, not one.\n\nAllan Smith reported from New York; Frank Thorp V, Sahil Kapur and Julie Tsirkin reported from Washington, D.C."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to remove the head of a government watchdog agency while a legal challenge to his firing plays out.\n\nIn a brief, unsigned order issued Wednesday afternoon, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the Trump administration to put on hold a lower-court ruling that said Trump\u2019s firing of Hampton Dellinger was unlawful. That ruling said Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, was entitled to stay at his post.\n\n\u201cThis order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\u201d the appeals court said in its order Wednesday. \u201cAppellants have satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court said it would expedite its review of the lower-court ruling.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Dellinger will appeal the court\u2019s order to the US Supreme Court on an emergency basis. The case has already gone to the high court once before. CNN has reached out to Dellinger\u2019s office for comment.\n\nThe court\u2019s order is the latest dramatic development in Dellinger\u2019s ongoing fight to keep his job after Trump moved to fire him in early February. In an earlier episode of legal wrangling, Dellinger was able to stay on the job while a federal judge in Washington, DC, considered his challenge to his ousting.\n\nIn a major ruling issued last Saturday, that judge \u2013 Amy Berman Jackson \u2013 rejected Trump\u2019s argument that the federal law saying the special counsel can be removed \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIt would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the legal proceedings, Trump asked the Supreme Court to step in on his behalf, but the high court blocked his effort to immediately fire Dellinger \u2013 deciding to wait for lower courts to weigh in on the legality of the dismissal.\n\nDellinger was positioned to be a significant independent official in the government whom federal civil servants could go to as whistleblowers and have some protection from retaliation. Typically a relatively low-profile but important job in the federal workforce, the Office of the Special Counsel is taking on new significance in Trump\u2019s era of removing government employees after considering their political loyalties.\n\nThe OSC is unrelated to special counsels like Jack Smith or Robert Mueller who are appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations.\n\nFollowing Jackson\u2019s ruling, Trump, represented by the Justice Department, quickly pressed the DC Circuit to put the order on hold, arguing that the Constitution \u201cempowers the President to remove sole agency heads, such as the Special Counsel, at will.\u201d\n\nBut attorneys for Dellinger urged the intermediate court to reject the administration\u2019s request and to review the merits of the case in the ordinary course.\n\nThe appeals court, they wrote in a filing, \u201cshould reserve these weighty issues for full deliberation and maintain stability and continuity at OSC in the interim.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz and John Fritze contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Facebook, Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s got to be strange when your sibling becomes an online sensation, like when Australian academic Rachael Gunn (a.k.a. Raygun) rocketed to fame during the Olympics last summer for her less-than-stellar performance in breakdancing \u2014 a viral event that was compounded by the allegation that she rigged the system to get on the Aussie national team ahead of some more qualified candidates.\n\nRaygun may now know how it feels to be on the other side of that dynamic. Months after everybody had moved on from her brave performance in Paris \u2014 and her retirement from competitive breakdancing \u2014 Raygun\u2019s brother is the Gunn sibling everyone in Australia is talking about. On Wednesday, Brendan Gunn was charged with a crypto-related crime by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn, Gunn is a director at Mormarkets Pty Ltd, a firm that takes investors\u2019 cash and turns it into crypto or invests it abroad. In the spring of 2020, regulators say that Gunn \u201cdealt with two bank cheques\u201d worth $181,000 Australian dollars (about $115,000 USD). These \u201ccheques\u201d were allegedly the proceeds of a crime. Despite knowing this, they charged, Gunn kept trying to open bank accounts even though bank officials \u201crepeatedly\u201d informed Gunn that they were concerned about these deposits. If that sounds confusing, Australian news outlets are calling this \u201calleged money laundering\u201d or \u201cmoney reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime.\u201d As it happens, people are also considered innocent until proven guilty in Australia.\n\nGunn does not appear to have entered a plea, and his next court date is expected on April 29. In addition to his work converting cash to crypto (something that is pretty easy for anyone to do with a service), Gunn also describes himself as a \u201chuman-centric\u201d recruiter who \u201cdiscovers the \u2018who\u2019\n\nfor exceptional teams.\u201d After his sister\u2019s brush with controversy, he held strong in his support. \u201cYou will always be a winner to me,\u201d Gunn wrote on X."

Plus, Andrea Mitchell dives into what\u2019s next for Ukraine and its European allies as the United States continues to scale back assistance.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nWhy Trump isn't hitting the road after his speech\n\nA go-to move for presidents who\u2019ve just delivered prime-time speeches before joint sessions of Congress is to quickly travel outside of Washington to start selling the glut of proposals they\u2019ve laid out before the biggest televised audiences they might attract all year.\n\nDonald Trump did just that as a new president eight years ago, but this time he appears to be staying put, Peter Nicholas, Olympia Sonnier and Yamiche Alcindor report.\n\nComing off his address Tuesday night, Trump had no post-speech travel in the offing, a senior administration official said. He remained at the White House on Wednesday, meeting with members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to discuss government funding.\n\nNo place like home: Trump has kept presidential travel to a minimum in his second term.\n\nApart from a whirlwind two-day trip that included stops in North Carolina, California and Nevada in the first week of his new term and a stop in New Orleans last month for the Super Bowl, Trump\u2019s only travel outside Washington has been to South Florida, where he has a home and ready access to his golf clubs.\n\nThe reason appears to be twofold. One, Trump has long been a bit of a homebody, relishing the gilded comforts of his Palm Beach and northern New Jersey resorts, along with his namesake Manhattan tower.\n\n\u201cHe likes sleeping in his own bed,\u201d a White House official in Trump\u2019s first term said in an interview. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like hotels. He was more than happy to give a speech somewhere as long as he could fly out the same day and sleep in his own bed.\u201d\n\nTwo, in terms of raw politics, Trump\u2019s name won\u2019t be on the ballot again, meaning there\u2019s no compelling need to blanket the swing states. A person involved in Trump\u2019s political operation said the next time he has to travel for political reasons \u201cwill be for the midterms to sell candidates.\u201d\n\nDelegating tasks: Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance has been eager to hit the road, visiting the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas, today.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nAs the U.S. rolls more assistance back, Ukraine scrambles on next steps\n\nBy Andrea Mitchell\n\nYou rarely, if ever, see a CIA director reveal on national television that the United States is stopping intelligence-sharing with a wartime ally, on top of halting weapons shipments, as John Ratcliffe did today on Fox Business.\n\nThe message to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: There are consequences for not obeying the will of the American president. European NATO partners are scrambling to backfill for what the United States isn\u2019t providing, but they don\u2019t have the air defenses or intelligence assets that only the United States can offer.\n\nNow, French President Emmanuel Macron is proposing a partial ceasefire. Zelenskyy is doing verbal backflips, repeatedly apologizing for challenging President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. And Trump signaled in his speech to Congress that he might be open to resume negotiations with Ukraine while declaring he has received \u201cstrong signals the Russians are ready for peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be beautiful?\u201d he added.\n\nIndeed, if Russian leader Vladimir Putin were ready for peace, other than on his terms, it would be \u201cbeautiful.\u201d But there is no U.S. intelligence assessment or evidence from the tempo of Russian attacks against Ukraine indicating that\u2019s true.\n\nStill, even some of Ukraine\u2019s strongest European supporters tell me they wish Zelenskyy had found a way to be more diplomatic and flatter Trump last week. Although they understand that the leader of a besieged nation can\u2019t easily ignore that 20,000 Ukrainian children have been kidnapped by Russia and given new names and identities when he hears Trump extol Putin as a partner in peace.\n\nFor decades, U.S. presidents of both parties have supported NATO as a multilateral bulwark against the former Soviet Union and now Russia. This administration\u2019s sudden reversal of that bipartisan foreign policy is shocking enough. But since Friday\u2019s Oval Office showdown with Zelenskyy, the transformation of lifelong cold warriors is truly head-spinning.\n\nA few stalwarts are beginning to speak up. Asked last night about the halt in U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said: \u201cLook, if I am Putin, I\u2019m loving a pause, I\u2019m plussing up troops at the border, I\u2019m trying to get more drones from Iran, I\u2019m trying to get more crap from North Korea, I\u2019m getting the illicit money coming from China, and I\u2019m loving a pause and I\u2019m loving a cessation of a resupply to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Tillis\u2019 message to the administration?\n\nHe said, \u201cPutin\u2019s a liar and a murderer. Let\u2019s get it right with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPoll result\n\nYesterday, we asked you how long you thought Trump\u2019s speech to Congress would last. The most common answer was 90 minutes \u2014 not far off from the roughly 100 minutes he ended up going for.\n\nTrump set a record for the longest speech to a joint session of Congress or State of the Union address, besting Bill Clinton, who spoke for nearly 89 minutes in 2000, according to the University of California-Santa Barbara\u2019s American Presidency Project.\n\nThat\u2019s all From the Politics Desk for now.

            "full_content": "Photo: Kenny Holston/The New York Times/Redux\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there: You spend time carefully putting together a surprise gift for a loved one, but when they open it up, you can tell they don\u2019t really love it. That\u2019s basically what happened to Attorney General Pam Bondi last week \u2014 but in this case, the recipient was the Trump White House and MAGA conspiracy theorists, and the present was previously released information on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, repackaged into a binder.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s new attorney general managed to anger people across the political spectrum last week when she teased the release of new files related to the Epstein investigation on Fox News, only to hand out binders full of previously released documents to far-right influencers, including Mike Cernovich, Liz Wheeler, Jack Posobiec, Rogan O\u2019Handley (a.k.a. DC Draino), and Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik.\n\nSo what was Bondi thinking? On Tuesday, ABC News reported that neither the dozen-plus MAGA influencers nor the senior White House officials who organized the February 27 event were informed of Bondi\u2019s plans to distribute the Epstein files, as she thought it would be a welcome surprise:\n\nAhead of the Justice Department\u2019s public release, Bondi directed her staff to compile binders of the materials to distribute to the influencers at the event, sources said. She also instructed her team not to inform White House officials of the plan, according to multiple sources, apparently thinking the surprise would be well received inside the West Wing.\n\nThe White House had organized the event a week earlier to engage influential pro-Trump voices who the president credits with aiding his 2024 campaign. According to multiple sources, the agenda never included distributing Epstein-related materials.\n\nIt seems the viral images of the influencers brandishing the binders \u2014 which were marked \u201cDeclassified,\u201d though they did not contain official government declassification markings \u2014 were not part of her plan. Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel unexpectedly handed out the documents at the meeting, then press cameras that were set up to cover British prime minister Keir Starmer\u2019s visit happened to capture the influencers leaving the White House.\n\nTrump does love made-for-TV theatrics, but usually he\u2019s the one berating a foreign leader or holding the map-doctoring Sharpie. ABC reports that the incident left White House officials scrambling to smooth things over with some of the president\u2019s most loyal supporters (though Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that):\n\nWhite House staff moved quickly to try and contain the fallout, privately reaching out to influencers who were critical of Bondi and the move online, according to sources.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, responding to a request for comment from ABC News, said, \u201cEveryone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump. Any notion to the contrary is completely false.\u201d\n\nEither way, it doesn\u2019t seem as though Trump himself is too angry about the botched stunt. He gave Bondi and Patel a shout-out during his address to Congress on Tuesday, as he claimed that \u201cour justice system has been turned upside down by radical-left lunatics\u201d and gestured at Democrats in the room.\n\nAnd Bondi has managed to deflect some of the blame onto the FBI\u2019s New York office. After the binders stunt flopped, she accused the office of withholding information about the Epstein investigation without providing evidence to back up that claim. The head of the office, James Dennehy, was forced to submit his resignation the following day. Dennehy said he \u201cwas not given a reason for this decision.\u201d But in addition to clashing with Bondi over the Epstein files, he had angered the Trump administration by publicly supporting bureau leaders who resisted pressure to turn over the names of people who investigated the Capitol riot.\n\nIn a Monday interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Bondi claimed that the FBI has now turned over a \u201ctruckload\u201d of Epstein files, which the bureau is reviewing \u201cas fast as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new administration, and everything\u2019s going to come out to the public. The public has the right to know. Americans have a right to know.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: Attorney General Pam Bondi says a \"truckload\" of Jeffrey Epstein files arrived on Friday, says FBI Director Kash Patel is looking through them now.\n\n\n\n\"We got them all Friday at 8AM. Thousands of pages of documents. I have the FBI going through them.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's now in the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rxABwmO5p2 \u2014 Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) March 4, 2025\n\nSo while Bondi\u2019s big surprise may have flopped, all\u2019s well that ends well. It looks as if she isn\u2019t facing any serious consequences, a well-respected FBI official who annoyed the Trump administration has been let go for unclear reasons, and the search for the (possibly nonexistent) Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d continues."

            "full_content": "Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nSince taking office, Donald Trump and his administration have embarked on an unsparing quest to reduce government spending by making substantial cuts to federal agencies across all sectors. Their efforts have resulted in slashed departmental contracts and programs, as well as mass layoffs of federal workers, in exchange for a questionable amount of savings.\n\nThough the cuts have prompted pushback and legal challenges, the president\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency agenda shows no signs of abating and the administration stands poised to institute further cuts to another crucial agency. The Associated Press reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs intends to eliminate at least 80,000 jobs as part of a restructuring of the agency, which provides health care and other benefits and services to American veterans.\n\nIn an internal memo, VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek outlined goals to return the department to its 2019 staffing levels to \u201cresize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.\u201d According to the outlet Government Executive, which first reported on the memo, the VA currently employs 482,000 staffers and would have to eliminate 83,000 jobs to reach its 2019 level of 399,000 workers. Syrek urged agency officials to work alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE in these efforts and to \u201cmove out aggressively while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach.\u201d\n\nIf implemented, the substantial cuts will impact veterans not just as care recipients but also as employees. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, veterans make up about 30 percent of the federal workforce. Democratic members of the House Appropriations Committee estimate that Musk and Trump\u2019s DOGE initiative has resulted in the firing of nearly 6,000 veterans from the overall civilian federal workforce as of late February. Several congressional Democrats sought to highlight this fact on Tuesday by inviting federal workers, many of them veterans, who were fired as a result of the administration\u2019s cuts to attend Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress as their guests.\n\nLast week, Trump was asked about the firings impacting veteran workers during a press conference with Keir Starmer, the prime minister of the United Kingdom. The president said he was aware that veterans had been caught up in the layoffs but gave no signal that a change in approach was coming. \u201cWe\u2019re watching that very carefully, and we hope it\u2019s going to be as small a number as possible. But we are having great success in slimming down our government,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump continued, \u201cWe love our veterans. We\u2019re gonna take good care of them.\u201d"

The second point was a reference to Canada\u2019s housing crisis, in which housing costs skyrocketed and banks began offering absurdly long mortgages under Trudeau\u2019s policies. The Conservatives believe an important part of the answer lies in cutting red tape to increase new home construction.\n\nWATCH \u2014 Trump on Negotiations with Trudeau: We Don\u2019t Need Canada \u201cfor Anything\u201d:\n\nPoilievre largely dismissed President Trump\u2019s complaints about Canada\u2019s weak border security and fentanyl smuggling, although he conceded that Trudeau\u2019s Liberals \u201chave not done enough on fentanyl,\u201d which is killing huge numbers of Canadians as well as Americans.\n\nPoilievre said Trump \u201cstabbed America\u2019s best friend in the back\u201d with his tariffs.\n\n\u201cMy message to the president is this: Canada will fight back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will defend our people and our economy, and we will put Canada first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that our economy will suffer,\u201d Poilievre conceded. \u201cBut so will yours, President Trump. In fact, you\u2019re already paying the price with trillions of dollars erased in stock market value over the last month of these threats.\u201d\n\nWATCH \u2014 Oh, Canada\u2026 Trump Threatens Canada\u2019s Leadership With Increased Tariff\u2019s for \u201cAbuse\u201d of USA:\n\n\u201cAlready, Americans are paying higher gas prices as, at midnight, a new American gas tax kicked in on U.S. working-class taxpayers and motorists,\u201d he said.\n\nPoilievre predicted that American workers would lose their jobs as they lost access to Canadian raw materials they were \u201cgetting at an incredible and ridiculous bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your businesses will be selling fewer products to your closest neighbor \u2014 and that\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d he warned.\n\nPoilievre said Canadians are \u201cslow to anger and quick to forgive,\u201d but Trump\u2019s tariffs have \u201cprovoked\u201d them to fight back.\u201d\n\nAddressing the \u201cmillions of Canadians who are anxious today\u201d after Trump \u201cattacked\u201d the Canadian economy, the Conservative opposition leader promised to fight for their jobs, families, and \u201cchance at owning and paying off a home\u201d \u2014 a dig at Trudeau and his liberals, on a Conservative signature issue, slipped into a speech largely directed at Trump.\n\n\u201cI will fight to put Canada first,\u201d he promised.\n\nPoilievre\u2019s feisty attitude could be partly due to polls that show the Liberals coming back after a disastrous year in which they ran 20 points behind the Conservatives and seemed in real danger of slipping into third place behind the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP).\n\nSome of this polling surge could be due to voters deciding they disliked Trudeau much more than they disapproved of his party, so with the unpopular prime minister on his way out, the Liberals recaptured some lost ground.\n\nSome political analysts in both Canada and the U.S. are convinced Trump\u2019s tariff threats also played a role in jolting the Liberals back to life. Canadians are said to be furious at Trump, and with Trudeau gone, they appear willing to take a second look at the Liberals as the party more likely to fight back against Trump with both passion and effectiveness.\n\n\u201cPeople who have followed Canadian politics for a long time can\u2019t think of an instance where we\u2019ve seen a shift in vote intention that\u2019s as rapid and as significant as what the polls are currently showing,\u201d University of Calgary political science professor told the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nPoilievre\u2019s remarks on Monday and Tuesday were clearly calibrated to reassure Canadian voters he is ready and willing to fight back against Trump, and also to remind voters that the Liberals left Canada in a weak position for that fight.\n\nPoilievre finds himself competing against Liberal leaders whose task is to convince voters they can handle Trump far better than the exhausted pipsqueak who will shortly vacate the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 unless the reinvigorated and suddenly tough-talking Trudeau decides his hour has not passed after all.\n\nTrump raised that possibility in a social media post Wednesday after a phone call with Trudeau he described as \u201csomewhat friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place, which made me curious, like, what\u2019s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!\u201d Trump wrote."

Whatever happens, we need to provide ourselves with more arms, more equipment in terms of defense, to provide a dissuasive force.\"\n\nMacron warned that Ukraine cannot be abandoned in its fight against Russia because, he said: \"Who can believe that in this context, Russia will stop at Ukraine? Russia has become, and will remain, a threat to France and Europe.\u201d\n\nThe French president made clear that France and other European countries must take concrete steps, including investing in defense and military capabilities, to protect the security of their nations and Ukraine's.\n\n\u201cTo remain a spectator in this dangerous world would be crazy,\" Macron said. \"The initiatives for peace are going in the right direction, and I welcome them, and we need to continue to help Ukrainians resist until they can negotiate with Russia a solid and lasting peace for themselves and for all of us. The path to peace cannot be achieved by abandoning Ukraine.\"\n\nMacron reiterated remarks made by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the weekend at a defense summit in London that Europe may have to put boots on the ground in Ukraine.\n\n\"Our forces will be there if necessary to guarantee peace, not before a peace agreement is signed,\" Macron said Wednesday. \"We will continue to meet with allies to move toward the signing of such an agreement. It's a plan for a lasting, solid, verifiable peace agreement, which we're working on with European partners and Ukraine.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X that he was grateful for Macron's \"clear vision and our joint efforts to achieve peace.\"\n\n\"Peace must be real, not just a word\u2014it cannot mean Ukraine\u2019s capitulation or collapse. It must be just, reliable, and lasting, and this can only be achieved through strong and long-term security guarantees \u2014 for Ukraine, Europe, and the entire world,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nMacron and Starmer have teamed up in a desperate attempt to heal American-Ukraine ties after last Friday\u2019s extraordinary shouting match at the White House involving Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Both Starmer and Macron have sought to balance their yearslong outspoken support for Zelenskyy with the need to retain good relations with the United States.\n\nTeeing up his speech, Macron said on X that it came in a \u201cmoment of great uncertainty, when the world is facing its greatest challenges.\u201d Starmer told British lawmakers Wednesday that he had spoken with Trump three times since he visited the White House last week.\n\nThis Anglo-French mission has at times appeared onerous.\n\nAfter the Oval Office spat, Trump continued to berate Zelenskyy on social media, with the president and some of his team suggesting that Ukraine\u2019s leader could or should be ousted from office. The administration then paused aid to Ukraine, a vital lifeline holding back the Kremlin war machine.\n\nThe aid freeze is a serious blow not just to Ukraine, whose biggest military backer is the U.S., but also Europe, which is years away from being able to defend itself against Russia without Washington.\n\nThings shifted Tuesday when Trump said during his joint address to Congress that he had received \u201can important letter\u201d from Zelenskyy stating the Ukrainian president's desire for peace and his gratitude for U.S. support.\n\nZelenskyy confirmed the thrust of this missive in an X post on Tuesday, calling the White House clash \u201cregrettable,\u201d thanking Trump\u2019s team and saying he was ready to sign a deal giving Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s rich mineral wealth.\n\nStill, there is much to resolve.\n\nUkraine is reluctant to sign a ceasefire without \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d \u2014 meaning protection from Europe and the U.S. against Russia violating the truce, as it has done before.\n\nSupporters and independent analysts worry that a ceasefire would allow Russia to regroup \u2014 as well as showing Russian President Vladimir Putin that attacking a European country is not only permitted, but rewarded.\n\nZelenskyy once stood firm in demanding these security guarantees. But now facing pressure from Moscow and Washington, he suggested on X that he would accept a minerals deal that was merely a looser \u201cstep toward\u201d such promises."

            "full_content": "Photo: Win McNamee/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress on Tuesday night felt familiar, though it was delivered in a much different venue. In a tone reminiscent of a campaign speech, the president boasted about his accomplishments and claimed to have a strong mandate from the American people, prompting raucous cheers and frequent standing ovations from Republican members. But unlike at a Trump rally, the audience was also filled with disapproving Democrats. And things took a turn early on as Representative Al Green, a Texas Democrat, stood and disrupted Trump\u2019s speech, shouting, \u201cYou have no mandate to cut Medicaid!\u201d\n\nAfter multiple warnings, House Speaker Mike Johnson directed the Sergeant of Arms to remove Green from the House chamber to the sounds of cheers and some Republicans singing, \u201cHey, hey, hey, good-bye.\u201d\n\n.@RepAlGreen (D-TX) is removed from the Joint Session of Congress. pic.twitter.com/GJVHJpZHGc \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) March 5, 2025\n\nDuring his time in Congress, Green has challenged Trump many times. He filed the first articles of impeachment against Trump back in 2017 following the firing of FBI director James Comey, despite a lack of support from many in his party at the time. He went on to file two more attempts at impeachment. Green told reporters outside the chamber that he spoke out in defense of programs like Medicare and Medicaid that are at risk for cuts under Trump\u2019s administration and that he\u2019s ready to accept any repercussions from his actions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll accept the punishment. It\u2019s worth it to let people know that there\u2019s some of us who are going to stand up against this president\u2019s desire to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security,\u201d he said.\n\n.@RepAlGreen after being removed from Joint Session of Congress: \"I'll accept the punishment.

In an interview with Fox News following Trump\u2019s speech, Johnson expressed support for censuring Green for his disruption, calling his actions \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect that there\u2019ll be a censure resolution brought on the floor to discipline him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do that inside the House. We have to maintain decorum.\u201d\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus indicated Wednesday morning that it would be filing a censure motion against Green later in the day. Representatives Troy Nehls and Dan Newhouse intend to introduce their own separate motions against Green. The internal disciplinary sanction requires a majority vote from the full House of Representatives, which the Republican Party currently holds by a slim margin. If passed, Green would be only the fifth House member to be censured since 2010."

No cause of death was provided.\n\n\u201cThroughout his career, he was known for his bipartisan leadership, dedication to his constituents, and unwavering commitment to improving the lives of all Houstonians,\u201d the office said.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership informed members of Turner\u2019s death during a meeting Wednesday morning, according to a source in the room.\n\nLater in the day, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Democratic colleagues held a moment of silence at an afternoon event in honor of Turner, calling his passing tragic and unexpected. The Democratic leader remembered Turner as a \u201cpowerful, profound principled public servant.\u201d\n\nTurner was sworn into Congress in January after serving eight years as the mayor of Texas\u2019 biggest city. Before that, he also spent 27 years in the Texas House where he was a powerhouse on the state\u2019s appropriations panel.\n\n\u201cA remarkable public servant who impacted millions of people. He rose from poverty but never forgot where he came from. It is a terrible loss for the city and a personal loss for me,\u201d Houston Mayor John Whitmire said of Turner in a statement posted by the City of Houston.\n\nTurner came out of retirement to succeed the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who was her own force in Texas politics during her two decades in the US House.\n\nTurner was the preferred pick by Jackson Lee\u2019s children in the competitive primary to replace her after her death in July 2024. He vowed to, like Jackson Lee, devote his time to securing federal resources for the sprawling district.\n\nThe 70-year-old said in 2022 that he had been treated for bone cancer but declared himself \u201ccancer free\u201d in an interview with the Texas Tribune later that year.\n\nHis death came as a shock for his fellow congressional Democrats, who had sat with him at the president\u2019s joint address Tuesday evening. He attended the speech with his guest, a Houston resident and mother whose 2-year-old daughter has a rare genetic condition and relies on Medicaid to survive.\n\nIn recent months, Turner had been outspoken \u2014 and in his words, \u201chopeful\u201d \u2014 about how Democrats can rebound from the GOP\u2019s electoral win in November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic simply because I know what we are made of,\u201d Turner told a crowd at the Houston Black American Democrats last month. \u201cThe only way that we lose is that we fail to use what we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful. I did not come with a head bowed. I know the president is in office. A lot of things he has done. But I\u2019m optimistic. I\u2019m positive. I don\u2019t have a hard time going to bed at night.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Among the many problems that have emerged in federal law enforcement over the last six weeks is the campaign against key personnel. Indeed, there\u2019s been an unsubtle campaign to purge federal law enforcement of prosecutors and FBI officials who worked on cases that Donald Trump didn\u2019t like.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi suggested this week that these efforts are ongoing \u2014 and likely to get worse. USA Today reported:\n\nThe Justice Department has fired all of Jan. 6 special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s staff and is working to \u2018root out\u2019 anyone at the department and FBI who it believes doesn\u2019t like President Donald Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi has confirmed. ... Over eight minutes, she described a scorched-earth effort currently underway to purge the 115,000-employee Justice Department of any staffers involved in investigating Trump during or after his first term in office and other perceived enemies of the president.\n\n\u201cWell, first and foremost, we got rid of the Jack Smith team. Gone. Those people are gone,\u201d the increasingly hyper-partisan attorney general said. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to find ... a lot of people in the FBI and also in the Department of Justice who despise Donald Trump, despise us, don\u2019t want to be there.\u201d\n\nBondi added, \u201c[W]e\u2019re going to root them out. We will find them, and they will no longer be employed.\u201d\n\nJust so we\u2019re all clear, the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official isn\u2019t talking about identifying Justice Department employees who are necessarily bad at their jobs. Rather, Bondi appeared to describe a process in which law enforcement personnel who disagree with Trump will be hunted down and kicked out of the department.\n\nWhen it comes to matters of law and politics, I tend not to agree with National Review\u2019s Ed Whelan on much, but the conservative lawyer\u2019s take on the attorney general\u2019s comments rang true.\n\n\u201cCareer DOJ lawyers who do their jobs (most of which have nothing to do with politics) should not be rooted out because they \u2018despise\u2019 the president,\u201d Whelan explained online. \u201cThat\u2019s true of those who despised Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Biden just as it\u2019s true of those who despise Trump. It\u2019s very bad that AG Bondi either doesn\u2019t understand this or needs to pretend she doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDuring his tenure as attorney general, Merrick Garland went to extraordinary lengths to avoid appearing partisan or political in any way, often to the frustration of Democratic lawmakers and the party\u2019s base. Garland had seen what had transpired during Trump\u2019s first term, and by all accounts, he was determined to restore integrity to the office.\n\nThe idea that he\u2019d go on national television and vow to \u201croot out\u201d conservative critics of the Democratic White House at the Justice Department is ridiculous.\n\nAnd yet, here we are, watching his successor infuse her office with partisan politics at a breathtaking pace.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage."

            "full_content": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nEven as he was delivering the most partisan address to Congress maybe ever, Donald Trump\u2019s public support seemed to be regularly eroding. An updated FiveThirtyEight average of Trump\u2019s approval ratings on March 4 showed him going underwater for the first time since reoccupying the White House, with 47.6 percent approval and 47.9 percent disapproval. That puts Trump back in the same territory of public opinion he occupied during his first term as president, where (per Gallup) he never achieved more than 50 percent job approval, and averaged a mere 41 percent.\n\nPerhaps Trump will get lucky and conditions in the country will improve enough to validate his agenda, but it\u2019s more likely that the same sour public climate that overwhelmed Joe Biden will now afflict his predecessor and successor.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos survey that pushed Trump\u2019s numbers into negative territory showed a mood very different from the 47th president\u2019s boasts about a new \u201cgolden age\u201d for our country:\n\nThirty-four percent of Americans say that the country is headed in the right direction, compared to 49% who say it is off on the wrong track. When it comes to several specific issues, Americans are more likely to say things are off on the wrong track than going in the right direction: cost of living (22% right direction / 60% wrong track), the national economy (31% right direction / 51% wrong track), national politics (33% right direction / 50% wrong track), American foreign policy (33% right direction / 49% wrong track), and employment and jobs (33% right direction / 47% wrong track).\n\nSo all the hype about Trump being a popular president who was in the midst of engineering a major realignment of the American electorate is already looking more than a bit hollow. Trump has a solid Republican base of support and a solid Democratic opposition, with independents currently leaning towards the Democratic Party on most issues. Perhaps Trump\u2019s agenda will gain momentum and support, but since he\u2019s not trying to reach out beyond his party\u2019s base at all, he\u2019s going to need a lift from Americans who only voted for him in 2024 as the lesser of evils and may not vote in the 2026 midterms at all.\n\nAt present Trump has lost whatever presidential \u201choneymoon\u201d he initially enjoyed after his return to the White House, and needs to find new converts to return to genuine popularity. He\u2019s not off to a great start."

Self-aggrandizement of its jurisdiction is not one of them.\u201d\n\nWhile the ruling was 5-4, it was \u201cextremely modest,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\n\u201cThe unsigned order does not actually require the Trump administration to immediately make up to $2 billion in foreign aid payments; it merely clears the way for the district court to compel those payments, presumably if it is more specific about the contracts that have to be honored,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cThe fact that four justices nevertheless dissented \u2013 vigorously \u2013 from such a decision is a sign that the Court is going to be divided, perhaps along these exact lines, in many of the more impactful Trump-related cases that are already on their way.\u201d\n\nThe appeal raced to the high court within days \u2013 exceedingly fast by the federal judiciary\u2019s standards. It is the second case to reach the justices dealing with Trump\u2019s moves to consolidate power within the executive branch and dramatically reshape the government after taking power in January.\n\nAt the center of the case is billions in foreign aid from the State Department and the US Agency for International Development that Trump froze in January as he sought to clamp down spending and bring those agencies in line with his agenda. Several nonprofit groups that rely on the funding for global health and other programs sued, asserting that the administration\u2019s moves usurped the power of Congress to control government spending and violated a federal law that dictates how agencies make decisions.\n\nIn a brief on Friday, the groups described the administration\u2019s actions as having a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact.\n\nThey told the court that the funding \u201cadvances US interests abroad and improves \u2013 and, in many cases, literally saves \u2013 the lives of millions of people across the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn doing so, it helps stop problems like disease and instability overseas before they reach our shores,\u201d the groups said.\n\nUS District Judge Amir Ali on February 13 ordered that much of the money continue to flow on a temporary basis while he reviewed the case. Days later, the plaintiffs argued that the administration was defying that order and continuing to block the spending and Ali then ordered the Trump administration to spend the money at issue by midnight Wednesday.\n\nAli was named to the bench by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Trump administration rushed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court hours before that deadline, urging the court to at least pause it for a few days. The administration is making \u201csubstantial efforts\u201d to review payment requests and spend the money, the government agued, but it couldn\u2019t turn the spigot on fast enough to meet the Ali\u2019s timeline.\n\nThe groups that sued have balked at that explanation, arguing that a small number of political appointees within the administration \u201care refusing to authorize essentially any payments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has not taken \u2018any meaningful steps\u2019 to come into compliance,\u201d the groups said a Supreme Court filing earlier Friday.\n\nRoberts, acting alone, gave the administration a brief reprieve on Wednesday, issuing what\u2019s known as an \u201cadministrative stay\u201d that pushed pause on the case so that both sides could submit written arguments. The chief justice handles emergency cases rising from the federal appeals court in Washington, DC.\n\nAmong the groups challenging the freeze are the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, a New York-based organization working to speed HIV prevention and the Global Health Council, based in Washington, DC, which represents other groups that administer health programs.\n\nThe Trump administration revealed in court filings in the case that it is attempting to terminate more than 90% of the USAID foreign aid awards.\n\n\u201cIn total, nearly 5,800 USAID awards were terminated, and more than 500 USAID awards were retained,\u201d a filing from the administration said.\n\n\u201cThe total ceiling value of the retained awards is approximately $57 billion,\u201d the filing said.\n\nIn addition to the USAID award terminations, \u201capproximately 4,100 State awards were terminated, and approximately 2,700 State awards were retained,\u201d the government told a lower court, referring to the State Department.\n\nAid programs around the world have ground to a halt due to the sweeping funding freeze and review of billions of dollars of assistance. It also comes as the Trump administration has either placed the majority of USAID\u2019s workforce on leave or terminated them.\n\nDemocrats celebrate ruling\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats said the ruling shows that Trump\u2019s power to freeze spending is not unlimited.\n\n\u201cThat money had already been appropriated, things were already in action, and so I think the Supreme Court ruled the right way, and now the administration needs to unfreeze them and allow those contractors and the work to be done,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Commitee.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal called it \u201ca very important ruling\u201d from \u201ca Trump-dominated court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it reinforces \u2026 that Congress has authorization to appropriate money, and that people rely on that authorization for those programs, and that when you do the work, you should get paid when it\u2019s been authorized,\u201d the Washington state Democrat told CNN.\n\nAsked if she\u2019s confident the payments will be turned on, Jayapal said she\u2019s not confident about anything, \u201cbut I hope that the Trump administration will pay attention to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler and Devan Cole contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration appears to have ordered at least a partial halt to the crucial intelligence that the United States shares with Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion, according to a US military official and public remarks made by top Trump administration officials.\n\nStatements from national security adviser Mike Waltz and CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Wednesday morning indicated that a pause in intelligence sharing is in place but the extent of the limitations was not clear. Both officials also suggested that the pause may be short-lived if the president can be satisfied that Ukraine has taken steps towards negotiations to end the war \u2013 a controversial effort that appeared to be derailed after Friday\u2019s fiery Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWe are pausing, assessing, looking at everything across our security relationship,\u201d national security adviser Mike Waltz told CBS News, asked directly about intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. The Trump administration had already announced a freeze in weapons deliveries to Ukraine, part of the White House effort to attempt to pressure Kyiv into a swift end to a war it didn\u2019t start.\n\nStill, Waltz told reporters after the interview that he spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart over the phone this morning, and he projected optimism on the state of talks since Zelensky issued a statement yesterday saying that he is ready to negotiate peace.\n\n\u201cWe are having good talks on location for the next round of negotiations, on delegations, on substance. So, just in the last 24 hours since the public statement from Zelensky, and then the subsequent conversations, which I\u2019m going to walk inside and continue, I think we\u2019re going to see movement in very short order,\u201d Waltz said.\n\nZelensky\u2019s top aide Andriy Yermak said later Wednesday that Ukrainian and US officials have agreed to meet \u201cin the near future,\u201d following the phone call with Waltz.\n\nYermak, who is Zelensky\u2019s chief of staff, said he and Waltz \u201cdiscussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace\u201d during the call.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe in an interview on Fox Business on Wednesday also suggested that the pause on intelligence sharing may soon be ended.\n\n\u201cYou saw the response that President Zelensky put out,\u201d Ratcliffe said, referring to recent statements from the Ukrainian president that the country was ready to negotiate. \u201cSo I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away.\u201d\n\nIf the freeze is total and sustained, multiple sources familiar with the information shared with Ukraine over the past three years of war said, it could deal a devastating blow to Kyiv\u2019s ability to fight on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad,\u201d one source familiar with the arrangement said. \u201cCombined with the stopping of military assistance and foreign aid, it pretty much guarantees a Russian victory without there needing to be a peace deal.\u201d\n\nA top Russian lawmaker, Andrei Kartapolov, in recent days called for the US to stop providing Ukraine with intelligence, underscoring the boon Trump may have already offered Moscow on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cIt would be much more important if the Americans stopped giving them with intelligence information, then this would allow us to achieve results more quickly,\u201d Kartapolov said.\n\nSince the early days of the conflict, the US has provided extensive information on Russian force movements and locations, as well as intercepted communications about their military plans and the movement of their spies \u2013 intelligence that officials say has been as important as any American weapon system to both Ukraine\u2019s ability to protect its cities and push back on Moscow on the battlefield.\n\nWhen Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2022, the source familiar with the sharing said, Russia was planning an airborne operation to seize key facilities in Kyiv that could have allowed them to sack the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine was able to successfully derail the operation because of intelligence that the US shared.\n\nIn the lead up to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Ratcliffe and the transition team were told of the value of intelligence sharing with Ukraine by US officials who stressed that it was a hallmark of their achievements on the battlefield, according to another source familiar with those discussions.\n\nOne US military official said that the US is now offering fewer surveillance flights to the Ukrainians, as well as less satellite coverage \u2013 both of which are essential to Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend its cities against Russian missile attacks.\n\nBut underscoring the fluid nature of the situation, as recently as Tuesday, another US military official in the region said that American military contact with the Ukrainians, including some intelligence sharing, was continuing.\n\nA key concern for Ukraine is whether the administration \u2014 or Trump\u2019s ally, Elon Musk \u2014 will allow the satellite internet system Starlink to continue operating. That system has been a critical component to the Ukrainian military response that has allowed its forces to communicate on the battlefield.\n\nFor some US officials, the decision to limit intelligence sharing with Ukraine not only helps Russia \u2014 it is tantamount to a betrayal of Ukraine. The CIA has worked closely with Ukrainian special operations forces since 2014, when Russia first took action to seize control of Ukraine, supporting a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and annexing Crimea.\n\nIn the early days of the 2022 conflict, prominent Republicans \u2014 including now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 complained that the Biden administration wasn\u2019t sharing intelligence with the Ukrainian military quickly enough.\n\nNow, many US military and intelligence officers \u201cfeel we are abandoning our allies on the battlefield,\u201d said one former intelligence official who remains in contact with old colleagues.\n\nCNN\u2019s Matthew Chance contributed reporting.\n\nThis story and its headline have been updated with additional reporting."

            "full_content": "The biggest reason President Donald Trump won the White House again was dissatisfaction with the economy under Joe Biden. Specifically, the public\u2019s frustration over a spike in inflation, which, even after it cooled, appeared to leave widespread, lingering resentment over the cost of everyday items at the grocery store and elsewhere. Trump has now enacted an extraordinary tariffs regime that will, by design, cause a spike in many of those items.\n\nTrump\u2019s 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Canada and Mexico and 20% tariffs on goods from China mean that around 40% of the items imported into the United States will be subject to a border tax. Those tariffs will, economists explain, almost inevitably be passed on to consumers as higher prices, just as they were after Trump\u2019s far more targeted tariffs in 2018.\n\nWill Trump's base buy his inevitable lies that he\u2019s not to blame for the pinch on their wallet?\n\nCompanies that make canned goods are warning about higher prices since most steel for making cans is imported. Craft beer companies generally don\u2019t have the ability to lower costs to mitigate the higher price of cans, so they will almost certainly raise prices to deal with higher costs. A lot of popular fruit, such as avocados, tomatoes and strawberries, is imported from Mexico and will be hit with tariffs. The most popular beer in America, Modelo, is a Mexican import.\n\nBeyond grocery store items, tariffs could exacerbate the affordable housing crisis by making the lumber imported from Canada more expensive.\n\nMany companies perceived as purely domestic manufacturers who would seemingly benefit from a penalty on foreign competition will nonetheless take a blow because of supply chain norms. Consider, for example, that U.S. auto manufacturers rely on car parts from Canada and Mexico and are going to see a huge spike in costs. \u201cLet\u2019s be real honest: Long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors in February.\n\nJared Bernstein, the former chair of Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, estimated in a January column for MSNBC that \u201c25% tariffs on all imports out of Canada and Mexico and 10% on China would cost the average household $1,500-$2,000.\u201d (Since then, Trump has doubled the tariff rate on Chinese imports.)\n\nGlobal markets plunged after the tariffs went into effect Tuesday, and Canada, Mexico and China have announced their own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, setting in motion a trade war within an extremely interdependent sphere of the global economy. Economic analysts are warning that the drag caused by a tax on over a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of imports is likely to help push the U.S. economy into a recession. As businesses try to navigate an uncertain economic environment with rising costs, hiring is likely to slow down, which in turn is likely to reduce consumer spending and deal a significant blow to economic growth.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of tariffs is not only far more sweeping than anything he did during his first term; it\u2019s the most sweeping use of tariffs by the U.S. government in about a century. The coming economic pain raises political questions: What will happen to Trump\u2019s reputation as an effective steward of the economy as tariffs cause prices to soar and possibly induce a recession? Will business elites who have warmed to him finally experience buyer\u2019s remorse? Will Trump's base buy his inevitable lies that he\u2019s not to blame for the pinch on their wallet? Will some of the hard-core MAGA base finally hit a wall and turn on its dear leader?\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs fulfill the ultranationalist promise he made countless times on the campaign trail. He occasionally warned us of the hardship to come alongside his tirades against migrants and nonsense about bringing down prices. But the pain is due to arrive now, and his having predicted it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessary or any easier to afford."

            "full_content": "Consider, for a moment, the example of Dan Osborn. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nIf the first election of Donald Trump was a boon to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, the second might have granted new life to moderates. Trump\u2019s popular-vote victory \u2014 his only, and one of the most dispiriting events for the American left in the twenty-first century \u2014 put to rest several long-standing arguments about the national electorate. It was far easier to blame racism for Trump\u2019s shock win in 2016 because Barack Obama had stumped aggressively for Hillary Clinton, who still beat Trump by two percentage points. Eight years later, Trump has made tremendous gains with Latino, Asian, and even some Black voters, and his 2024 coalition was more multiracial than any liberal pundit would have predicted just a few years ago.\n\nIn turn, many of the de rigueur causes of the 2010s have fallen out of vogue. Black Live Matter is moribund, and there are no calls to abolish ICE despite Trump promising mass deportations. The Women\u2019s March didn\u2019t materialize to oppose Trump\u2019s inauguration. Climate activism, which burned so hot in the late 2010s and early 2020s, is at a low ebb, and despite David Hogg\u2019s rise to vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, there is nothing approximating the mass marches over gun control that took place in 2018 and 2019. Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on so-called DEI initiatives and \u201cwoke\u201d have triggered only limited backlash from Democrats, who seem increasingly willing to move on from culture war.\n\nThe latest evidence of a possible moderate resurgence was a gathering hosted by Third Way, the centrist Democratic think tank, last month. Unlike the DNC, which has not performed any autopsy of 2024, Third Way produced five pages of takeaways that it believes explain Democratic failure and can plot a path back to power. They blame a failure to prioritize economic concerns, an overemphasis on identity politics, allowing the \u201cfar-left\u201d to define the party, and an attachment to unpopular institutions like academia, the media, and government bureaucracy for Trump\u2019s ascendance. Among Third Way\u2019s proposals is a ban on \u201cfar-left candidate questionnaires\u201d and a movement \u201caway from the dominance of small-dollar donors whose preferences may not align with the broader electorate.\u201d They argued, too, for Democrats to embrace \u201cpatriotism, community, and traditional American imagery\u201d and to \u201cget out of elite circles and into real communities\u201d like tailgates, gun shows, local restaurants, churches. It was time, they proclaimed, to celebrate \u201cmoderation, individualism, and masculinity.\u201d\n\nGiven the slow bleed of working-class voters from the Democratic Party, especially men, much of this is sound reasoning \u2014 if easy to mock on social media. Ruben Gallego, the new Democratic senator from Arizona, has said the left needs to understand that \u201cevery Latino man wants a big-ass truck.\u201d Democrats are afraid, Gallego said, of \u201csaying, like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s help you get a job so you can become rich.\u2019\u201d The GOP, for many voters, has become the aspirational, freedom-loving party, while Democrats embody the nattering, faculty-lounge caricature, too affluent and alien. There is an image problem that Democrats will need to fix. Pumping out new policy platforms isn\u2019t enough.\n\nBut the battle back to power \u2014 and the hope for Democrats, really, of erecting any sort of sustainable and durable majority \u2014 will be far more complicated than simply pivoting to the center. Behind Third Way\u2019s argument that small donors represent an energized minority that could force certain Democrats to take unpopular positions is the implication that large donors are a safer bet \u2014 as if millionaires and billionaires weren\u2019t capable of corroding the priorities of politicians and dragging them away from where the median voter might be. If it\u2019s understandable Third Way doesn\u2019t want Democrats to be openly \u201canti-capitalist\u201d (capitalism itself polls well, after all), the plea for Democrats \u201cto stop demonizing wealth and corporations broadly\u201d is odder.\n\nWhat evidence is there that corporate skepticism has damaged either party? Were it up to Third Way, Trump would never have turned against NAFTA and Obama would have tried to triangulate John McCain on economics, running to the right as the financial sector collapsed in 2008. Bernie Sanders\u2019s enduring popularity, including his recent, packed-out rallies against oligarchy, should be impossible. Sanders, the self-identified socialist from Vermont, has always been confounding for Third Way, especially his 2016 presidential campaign, which won more than 40 percent of the primary vote against Clinton, the overwhelming front-runner.\n\nSanders never became president, and several of his most prominent prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, embody some of the 2010s and early \u201920s excesses that cost Democrats votes, like calls to defund the police and comparisons of migrant detention facilities to \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d But Sanders himself, even at the height of the George Floyd protests, was against pulling funding from police departments, instead enraging progressives by reiterating his belief that officers should be paid more money. On immigration, Sanders is far more humane than any Republican but has decried an open border, likening it to a scheme for the wealthy to procure cheap labor. A supporter of gun control, Sanders was nevertheless more moderate than many cultural liberals because he had risen to power in a rural state where Republicans once held great sway.\n\nA more culturally right-wing version of Sanders almost nabbed a Senate seat in deep-red Nebraska last year, and it\u2019s peculiar that many Democrats, including Third Way, still don\u2019t want to talk about it. Dan Osborn came within seven points of defeating Deb Fischer, an incumbent Republican, in a state Trump would carry by more than 20. Osborn, a mechanic and labor leader, had led a strike at Kellogg\u2019s Omaha plant in 2021; on economic issues, he represented everything Third Way, which is Clintonian centrist at its core, resents. He supported raising the national minimum wage, bolstering railway safety, strengthening Social Security, and making it easier for workers to organize into labor unions. On culture, he did pivot right: He backed Trump\u2019s border wall and gun rights. He notably campaigned as an independent, not a Democrat, and targeted the very small donors Third Way wants Democrats to shun. Osborn did not commit to caucusing with the Democrats if he won, but at minimum, he would not have been an automatic vote for Trump in the Senate.\n\nMost Democrats now agree that they have a Senate problem: The 2024 election cycle was not as devastating for Democrats as initially feared, with slim victories in Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but even this slight overperformance has resulted in a comfortable 53-47 GOP majority. To escape the minority and eventually find a way to 52 or 53 seats, Democrats will have to compete, as Third Way and many others argue, for working class and non-college-educated voters, especially in rural areas. This will mean, in addition to fixing the Democratic brand, fielding more candidates like Osborn who can make Trump states competitive again. It will not mean abandoning small donors or the economic populism that thrills them. It will mean being a tribune for the working class."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Republican-heavy audience that tuned in to hear President Donald Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday greeted it with tempered positivity, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nSpeech-watchers broadly said Trump\u2019s policies would take the country in the right direction, with majorities saying the same across five issue areas that were the focus of the president\u2019s speech. But fewer expressed strong confidence in Trump to help people like them, use his presidential power responsibly or provide the nation with real leadership.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 speech-watchers said they had at least a somewhat positive reaction to Trump\u2019s speech tonight, with a smaller 44% offering a very positive response. That\u2019s lower than the 57% of viewers who rated Trump\u2019s initial address to Congress very positively eight years ago, or the 51% who said the same of President Joe Biden\u2019s initial address in 2021. It also comes just below the 48% \u201cvery positive\u201d rating Trump saw for his 2018 State of the Union.\n\nGood marks from speech-watchers are typical for presidential addresses to Congress, which tend to attract generally friendly audiences that disproportionately hail from presidents\u2019 own parties. In CNN\u2019s speech reaction polls, which have been conducted most years dating back to the Clinton era, audience reactions have always been positive.\n\nThe pool of people who watched Trump speak on Tuesday was about 14 percentage points more Republican than the general public.\n\nThe Trump-friendly audience reacted negatively to a protest effort from a Democratic member of Congress. Eight in 10 Americans who watched the speech said they saw Rep. Al Green\u2019s interruption of Trump\u2019s speech as inappropriate, with just 20% saying the representative from Texas acted appropriately. Green was ejected from the House chamber after continuing to protest following a warning from House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nRoughly 6 in 10 viewers said in a poll conducted before the speech that they approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency overall. By contrast, Trump\u2019s approval rating is underwater with the American public as a whole, a CNN poll released Sunday found, with 48% of U.S. adults approving of his performance as president and 52% disapproving.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech on Tuesday did little to further improve the already-positive perspectives of his audience. In a survey conducted prior to the speech, 61% said they believed his policies would move the country in the right direction; afterward, 66% of the same people said his policies would take the country down the right path. The share who believed Trump has had the right priorities so far stood at 56% prior to the speech and 59% immediately following its conclusion.\n\nHalf of speech-watchers said they held a lot of confidence in Trump to provide real leadership, while 45% said they had a lot of confidence in him to use his presidential power responsibly, and just 4 in 10 expressed high confidence in his ability to help people like them. Majorities of 65% or more said they had at least some confidence in him across each metric.\n\nTrump scored his highest marks of the night for his policies on immigration: 76% of speech-watchers said his proposed policies on that issue would take America in the right direction, compared with closer to 6 in 10 who said the same of his proposals to change how the government works (63%), or his proposed policies on the economy (62%) or tariffs (56%). That\u2019s a shift from CNN\u2019s polling on his first term speeches, when he consistently rated higher on economic issues than on those related to immigration.\n\nMost who tuned in said they thought his proposed policies on foreign affairs would move the country in the right direction (61%). Speech-watchers are also largely aligned with Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine and Russia. Majorities said that based on what they heard in the speech, the president\u2019s policies toward Ukraine (63%) and Russia (58%) offered the right amount of support for each country. Sizable minorities, though, see Trump as too supportive of Russia (37%) and not supportive enough of Ukraine (33%).\n\nAnnual presidential addresses rarely lead to significant shifts in presidential approval among the broader American public, particularly in recent years. Historically, first-year addresses to Congress have tended to be better rated than later State of the Union speeches and more likely than others to result in an approval rating bounce. But Trump, the first president in the era of modern presidential polling to serve nonconsecutive terms, isn\u2019t new to the office \u2014 and current levels of polarization may also curtail his speech\u2019s potential to affect public opinion.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by text message with 431 US adults who said they watched the presidential address on Tuesday, and are representative of the views of speech-watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the speech, and were selected by a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of speech-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report."

He celebrated his crackdown on migration. He repeatedly taunted his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying the former president imposed \u201cinsane and very dangerous open border policies\u201d and offered little in the way of olive branches to Democrats, instead touting his 2024 victory as a mandate to reshape the nation.\n\nHere are our takeaways from the speech \u2014 and how it sets up the rest of Trump\u2019s 2025.\n\nTrump defends his tariff moves: Trump said the 25% tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico \u201care about protecting the soul of our country\u201d as scores of Republicans applauded.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of how Trump has transformed the traditionally pro-free trade GOP, though there is some unease in the party about the tariffs\u2019 effects on prices and the broader economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a little disturbance,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut we\u2019re OK with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d\n\nOutlining the agenda for the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d: Trump spent significant time on issues ranging from transgender athletes to the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. But the biggest thing Congress may work on this year will be a massive tax and spending bill, and Trump outlined his priorities.\n\nTrump reiterated his calls to cut taxes and include several campaign trail tax promises in a bill later this year \u2014 specifically killing taxes on tips and overtime. Congressional Republicans are wrestling with the feasibility of those proposals.\n\nWhat was missing: A few thorny issues were mostly or entirely missing from the speech, reflecting the broad goal of rallying Republicans.\n\nThe return of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza earned a mention, but Trump did not delve much deeper into the broader issues facing the Middle East. And as the GOP\u2019s budget and spending plans take shape, there was no mention of Medicaid \u2014 a major portion of the federal budget that could be a target for changes. And Trump did not delve into the federal worker cuts that have sparked anxiety among some congressional Republicans and pushback from the public.\n\nRead the rest of the takeaways here \u2192\n\nDemocrats' silent protests of Trump speech overshadowed by one outburst\n\nBy Scott Wong and Frank Thorp V\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats silently protested Trump \u2014 refusing to applaud, holding up signs calling him \u201cking\u201d and \u201cliar\u201d and, for some, walking out of the address altogether.\n\nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, didn\u2019t get the memo.\n\nAfter Trump told lawmakers he had won a mandate, the progressive rabble-rouser rose, began waving his cane at Trump and yelled out repeatedly: \u201cYou have no mandate!\u201d The sergeant at arms promptly removed Green from the chamber \u2014 a first during modern-day presidential addresses to Congress.\n\nIt was not what Democratic leaders had wanted. They had warned their rank-and-file members before the joint address not to bring props and to stay on message \u2014 the focus should stay on the federal workers fired by Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, as well as the everyday Americans harmed by their policies and cuts.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to keep every congressional Democrat in line. From the moment Trump walked onto the House floor, it was clear this would not be the usual speech to Congress. Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the new DOGE subcommittee, silently held a sign behind Trump reading: \u201cThis is NOT normal.\u201d\n\nAfter he greeted Trump, Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, reached across the aisle, ripped the sign away from Stansbury and tossed it in the air \u2014 all on live TV.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, stood when Trump walked down the center aisle but did not applaud.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., brought an erasable whiteboard into the chamber and scribbled various messages to Trump throughout the night: \u201cNO KING,\u201d \u201cTHAT\u2019S A LIE\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re cutting Medicaid,\u201d for instance.\n\nRead more from inside the House chamber here \u2192\n\nMore coverage\n\nThat\u2019s all From the Politics Desk for now.

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump delivered his first speech to Congress of his second term Tuesday night, celebrating the big spending cuts, crackdown on migration and economic vision from the opening weeks of his administration.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump bent the facts on issues including Social Security, immigration, fentanyl and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nHere's what Trump got right \u2014 and wrong \u2014 during his 100-minute address.\n\nEconomic issues\n\nFact check: Are millions of people older than 100 \u2014 including some older than 160 \u2014 collecting Social Security?\n\nTrump said: \u201cWe\u2019re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.\u201d\n\nThis is false.\n\nTrump alleged in his speech that millions of senior citizens over age 100 \u2014 including some he maintained were older than 160 \u2014 were collecting Social Security checks, according to Social Security Administration data.\n\nTrump specifically said that SSA records indicated that 4.7 million people 100 to 109 were getting checks, that 3.6 million 110 to 119 were, that 3.47 million 120 to 129 were, that 3.9 million 130 to 139 were, that 3.5 million 140 to 149 were, that 1.3 million 150 to 159 were \u2014 and that even 130,000 people older than 160 years old were still getting checks.\n\nHe also alleged that several hundred people older than 220 were still getting checks, according to SSA data \u2014 and that \u201cone person is listed at 360 of age.\u201d\n\nThe alleged fraud that Trump \u2014 and DOGE chief Elon Musk \u2014 have pointed to doesn\u2019t exist. Rather, the numbers they refer to are products of a known problem with the government\u2019s data.\n\nThere are millions of people over age 100 in the Social Security Administration\u2019s database, but the vast majority aren\u2019t receiving benefits.\n\nInspectors general at the agency have repeatedly identified the issue, but the Social Security Administration has argued that updating old records is costly and unnecessary.\n\nAn SSA IG report from 2023 showed 18.9 million people listed as 100 years or older \u2014 but not dead \u2014 were in the database. But \u201calmost none\u201d currently receive SSA payments.\n\nThe SSA\u2019s inspector general also found in a report released in July that from 2015 to 2022, only 0.84% of benefits payments were improper. That 0.84% of improper benefits payments totaled $71.8 billion over eight years. The report also says most of the improper payments were overpayments \u2014 not payments to dead people or people who didn\u2019t qualify.\n\nIn addition, according to the agency\u2019s online records, just 89,106 people \u2014 not tens of millions \u2014 over age 99 received retirement benefits in December, out of the more than 70 million people who receive benefits every year.\n\nFact check: Under whose watch did egg prices spike?\n\nTrump said: \"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control \u2014 and we are working hard to get it back down.\"\n\nThis needs context.\n\nIt\u2019s true that egg prices spiked during Biden\u2019s presidency as inflation rose steadily. The average price of one dozen Grade A eggs peaked during the Biden administration in January 2023 at $4.32, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. It eventually retreated, falling to less than half that by late 2023, before it rose again last year.\n\nAccording to that government data, however, the average price of one dozen Grade A eggs peaked this January at $4.95, a month in office that Trump shared with Biden \u2014 a product of the growing transmission of bird flu among chickens. That is nearly double the price they were in January 2024 ($2.52).\n\nFact check: Trump says car plants are \"opening up all over the place\"\n\nTrump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody\u2019s ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made, never seen. That\u2019s a combination of the election win and tariffs. It\u2019s a beautiful word, isn\u2019t it, that, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It\u2019s going to boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three, the top people, and they\u2019re so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly false.\n\nNo automaker has announced a new plant since Trump took office and began instituting new tariffs. Reuters reported that Honda planned to produce 210,000 Civics in Indiana instead of Mexico, but the company hasn\u2019t made a public announcement.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s unclear whether Honda would expand its operations in Indiana, open a new plant or simply move production of the new Civic to the plant and reduce production of other vehicles there, too. Honda\u2019s Indiana plant produces as many as 250,000 vehicles annually.\n\nIn addition, Trump\u2019s move to impose a 25% tariff on all imports coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico could add thousands of dollars to the cost of each new vehicle.\n\nImmigration\n\nFact check: Trump claims illegal immigration \"destroyed\" Aurora, Colo., and Springfield, Ohio\n\nTrump said: \"Joe Biden didn\u2019t just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody has ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.\"\n\nThis is false.\n\nSpringfield and Aurora have long been some of Trump\u2019s favorite targets when it comes to examples of American cities he likes to nod to as being overrun by migrants, though he often misrepresents the situations there.\n\nHe didn\u2019t mention any specific allegations about the two cities in his speech \u2014 but his reference to them is a clear reference to previous false allegations about them.\n\nFor example, Trump repeated a baseless claim about Haitian immigrants in Springfield eating dogs and other pets during a debate last year. The story provide false, however. The culprit was a non-migrant woman in a nearby town.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump also painted a sinister picture of Aurora during the campaign. At a rally there in October, he alleged the city had been overtaken by a Venezuelan prison gang \u2014 Tren de Aragua \u2014 after a social media clip went viral claiming the gang had taken over an apartment complex in Aurora.\n\nPolice at the time said there was no evidence the gang had taken over the complex, and Mayor Mike Coffman, a Republican, called Trump\u2019s descriptions \u201cnot accurate.\u201d\n\nFact check: Is Canada, along with Mexico, to blame for the fentanyl crisis?\n\nTrump said of Canada and Mexico: \u201cThey\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nWhile fentanyl comes across the border from Mexico in significant numbers, Canada is hardly to blame for the crisis. In the 2024 fiscal year, fentanyl seizures at the northern border were just 43 pounds, according to Customs and Border Protection data. Meanwhile, more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern border during the same period.\n\nFact check: Trump says many migrants who entered the country the past four years were criminals\n\nTrump said: \u201cOver the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection data, the Biden administration had more than an estimated 14 million migrant encounters at and between ports of entry at U.S. borders.\n\nMore than 118,000 migrants with criminal backgrounds were apprehended at U.S. borders during that time \u2014 a small part of the more than over 14 million migrant encounters. There have been instances of migrants found to have criminal records from their home countries after they\u2019ve entered the United States, but there is no evidence to support that it is widespread, and immigration officials have long cited challenges with getting criminal records from certain migrants\u2019 home countries before they cross the border.\n\nThe Trump administration has frequently cited the presence of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in the United States and the high-profile killing of the Georgia nursing student Laken Riley last year by a Venezuelan national who entered the country illegally in 2022 as indicative of widespread migrant crime.\n\nFact check: Is Trump responsible for \"the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever\"?\n\nTrump said: \u201cSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history \u2014 and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be true, but questions about the specifics remain.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump is speaking about border crossings, encounters and/or apprehensions.\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection data from 2000 to 2019 that compares apprehensions across the various sectors by month, the month with the fewest crossings on record was April 2017, at 11,677.\n\nCPB says, \u201cFrom Jan. 21 through Jan. 31, 2025, the number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border dropped 85% from the same period in 2024.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed last month on Truth Social: \u201cThere were only 8,326 apprehensions of Illegals by Border Patrol at the U.S. \u2014 Mexico Border.\u201d\n\nHealth\n\nFact check: Trump says more children are being diagnosed with autism\n\nTrump said: \u201cAs an example, not long ago, and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers, 1 in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it\u2019s 1 in 36. There\u2019s something wrong. One in 36, think of that, so we\u2019re going to find out what it is.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this ratio is correct. But the statistic is often used to justify opposition to vaccination.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pointed to vaccines to explain the substantial rise in autism diagnoses in recent decades, which have ballooned from an estimated 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today.\n\nBut the science is clear that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism.\n\nRather, research suggests that much of the increase is due to increasing awareness and screening for the condition, changing definitions of autism to include milder conditions on the spectrum that weren\u2019t recognized in previous years and advances in diagnostic technology.\n\nFinding the causes of autism is complicated, because it\u2019s not a single disorder, scientists and experts have told NBC News. In addition, those scientists and experts have said they believe that people develop autistic traits because of a combination of genetic vulnerability and environmental exposures.\n\nInternational\n\nFact check: Trump claims U.S. is spending much more on Ukraine than Europe\n\nTrump said: \u201cEurope has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They\u2019ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending. And we\u2019ve spent perhaps $350 billion, and they\u2019ve spent $100 billion. And we have an ocean separating us, and they don\u2019t. And Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly false.\n\nFrom Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 to last December, the United States had allocated $114.2 billion in aid to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute, which is tracking aid to Ukraine. That\u2019s not more than Europe spent: Those nations allocated more than $132.3 billion, with plans to allocate more.\n\nTrump is correct in pointing out that Europe has spent more on oil and gas than it spent on military assistance last year, according to estimates from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Oil and gas taxes account for a huge share of Russia\u2019s revenues each year.\n\nPolling\n\nFact check: Is the share of Americans who think the country is on \"right\" track at a record high?\n\nTrump said: \u201cFor the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nThis is false.\n\nTrump appears to be cherry-picking a single poll result and ignoring a few strong numbers from early in Biden\u2019s term. While he doesn\u2019t cite his source, it seems likely he\u2019s pointing to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll showing that 47% say America\u2019s on the \u201cright track.\u201d\n\nRasmussen is a right-wing poll that regularly partners with conservative authors and outlets to sponsor its polling. And it\u2019s controversial \u2014 the polling aggregation site FiveThirtyEight removed the poll from its averages last year over concerns about its partisanship and its methodology.\n\nIt\u2019s true that many polls have shown a bump in the classic \u201cright track, wrong track\u201d question since Trump took office. For example, NPR/Marist/PBS\u2019 newest poll found 45% saying the country is moving in the right direction, up from 35% in December and from even lower during earlier parts of the Biden administration.\n\nBut those highs have been hit before \u2014 47% said America was moving in the right direction in a July 2021 poll from NPR/Marist/PBS (49% thought it was moving in the wrong direction). And just months earlier, a Politico/Morning Consult poll found 51% of registered voters saying the country was going in the right direction."

            "full_content": "Photo: Ben Curtis/AP Photo\n\nBefore Donald Trump\u2019s first joint address to Congress since returning to the White House, I wrote about what things he might do to increase support for his agenda in the big speech. These included \u201cspeaking to the nation, not to his base,\u201d renouncing the chaos so many perceive his administration has engendered, asserting control over Elon Musk and DOGE, more closely relating his agenda to concerns, like rising prices, that Americans think he is inadequately addressing, and disclaiming responsibility for the government shutdown that may be just down the road. He didn\u2019t do any of these things.\n\nInstead, in the longest and by far the most partisan presidential address to Congress in history, Trump spoke strictly to his own partisans, aside from contemptuous dismissals of Democrats and interminable attacks on Joe Biden. He celebrated the chaos of his first days in office as the greatest beginning of any administration in history. He saluted Musk and cited many of the bogus anecdotal examples of \u201cwaste and fraud\u201d DOGE\u2019s novices had allegedly unearthed. He simply asserted his agenda would restrain inflation and didn\u2019t even address the looming government shutdown. The speech was essentially a warmed-over 2024 campaign-rally speech that didn\u2019t even attempt to persuade those not already persuaded that his administration was ushering in a \u201cgolden age \u2026 unlike anything ever seen.\u201d\n\nThere were no substantive new initiatives announced, at all, and much of the address and its many human props in the galleries had little or nothing to do with the agenda he\u2019s asked Congress to implement. Tax cuts, the beating heart of that agenda, were barely mentioned beyond dubious assertions about the magical effect of the tax cuts he promoted in 2017. The very specific budget cuts his allies are poised to enact went unmentioned as well, other than an absurd pledge to balance the federal budget. Trump didn\u2019t even bother to repeat his promises not to go after Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Though he spent inordinate time on demonizing immigrants, he offered absolutely no specifics or timetable for his pledge to deport all undocumented people in the country, and didn\u2019t even mention his radical proposal to end birthright citizenship. And despite his warm endorsement of DOGE, Trump never gave any indication of how far and how fast he intends to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d by firing federal employees and abolishing federal programs.\n\nThose looking for reassurance that the radical beginning of Trump 2.0 might give way to something more orderly and less divisive were given absolutely nothing in this speech. Business leaders and farmers hoping for an indication that his program of tariffs was temporary and would not trigger a trade war were told once again that tariffs are beautiful and powerful and would remain as a major source of federal revenues and a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s economic strategy, such as it is. Old-school conservatives looking for a vision of the kind of world an America First foreign policy might create were asked to cheer plans to take back the Panama Canal and grab Greenland \u201cone way or the other\u201d \u2014 agenda items many had hoped were a meme or even a joke. And despite the sycophantic welcome he received from Republican members of Congress, he gave them absolutely no direction on how to implement his many conflicting promises, and did everything within his rhetorical powers to ensure not a single Democrat will cooperate.\n\nSince this speech was so very similar to what he said every day on the 2024 campaign trail, and repeated in his inaugural address and in the turgid, debased language of his executive orders and his administration\u2019s memoranda and other public statements, it\u2019s time to conclude that we can never expect anything different from this president. He has all but stopped communicating with those of us who aren\u2019t wearing red hats and cheering his boasts and lies. This speech was supremely self-indulgent, and there\u2019s no reason to believe he will exercise self-restraint until the courts or the midterm electorate denies him the power to do exactly what he wants."

Looking to embrace a more balanced lifestyle while securing new opportunities?\u201d the website asks. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start building your European escape in the stunning paradise of Sardinia.\u201d"

Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., lit into President Donald Trump on Tuesday night, suggesting that President Ronald Reagan \u2014 whose \u201cpeace through strength\u201d mantra Trump has adopted \u2014 would be appalled by his approach to Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAfter the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave,\u201d Slotkin, referring to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week, said in her response to the joint address to Congress.\n\n\u201cAs a Cold War kid, I\u2019m thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s,\u201d she added. \u201cTrump would have lost us the Cold War.\u201d\n\nSlotkin, who addressed the nation from Wyandotte, Michigan, framed her speech as a pitch for \u201cresponsible\u201d governing over \u201creckless\u201d leadership, arguing that Trump\u2019s agenda could spell economic doom for the country.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not careful,\u201d she said, \u201che could walk us right into a recession.\u201d\n\nSlotkin posited that Trump\u2019s policies, as well as the sweeping cuts he has empowered billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk to oversee as part of a government efficiency initiative, would be destructive to most Americans.\n\n\u201cThe president talked a big game on the economy, but it\u2019s always important to read the fine print,\u201d she said. \u201cSo do his plans actually help Americans get ahead? Not even close. President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America, and to do that, he\u2019s going to make you pay in every part of your life. Grocery and home prices are going up, not down, and he hasn\u2019t laid out a credible plan to deal with either of those. His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber and cars and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.\u201d\n\nSlotkin also had harsh words for Musk.\n\n\u201cIs there anyone in America,\u201d she asked, \u201cwho is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information and your bank accounts?\n\n\u201cWe need a more efficient government,\u201d she added. \u201cYou want to cut waste? I\u2019ll help you do it. But change doesn\u2019t need to be chaotic or make us less safe.\u201d\n\nSlotkin was one of the Democratic Party\u2019s few bright spots last year \u2014 a successful candidate for an open Senate seat in Michigan who outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris in the battleground state. A former House member who positioned herself as a more moderate voice in a party tilting left on cultural issues, Slotkin narrowly beat former Rep. Mike Rogers. Her victory has been held up in some corners of the party as a template for Democrats.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and I both won here in November,\u201d Slotkin said of Wyandotte. \u201cIt might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist across the United States, places where people believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids should do better. It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat, but it was never a big deal because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.\u201d\n\nSlotkin also has emerged as one of the sharpest critics of Democratic messaging, telling reporters after last fall\u2019s election that Democrats would be wise to focus more on \u201cissues that keep people up at night,\u201d like their bank accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science, but talking about those issues plainly, not from the faculty lounge but from the assembly line, is, I think, a very important message,\u201d Slotkin said then. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what you\u2019re saying but from what place you are talking about those issues. \u2026 I personally think that identity politics needs to go the way of the dodo.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, Slotkin warned of an American democracy \u201cat risk when the president pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different and tells certain people they shouldn\u2019t be included.\u201d\n\nShe closed her speech with a call to action.\n\n\u201cFirst: Don\u2019t tune out. It\u2019s easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever,\u201d Slotkin said. \u201cSecond: Hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they\u2019re voting. Go to town halls and demand and take action. That\u2019s as American as apple pie.\n\n\u201cThird: Organize. Pick just one issue you\u2019re passionate about and engage, and doom-scrolling doesn\u2019t count,\" she added. \"Join a group that cares about your issue and act.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Tuesday evening that the US has apprehended a \u201ctop terrorist\u201d involved in the 2021 bombing at Kabul airport\u2019s Abbey Gate in Afghanistan where 13 US service members and at least 170 Afghan civilians were killed.\n\nMohammad Sharifullah, who was allegedly involved in the planning of the bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, was charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support for terrorism. He arrived in the US on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the operation.\n\n\u201cTonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,\u201d Trump said in his joint address to Congress.\n\nPakistan acted on CIA intelligence that led to the arrest of Sharifullah, according to another source familiar with the matter. In his speech, Trump thanked Pakistan for \u201chelping arrest this monster.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif returned the message of gratitude in a statement issued on Wednesday, thanking Trump for \u201cacknowledging and appreciating Pakistan\u2019s role and support in counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nSharif said Pakistan\u2019s security forces apprehended Sharifullah, an Afghan national, \u201cin a successful operation conducted in Pakistan-Afghan border region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Trump once again attacked President Joe Biden over the handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, a criticism he made frequently on the campaign trail last year. Trump said he spoke to the families of the service members who were killed on a call before his speech \u201cand they did nothing but cry with happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly \u2013 over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown.\u201d\n\nSharifullah was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, according to an indictment unsealed late Tuesday.\n\nHe was interviewed by FBI agents on Sunday, where he told them he was recruited in 2016 into ISIS-K, a branch of ISIS. In the interview, Shariffullah \u201cadmitted to supporting and conducting activities on behalf of ISIS-K in support of multiple lethal attacks,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nSharifullah, who is also known as \u201cJafar,\u201d according to the court documents, was in prison from 2019 until two weeks before the Abbey Gate attack. When he was released, he was contacted by ISIS members for assistance in the attack.\n\n\u201cSharifullah was tasked with scouting a route near (Hamid Karzai International Airport) HKIA for an attacker. Sharifullah conducted surveillance on a route, specifically checking for law enforcement and American or Taliban checkpoints,\u201d the court documents state.\n\n\u201cSharifullah communicated to other ISIS-K members that he believed the route was clear and that he did not think the attacker would be detected while proceeding through that route.\u201d\n\nISIS members instructed him to leave the area around the airport, the court documents state. \u201cLater that same day, Sharifullah learned of the attack at HKIA described above and recognized the alleged bomber as an ISIS-K operative he had known while incarcerated.\u201d\n\nThe indictment also details Sharifullah\u2019s alleged involvement in two other attacks, claiming that he conducted surveillance and transported a bomber to an attack on embassy guards in Kabul in 2016, and provided weapons training for gunmen who carried out an attack on a Moscow nightclub last year.\n\nSharifullah made his first federal court appearance Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nMagistrate Judge William Porter ordered Sharifullah to be detained until his next hearing, which is scheduled for Monday afternoon.\n\nSharifullah wore a powder blue uniform and a black facemask during the 10-minute hearing. A Dari language interpreter aided him during the proceedings, and he was flanked by several US marshals.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t yet entered a plea. His public defender declined to comment about the charges after the hearing.\n\nTrump\u2019s CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, raised the issue during his first phone call with the Pakistani intel chief, which took place during his first few days on the job, the source familiar added.\n\nSenior members of the administration heralded the news.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump just announced, I can report that tonight the FBI, DOJ, and CIA have extradited one of the terrorists responsible for the murder of the 13 American soldiers at Abbey Gate during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal,\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X shortly after Trump announced the arrest. \u201cOne step closer to justice for these American heroes and their families.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Sophia Saifi and Josh Campbell contributed to this report"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s first address to Congress since returning to power was both a victory lap following a consequential first 43 days in office and an attempt to justify what he\u2019s done to an American public that may still be digesting his rapid-pace changes.\n\nOn tariffs, government cuts and foreign affairs, Trump has taken dramatic steps that have left Democrats fuming and even some Republicans skeptical, while foreign capitals have scrambled to respond. His task Tuesday was to say why.\n\nHe did that \u2013 to an extent. But the president also used his speech to relentlessly attack his opponents, blame his predecessor and air old grievances.\n\nThe president entered the chamber with a lot to say. His speech broke the record for longest annual presidential address to Congress in modern history, at just under one hour and 40 minutes. It was also one of the most partisan, with almost none of the customary calls for unity.\n\nA partisan affair\n\nFrom almost the first words of Trump\u2019s speech, it was evident it would not resemble many addresses to Congress in the past. He boasted about his November election win, attacked Democrats for standing in his way and complained they would never applaud his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,\u201d he said, describing his opposition as essentially a lost cause.\n\nThe dramatics extended to the audience, when Democratic Rep. Al Green interrupted the president repeatedly before House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to eject the Texas congressman.\n\nRep. Al Green shouts out as Trump addresses a joint session of Congress. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThe moment early in Trump\u2019s speech helped set the partisan atmosphere. Other Democrats held up signs or walked out of the chamber during the speech, defying leadership\u2019s calls to show restraint.\n\nAnd the president made little attempt to lower the temperature, repeatedly chastising Democrats for not helping advance his agenda. He pointed their way when referring to \u201cradical left-wing lunatics\u201d and even used his derogatory \u201cPocahontas\u201d nickname for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAlways in campaign mode\n\nThroughout the speech, Trump narrowed in on the culture war issues that thrill his base, promising to erase \u201cwokeness\u201d from society and touting some of his most divisive executive actions.\n\nHe bemoaned what he calls the unfairness of affirmative action and touted his efforts to roll back transgender rights and diversity programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military and it\u2019s already out, and it\u2019s out of our society. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nTrump used the guests in the first lady\u2019s box to illustrate his point, including female athletes, parents of children murdered by undocumented immigrants and a mother whose daughter Trump claimed had been \u201csecretly socially transitioned\u201d at school.\n\nTrump framed the moves as part of his \u201ccommon sense revolution,\u201d though each of the issues appeared designed to mostly appeal to his base.\n\nInstead of bridging any partisan gaps, the lines underscored the perpetual campaign mode Trump operates within, even as he\u2019s no longer running for office.\n\nAllyson and Lauren Phillips, mother and sister of the late Laken Riley stand as they are recognized by President Donald Trump. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRapid pace of change\n\nThe executive actions reshaping the federal government have come fast and furious in Trump\u2019s first month-and-a-half; his team is far more experienced this time around, and the president himself is impatient to fulfill his campaign promises.\n\nYet for many Americans, the flurry of changes has been confusing. Polls show skepticism seeping in about Trump\u2019s priorities. Tuesday\u2019s speech was an opportunity to present a cogent argument.\n\nHe chose to highlight Elon Musk, the billionaire in charge of his government efficiency effort who was sitting in the galleries.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s working very hard. He didn\u2019t need this. He didn\u2019t need this,\u201d Trump said, before goading Democrats further: \u201cEverybody here, even this side, appreciates it. I believe they just don\u2019t want to admit that,\u201d he said, pointing toward Democrats.\n\nLater, Trump recited a lengthy list of programs whose funding has been slashed by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, misleadingly calling them examples of fraud. And he repeated debunked claims that significant number of dead Americans are receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nDemocrats in the audience held aloft signs saying \u201cMusk steals,\u201d but the president\u2019s recitation of DOGE\u2019s efforts seemed far more focused on messaging about programs that, in his mind, reflect wasted taxpayer dollars than about detailing any actual government savings.\n\nRep.

Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIssue number 1\n\nThe hours ahead of Trump\u2019s speech were hardly the economic backdrop he may have hoped for. Stock markets tumbled as the broad tariffs he announced on Mexico, Canada and China reverberated among investors. Almost as soon as markets closed, his commerce secretary suggested there may be a pull-back on the new duties on Wednesday.\n\nNonetheless, Trump \u2014 who has advocated for tariffs since the 1970s, and once called \u201ctariff\u201d his favorite word \u2014 was not backing away from the strategy during his biggest speech of the year.\n\n\u201cWhatever they tariff us, we tariff them. That\u2019s reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we tax them,\u201d he\u2019ll said in the speech. \u201cWe will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.\u201d\n\nRepublicans stand as Democrats sit as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n\nMany Republicans have deep reservations about the tariffs, and lawmakers from states that could be hard-hit spent Tuesday on the phone with Trump\u2019s aides voicing their concerns. They had been hoping to hear from Trump a more fulsome explanation of his tariff plan, and an explanation of how average Americans might benefit.\n\nTrump was vague in the specifics, and he repeated his encouragement to farmers to \u201chave a lot of fun\u201d selling their products inside the United States (a sentiment he voiced on social media this week).\n\nBut he was adamant about the wisdom of tariffs, even as he acknowledged they could cause economic pain.\n\n\u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it\u2019s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re okay with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d\n\nA changed world\n\nTrump could hardly avoid the issue that has dominated the last week \u2014 the war in Ukraine \u2014 despite his address being largely focused on domestic matters.\n\n\u201cI am also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAt one point, Trump had hoped to herald a new rare earth minerals deal with Ukraine during his speech. But an Oval Office fracas last week with President Volodymyr Zelensky blew that up.\n\nInstead, Trump returned to his frustrations at how much US money has been spent on the conflict.\n\nBut he also responded positively to a social media post earlier Tuesday from Zelensky \u2013 Trump referred to a letter from the Ukrainian leader \u2013 in which Zelensky voiced regret for Friday\u2019s blowup and said he was ready to begin peace talks.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that he sent this letter,\u201d he said, without saying when he might try speaking to Zelensky again.\n\nBlame it on Biden\n\nTrump has made his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, a central figure of his second presidency, blaming him for everything from higher prices to foreign conflicts.\n\nTuesday\u2019s speech was no exception. He named Biden 12 times in his speech and referenced his administration another four times. He accused Biden of leaving him problems ranging from the high price of eggs to authorizing too much money for Ukraine, according to excerpts of the speech.\n\n\u201cAs you know, we inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,\u201d Trump said in his speech.\n\nLater, addressing attempts to pass a border bill last year, Trump said that instead of new legislation, \u201cAll we really needed was a new president.\u201d\n\nEvery president inherits obstacles left to them by the previous administration. Yet how much longer Trump can blame Biden for the country\u2019s continued challenges remains to be seen. Eventually, voters look to the office-holder to fix their problems \u2014 not blame them on someone else.\n\nDemocrats respond\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, the Michigan freshman who delivered Democrats\u2019 rebuttal, was assigned one of the infamously thankless tasks in politics.\n\nShe kept it short and to the point. She opened by accusing Trump \u2014 and, pointedly, Musk \u2014 of taking a \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cchaotic\u201d approach to reforming the federal government.\n\nDecrying the Oval Office berating of Zelensky, she alleged Ronald Reagan would be \u201crolling in his grave.\u201d\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin speaks from Wyandotte, Michigan. Paul Sancya/AP\n\nShe acknowledged Americans want change. But, in her telling, the change Trump is executing risks fundamental damage to the country.\n\nHer matter-of-fact approach contrasted with some other Democrats, who have tried to channel outrage in their opposition to Trump.\n\nInstead, Slotkin encouraged Democrats to embrace action, not anger: \u201cPick just one issue you\u2019re passionate about \u2014 and engage. And doom scrolling doesn\u2019t count,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

That means women, not politicians, should be in charge of whether, when, and how to start or grow their families. That includes access to birth control, access to abortion, and access to IVF,\" the group said in a statement in 2024."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration announced Tuesday that it is considering selling off hundreds of \u201cnon-core\u201d federal properties, according to the General Services Administration.\n\n\u201cGSA\u2019s decisive action to dispose of non-core assets leverages the private sector, drives improvements for our agency customers, and best serves local communities,\u201d the agency said in a news release linking to a list of 440 properties that included the headquarters of the FBI and the Department Justice.\n\nLater Tuesday, however, the list was scaled back to 320 properties, with all DC-based properties removed. By Wednesday, the list of federal buildings had been removed from GSA\u2019s website, which now says the list is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nThe agency said in a statement Wednesday the list was removed from its website due to \u201can overwhelming amount of interest.\u201d GSA said it planned to republish the list \u201cin the near future after we evaluate this initial input and determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.\u201d\n\nHowever, a source with knowledge of the situation said, \u201cThere was a miscommunication issue when posting the list. So they are pulling that back.\u201d\n\nThe source said the list mistakenly included federal buildings the administration does not want to sell. According to the source, the list should have included three categories of properties: buildings identified as required for government operation, buildings identified for disposal and buildings whose status could change at a later date and could eventually be put up for sale.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of rushing to get things out and posted without taking time to review what is actually being shared,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe list of 440 \u201cnon-core\u201d properties initially posted to the GSA website also included the departments of Veterans Affairs, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development; Federal Trade Commission; GSA\u2019s own headquarters; and the Old Post Office \u2013 where the Trump Organization had a 60-year lease until it sold it to the Waldorf Astoria hotel in 2022. Several of the buildings listed include staff from multiple agencies, such as the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center, the biggest federal government building in the Southeast.\n\nGSA said in its Tuesday release that most of the buildings flagged consist primarily of office space and that selling them will \u201censure taxpayers no longer pay for empty and underutilized federal office space.\u201d It also claimed it could potentially save \u201cmore than $430 million in annual operating costs.\u201d\n\nThe release said the agency has identified certain \u201ccore\u201d assets \u201cthat are needed for critical government operations,\u201d including courthouses and facilities key to national defense and law enforcement, which \u201cwill be retained for long-term needs.\u201d However, multiple courthouses, including the US Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, were on the list.\n\nThough many of the properties initially listed are in the Washington, DC, metro area, the list included buildings across the country, from Alaska to Florida.\n\nFederal workers ordered to return to office\n\nThe moves come as the Trump administration has ordered federal workers to return to their offices, marking an end to Covid-era rules allowing more flexibility. GSA on Tuesday did not specify where federal workers will go if their buildings are disposed of.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has been working with GSA on a plan to shed federal offices and collocate agencies, according to a source with knowledge of the plans. The goal is to have federal agencies share office space by connecting those that need workspace with those that have extra room.\n\nA recently launched program called \u201cspace match\u201d will allow agency heads throughout the government to fill out a Google form detailing how much space they need for their operations. The program is intended to offset the loss of workspace, but the source cautioned that closing these buildings could be expensive.\n\n\u201cThe cost to close buildings and relocate is pretty high \u2014 you have to clean out the old building and all of its furniture, etc., which for a 500,000 (square foot) building is not cheap,\u201d the source said. GSA will then have to find a place for displaced employees to go, which could mean purchasing new information technology infrastructure or possibly furniture.\n\nThe potential closure of the buildings echoes promises made during President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, where he vowed to move tens of thousands of federal jobs out of Washington, DC, and into \u201cplaces filled with patriots who love America.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump pushed to relocate federal agencies in Washington during his first term, when the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management was moved from the capital to Grand Junction, Colorado.\n\nAs part of a plan to conduct mass layoffs across the federal government, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management have asked federal agencies for an outline of \u201ca positive vision for more productive, efficient agency operations going forward.\u201d\n\nOMB and OPM have asked for agencies to submit proposals for office relocations away from the DC metro area and plans to reduce costs and improve efficiency through technology. Those are due no later than April 14 and should be implemented by September 30, CNN previously reported.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche contributed to this report."
