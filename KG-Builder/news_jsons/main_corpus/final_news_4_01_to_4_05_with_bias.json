      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nThe Justice Department has placed on administrative leave a government immigration lawyer who in court this week expressed frustration at not being able to answer key questions from a judge over a mistaken deportation case, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nErez Reuveni argued the government’s case in the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the government has said was sent to his native El Salvador last month due to a clerical error, despite a court order that he not be deported.\n\nReuveni said in court of the government’s position: “Our only arguments are jurisdictional. … He should not have been sent to El Salvador.”\n\nAsked why the US couldn’t simply ask for his return, Reuveni said, “The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” adding that he did not get a direct answer.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi took issue with how Reuveni handled the case in court.\n\n“At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,” she said in a statement to CNN.\n\nBondi issued a memo on her first day as attorney general requiring lawyers to “zealously” advocate for administration positions or face disciplinary action and potential firing.\n\nAugust Flentje, Reuveni’s supervisor, was also placed on administrative leave, according to one person familiar with the matter. ABC News reported earlier Saturday that Flentje was told he had failed to supervise a subordinate. CNN has reached out to Flentje and the Justice Department for comment.\n\nReuveni didn’t respond to a request for comment. On LinkedIn five months ago, he posted that he had been promoted to a new position as acting deputy director at the Office of Immigration Litigation.\n\nFlentje, whose LinkedIn profile lists his title as deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation, is known for his work defending the travel ban in the first Trump administration, a role that garnered criticism from some DOJ colleagues.\n\nIn a court filing earlier this week, the Trump administration conceded that Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father of three, was deported “because of an administrative error.” That filing appeared to be the first time the administration has admitted an error related to its recent deportation flights to El Salvador, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.\n\n“On March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the Trump administration’s March 31 filing said.\n\nA Maryland judge has ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned by Monday night, but the Trump administration on Saturday filed an emergency stay attempting to block the order. The administration has said it cannot return him because he’s now in Salvadoran custody.\n\nAbrego Garcia, who attorneys say fled gang violence in El Salvador more than a decade ago, had been identified by his wife in a photo of detainees entering intake at CECOT, the country’s notorious mega prison.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

      "full_content": "Austin, Texas CNN —\n\nA district court judge awarded $6.6 million combined to four whistleblowers who were fired shortly after they reported Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to the FBI.\n\n“By a preponderance of the evidence,” Travis County Judge Catherine Mauzy wrote in her Friday judgment, the plaintiffs proved liability, damages and attorneys fees in their complaint against the attorney general’s office.\n\n“Because the Office of the Attorney General violated the Texas Whistleblower Act by firing and otherwise retaliating against the plaintiff for in good faith reporting violations of law by Ken Paxton and OAG, the court hereby renders judgment for plaintiffs,” Mauzy wrote.\n\nThe court found that the four Paxton aides were fired in retaliation for reporting allegations that he was using his office to accept bribes from an Austin real estate developer who employed a woman with whom Paxton was having an extramarital affair. Paxton has denied accepting bribes or misusing his office to help Nate Paul, the real estate developer.\n\nThe judgment also stated that the employees made their reports to law enforcement “in good faith” and that Paxton’s office did not dispute any claims or damages in the lawsuit.\n\n“It should shock all Texans that their chief law enforcement officer, Ken Paxton, admitted to violating the law, but that is exactly what happened in this case,” Tom Nesbitt, an attorney for Blake Brickman, and TJ Turner, an attorney for David Maxwell, said in a joint statement.\n\nIn a statement to the media, Paxton, a Republican, called the ruling “ridiculous” and “not based on the facts or the law.” He also said that his office intends to appeal the ruling.\n\nPaxton was at the center of a federal investigation after eight employees reported his office to the FBI in 2020 for bribery allegations. Paxton in 2023 agreed to a $3.3 million settlement and an apology, but no admission of wrongdoing, with four of the whistleblowers. After Paxton asked state lawmakers to fund the settlement, the Texas House rejected his request, conducted its own investigation and impeached him in 2023. He was later acquitted in the state Senate.\n\nIn November, the Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling that Paxton testify in the lawsuit.\n\nThe US Justice Department decided not to pursue its investigation into Paxton in the final weeks of the Biden administration, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nNo longer shadowed by the federal corruption investigation that hung over his rising profile in the Republican Party, Paxton is now gearing up for a potential US Senate run. Paxton, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has hinted at challenging GOP Sen. John Cornyn for more than a year but has not said when he will make a decision.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump arranged for far-right activist Laura Loomer to join him in the Oval Office this week for an extraordinary meeting that preceded a shake-up of his national security leadership, two sources familiar with their meeting told CNN.\n\nTheir sit-down came after Loomer reached Trump by phone, the sources told CNN. As a result of their call, Trump instructed staff to invite her to the White House, the sources added.\n\nWithin 24 hours of their meeting, the administration had fired the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, the United States’ powerful cyber intelligence bureau, as well as staff members on the National Security Council. Loomer had advocated for their dismissal during her conversation with Trump, CNN previously reported.\n\n“This is called vetting,” Loomer wrote on X early Friday, adding of the NSA leaders: “Their firings are a blessing for the American people.”\n\nThe stunning series of events recalled Trump’s first term, when informal advisers, fringe figures and longtime associates often bypassed traditional channels to gain direct access to the Oval Office. His aides have insisted the president’s second term would be marked by discipline and structure.\n\nLoomer’s previous inflammatory rhetoric has drawn rebukes from Republican leaders, and her access to then-candidate Trump was limited last fall after her appearances on the campaign trail alongside him prompted internal tensions and public criticism. Now, by securing a White House visit just 72 days into Trump’s second term, Loomer has once again cast a spotlight on the external sources shaping the president’s decision-making in what was supposed to be a closely guarded Oval Office.\n\nAnd it appears Loomer’s work isn’t finished. In the days since her meeting with Trump, Loomer has publicly accused the president’s advisers of failing to block Republicans whom she sees as unfaithful to Trump from top White House and administration jobs. In response to what she calls a “vetting crisis,” Loomer recently announced she was starting an opposition research firm to dig into the backgrounds of executive branch hires on her own.\n\n“I literally have a binder of receipts,” she said in a recent podcast appearance, “and I know who’s loyal and I know who is disloyal.”\n\nLoomer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. However, she told CNN earlier this week that she would “decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump.”\n\n“It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security,” she said in a statement Thursday.\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House about the meeting.\n\nAs a conservative provocateur who is fiercely loyal to Trump, Loomer has publicly positioned herself as a protector of the president against people she views as insufficiently committed to the MAGA movement and its leader. In social media posts, she shares her deep suspicions of Elon Musk and other tech billionaires who have lately cozied up to the president and is especially critical of Republicans who failed to stand by Trump after his defeat in 2020.\n\nUntil this week, she had largely operated from outside the halls of power in Washington — though not for lack of trying. Loomer, who twice ran unsuccessfully for Congress, has spent months attempting to gain access to the West Wing. On social media, she has accused the president’s inner circle of pushing aside her and others whom she considers faithful Trump followers.\n\nWhile she regularly talks to Trump by phone, sources familiar with their relationship said, senior advisers had until recently largely thwarted her efforts at greater access and had limited her ability to gain an in-person audience with the president. The White House hasn’t approved her attempts to secure a press credential and attend daily briefings, she has said on social media. The press office didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment about the status of her application.\n\nBut the president was intrigued by Loomer’s latest overture during their recent phone conversation, the sources familiar with the meeting said, which included detailed critiques of many officials serving in key intelligence agencies. After Loomer presented her case to the president in person — carrying a list of roughly a dozen names she encouraged him to dismiss over their political backgrounds — the White House moved to oust the individuals.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump acknowledged meeting with Loomer but downplayed her role in the dismissal of National Security Council staff, calling her “a very strong person” who “recommended some people for jobs.”\n\n“And sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody, I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nHours later, CNN reported that Trump had dismissed two more individuals flagged by Loomer, including the NSA director, Gen. Timothy Haugh, a Senate-confirmed official who also leads US Cyber Command.\n\nBut sources familiar with Loomer’s Oval Office visit on Wednesday told CNN the meeting was a one-off, and they insisted her access to the president remained in check.\n\nThe firings also came amid intense internal scrutiny of national security operations following the revelation that top administration officials discussed an attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen over a Signal chat that mistakenly included a journalist. While it’s unclear whether this week’s dismissals were related to that incident, Trump and other top administration officials have remained wary behind the scenes of how the intelligence community is operating, CNN previously reported. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who was at the heart of the Signal scandal, was in the room Wednesday while Loomer condemned the staffers on his team.\n\nStill, it’s the second time in recent weeks that Loomer has appeared to claim credit for a Trump decision. Loomer, in a mid-March social media post, accused the son of former President Joe Biden, Hunter, of vacationing in South Africa with the protection of US Secret Service agents. Asked about the allegations several days later, Trump said he “just heard about it for the first time” and would “take a look at that.” Shortly after, Trump wrote on Truth Social he was revoking Hunter Biden’s protective service.\n\nLoomer has long occupied a place on the outer edges of Trump’s inner circle, a position that brought considerable challenges for the Republican’s 2024 campaign. For a time, Loomer accompanied then-candidate Trump on his private plane or met with him at his personal resort clubs, where she would share with him her theories.\n\nWhen Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ ethnicity during an especially tense interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last summer, an adviser blamed Loomer — who, leading up to Trump’s appearance, baselessly accused Harris on X of hiding her Black heritage — for planting the seed. Asked by CNN last fall, Loomer did not weigh in on whether she influenced Trump’s remarks.\n\nLoomer notably accompanied Trump on his flight to the Republican National Convention last summer, just one day after an assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. And she was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane ahead of his September debate against Harris.\n\nHer proximity to Trump, though, soon became a source of friction. Democrats pounced and Republicans groaned when she appeared alongside Trump at a memorial service honoring those who died on September 11, 2001. Loomer had previously posted a video claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job.” (Loomer, in a phone interview with CNN last year, said, “I’ve never denied the fact that Islamic terrorists carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks.”)\n\nAfter the controversy stirred by that appearance, advisers largely curtailed Loomer’s access to Trump for the remainder of the campaign. This week, though, Loomer demonstrated her staying power as she defended Trump’s firing of national security officials.\n\n“Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you,” she wrote on X, “and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.”",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is expected to take aim at the Department of Homeland Security in the coming days, seeking potentially major cuts to personnel across its agencies, including the US Secret Service, multiple sources tell CNN.\n\nDHS is bracing for what could amount to significant layoffs, four sources familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely told CNN, though no final decisions have been made, and the ultimate scale and scope has not been set.\n\nThis week, two of the sources said, there was back-and-forth negotiation and lobbying between DOGE, the White House, and Homeland Security leadership, with each of the department’s components expected to be impacted differently. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is expected to be decimated, one of the sources said.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are also facing potential cuts, two of the sources said.\n\nA senior DHS official told CNN the department is “determined to eliminate government waste that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer. Across DHS, we will be eliminating non-mission critical positions and bureaucratic hurdles that undermine our mission to secure the homeland. Secretary Noem is determined to return DHS to its core mission of keeping America safe.”\n\nCNN has reached out to DHS and DOGE for comment. The Secret Service declined to comment.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to send an email to her department’s personnel in the coming days laying out the expected cuts, with a separate email in the works detailing potential options for employees to include voluntary separations and early retirements. One of the sources made clear that Noem’s name may be on that email – but it is top Trump aide Stephen Miller, DOGE and other White House staff making the key decisions.\n\nCuts to the Secret Service would come at a particularly challenging time for the agency, which has been strained by what top officials have cast as an unprecedented and dynamic threat environment, including two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump last summer. The agency has been wracked with low morale, burnout, low staffing, and retention issues.\n\nThe agency spent an unprecedented $2 million last February on a television recruiting advertisement, tapping blockbuster movie director Michael Bay for the ad.\n\nOfficials have repeatedly argued in testimony on Capitol Hill following the assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, that the agency is underfunded and under-resourced.\n\nAny cuts at the agency, one of the sources said, are likely to impact administrative and technical staff, but could also impact new hires and those who are within their probationary period, positions that are more easily cut. It is not expected, that source said, to immediately impact the agency’s core missions and readiness – though it could in time, particularly if those in law enforcement roles need to backfill vacant support positions.\n\nThere is tremendous anxiety about what could ultimately take place at the USSS among rank-and-file staff, the sources said, and hesitancy to speak to reporters due to the threat of polygraph tests.\n\n“It’s hard for the Service to execute on a strategy, which is to bolster their resources and funding – especially in the wake of the attack on President Trump in Butler. How do they build that strategy now having to reduce a workforce?” questioned Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN contributor and former USSS agent.\n\nWackrow continued, “The mission is not directly impacted with what is being proposed at this moment – but it will over time. You start creating these intrinsic vulnerabilities in your workforce that could lead to another Butler.”\n\nNews of the potential cuts sent shockwaves across DHS component agencies Saturday, multiples sources said, with personnel desperately seeking clarity from their managers regarding whether they might be impacted.\n\nAt the Secret Service, senior managers told personnel Saturday that DHS was conducting a downsizing assessment for each of its component agencies, sources said, but any possible cuts remained unclear. Senior Secret Service officials also told the rank-and-file they were awaiting further clarity from DHS leadership, which they hoped to have in the coming days.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nA trio of election results this week have Republicans confronting a new reality: not only are they facing political headwinds as the party in power but simultaneously grappling with a dramatic reversal in the partisan preferences of the country’s most reliable voters.\n\nFor years, Republicans were seen as the party that dominated lower profile elections outside presidential years, while Democratic voters were less consistent. But under President Donald Trump, Republicans worry their base has shifted to include low propensity voters who turn out for him but are not as motivated as Democrats to show up when he’s not on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats have overperformed the top of the 2024 ticket in nearly every special election this year, flipped control of two state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania, halved the margins for two open US House seats in Florida and won a high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race by a resounding 10 points. While Democrats have said those results are a sign that voters are rejecting the Trump administration’s agenda, some top Republicans have raised alarms about turning out the base.\n\n“The political problem on the Republican side of the aisle is how to get our base to vote in off-cycle elections,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X, adding that it was time for the GOP establishment to learn from Trump’s political success.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, argued that Republicans must acknowledge that they are the party of low propensity voters, or people who don’t consistently show up to vote.\n\n“Special elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy,” he wrote on X.\n\nKirk, whose organization worked to engage low propensity voters in swing states during the 2024 election cycle, said politics is an “afterthought” for many of their voters and Republicans needed to “begin to fully fund the infrastructure to match the Democrat machine” ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nTurning out Trump loyalists who vote infrequently could be key to Republicans’ electoral fortunes, especially as the president’s agenda risks pushing away independent and moderate swing voters.\n\nRepublicans are also hoping to maintain control of the Virginia governor’s seat, despite the state’s Democratic lean and potentially build on their narrow House and Senate majorities.\n\nThe party that wins the White House historically loses seats in midterm cycle that follows, and voters have become increasingly willing to back split government – Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden all lost the House two years after first being elected.\n\nOne GOP political operative familiar with House campaigns said the party is still on offense and pointed to the 13 US House districts Trump won in 2024 that are held by Democrats. Republicans have also noted it’s too early to say what the political climate, the economy or Trump’s approval ratings will look like next year.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that Trump had a 43% approval rating, with 52% of Americans saying they agree tariffs on imported goods would do more harm than good and 57% viewing the president’s moves to shake up the economy as too erratic.\n\nThe party of low propensity voters\n\nThroughout the Trump era, Democrats have pointed to special and off-year election victories and closer-than-expected losses as evidence of a momentum advantage. During Trump’s first term, Democrats won a GOP-held Pittsburgh-area US House seat and an Alabama US Senate seat in special elections ahead of winning back the House in 2018. The party also significantly cut into GOP margins in a handful of special elections for deep-red US House seats in states such as Kansas and South Carolina.\n\nMike DuHaime, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, said Republicans would have to learn the same lesson Democrats did under Obama. Despite his 2008 and 2012 wins, Democrats suffered substantial downballot losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterms.\n\n“When it comes down to turning out Republicans, it takes money, it takes a message, and it takes an exciting candidate,” DuHaime said.\n\nHe pointed to Wisconsin, where Brad Schimel, a conservative state Supreme Court candidate endorsed by Trump, lost to liberal Susan Crawford. Though Schimel won 63% of the number of votes Trump received in November – exceeding the 60% mark Republicans estimated they needed to win – Crawford won 78% of the number of votes Vice President Kamala Harris received. Schimel lost despite Trump hosting a tele-rally to back him and Tesla CEO Elon Muskcombining with allied groups to spend more than $20 million to boost him.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel makes his concession speech to a crowd at his election night party on Tuesday in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. Andy Manis/AP\n\n“In Wisconsin, the money was certainly there,” DuHaime. “Whether or not the message and the candidate were there, that’s where the question lies.”\n\nSean Noble, an Arizona-based Republican strategist, said Republicans have failed over the years to build up a long-lasting get-out-the-vote infrastructure to compete with Democrats.\n\n“Democrats have an advantage over Republicans on what I would call a permanent infrastructure of turnout that Republicans have never taken the time or effort or money to really build and sustain over the long term,” he said.\n\nIn 2024, the Trump campaign and its allies made the risky decision to focus on turning out infrequent voters for the president. That bet paid off for the president, but Republicans in other races struggled to harness that support for themselves, even when they shared the ballot with Trump.\n\nWhile Trump won in Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin last year, the Republican Senate candidates he endorsed in those states lost after receiving several thousand fewer votes than the president. The Democratic Senate candidates were able to hold onto most of Vice President Kamala Harris’ support or, in the case of Ruben Gallego in Arizona, surpass it.\n\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres dismissed the idea that the Republican Party as a whole had become the party most likely to benefit from turning out infrequent voters.\n\n“Donald Trump is president in no small part because of low propensity voters who turn out to vote for him,” he told CNN. “That doesn’t mean they’re going to turn out to vote for other Republicans.”\n\nAyres said Democrats’ performance in recent special and off-year elections was reminiscent of the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats made huge gains in the House of Representatives. To avoid a similar fate next year, he said Republicans would need to avoid unpopular agenda items.\n\n“You might want to not tank the entire world economy with massive tariffs,” he said. “That might be a good start.”\n\nA 2018 repeat?\n\nDemocrats have argued that the issue for Republicans isn’t with infrequent voters, but with swing voters who elected Trump to lower prices and improve the economy.\n\n“Their problem is not that they plan for low propensity voters to vote in these special elections and they’re not showing up,” said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. “What they’re losing is Republicans, either to inaction or questioning their policies.”\n\nJennifer Konfrst, Iowa’s Democratic House Minority Leader, said Democrats in her state wereable to flip a Republican-held state Senate seat thanks to solid candidate recruitment – Democrat Mike Zimmer was an elected school board leader and longtime high school principal in district – and connecting with Democrats who are ready to re-engage in politics after their defeat in November.\n\n“There are some folks who have just been kind of unplugging for a while,” she said. “They are plugged back in now, and they are ready to fight.”\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrats pointed to high turnout and Crawford’s success in red areas as evidence that she’d won over Trump voters. Crawford won ten counties that backed Trump in November, including Green Bay’s Brown County, where Musk gave out two $1 million checks to voters at an event the weekend before the election.\n\nElon Musk gives a check to an audience member during a rally in support of a conservative state Supreme Court candidate in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Vincent Alban/Reuters\n\n“There were clearly MAGA voters that were voting for Brad Schimel, but there were a lot of Republican voters that were voting for Susan Crawford,” Patrick Guarasci, a senior advisor to Crawford’s campaign, told CNN.\n\nNational Democrats have become increasingly bullish on their chances of winning back the House after Tuesday’s races.\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin said recent special elections showed “voters moving en masse towards the Democratic Party,” during a press call this week.\n\nState party leaders are echoing that optimism. Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried said this week’s special election results should scare any Republican who won by less than 15 pointslast November, while in Wisconsin, chair Ben Wikler said voters in his state sent a clear message: “Democrats are back.”",

      "full_content": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nThe Chinese military officials in brown uniforms fan out around rows of young trees, shoveling soil into freshly dug pits. The camera pans to the most senior leaders one by one, in order of rank. But one prominent face is conspicuously absent.\n\nThe news segment, aired Wednesday night on China’s state broadcaster, features a tree-planting event in the outskirts of the capital Beijing – an annual springtime tradition for the country’s military leadership spanning more than four decades.\n\nBut Gen. He Weidong, the second-highest-ranking uniformed officer in the People’s Liberation Army, was nowhere to be seen. Nor was he named as a participant in a report by the official state news agency.\n\nGen. He’s absence from the high-profile event has fueled ongoing speculation that the second-ranking vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) may have become the latest – and most senior – casualty in leader Xi Jinping’s purge of the military’s top ranks.\n\nAs Xi’s No.2 general, He shares a long-standing relationship with the Chinese leader, dating back decades to the early days of their careers in the coastal province of Fujian.\n\nRumors about an investigation against He first surfaced among the Chinese dissident community following China’s annual political meetings last month. The 67-year-old hasn’t appeared in public for three weeks since the closing ceremony of the country’s rubber-stamp legislature on March 11.\n\nThe Chinese government has offered little in the way of clearing the air.\n\nWhen asked about He’s situation at a news briefing on March 27, Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said: “There is no information on this matter, and we are not aware of the situation.”\n\nIt is now unclear what has happened to He, who also sits on the Communist Party’s 24-member Politburo.\n\nThree weeks out of the public eye is not unheard of for a top general without a public-facing role and there is always a chance he resurfaces. But his no-show at a well-choreographed annual propaganda event stands out in a political system deeply attuned to the importance of symbolism.\n\n“Clearly the absence of one CMC vice chair is important symbolically,” said James Char, a longtime PLA expert and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\nSimilar to the Communist Party Congresses and annual “two sessions” political gatherings, “it’s important for all the major figures that the rest of the world know of to show up to be in the same picture, because it helps to demonstrate the power and – more importantly – the unity of the party,” Char said.\n\nReading the “tree leaves”\n\nIn the opaque world of Chinese politics, observers have long leaned on arcane signals of Communist Party traditions and protocol to interpret what is going on behind the scenes. The discipline, known as “tea-leaf reading,” has become more relevant than ever in Xi’s era as he centralizes power into his own hands and makes the decision-making process even more obscure.\n\nAnd now, some experts are scouring this week’s events for clues on the fate of one of Xi’s top generals.\n\nThe annual ritual began as part of a nationwide tree-planting campaign launched by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in late 1981, following devastating floods he blamed on rampant deforestation. It was billed as a patriotic, selfless undertaking in “greening the motherland, building socialism and benefiting future generations.”\n\nThe following spring, Deng, then chairman of the CMC, planted the first tree of the campaign, setting a tradition that has since been carried on by successive Chinese leaders and military top brass.\n\nWednesday marked “the 43rd consecutive year the CMC leadership has collectively participated in the voluntary tree-planting activity in the capital,” said Xinhua, the state news agency.\n\nSince Xi came to power in late 2012, his two vice chairmen on the CMC had led military officers to plant trees without fail every spring – until He’s rare absence on Wednesday.\n\nThe first-ranking CMC vice chairman, Gen. Zhang Youxia, attended the event, so did two other generals on the commission, Liu Zhenli and Zhang Shengmin.\n\nThe only other uniformed CMC member who did not show up was Adm. Miao Hua, who was suspended under investigation in November for “serious violations of discipline” – a common euphemism for corruption and disloyalty.\n\n“I think He’s absence is quite telling, but again, no one can be absolutely sure,” Char said. “There’s another school of thought, which is He Weidong was involved in the last two weeks with the preparations for the military exercises around Taiwan.”\n\nStarting from Tuesday, combined forces of the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command held surprise exercises around Taiwan for two straight days, testing capabilities to blockade the self-ruling island, simulate strikes on its ports and other critical infrastructure, and launch long-range live-fire strikes.\n\nThe commander of the Eastern Theater Command from 2019 to 2022 was He. It was during his tenure that the Eastern Theater Command staged massive military drills and fired missiles around Taiwan in August 2022, in retaliation against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.\n\nA prolonged absence from public view does not always signal trouble for Chinese officials. Some have resurfaced and resumed their duties. It’s also not uncommon for officials to be taken in for questioning by graft busters to assist investigations into colleagues.\n\nLast November, Defense Minister Dong Jun was reported to be under investigation for corruption by the Financial Times, citing US officials. China’s Defense Ministry dismissed the report as a “sheer fabrication.” Dong reemerged in public a week later. The minister was also seen attending Wednesday’s tree-planting event on the state broadcaster.\n\nWhen Chinese leader Xi Jinping began his third term in 2022, he stacked the Central Military Commission with six loyalists. Now, one of them has been expelled from the Communist Party for corruption, another was suspended under investigation, and a third missed a high-profile event this week. Yue Yuewei/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nMilitary purges\n\nAfter coming to power, Xi consolidated control over the world’s largest military by taking down powerful generals from rival factions and replacing them with allies and loyal proteges.\n\nBut a decade on, having structurally overhauled the People’s Liberation Army and stacked its top ranks with his own men, Xi is still knee-deep in his seemingly endless struggle against graft and disloyalty – and is increasingly turning against his own handpicked loyalists.\n\nSince the summer of 2023, more than a dozen high-ranking figures in China’s defense establishment have been ousted in a sweeping purge that focused on the country’s nuclear force and equipment procurement, including two defense ministers promoted to the CMC by Xi.\n\nThe ongoing turmoil roiling the senior ranks of the PLA has raised questions over Xi’s ability to end systemic corruption in the military and enhance its combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Recurring purges of the senior-most PLA leaders indicate that Xi Jinping distrusts his officer corps,” said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the RSIS.\n\n“The constant removal of so many senior officers, as well as the extent of corruption running to the very top undoubtedly has an effect on the PLA’s morale, and likely also its military capabilities,” Thompson added.\n\nBut some analysts noted that by this point, the PLA may have well become accustomed to the shake-ups in its high command.\n\n“Leadership purges in the PLA seem to have become normalized to a point that it’s just part and parcel of being the PLA,” said Collin Koh, another research fellow at RSIS.\n\nThe Chinese military may have started to grow accustomed to the purges – to a point where it is able to isolate them from its daily operational activities and go on with business as usual, Koh noted.\n\n“It does not necessarily mean that because of the purges, the PLA has started to relent on readiness. These purges might potentially have the effect of reminding the PLA to do their work better – if anything, if you want to escape the purges, then one way to do that is to obey what the party is telling you, which is to be prepared for conflict,” he said.\n\nA close confidant\n\nLike Miao, He is widely believed to have forged close personal ties with Xi during their overlapping years in Fujian, where the future Chinese leader was rising through the ranks as a local official in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBoth He and Miao spent most of their early career serving in the former 31st Group Army in Fujian, which became a major power base for Xi. A string of military officers hailing from the 31st Group Army have been fast-tracked for promotion since Xi took power in late 2012.\n\nGen. He was no exception. In 2013, he was promoted to commander of Jiangsu Military District; less than a year later, he became commander of the Shanghai Garrison. In 2016, he was promoted yet again to command ground forces of the Western Theater Command, which oversees China’s border with India.\n\nHe was promoted to full general in 2017, when he became commander of the Eastern Theater Command, responsible for leading any military invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nBut the ultimate sign of Xi’s trust in He came at the 20th Party Congress in 2022, when He landed the CMC vice chairmanship – an unusually rapid rise for an official who hadn’t served on the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nDuring that leadership reshuffle, Xi stacked the CMC with six loyalists. If confirmed to be under investigation, He would be the powerful military body’s first sitting vice chairman to be purged by Xi and the third member on the current CMC to fall from grace.\n\nThe last time a sitting CMC vice chair was purged was more than three decades ago, when then-Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was ousted for sympathizing with student protesters in the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement.\n\n“What happens finally to He Weidong gives us a window into how the political system in China is being restructured further under Xi Jinping,” Char said, noting the PLA’s reform of its rigid political structure.\n\n“I don’t think anyone in the system now is irreplaceable,” he said. “This is what a political strong man does. He’s ruthless… he’s continuously purging his own ranks to keep his generals on their toes.”",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs are facing blowback from all corners – a market sell-off, foreign retaliation, anger from corporate America and skepticism from the Federal Reserve chairman and some allies in Congress. So far, the president is defiant in the face of the global turbulence.\n\nAfter a day and a half of mixed messages from Trump and top administration officials over whether the tariffs were the start of a negotiation or a more permanent change to US economic policy, Trump didn’t use Friday to deliver clarity. He didn’t venture out into the country to sell his plan from the floor of an American factory or to showcase a business or community that he believes will benefit from the tariffs.\n\nInstead, the president chose to begin his day on the golf course in Florida.\n\nThe financial markets were already falling by the time he left his Mar-a-Lago resort for a short ride to the Trump International Golf Club. He waved to onlookers as his presidential limousine rolled through the gates.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback JPMorgan executive says inflation and recession likely from tariffs 02:25 - Source: CNN JPMorgan executive says inflation and recession likely from tariffs 02:25\n\nWhile the president has traveled to Florida nearly every weekend since taking office, he chose to leave the White House a day earlier than normal, creating a split-screen of being on a golf course in one of the wealthiest enclaves in America as economic worries deepened.\n\nUS stocks plunged a second straight day after China said Friday it would impose 34% reciprocal tariffs on imports of US goods, a development that put a spotlight on just how much is outside of Trump’s control as his economic team tries to pull off an unprecedented high-wire act after launching the most expansive and disruptive tariffs in more than a century. The Dow closed in correction, down more than 10% from its record high in December.\n\nA White House official said the president’s “full attention” was on the tariff policy Friday, noting he continued to send updates about conversations he had with foreign leaders. The official dismissed the suggestion that Trump was rattled by the market reaction, saying the president has long warned of short-term pain created by his tariff vision and America First agenda.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump said countries were already coming to him looking to make deals, suggesting he was open to negotiating with foreign leaders before the tariff deadline arrived Friday at midnight. But his message Friday morning sounded different.\n\n“To the many investors coming into the United States and investing massive amounts of money, my policies will never change,” Trump wrote in a social media message posted shortly before he arrived at the golf course. “This is a great time to get rich, richer than ever before!!!”\n\nMixed messages and market chaos\n\nThe fluid nature of Trump’s own view of the purpose tied to his new tariffs threatened to upend an explicit effort by his top economic officials to deliver a unified message that the reciprocal tariffs would be implemented on April 9, period – despite the fact that Trump’s own advisers were divided before the announcement over how far to go.\n\nBehind the scenes, it reflected the necessity of delivering certainty to a market consumed by anything but for nearly two weeks. The need for unity was stressed to allies and surrogates in talking points circulated on Capitol Hill on Thursday. But message discipline – or lack thereof – didn’t address the other looming threat made acutely real on Friday: retaliation.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear Rubio’s response to 'crashing' markets after tariff news 01:26 - Source: CNN Hear Rubio’s response to 'crashing' markets after tariff news 01:26\n\nWhile the president sent several messages throughout the day, an adviser said Trump was intentionally not speaking publicly or taking questions on camera as the trading markets remained opened on Friday. Even though the White House has kept up a strident defense of the tariff strategy, a rising sense of frustration and anger at the universal global reaction was troubling.\n\n“The president isn’t guided by the market, but of course he watches it like everyone else,” a Republican political adviser to Trump told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid discussing West Wing deliberations.\n\nOne person who spoke to Trump amid the market sell-off on Thursday described the president as largely sanguine about his plan, suggesting the tariffs were only one aspect of a broader economic policy that was still coming into shape. But another person who is in touch with the president said he is getting close to his threshold for withstanding drops in the market.\n\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on April 4, 2025. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMany outside allies of the president have been confused at the messaging surrounding the tariffs, which veered from calling them “reciprocal” to pledging they would be “generous” to the eventual plan, which was a different calculation altogether.\n\n“It didn’t help they tariffed islands with no people and no exports,” one ally to the president said.\n\nA central question was how much Trump was open to negotiating and how aware he was of the deep criticism. The White House fielded calls from business owners and industry lobbyists, but it was unclear how aware Trump was of the blowback and whether that would shape his posture in the days leading up to next week’s second tariff deadline.\n\nA 10% tariff on all US imports will go into effect on Saturday, with even higher tariffs slated for April 9.\n\nTrump criticized Beijing for retaliating against his tariffs, claiming that China “panicked” after Trump unveiled an additional 34% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the US, on top of a 20% tariff previously imposed with the goal of curbing fentanyl from China to the US.\n\nThe Trump administration has encouraged countries ensnared in the tariffs not to panic – but to pick up the phone. Trump has criticized those – like Canada and China – that have pledged to retaliate.\n\n“China played it wrong, they panicked - the one thing they cannot afford to do!” Trump posted on truth social after Beijing unveiled 34% retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to the added tariff on Chinese imports that brings total charges to 54%.\n\nDespite adamance by senior trade hand Peter Navarro and Vice President JD Vance that the new tariffs represent a permanent reset in global trade, others in Trump’s orbit have acknowledged the president’s natural inclination to strike deals.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to be the last country to try to negotiate with @realdonaldtrump,” his son Eric posted on X. “The first to negotiate will win – the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life.”\n\nSome countries are trying to get to the front of that line. Trump is actively negotiating with Vietnam, India, and Israel to negotiate bespoke trade deals ahead of the new tariff deadline, a senior advisor told CNN. Such discussions could provide an off-ramp for Trump – if the two sides reach agreement.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump said the general secretary of Vietnam’s Communist Party, Tô Lâm, reached out with a proposal to “cut their tariffs down to zero” if a mutual agreement can be struck.\n\nFlak from Powell, corporate America\n\nThe president on Friday also took the unusual step of trying to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, continuing a long-running critique of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\n“He is always ‘late,’ but he could now change his image, and quickly,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Cut interest rates, Jerome, and stop playing politics.”\n\nPowell spoke at an event in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, where he said the central bank was taken aback by the scope of Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“We face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation,” Powell said. “While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.”\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing Annual Conference in Arlington, Virginia, on April 4. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nCorporate America, meanwhile, is irate, according to conversations with a dozen chief executive officers.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been fielding angry calls from executives, some of whom are weighing whether to sue the administration over the tariffs – and the national emergency Trump has asserted justifies them. A stronger-than-expected jobs report on Friday, one executive told CNN, should be seen by a judge if there is litigation as further proof no such national emergency exists.\n\nCompanies have been reticent to attack the administration’s policies in court or on the airwaves for fear of rhetorical attacks – or worse. When one company suggested privately to Trump officials that their proposed tariffs would simply raise prices on goods with no effect on their factory locations, the official suggested they would double the tariff to get the company to move.\n\nBessent is among the many Trump officials who had been advocating for a more nuanced approach to tariffs than what Trump unveiled, a policy that was immediately met with skepticism for how it was engineered.\n\nAfter the rollout – and a round of interview with major television networks – the newly minted Treasury secretary found himself in awkward company as he joined a reunion dinner at Café Milano with most former Treasury secretaries – a bipartisan tradition going back decades. “Liberation Day,” according to sources, quickly became the subject of conversation, though the scheduling was unintentional.\n\nA second CEO close to the White House says the breadth and extremity of the president’s tariff policy was shocking, especially considering how many companies have already adjusted their businesses to align with Trump’s perceived policy goals.\n\n“It was his first administration that caused [manufacturers] to move from China to Vietnam,” the CEO said. “Now, we’re punishing them, too. There’s no endgame.”\n\nTrump trained his anger on China during his first term, leading many manufacturers like Nike, Gap, Levi’s, and Dell to begin shifting operations to Vietnam, in order to save costs and set up shop in friendlier territories. But now Trump is hitting Vietnam with a 46% tariff, leaving many executives exasperated – and planning to raise prices rather than relocate yet again.\n\nIn the words of another executive: “We’re just going to have to make fewer shirts and sell them for more money.”\n\nDespite objections from many within his Cabinet over unnecessarily angering allies and ratting global markets, Trump’s views on tariffs are ossified – and amplified by his close counselor Navarro. Feedback from dissenters has fallen on deaf ears.\n\n“The problem is, it’s the president’s view and it’s not widely shared,” said the executive close to the White House of Trump’s commitment to lowering trade deficits. “On this issue, he seems immovable.”\n\nOn Wall Street, group chats on messaging apps have lit up over how or whether to publicly speak out against a president who has shown a penchant for retribution. Other private sector executives are debating whether to hire a Trump-friendly lobbyist to try to seek an exemption from the policy.\n\nA desire to refocus on tax cuts\n\nAfter weeks of internal debate over the reciprocal tariffs – and frequent mention by the president of his love for the tool – many of his allies have grown weary of discussing them and feel it’s time to turn attention to his tax plans.\n\nIn part, that is because they believe the tax cuts – particularly eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, both promises he made as a candidate – are easier to understand and more of a political winner than the tariffs, which are complicated and run the risk of raising prices.\n\nThat tax plan is still a work in progress on Capitol Hill, where narrow majorities and divergent policy views have already bubbled up during negotiations over the procedural mechanism that will be used to move it through the House and Senate on a partisan basis.\n\nBut the effort needed from Trump’s economic team to both put in place historic tariffs and get a tax bill over the finish line also spilled into the internal scramble leading up to Trump’s announcement as advisers grappled with whether to use some kind of universal baseline tariff or setting a country-by-country number that captured a measurement trade economists in both parties panned as nonsensical.\n\nOn Monday, Trump asked for the list that would form the basis of the Rose Garden chart he would hold up. Throughout, two of Trump’s top advisors shuffled up and down Pennsylvania Avenue to negotiate with congressional Republicans over the pathways to their critical tax proposal.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who had successfully made the case for reciprocal tariffs to Trump for months, and Bessent, were also running point on the tax efforts. They provided little intel on tariffs to desperate Republicans on the Hill during their visits.\n\nBut in their absence, two of Trump’s most strident tariff supporters – Navarro and Lutnick – helped shape where Trump would ultimately land.\n\nCNN’s Kevin Liptak and Alayna Treene contributed to this report.",

      "full_content": "Happy Friday, newsletter readers! President Donald Trump’s tariffs (and the market reaction) are the story of the week, but a key step toward more of his domestic policy agenda is underway right now in the Senate — and our Congress team breaks down how it’s spotlighting some divides in the GOP’s narrow majorities. And ahead of this weekend’s “Meet the Press,” Kristen Welker goes through the three key questions Trump and his administration face on the tariffs. Plus, we answer a reader question about Elon Musk’s role in government.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n— Scott Bland\n\nGOP concerns about tax cut strategy and Medicaid loom over Senate budget\n\nBy Julie Tsirkin, Syedah Asghar, Sahil Kapur, and Frank Thorp V\n\nAs President Donald Trump’s tariffs grab headlines, Senate Republicans are moving through the procedural steps to set up Trump’s tax plans and other major domestic spending priorities. But it’s not going to be easy for them to agree on exactly what to do.\n\nSenate Republicans managed Thursday to advance their massive budget plan to debate, but not before an unexpected delay caused by some of their own who have concerns about their strategy on tax cuts and potential cuts to Medicaid.\n\nPrior to debate commencing on the measure Friday, the delay occurred as those Republicans met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to talk through their concerns.\n\nSome more centrist senators are worried about a budget change the party is using to slap a zero-dollar price tag on extending Trump’s tax cuts, which are estimated by the official scorekeeper in Congress to cost $4.6 trillion over a decade.\n\nRepublicans are delaying a reckoning over the issue after they bypassed the Senate parliamentarian on the question of whether they can use a “current policy” baseline to treat extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire this year, as costing nothing. But that means the move could be challenged later, and it could potentially blow up the bill if the parliamentarian rules against it — unless the Senate votes to overrule her, which some have likened to nuking the 60-vote filibuster rule.\n\nA handful of Republicans have concerns that they will be asked to do that later in the process.\n\nAnother senator, Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he has “a big concern” about the bill slashing Medicaid — and took his concerns directly to Trump in a phone call Thursday evening before the vote.\n\nTwenty-one percent “of my state receives Medicaid — CHIP or Medicaid. So, I’ve made clear I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts. And I thought the president’s assurance to me tonight was completely unequivocal,” Hawley added, saying that assurance made him comfortable voting to begin the process.\n\nThat’s easier said than done. The House-approved budget, which Trump endorsed, makes it mathematically impossible for Republicans to achieve their targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. Lawmakers say they want to cut waste and fraud, along with imposing a potential work requirement for Medicaid. Beyond that, they haven’t identified ways to reduce spending.\n\nThree questions about Trump’s tariffs\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs have rattled the markets and raised new concerns about potential price hikes. While Trump campaigned on implementing tariffs, more questions remain as they take effect.\n\nFirst, how will the Trump administration explain the tariffs to the American public?\n\n“People don’t understand what the plan is, what the strategy is,” former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., told “Meet the Press NOW” on Thursday, later adding: “There are Republicans on the Hill who are wondering: Where are we going?”\n\nAnother key question: What will the economic fallout look like?\n\nTrump warned that his trade policies would cause a “little disturbance” in his speech to Congress last month. And we’re already seeing markets rattled by the new tariffs, raising questions about the possibility of a national — or even global — recession.\n\nSome Republicans have indicated that the administration may need to rethink its policies if they result in an economic downturn.\n\n“If they make things better, they should want more; if it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told our Capitol Hill team on Wednesday.\n\nAnd lastly: When are Americans going to reap the benefits of this trade policy?\n\nTrump told me back in December that he “can’t guarantee” American families will not pay more, later adding that tariffs “are going to make us rich.”\n\nThe president also said on Air Force One last night that it could take “a year and a half to two years” to ramp up American manufacturing. But the administration has yet to lay out exactly when everyday Americans will start to benefit from these tariffs.\n\nWe’ll delve into these questions and more on “Meet the Press” this Sunday with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Sen. Jim Lankford, R-Okla., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nI also talked to our friends over at NBCU Academy about how I prepare for a “Meet the Press” interview.

Here’s this week’s reader question:\n\n“Is Elon Musk receiving a government salary?”\n\nTo answer that, we turned to national political reporter Ben Kamisar. Here’s his response:\n\nElon Musk is what’s known as a “special government employee,” a tag given to outside experts brought into the government to provide their expertise on a part-time basis without becoming a full-time administration employee. He’s not drawing a salary but does have to abide by certain rules like conflict-of-interest guardrails and is only expected to work 130 days of a 365-day period. Here’s more on the “special government employee” position and how the White House says it’s handling Elon Musk, particularly around the question of conflicts of interest.\n\nThat’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

      "full_content": "Photo: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nOne of the interpretations often heard about the 2024 elections is that the outcome represented a conservative “correction” for the progressive excesses of the Biden presidency. And indeed, it’s possible to view much of American political history as a left-right oscillation in which one major party’s dominance is countered by a reaction benefiting the other major party. Thus, for example, the Hoover administration’s conservative ineffectiveness against the ravages of the Great Depression led to a New Deal revolution that was mitigated significantly by a bipartisan “conservative coalition” in Congress and eventually the Republican landslide of 1952.\n\nBut as should be abundantly clear by now, any hopes that Trump 2.0 would represent a mild and conservative “correction” of anything in living memory are hallucinatory. Indeed, it’s as good a time as any to stop using the word “conservative” for this band of disruptive revolutionaries. Many of them believe America went crucially wrong not in 2021 (when Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat failed) or in 2008 (when Barack Obama was elected president), or even in the 1960s, when America’s “family values” were allegedly challenged if not destroyed, but instead near the beginning of the 20th century. That’s why on the far right the original devil figures of the left in the MAGA version of history are Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, the “elitist” progressives who seized permanent power for judges, bureaucrats, and globalists in pursuit of values like equality and social justice that were not part of the Founders’ vision of this country.\n\nAs MSNBC’s Ryan Teague Beckwith explains, much of Trump’s actual agenda represents an effort to repeal the policies of the 20th century:\n\nThanks to Elon Musk and Russell Vought, we are getting a vivid demonstration that MAGA plans to demolish the “deep state” are essentially an attack on the late-19th-century introduction of civil-service protections of public employees. The effort to purge DEI policies and programs from both the public and private sectors represent a conscious reversal of the civil-rights movement’s premise that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow required affirmative action to create equal opportunity. And most obviously, the vast expansions of executive power being sought by Trump represent the belief that absolutely any means are justified to radically reverse the trajectory of American public policy prior to Trump’s own accession to power.\n\nThere are a host of conservative intellectuals who have spilled many gallons of ink challenging the MAGA movement’s claim to represent the conservative tradition or the Republican Party’s heritage. But history aside, it’s the smash-and-grab style of Trump 2.0 that is most alien to the temperament associated with many generations of conservative thinkers and activists. This is an administration (with the concurrence of its party) that has arrived like a thief in the night. It is seizing power and enemy turf with a speed and ruthlessness that suggest a determination to take steps that cannot be easily reversed by the very electorate that is supposed to have given Trump a virtually unlimited mandate. The initial phases of the mass-deportation program supervised by MAGA radical Stephen Miller all but courts the appearance of impropriety as masked secret policemen abduct people legally in this country. As former Republican U.S. senator John Danforth argued on the eve of Trump’s rise to power, the very founder of Anglo-American conservatism, Edmund Burke, would have been appalled by the contemporary American right:\n\nThe essence of Burke’s conservatism was his belief that political change should be gradual and not revolutionary and achieved through existing institutions. The result would be step-by-step change that would not be perfect in anyone’s eyes, but it would be better than the tyranny of absolutism that had terrorized France. For Burke, the greatest threat to society wasn’t some mistaken governmental policy but absolutists so certain of their own opinions that they would stop at nothing to force their opinions on the nation.\n\nIt’s a distinctive trait of Trump 2.0 that its leading figures prefer to achieve change outside of “existing institutions,” since the destruction of these institutions is a big part of their agenda. That’s why tariffs, federal budget and personnel cuts, and changes in federal agency duties that the administration might well have secured through the Congress Republicans completely control are instead being pursued by executive order and implemented by quasi-legal organizations like DOGE and an OMB director who believes the president should have the right to impound every nickel of appropriated dollars. Trump’s narcissism is perfectly matched to a cult of personality that is diametrically opposed to the measured and balanced approach to governing always associated with conservatism.\n\nIt’s no wonder that the first truly national protest movement of the second Trump administration goes by the headline “Hands Off!” It’s a movement with no demands beyond the restoration of the status quo ante enjoyed by its members before Trump and Musk and their allies assaulted their values, their interests, and their peace of mind. These protesters are the real conservatives in America today.\n\nSo you can call MAGA folks by all sorts of labels from “reactionary nihilists” to ultranationalists to the “alt-right” to apostles of an American Greatness associated with the distant past. But they’re not conservatives unless that term has lost all meaning. Trump and his acolytes are trying to create a very different country than the one whose leadership they have inherited. In the America most of us cherish, they see nothing worth conserving.",

Not going [to] happen,” the former Florida senator concluded.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have been detaining foreign college students for deportation for aligning themselves with the extreme Islamist group, Breitbart News reported.\n\nIn the case of Rumesya Ozturk, a Turkish national and Tufts University graduate student who was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE officers while she walked down the street near the Massachusetts campus in a now-viral video, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said she was “engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.”\n\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, D.C.

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nThe total cost of the US military’s operation against the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen is nearing $1 billion in just under three weeks, even as the attacks have had limited impact on destroying the terror group’s capabilities, three people briefed on the campaign’s progress told CNN.\n\nThe military offensive, which was launched on March 15, has already used hundreds of millions of dollars worth of munitions for strikes against the group, including JASSM long-range cruise missiles, JSOWs, which are GPS-guided glide bombs, and Tomahawk missiles, the sources said.\n\nB-2 bombers out of Diego Garcia are also being used against the Houthis, and an additional aircraft carrier as well as several fighter squadrons and air defense systems will soon be moved into the Central Command region, defense officials said this week.\n\nOne of the sources said the Pentagon will likely need to request supplemental funding from Congress to continue the operation, but may not receive it — the offensive has already been criticized on both sides of the aisle, and even Vice President JD Vance said he thought the operation was “a mistake” in a Signal chat published by The Atlantic last week.\n\nThe Pentagon has not publicly disclosed what impact the daily US military strikes have actually had on the Houthis. Officials from the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, US Central Command, US Indo Pacific Command, Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, and the State Department told Congress in recent days that the strikes have eliminated several members of Houthi leadership and destroyed some Houthi military sites.\n\nBut they acknowledged that the group has still been able to fortify their bunkers and maintain weapons stockpiles underground, much as they did during the strikes that the Biden administration carried out for over a year, the sources said. And it has been difficult to determine precisely how much the Houthis still have stockpiled, a defense official said.\n\n“They’ve taken out some sites, but that hasn’t affected the Houthis’ ability to continue shooting at ships in the Red Sea or shooting down US drones,” said one of the sources briefed on the operation. “Meanwhile, we are burning through readiness—munitions, fuel, deployment time.”\n\nThe New York Times first reported details of the military operation shared in briefings with Congress.\n\nThe operational tempo of the strikes is also higher now that CENTCOM Commander Erik Kurilla no longer needs higher-level approval to conduct strikes—a shift from the Biden administration and a return to the policies of Trump’s first term, when military commanders were given more freedom to carry out missions in order to achieve “a strategic effect” as opposed to needing case-by-case approval from the White House for each strike and raid.\n\nIt’s still not clear, though, how long the Trump administration plans to continue the offensive, which CENTCOM has described as a “24/7” operation. Trump has said it will last until the Houthis stop attacking Red Sea shipping, but despite weeks of bombing the Houthis have continued launching missiles and drones at targets in and over the Red Sea. Earlier this week, they shot down another US MQ-9 Reaper drone—the second MQ9 shot down since the offensive began last month, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nAnother defense official noted, however, that ballistic missile attacks from the Houthis against Israel have decreased in the last week, and said the relentless US bombing campaign has made it more difficult for the Houthis to communicate and hit things accurately because they’ve been forced to “keep their heads down.”\n\nThe people briefed on the operation also all described the Houthi officials who have been killed in the US strikes as mid-level, akin to “middle management.” One exception is the Houthi official in charge of the group’s drone operations, who was killed in a strike last month, officials said.\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz referenced that Houthi leader in the Signal chat in March that was disclosed by The Atlantic. Waltz said in that chat that the Houthis’ “top missile guy” was killed when he walked into his girlfriend’s building in Yemen which “collapsed” amid US strikes.\n\nTwo of the sources briefed on the ongoing operation said that comment is indicative of how the US military under Trump is taking a more “expansive” approach to the strikes than the Biden administration did, in terms of being less concerned about collateral damage. The Houthis have long used more populated areas to conceal command and control sites, the sources said.\n\nBut one of the defense officials said the building was not a civilian apartment building, but rather a meeting place for Houthi officials, and that the US military is using precision munitions and taking other measures to mitigate the risk of civilian casualties.\n\nThe large-scale operation has also rattled some officials at US Indo-Pacific Command, who have complained in recent days and weeks about the large number of long-range weapons being expended by CENTCOM against the Houthis, particularly the JASSMs and Tomahawks, the sources said. Those weapons would be critical in the event of a war with China, and military planners at INDOPACOM are concerned that the CENTCOM operation could have a negative impact on US military readiness in the Pacific.\n\nOne of the defense officials also downplayed that concern, calling it “an exaggeration.”\n\n“We employ precision munitions in every strike. We retain authority to use the full capacity of our deployed forces in the Middle East region against the Houthis,” the official said. “We have no concern about employment of long-range weapons when and if needed to maximize our effectiveness.",

He described the tariffs as \"kind reciprocal\" and will focus on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S.\n\nThe new measures -- which Trump described as \"historic\" -- include a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all trading partners and further, more targeted punitive levies on certain countries, including China, the European Union and Taiwan.\n\n\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" he said, adding, \"because we are being very kind.\"\n\nHendrick Svendsen, the owner of a furniture store in Merriam, Kansas, told ABC News on Wednesday he has decided to close his store due to Trump's tariffs announcement.\n\n\"We just made the decision we are going to close down, we will be out in August,\" Svendsen said.\n\nHe said there is no way to continue the store's operation by using American-made products, with 90% of their items made overseas.\n\n\"I don't think that furniture manufacturing is ever going to come back to the U.S. North Carolina, where it used to be made, it's like a ghost town,\" Svendsen said on ABC News Live. \"When it comes to skill and workers, I don't think we have that in the U.S.\"\n\nFurniture manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined over the past few months, with 336,900 reported in February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick holds a chart as President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, April 2, 2025, in Washingto, D.C. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nSimon Bryant, a restaurant owner in San Francisco, told ABC station KGO that food costs have already been difficult to manage due to bird flu, and the tariffs could make things even more challenging.\n\n\"The reality is everyone's paying higher prices,\" Bryant said. \"We have to figure out what to do as a community.\"\n\nBut, there are individuals who are optimistic about the tariffs, including Duane Paddock, the owner of a Chevrolet dealership in Buffalo, New York. He told ABC News Live that he has seen the best sales in 13 years.\n\nWhile he is uncertain of the exact impact of the tariffs, he said he is hopeful that Trump's announcement is the \"best thing for our country\" and that his dealership will continue to \"keep prices as low as possible and do our fair share to help the customers.\"\n\n\"Whether President Trump was a Democrat or Republican, I have to have faith in my president and that's what I choose to do,\" Paddock said.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of these tariffs allowing for products to be made in the United States.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity for people to get back with manufacturing and have an opportunity to have a great middle-class life and increase their compensation over the course of time,\" Paddock said.\n\nJames Evans, a manufacturer who produces car parts in the U.S., told Baltimore ABC affiliate WMAR the tariffs will be \"great for us in six months to a year probably.\"\n\n\"I think in three, four years, it should set us up and other people that are manufacturing here in America for success,\" Evans said. \"I'm fine with dealing with some headaches for the next six months to a year and hopefully things go the way I think they're gonna go and then we'll be good, but maybe not. Only time will tell.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, shrimp catchers are also pleased with Trump's tariff announcement. Rocky Magwood told Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV that he will now be able to \"sell everything\" he catches. According to the Southern Shrimp Alliance, 94% of shrimp consumed in the United States is imported, with India and Ecuador supplying nearly 70%.\n\n\"This is the greatest stuff we see,\" Magwood said. \"Maybe people will want to buy our shrimp more. I can't say on the politics one way or another because I'm not into politics. That's not what feeds my family.\"\n\nBut Leah Ashburn, the president and CEO of Highland Brewing in North Carolina, said moving to American production is not feasible in all industries, especially her company, which relies on aluminum to make beer cans. While there are existing aluminum manufacturers in the United States, Canada is still the fourth-largest primary aluminum provider, behind China, India and Russia, according to the Canadian government.\n\nIn 2021, the United States accounted for less than 2% of global aluminum production, according to a Congressional Research Service Report.\n\n\"The U.S. simply can't pivot to making aluminum cans,\" Ashburn told WLOS. \"Mining is not done here. Aluminum is 95% brought in from other countries, and we are dependent on Canada. The effort to make aluminum here would be complex, costly and take a lot of time. It won't come soon enough.\"\n\nShe also said her business cannot raise their prices because consumers have \"hit their limit on what they're going to pay for a six-pack.\"\n\nThe 10% baseline tariff rate goes into effect on April 5, according to senior White House officials. The \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs go into effect April 9 at 12:01 a.m., officials said, and will affect roughly 60 countries.\n\nABC News' Jaclyn Lee, Alexandra Hutzler, Lauren Lantry and Michael Pappano contributed to this report",

      "full_content": "Trump launches a trade war. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nTo those of us who have been closely watching the slow unfolding of Donald Trump’s legislative agenda in Congress, it all looks like a giant Jenga tower: imposing but very fragile. Partly because of his party’s narrow margins of control (particularly in the House) and partly because of the “one big, beautiful bill” strategy of cramming nearly everything he wants accomplished into a single budget-reconciliation measure, the success of the whole initiative will likely come down to a few all-or-nothing votes whereby the package will fly to Trump’s desk or collapse in immense disarray. And while the success enjoyed so far by Mike Johnson and John Thune in keeping the troops in line may boost the odds of it all working out in the end, the slow forward momentum of the budget process has depended in no small part on tricks used to delay the resolution of major differences of opinion dividing House and Senate Republicans and factions in each chamber.\n\nEven as Congress creeps toward enactment of a budget resolution this month, we don’t know the level of tax or spending cuts it will impose, much less a lot of the details, including hot-button topics like Medicaid benefit cuts.\n\nEvents outside Congress have already stressed those working inside Congress: notably the Elon Musk–led DOGE initiative that has usurped congressional authority while mobilizing public opposition to the austerity measures Republicans intend to pursue legislatively as well as via executive actions. GOP lawmakers have been repeatedly blindsided by DOGE raids on federal agencies, often accompanied by cartoon-villain boasts from Musk and his minions about the damage they are inflicting on “useless” federal employees and the “parasites” they serve. But they cannot object to this largely nihilistic behavior without displeasing the Boss, so they’ve bitten their tongues.\n\nBut now Trump himself has given his congressional allies a whole new cross to bear: his audacious and market-crashing global tariff regime. Even those who believe Trump is doing the right thing in seeking to reorder the entire global trading system (probably a minority of congressional Republicans), and that it will eventually produce positive results for U.S. growth and employment, have to acknowledge (as Trump has) that the short-term consequences could be painful. For that very reason, the period of transition to the planned Fortress America will likely be very rocky politically. Will Senate and particularly House Republicans facing difficult contests in 2026 simply salute and march off the cliff in lockstep support of Trump’s legislative agenda if his job-approval ratings go significantly underwater? Will they demand modifications in that budget-reconciliation bill that hard-core MAGA shock troops in safe seats will reject? How does the Jenga tower stay stable?\n\nBeyond the basic politics of the tariff blitz, its economic effects could unravel some of the assumptions underlying Trump’s legislative agenda. Restored inflation could increase political resistance to domestic-spending cuts as consumer purchasing power erodes. And if the nightmare of stagflation (inflation combined with reduced economic growth) descends on the U.S. economy, both financial markets and the Federal Reserve may take actions to counteract what the Republican Congress is trying to do, even as recessionary fears undermine the case for federal budget austerity.\n\nAs Punchbowl News reports, Republicans in Congress are increasingly frustrated by the situation:\n\nThe climate in Washington and across the country — both politically and economically — is making it much more difficult for Republicans to pass a massive tax-and-cut plan. Equity markets are getting rocked. Economists are already saying that a recession is possible. It will be difficult for Republicans to make the case that they should cut government spending. One almost wonders if the president should’ve waited on his tariff regime until after the reconciliation bill was passed.\n\nThe overriding point is that passage of Trump’s legislative agenda depends not just on partisan loyalty to the 47th president, but on a reasonably stable political and economic environment. It’s just the worst possible time for that environment to be shaken up like a snow-globe landscape by presidential actions that have massively increased uncertainty about the immediate future of the United States internationally and domestically. The Jenga tower of legislation will be much harder to keep upright. It will be interesting to see if Trump himself understands everything he is putting at risk with his beloved tariffs and the trade war they have already sparked.",

      "full_content": "Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nAfter President Trump announced sweeping tariffs this week, the financial markets saw their steepest one-day declines since 2020, Americans started panic buying everything from TVs to soy sauce, and financial analysts warned that we’re facing “economic Armageddon.” Like many people, I was feeling pretty jittery about the collapse of the post–World War II economic order. But then I took a look at Donald Trump’s Truth Social feed and learned everything is going exactly according to plan!\n\nI’ll admit: I did not find the “truth” pinned to the top of Trump’s feed all that reassuring. It’s a video (replicated below on X) of the president declaring on Thursday that the markets are “going to BOOM” while in reality, they were doing the exact opposite:\n\nI think it's going very well—The MARKETS are going to BOOM... pic.twitter.com/aDXwfR2tlZ — Trump Posts on 𝕏 (@trump_repost) April 3, 2025\n\nBut after scrolling down Trump’s feed, I realized the markets actually aren’t supposed to “BOOM” — or at least, not yet. You see, “Trump is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers,” according to an X post the president shared. The accompanying TikTok video was eye-opening: We aren’t just spiraling into an unnecessary economic downturn, “Trump is Purposely CRASHING The Market”:\n\nTo be clear, Trump did not say this himself. But presumably he agrees with the sentiment, as that would be an utterly insane thing for a president to highlight in a tense economic moment if he didn’t mean it.\n\nSo what’s the “secret game” Trump is playing that could “make you rich”? Here’s the full text of the TikTok video (as Mediaite notes, the voice-over appears to be from an Instagram post filmed by crypto and finance influencer Brian Decker two weeks ago):\n\nTrump is crashing the stock market by 20 percent this month, but he’s doing it on purpose. And this is why Warren Buffett just said Trump is making the best economic moves he’s seen in over 50 years. Now here’s the secret game he’s playing and it could make you rich.\n\nSo why is he doing this? To push cash into treasuries, which forces the Fed to slash interest rates in May and those lower rates give the Fed the ability to refinance trillions of debt very inexpensively. It also weakens the dollar and drops mortgage rates. Now it’s a wild chess move but it’s working.\n\nNow you’re probably wondering, what about his tariffs? Well I’ll tell you, it’s a genius play. It actually forces companies to build here to dodge them. It also forces farmers to sell more of their products here in the U.S. to bring grocery prices way down. We’ve already seen this with eggs.\n\nNow remember, 94 percent of all stocks are owned only by 8 percent of Americans. So Trump, he’s taking from the rich short term and handing it to the middle class through lower prices.\n\nNow, I can’t find any evidence that Warren Buffett praised Trump’s economic moves (in fact, Buffett recently called tariffs “an act of war to some degree” that eventually become “a tax on goods”). And I feel like I’ve heard experts say that’s not how any of this works; in fact, Trump’s policies would actually “shift the tax burden away from the well-off and toward the poor and middle class.” But hey, I’m not an economist! And I definitely like the idea that the president knows what he’s doing and isn’t upending the economy because he has a fifth-grader’s understanding of how tariffs work.\n\nFrom there, Trump’s morning missives just kept getting more and more reassuring. He declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH, RICHER THAN EVER BEFORE!!!” This must be true because he shouted it in all caps, with three exclamation points:\n\nAnd Trump clarified that while his “POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE” he is open to changing them if other nations offer him something good:\n\nFinally, Trump touted Friday’s better-than-expected jobs report as evidence that “IT’S ALREADY WORKING.” (I assume “it’s” refers to his entire economic plan, not this week’s tariffs, specifically, as the jobs in question were added in March.)\n\nSo while things might seem a little grim right now, Trump has convinced me that all we need to do is “HANK TOUGH”!\n\nActually, scratch that. Trump quickly deleted that post and explained we’re supposed to hang tough:\n\nEither way, I know I feel better being in such competent hands!",

      "full_content": "Photo: Bing Guan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAmerica’s top tech stocks plunged after Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, with the so-called Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla — losing more than a trillion dollars in collective value the next day and continuing their bleeding on Friday.\n\nThe president’s rambling “Liberation Day” proclamation contained different versions of the same bad news for each firm. Apple manufactures a lot of devices in China but has spent billions of dollars hedging with new factories in Vietnam, India, and Malaysia. Now, all of them are subject to massive new tariffs. (One analysis estimated iPhone price increases at “30 percent to 40 percent.”) In addition to Elon Musk’s co-dependent relationship with the Trump administration, around 20 percent of Tesla’s revenue comes from China, as do many components of its cars sold elsewhere.\n\nThe sizes of the drops in shares of big tech companies varied in ways that made sense: Microsoft (down about 20 percent from its highs) is probably structurally less exposed than, for example, Nvidia (down 40 percent), which outsources chip manufacturing to Taiwan and is now clinging to a narrow (and negotiable) semiconductor exemption from generally astronomical tariffs. Meta and Google (both down around 30 percent) are valued as complex tech companies but make basically all their money from advertising, which fares particularly poorly during economic downturns, and which in recent years has been coming from China, where their services are otherwise banned.\n\nSome of the biggest spenders on Google and Meta ads are Shein and Temu, which are subject to the top-line tariffs on imported goods but also benefited from the de minimis exemption, which allowed them to ship cheap goods to American customers directly while bypassing scrutiny by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and avoiding tariffs. On Wednesday, Trump announced he was ending that policy, again.\n\nWhich brings us to Amazon. The retail giant lost nearly a tenth of its value on Thursday alone (and is down 28 percent overall). With the substantial caveats that these tariffs could be repealed or changed as quickly as they were instituted, that Amazon’s last-minute bid for TikTok could involve or implicate it in some sort of broader negotiation with China, and that China might react in ways that further complicate Amazon’s situation, there are two obvious ways to understand how these new rules could matter to Amazon. One is narrow: By eliminating de minimis shipments, which created a shipping and tariff situation so favorable to companies like Shein and Temu that Amazon cloned them, the administration is taking pressure off the company, and probably bringing prices on the platforms like Temu and Shein (which are substantially selling the exact same ultracheap stuff these days) in line with each other. For their part, the Chinese e-commerce companies seem to have known this was coming — Trump tried it in February, before backing off — and have been refocusing their efforts on other markets for a while now, especially Europe.\n\nThe second effect is broader: Amazon’s business is massively dependent on relationships with Chinese businesses, in one form or another. As is the case with many American retailers, a massive portion of its products are manufactured there, of course. Unlike most retailers, a majority of its products are also sold by third-party merchants on the platform, and the majority of those sales come from sellers based in China. In the last few years, says tech and e-commerce analyst Juozas Kaziukėnas, Amazon has “only accelerated its dependence on China. It has massive training centers for sellers in China, it organizes conferences for sellers. Any tariffs on China obviously have a massive impact on everything Amazon sells.” Without much “headroom” to absorb these tariffs, Amazon prices could go up across the board.\n\nThis is obviously bad news for any retailer, and painful for its customers. In the longer term, though — again, assuming this is a long-term situation — this could further entrench Amazon without substantially affecting its relationship with China.\n\nMore than a decade of aggressively pursuing cross-border commerce has transformed Amazon into a largely brandless store full of discount goods, which were often cheaper than their similarly imported, but branded, alternatives sold elsewhere. A situation in which prices are driven up for Amazon spatulas is a situation in which prices are driven up for most other spatulas people might buy instead. Cheap spatula production isn’t likely to be re-shored to the U.S. anytime soon, if ever. So everyone’s prices will be higher, but Amazon’s will be relatively low, and its lower-end major competitors will have been neutralized, leading customers back to Amazon, where shipping is faster and they probably already subscribe to Prime anyway. “During recessions, customers go for a cheaper alternative, Kaziukėnas says. “Amazon equally benefits from situations like this.” If, say, discretionary spending falls in general, that’s a challenge for Amazon, but perhaps less than many of its peers. Even setting aside its profitable cloud business and other ventures, Amazon’s retail business is diversified in ways that could mitigate tariffs. Its mostly internal advertising business, for example, squeezes fees out of sellers even when they fail, and while Chinese sellers account for much of that spending now, it’s an extremely profitable, high-margin business even if it shrinks (comparable businesses at Walmart are growing but relatively minuscule).\n\nIf Amazon benefits from Trump’s new trade rules, at least in relative terms, who loses? Direct-from-China e-commerce companies that have spent billions trying to lure American customers in a bid to ultimately take on Amazon more directly are obviously at risk, but so is basically everyone else. Small retailers selling more premium branded — but still likely imported — products will struggle. Other discount retailers, despite their dependence on imported goods, will both benefit from budget-conscious shoppers and find themselves competing more directly with the Everything Store. (Again, even in an environment where Chinese goods are subject to a 54 percent tariff, Marshalls and Ross are still cheaper than Target, and none of them is filling its shelves with made-in-the-USA goods anytime soon, which would likely still end up being far more expensive anyway.)\n\nThe biggest loser is shoppers. Prices will go up across the board with, in many cases, nothing to show for it in the purchased goods themselves. The country’s dominant e-commerce firm will tighten its grip on retail. People will still be buying Temu-tier Haushof or XiaoZu spatulas on Amazon. They’ll just cost as much as OXOs do. Or rather, did.",

Photo: Chet Strange/Getty Images\n\nLast month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rebuffed criticism of his handling of the government-spending bill, arguing that averting a shutdown by backing the Republican-led legislation was the best option in an overall terrible situation. “I knew it was a difficult choice and I knew I’d get a lot of criticism for my choice. But I felt as a leader I had to do it,” he said at the time.\n\nBut discontent around Democratic Party leadership has only grown as the Trump administration continues to implement its agenda unabated, with a recent survey suggesting that there are some voters who are ready to turn the page to a new generation of leaders.\n\nA new Data for Progress poll found Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez leading Schumer by double digits in a hypothetical 2028 Senate matchup, with the congresswoman receiving 55 percent of the vote to 36 percent for the veteran leader. Nine percent of respondents said they weren’t sure.\n\nThe progressive polling firm also found Schumer with the lowest favorability of the New York Democrats and party leaders tested, receiving a net-favorable rating of +26 compared to Senator Bernie Sanders’s +69 rating as well as former vice-president Kamala Harris, who received a +63 rating. The poll, which was first reported by Politico, surveyed 767 likely New York Democratic primary voters from March 26-31.\n\nCNN reported in March that some of Ocasio-Cortez’s House colleagues were urging her to primary Schumer following the intraparty debate on the stopgap-spending bill. But with 2028 several years away, it’s not clear that the congresswoman has any aims to pursue the Senate. Her name was similarly floated as a possible challenger to New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand in 2024, but Ocasio-Cortez opted instead to run for reelection and glided to victory.\n\nIn an interview voicing her opposition for the bill, Ocasio-Cortez didn’t directly answer a question about possibly challenging Schumer and instead emphasized the need for the Senate to stand firm on that issue. “The strength of our leadership in this moment is going to demonstrate the strength of our caucus,” she said last month.\n\nSchumer downplayed the possibility of a primary challenge in a March interview with the New York Times, suggesting it was too early to entertain the thought. “That’s a long time away. I am focused on bringing Trump’s numbers down, his popularity down, exposing what he has done to America and what he will do. That’s my focus right now,” he said.",

      "full_content": "U.S. border-patrol agents in New Mexico. Photo: Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump recaptured the White House by convincing voters to trust him on two issues: the economy and immigration. So far, the first is not going well. The month after his swearing in, the U.S. added 19,000 fewer jobs than expected and opinion polls showed his approval ratings underwater on the economy. On Wednesday, he announced new tariffs that sent global markets plummeting. A trade war and 1970s-style “stagflation” are now looming, which, besides ravaging Americans’ pocketbooks, could lead to him hemorrhaging political capital. That leaves immigration — which is also not going well. Per Axios, Trump’s rate of removals lags stubbornly behind Joe Biden’s in 2024, which Trump ridiculed as “weak and pathetic,” despite him promising “the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America.”\n\nYet unlike Trump’s upending of the economy, which was always part of his plan, immigration enforcement seems to be a source of real frustration. The president was reportedly so angry that ICE had not met his arbitrary deportation quota by mid-February that he reassigned the agency’s two lead enforcers. In more recent weeks, with border crossings in decline and the economy set to contract, the administration has started coming up with increasingly creative ways to juice the boss’s stats, offering a glimpse of how wide America’s deportation dragnet can become when the president fixates on a solution in search of a problem.\n\nThe alleged problem — crime committed by immigrants — is being redefined accordingly. Students on visas and green-card holders who have spoken out in support of Palestine are suddenly criminals. And as he burns through the Mahmoud Khalils and Rumeysa Ozturks, Trump is turning his attention to seemingly any foreigner who has run afoul of the law — no matter how petty the indiscretion. Dogukan Gunaydin, a Turkish graduate student at the University of Minnesota, thought he had resolved his legal troubles when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor DUI in 2023. Then on March 27, he was snatched off the street by plainclothes ICE agents for the same offense. While it is unclear if deportation proceedings are underway as Gunaydin languishes in detention, legal analysts told the New York Times that a case as old and minor as his usually gets resolved with a written notification and a path to retaining visa status.\n\nNo more. Instead we see gestapo-like fear tactics, like when a woman identified as Sarahi, a Guatemalan undocumented immigrant with two children ages 1 and 5, accidentally drove onto the Ambassador Bridge, a one-way toll road connecting Michigan and Ontario, Canada, in March. The mistake got the vehicle’s passengers — including Sarahi’s kids and teenage brother — detained by border-patrol agents, who threatened to deport her. Rather than being released under supervision with a future court date, as formerly was custom, she was locked in a windowless office for five days with a single cup of ramen-noodle soup to split with her children that first night.\n\n“This administration has an obsessive focus on detention,” Miriam Aukerman, an ACLU of Michigan staff attorney, told NPR of these methods, which oscillate between nitpicky quibbling and blithe carelessness. Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran man living in Maryland with his American wife and 5-year-old son, was airlifted to CECOT, El Salvador’s megaprison, on March 16, after it appears he was baselessly labeled a member of MS-13. Lawyers for the administration admitted to making an “administrative error.” But Garcia, who has protected legal status and has lived in the U.S. since 2011, has now been exiled to what is functionally a legal black hole from which the administration claims it is powerless to retrieve him. Not that it wants to — when confronted about the error on X, Vice-President J.D. Vance falsely labeled Garcia “a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.”\n\nAnd it’s not just ICE and border agents carrying out this agenda — the entire national-security apparatus seems to be following the same script. After the administration paid $6 million to have Garcia and more than 200 other deportees imprisoned in El Salvador and celebrated the transfer with a fascist sizzle reel, Kristi Noem, Trump’s secretary of Homeland Security, released footage of herself preening at CECOT wearing a $60,000 gold Rolex. Promotional videos of this variety — well-heeled politicos posing in front of kneeling prisoners — have been distributed so widely online that Garcia’s wife, who did not initially know where her husband had been taken, apparently discovered his location after spotting him in the background of one.\n\nTrump’s deployment of 9,000 troops and tanklike armored trucks to the U.S.-Mexico border offers them a similar photo op. And while it is currently illegal for active-duty military to perform civilian law enforcement, the administration plans to recategorize a “buffer zone” along the border in New Mexico as a “satellite military installation” that would make crossing it equivalent to trespassing on a military base — this generating even more detainees to use as props.\n\nThese dire trends only stand to worsen as pressure mounts on Trump to fulfill his campaign promises — or at least give the appearance that he is. The administration already seems to have defied a judge’s order to halt the deportation flight that took Garcia to El Salvador, and if its defiance goes unchecked, there’s no telling how many more people could be vulnerable to removal. The president’s go-to move whenever he fears an election-season wipeout, dating back to his first term, is to demagogue immigration. But while the ginned-up migrant caravans of yesteryear have no obvious near-term equivalent, approaching headwinds portend more of the same: Tuesday’s state supreme-court election in Wisconsin broke heavily for the liberal candidate despite Elon Musk spending a record amount of money to defeat her.\n\nUltimately these developments speak to how contingent Trump’s political strengths are. The harder he leans on deportation theater in this imploding economy, the clearer it becomes that our crises cannot be purged by ICE agents, because they are homegrown.",

      "full_content": "It’s easy to imagine Donald Trump feeling a sense of urgency and scheduling a busy day of difficult work. Major indices around the world have responded to the president’s trade tariffs with steep drop-offs. The likelihood of a recession is growing. Key businesses have announced layoffs. Consumer prices are poised to climb.\n\nKey U.S. allies are turning against us, and U.S. rivals are imposing retaliatory measures. Even some of the White House’s most sycophantic partisan allies are struggling to defend the White House’s agenda.\n\nIn case this weren’t quite enough, four U.S. servicemen who died during a training exercise in Lithuania are poised to return home at a dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.\n\nThe president, however, hasn’t scheduled a busy day of work at the White House, and he won’t be on hand for the service members’ return. As The Washington Post reported, “A day after seeking to remake the global economic order, President Donald Trump on Thursday is returning to another priority: remaking professional golf.”\n\nTrump will dine with leaders of the LIV Golf tour at his [Doral] club outside Miami, his latest visit to Florida and a sporting event in a 73-day-old presidency that has already been full of both. The trip combines the president’s prized relationship with the Saudi Arabian leaders who own the tour; his regular visits to Florida, where he has spent most weekends of this presidency at his Mar-a-Lago resort; and his frequent mixing of personal business with his presidential office.\n\nI think we’re all familiar with the old adage, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going to Florida for a Saudi-backed golf event.”\n\nOr something like that.\n\nFor a president who tends to be preoccupied with camera-ready appearances and the optics of politics, some part of him must realize that it doesn’t look great to take a golf trip after setting much of the global economy — and your retirement account — on fire, but Trump’s doing it anyway.\n\nMaking matters slightly worse, all of this comes on the heels of Trump’s recent declaration that federal employees who work remotely necessarily abuse the system. “I happen to be a believer that you have to go to work. I don’t think you can work from home,” the president said in February. “Nobody’s going to work from home. ... They’re going to play golf.”\n\nWell, someone’s going to be playing golf instead of working, but I don’t think it’s the federal workforce.\n\nLet’s also not forget that as a candidate in 2016, the Republican seemed eager to give voters the impression that he’s a workaholic. At an event in New Hampshire, for example, while complaining about Barack Obama’s golf outings, Trump declared that if he were in office, “I’d want to stay in the White House and work my ass off.” Soon after, he assured voters, “I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go play golf.”\n\nAfter taking office, Trump proceeded to golf rather obsessively throughout his first term. His second term is offering more of the same.\n\nWhen he spoke to NBC News’ Kristen Welker this past weekend and the topic of a third term came up, the “Meet the Press” host reminded him of just how much work a president has to do.\n\n“Well, I like working,” Trump replied.\n\nSure you do, big guy. Sure you do.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nThe Trump administration’s aggressive and fast-paced effort to advance its immigration agenda has exposed existing challenges with a dated system and raised concerns that authorities are flouting due process to ram deportations through.\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump and his team have taken extraordinary measures to crack down on immigration, including invoking a rarely used wartime authority, known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that has pitted the administration against a federal judge and prompted public backlash.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has made multiple missteps in recent weeks, including mistakenly deporting a Salvadoran man whose case will be heard in a federal courtroom on Friday. The errors kept happening despite federal agents assuring they are carefully vetting each person before putting them on flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nTrump’s border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly maintained that authorities have done due diligence to gather information that the migrants they are deporting should be removed, especially from the Latin American gangs MS-13 or Tren de Aragua.\n\nAfter hundreds of alleged gang members were flown to El Salvador last month in possible violation of a judge’s order, Homan said in an interview with ABC that “every single” migrant was a member of one of the gangs “according to the information” given to him “from the field.”\n\n“A lot of gang members don’t have criminal histories, like a lot of terrorists in this world,” Homan said. “We have to count on social media, we have to count on surveillance techniques, we have to count on sworn statements from other gang members.”\n\nWhite House 'border czar' Tom Homan speaks with members of the press on the grounds of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 4, 2025. Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMultiple detainees on those flights were eventually returned to the US because the Salvadoran prison wouldn’t take them once they landed there.\n\nIn the court fight over the deportations using the Alien Enemies Act, a senior Immigration and Customs official, Robert Cerna, defended the process for identifying members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua, or TdA.\n\n“Agency personnel carefully vetted each individual alien to ensure they were in fact members of TdA,” Cerna wrote in a declaration. “Officers and agents well versed in gang activity in general and TdA in particular reviewed the information gathered on each alien, identifying TdA members based upon the results of investigative techniques and information.”\n\nBut Cerna also wrote the US has little specific information about the detainees it believes are Tren de Aragua gang members.\n\n“The lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose. It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile,” the ICE official said in his declaration.\n\nKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia Courtesy Jennifer-Vasquez\n\nThe immigration push made national headlines again this week, when the administration admitted it shouldn’t have deported ﻿Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national who was living in Maryland, to the notorious mega prison in his home country, even though he had been granted a protected status that should have prevented him from being removed there.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the man’s removal a “clerical error.”\n\nAlso this week, a judge in Texas found that a man was wrongfully detained by immigration authorities, after he narrowly avoided being put on one of those deportation flights to El Salvador. The judge ordered the immediate release of Gil Rojas, a Venezuelan national whose attorneys had obtained a court order keeping him in the US just before the series of flights took off in mid-March.\n\nCourts weigh in\n\nThe cases underscore the complexity of the US immigration system: Proceedings can take years, people are granted a variety of different legal statuses, and the process for both immigrants and the federal government is cumbersome.\n\nThe mid-March deportation flights to El Salvador were central to a court hearing on Thursday, where US District Judge James Boasberg considered whether government attorneys misled him about the flights and if they or others in the administration should be held in contempt.\n\nBoasberg pressed for answers, sharply questioning the Justice Department about the administration’s rush to fly detainees to the Salvadoran prison on Saturday, March 15. The judge pointed out that in its haste, the administration risked putting people on the planes who shouldn’t have been.\n\nThe court fight – parts of which are before the Supreme Court – has raised questions about the reach of executive authority on immigration policy.\n\n“The district court has no ability to – in any way – restrain the president’s authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, or, as I believe, to conduct the Foreign Affairs the United States,” Stephen Miller, Trump’s White House deputy chief of staff, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on “The Arena” last month.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union attorneys are arguing that some of the migrants may have been sent to El Salvador erroneously because of common choices they made, like getting tattoos of a soccer ball and crown. One detainee said the tattoo was for the soccer team Real Madrid, but the administration read it as a possible sign of gang affiliation.\n\nThe case tests Trump’s power to send migrants away without removal proceedings where the migrants can argue they aren’t gang members. The high court hasn’t yet decided what it will do.\n\nAt an appeals court hearing last week, one of the judges said mistakes could be easily made with the administration’s current process.\n\n“You all could have put me up on Saturday and thrown me on a plane thinking I’m a member of Tren de Auga and giving me no chance to protest,” DC Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Patricia Millett said. She added at the court hearing that in her hypothetical, she wouldn’t be able to argue, “‘Excuse me, no I’m not, I’d like a hearing.’”\n\nSalvadoran Minister of Justice and Public Security Gustavo Villatoro, pointing, accompanies US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a tour of the Terrorist Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador on March 26, 2025. Alex Brandon/Pool/Reuters\n\nDenying gang affiliation\n\nWhile senior Trump officials have expressed confidence in their deportation decisions, migrants and their advocates say quick decisions have been catastrophic and may flout longstanding immigration procedures.\n\nImmigration attorneys and family members have argued that some of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador’s mega prison last month are not tied to gangs, like the administration has described. Some of those removed had also been in the middle of their immigration proceedings before being sent to another country.\n\nMany are still seeking answers.\n\nOn Wednesday, attorney John Dutton attended an immigration hearing for his client, Henrry Albornoz Quintero, who Dutton believes was sent to El Salvador.\n\nAsked by the immigration judge about the whereabouts of Albornoz Quintero, a Venezuelan national who was in immigration detention, the ICE attorney only stated he’s no longer in the agency’s custody.\n\nThe judge pressed for more information, calling the lack of answers ridiculous, according to Dutton. With no official confirmation of his deportation from ICE, another hearing has been scheduled.\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, co-founder and president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, also told CNN that her client, a Venezuelan asylum seeker, was abruptly removed to El Salvador before his immigration proceedings had concluded.\n\nToczylowski’s client was expected to appear virtually for his immigration hearing from ICE detention last month, but he wasn’t there. The ICE prosecutor didn’t have information, according to Toczylowski, and the judge rescheduled the hearing.\n\nA few days later, ICE confirmed in immigration court that Toczylowski’s client had been among those sent to El Salvador.\n\nCourt documents have shed light on some of the confusion with the flights to El Salvador.\n\nOne Venezuelan woman who was being held in Texas was flown to El Salvador along with a handful of other female Venezuelan detainees. But they were sent back to the US after landing at the Salvadoran prison. El Salvador’s infamous Center for Terrorism Confinement, known as Cecot, wouldn’t take the women, according to the filings.\n\n“All the men got off the plane,” the woman, who is only identified by the initials S.Z.F.R., wrote in a recent sworn statement in the case before Boasberg. “The remaining women asked what happens to us? I was told that the President of El Salvador would not accept women. I was also told that we were going back to detention in the US.”\n\nPrison guards in El Salvador also refused a male detainee of Nicaraguan descent because that Central American county was outside the agreement the US struck with El Salvador.\n\n“I overheard a Salvadoran official tell an ICE officer that the Salvadoran government would not detain someone from another Central American country because of the conflict it would cause,” the detainee wrote in a sworn statement.\n\nThe Trump administration conceded in a court filing Monday that it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father, to El Salvador “because of an administrative error” and argued it could not return him because he’s now in Salvadoran custody.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed over his removal, and a hearing is scheduled on Friday.\n\nPrior to his removal, he was arrested by ICE in mid-March “due to his prominent role in MS-13,” according to a court declaration from a senior ICE official. His attorneys say he’s not a member of the gang, nor does he have any ties to it.\n\n“As others were removed from the flight for various reasons, he moved up the list and was assigned to the flight. The manifest did not indicate that Abrego Garcia should not be removed,” Cerna, an acting ICE field office director, said in his declaration.\n\nCNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

      "full_content": "The Thai army has filed a criminal complaint against an American scholar working in Thailand, alleging that he insulted the country’s monarchy\n\nBANGKOK -- The Thai army has filed a criminal complaint against an American scholar working in Thailand, alleging that he insulted the country’s monarchy, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nPaul Chambers, a political science lecturer, said police came to his workplace at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok on Friday morning to serve him with an arrest warrant and summoning him to the local police station to formally hear the charges.\n\nChambers said he will report himself on Tuesday and hopes to get released on bail.\n\n“I’m basically in limbo because I can’t go anywhere. I’m not supposed to,” he told The Associated Press. “I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I’m kind of nervous.”\n\nA copy of the police summons, seen by the AP, says the regional army command filed charges against Chambers, including violating the law against defaming the monarchy and the Computer Crime Act.\n\nThe letter, signed by Phitsanulok City police chief Watcharapong Sitthirungroj, said the warrant was approved by the Phitsanulok Provincial Court on March 31. Watcharapong denied any knowledge of the charges against Chambers when first reached by the AP, but when asked about his signature on the document, said he couldn’t immediately comment and asked a reporter to call back.\n\nThe 3rd Army Area, covering Thailand's northern region, was named as the plaintiff in the document, but could not be reached for comment. Army spokesperson Winthai Suvaree could not immediately be reached.\n\nThe summons did not explain the details of the offense that Chambers was accused of. Chambers said he believes it was related to a webinar last October in which he discussed the influence of the military in Thai politics.\n\nThailand’s lese majeste law calls for three to 15 years’ imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent.\n\nCritics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and has been used in Thailand to punish critics of the government and institutions such as the military. The army plays a major role in politics and has staged 13 successful coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently just 11 years ago.\n\nIt is rare for a foreigner to be charged under the law, which has been applied frequently in the past decade during a period of political polarization.\n\nPublic criticism of the monarchy, a linchpin of Thai identity, used to be rare, but student-led pro-democracy protests began to challenge that taboo in 2020, openly criticizing the institution. That led to vigorous prosecutions under what was previously a little-used law.\n\nThe advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people — many of them student activists — have been charged with violating the lese majeste law, often referred to as Article 112.",

      "full_content": "If you worked for Bryan Johnson, you’d be seeing this now. Photo: Agaton Strom//Redux\n\nAt any given time, there are a lot of people who are upset with Bryan Johnson, the very online guy who wants to live forever. The entrepreneur, philosopher, and “rejuvenation athlete” is in pursuit of the lofty goal of not dying. If he can’t do that, he intends to at least slow down his own aging by taking 50-plus pills a day and eating his dinner around noon. At 47, his skin looks pretty good, if a little Draculean from years of abstaining from sunlight. But Johnson says it’s the inside that counts, claiming that his body is running like someone years younger than he is. Someone like his 19-year-old son, whose blood he has injected.\n\nThrough his company Blueprint, Johnson sells supplements featuring collagen, creatine, and other vitamins commonly promoted by fitness influencers. Like anyone making a load of health claims purporting improvements in a customer’s life for the low price of $46.55, Johnson has attracted a number of people questioning the science behind his claims. He appears to be a true believer in what he’s peddling, though he also benefits from being rich enough not to have to listen to anyone. Over a decade ago, he sold his payments company, which owned Venmo at the time, to PayPal, netting him perhaps as much as $300 million.\n\nAs with so many situations with people who made their name online, the more you talk about Johnson, the more it seems that he wins. Recently, he explained this succinctly: “Bryan Johnson hate is good for business.”\n\nEvery so often, though, his haters can mess up his business as usual.\n\nJohnson says he had never heard of the writer and lawyer Matt Bruenig until a few weeks ago, despite being a big reader. (Johnson said over the phone this week that he’s “probably read over a hundred” biographies of the great minds in history.)\n\nFor the past decade, Bruenig has been a popular voice of the wonky op-ed left, voicing progressive labor ideas in pretty much every paper and magazine that isn’t owned by the Murdoch family. (His spouse, Elizabeth Bruenig, a writer at The Atlantic who often tends to more Godly matters, has been printed in the rest of them.) If you’re concerned with the future of the Democratic party and how it can attract young voters with worker-friendly economic policies, you’ve probably run into his work. But Bruenig’s actual day job is as a labor attorney.\n\nAs it happens, Bryan Johnson has a profound love not just for aging slowly, but also for nondisparagement agreements. The New York Times reported a few weeks ago that Johnson required his staffers to sign 20-page NDAs blocking them from speaking about pretty much anything related to Johnson or his companies. One “opt-in” document to protect him from potential lawsuits informed his employees they had to be comfortable with extremely specific situations. These include being around Johnson while he has very little clothing on as well as “discussions for media production including erotica (for example, fan fiction including but not limited to story lines/ideas informed by the Twilight series and-or 50 Shades of Grey.)”\n\n“That stuff is weird,” said Bruenig. But what really concerned him is what he described as “Johnson’s suppression of employee speech through these disparagement clauses.”\n\nIn late 2019, according to publicly available court documents, Johnson handed one of these agreements to Taylor Southern, an employee at Kernel, his neuroimaging company. She was also his fiancée, until court docs say that Johnson called off their marriage, forced her to move out, then fired her — all while she was being treated for breast cancer. “It’s kind of the problem with an employer becoming engaged to an employee: this whole thing gets so entangled,” Bruenig said. “The agreement forbids Southern from saying anything disparaging about Johnson without making any exceptions for her unwaivable right to speak about her working conditions.”\n\nLast summer, Southern was looking for a way to get out of the nondisparagement clause that has barred her from speaking about this experience when she says she “stumbled across Matt’s blog” and reached out to him. Bruenig explained that she has a right to discuss her working conditions and agreements silencing dissent from other employees so long as she does so in coordination with other workers. After speaking with Bruenig, she and two more of Johnson’s former employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, arguing to the watchdog agency that handles private-sector labor disputes that they should be released from what they see as overbroad clauses.\n\nIn March, Southern went public with her legal battle. She had sued Johnson, saying that he owed her $150,000 for rent and moving out post-breakup, per the Times. Unfortunately for her, the suit was moved to arbitration, where she was ordered to pay him $584,000 in legal bills thanks to a fee-shifting clause, a provision in the agreement she signed that forced her to pay his lawyers if she sued and lost.\n\nJohnson’s attorney said that her social-media use violated the terms of her nondisparagement clause. Of concern was a video from February in which she described being “suddenly alone” after Johnson ended their engagement, as well as her posts on social media criticizing Harvey Weinstein and Sean Combs for their use of NDAs. “Given that Ms. Southern so frequently comments about Mr. Johnson, there is little doubt she is attempting to equate him with these individuals and paint him in a false light,” Johnson’s attorney wrote.\n\nFor Bruenig, this was a step too far. This week, he filed another unfair labor practice charge, describing this legal threat as a violation of Southern’s rights under the National Labor Relations Act. “If Mr. Johnson is uncomfortable with the fact that his use of non-disclosure agreements puts him in the same company as Harvey Weinstein and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, then he should reconsider how he conducts his employment relationships,” Bruenig wrote. As for the end of Johnson and Southern’s relationship, Bruenig’s argument had universal appeal: “Breakups cause people to feel alone. Saying so is not disparagement.”\n\nFrom here, a lawyer for the NLRB will investigate the matter then kick it up to higher authorities at the watchdog agency if the unfair labor practice charge has merit. If the board ruled in Southern’s favor, no money would be awarded. “The remedies at the NLRB are not that great,” said Bruenig. “But it does help defend us in the case of a lawsuit. If he does start to actually bring lawsuits attempting to enforce this stuff, we can point to the existence of the unfair labor practice charge to hopefully get that lawsuit dismissed.”\n\nSouthern, for one, is happy to have Bruenig in her corner. “Matt is the first person to offer a little bit of hope that I’m maybe not stuck in this forever,” she said. But as the case at the NLRB moves forward at a bureaucratic pace — made slower by President Trump’s refusal to fully staff the board that rules on cases — Johnson doesn’t seem phased. He says he is unable to comment on the case involving his ex-fiancée, their breakup, and her ouster while she was battling cancer aside from describing the ongoing NDA spat as just “noise.” He stands by his ways: When it comes to NDAs in the workplace, “I think that more people should do this,” he said.\n\n“The Times reports that somehow my use of NDAs is nefarious, that it’s somehow an evil plan to silence people,” Johnson said. “It’s actually the exact opposite. When people show up, I say, ‘Here is what our work environment is like, this is what we say, this is what we do, and this is what happens if you don’t like this. You do not have to work here.’”\n\nBruenig, who believes there needs to be a “policy-level” fix to restrict overbroad agreements imposed on workers, may not agree with Johnson’s claim that the workplace is made better with NDAs for all. He’s also not shopping Johnson’s products, noting that they’re often just longevity-branded versions of stuff you can get for cheaper at any store, like the product that Johnson markets as “snake oil.”\n\n“It’s sort of aside from any of the issues we have, but why would you ever buy this?” Bruenig asked. “Just go to the grocery store and buy olive oil.”",

The director of the National Security Agency and his deputy are fired. And scientists believe the key to understanding the evolution of human language can be found in one type of great ape.\n\nHere’s what to know today.\n\nMixed messages and confusion follow Trump’s tariff rollout\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have been met with confusion, uncertainty and fear since his big announcement Wednesday afternoon. The 10% baseline tariff on virtually every country — and higher numbers on countries with which the U.S. has larger trade deficits — now leaves his Republican supporters trying to thread the political needle of not criticizing him while also understanding the economic peril the tariff plan may cause.\n\nSo far, Trump’s team has not had a clear message to either explain the strategy behind the tariffs or his thought process behind the decision to go much further than his supporters expected.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nSome elements of the measures raised questions about the process behind their development, including the decision to levy tariffs on uninhabited lands, such as Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which has no human residents.\n\nThe White House has said the tariffs were not a negotiating tool, but that notion has been contradicted by Trump’s economic advisers and even Trump himself.\n\nThe uncertainty has left global markets in turmoil. Wall Street on Thursday saw its worst day since the depths of the pandemic, with nearly $2 trillion wiped out from the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq didn’t fare well, either. The rout could be read as a harsh early verdict on Trump’s tariff plan. Analysts are increasingly raising alarms about the potential for recession.\n\nBut Trump’s most staunch congressional allies are still expressing their support, albeit with caveats. “If they make things better, they should want more,” Sen. John Kennedy said. “If it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate. If the tariffs end up hurting America, I think you’ll see President Trump recalibrate.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore tariffs coverage:\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release its latest monthly jobs report today, with forecasts showing 140,000 new jobs in March and the unemployment rate at 4.1%.

Mark Schiefelbein / AP file\n\nThe director and the No. 2 official at the National Security Agency were ousted from their positions this week, according to a defense official and three sources with knowledge of the matter, but it wasn’t immediately clear why they were dismissed. Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh was both the director of the NSA and the head of the U.S. Cyber Command. Deputy NSA Director Wendy Noble was the agency’s senior civilian leader. Both are career officials.\n\nLast month, Elon Musk visited the NSA’s headquarters and met with Haugh after Musk had remarked on X that “the NSA needs an overhaul.”\n\nCongressional Democrats criticized the Trump administration over the firings. Rep. Jim Hines, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the firings “makes us all of us less safe.” Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Community, called Haugh’s removal “astonishing.” Read the full story here.\n\nMore politics coverage:\n\nStorylines to watch in the women’s Final Four\n\nPaige Bueckers of Connecticut plays against USC in the Elite Eight round of the NCAA women's tournament on March 31.

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nVice President JD Vance applauded in the front row of the Rose Garden as President Donald Trump announced a massive new round of tariffs on Wednesday – an economy-rattling policy he promised would bring back manufacturing jobs.\n\nBut for years before joining Trump’s ticket, Vance argued the opposite.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, Vance said repeatedly that American manufacturing jobs were lost for good, and that “protectionist” trade policies would do little to bring them back.\n\nVance’s comments are another example of his transformation from a self-described “Never Trump guy” to a full-fledged MAGA backer in the Senate and on Trump’s ticket, a change he has attributed to seeing the successes of Trump’s policies in his first term.\n\n“Vice President Vance has been crystal clear in his unwavering support for revitalizing the American economy by bringing back manufacturing jobs and sticking up for middle class workers and families since before he launched his U.S. Senate race, and that is a large part of why he was elected to public office in the first place,” said Taylor Van Kirk, spokesperson for the vice president.\n\nVance is now a key messenger for Trump’s economic agenda as the administration pursues sweeping new protectionists policies announced on what they deemed “Liberation Day.”\n\n“It’s our declaration of economic independence,” Trump said Wednesday. “Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already.”\n\nStarting around 2016, when Vance rose to national fame as the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” he argued in repeated interviews, speeches and social media posts that automation and technological change were the primary forces reshaping the American economy and said he opposed “hyper protectionists” and their policies.\n\n“So many of these jobs that have disappeared from these areas just aren’t coming back. They haven’t disappeared so much from globalization or from shipping them overseas,” Vance said in a January 2017 interview with Education Week. “They’ve largely disappeared because of automation and because of new technological change.”\n\nOther comments and social media activity from Vance during that time directly took aim at Trump’s trade rhetoric. Shortly after Trump met with manufacturing CEOs in February 2017 and publicly railed against America’s trade deficits, Vance pushed back.\n\n“Can’t be repeated enough: if you’re worried about America’s economic interest, focus more on automation/education than trade protectionism,” Vance wrote.\n\nIn December 2016, as then-President-elect Trump visited a Carrier plant in Indiana to tout a deal he claimed would keep manufacturing jobs from moving to Mexico, Vance liked a tweet from Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse that offered a different explanation for job loss.\n\n“Automation—even more than trade—will continue to shrink the number of manufacturing jobs,” Sasse wrote. “This trend is irreversible.”\n\nThe like, which CNN saved before X made likes private last year, underscored Vance’s alignment at the time with Republicans who doubted the effectiveness of Trump’s proposals to restore blue-collar jobs through trade pressure alone.\n\nEven when Vance acknowledged that globalization had caused deep harm in some communities, citing research that linked increased exposure to Chinese imports with strain on local labor markets, he argued that those downsides did not justify a sweeping reversal of US trade policy.\n\n“Now does that mean that we should be hyper-protectionists in our approach to trade? I would argue no,” Vance said at an April 2017 event. “But should we be cognizant of the fact that when you have some of those communities that are really exposed to trade, it can very often harm them or at least cause some pretty negative consequences, even as it might cause some positive ones. I think we have to.”\n\n“I do think that trade hasn’t necessarily been in the best interests of a lot of these communities. Now, the question of whether you can go backwards in time, I think the answer is no,” he told a gathering at the University of Chicago in February 2017.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds up a chart of new tariffs. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe long-term solution, Vance argued in December 2016, was to retrain workers.\n\n“The fundamental issue with American jobs and manufacturing right now is not that all of our jobs have gone to Mexico and China, it’s that they’ve been auto–automated. It’s that mechanization has sort of reduced the manufacturing work base,” he said. “There is a solution to that problem. It’s to train people for the next level of jobs, to train people for the 21st century workforce.”\n\nVance also expressed skepticism about Trump’s promises to revive traditional industries through trade policy, specifically questioning whether legacy jobs like coal and steel could ever return.\n\n“I don’t think that there’s a simple, ‘Let’s bring the coal or steel jobs back,’” Vance said in early 2017. “But I also think that if folks are employed in next generation jobs with dignified work and good wages, that they’re not gonna be angry that Trump didn’t bring back the steel jobs.”\n\nWhile recognizing the downsides of globalization, Vance also argued it was too late to reverse course while agreeing at the time that fighting over trade was “yesterday’s war.”\n\n“Maybe you could [turn the clock back] a little bit on trade if we were in the ’80s, but we’ve already lost that battle in some ways,” Vance told CNN in February 2017. “The jobs are already gone.”\n\nMore recently, Vance has credited Trump’s first term in the White House with broadly shifting his view on his agenda. And Vance’s public statements on globalization were beginning to shift by 2019, just before he has said he fully embraced Trump, voting for him in 2020 and then running the next year for Senate as a Trump-allied Republican. In October 2019, Vance called the view that automation had taken jobs a “bad argument.”\n\n“I’m not an economist, but I can spot a bad argument. And the argument–reproduced ad nauseum in the business press–that manufacturing jobs not keeping pace with output = automation is the main culprit is really bad,” he wrote.\n\nBut even in the final half of Trump’s first term, when Vance was more sympathetic to the Trump administration’s arguments on trade, he was not optimistic on the odds of success of protectionist policies.\n\n“FWIW, my guess is the policy may very well fail, especially if Biden is elected president and China’s intransigence is rewarded. I’ve seen some claim that they’re explicitly betting on that fact,” he wrote.",

      "full_content": "Paul Weiss agreed to “essentially a settlement,” in Trump’s words. Photo: Jeenah Moon/The New York Times/Redux\n\nYou’ll be forgiven if your heart isn’t breaking over the fate of the handful of elite law firms recently targeted by Donald Trump. So a few megarich corporations who help make mega-megarich corporations even richer stand to get a little less rich? We’ve got bigger problems.\n\nBut don’t skim past this one. You’ve heard the Shakespeare quote: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” That line is sometimes misinterpreted as an expression of frustration directed at lawyers, who are always mucking things up and impeding free enterprise and a good time. But Shakespeare’s point, in context, is that lawyers stand in the way of lawlessness, so anyone hoping to subvert the established order might want to start by chucking all us pesky J.D.’s in the river.\n\nTrump has now targeted a string of elite law firms for reasons that are equal parts Machiavelli, Mean Girls, and Dick (the character who speaks the aforementioned line in Shakespeare’s Henry VI, Part 2). The president has issued a series of formal proclamations that warn vaguely but darkly of the “significant risks” posed by these “rogue law firms,” which engage in “harmful activity” and “egregious conduct.” The Orwellian preludes quickly give way to burn-book flaming of the condemned law firms. Trump offers zero pretext; this is entirely about retribution, personal and political.\n\nWitness the sins of the commander-in-chief’s disfavored firms. Covington & Burling (where I worked 20-plus years ago) made the list primarily because, horror of horrors, it is providing free legal services to Jack Smith. The president attacked Jenner and Block largely because it formerly employed Andrew Weissmann, who once prosecuted the bumbling Trump-adjacent ostrich-skin aficionado Paul Manafort, and WilmerHale, which has hired lawyers who once worked on Robert Mueller’s special-counsel investigation. Perkins Coie got its comeuppance because it represented Hillary Clinton and has worked with George Soros. (Now, don’t you feel safe and protected from all the big, scary, “significant risks” that were afoot?)\n\nTrump instinctively understands how to hit his chosen enemies where it hurts most: the bottom line. All law firms aspire to high-minded principles (and sometimes achieve them), but they are, at core, relentlessly profit-seeking entites. Trump — no stranger to cold-blooded capitalism — has expertly crafted his proclamations to bring the named firms to their knees.\n\nFirst, the proclamations strip all firm lawyers of security clearances and bar them from access to government buildings — making it effectively impossible to represent clients in any federal criminal or regulatory matter. And, crucially, the proclamations threaten that any company doing business with the targeted law firms will lose its government contracts.\n\nConsider these conditions from the perspective of a potential blue-chip client — say, a private aeronautics company that relies on federal-government contracts for the bulk of its revenue. If that company needed representation on any criminal or regulatory case, it would immediately drop the targeted firms, given that the lawyers can’t even step foot inside DoJ or Securities and Exchange Commission or Department of Defense buildings. And why would our hypothetical aeronautics company hire a blacklisted firm, if that meant risking losing its federal government contracts? The safe move for a rational, self-interested client is to tiptoe down the street to any of the dozens of elite law firms that have not (yet) incurred the president’s wrath.\n\nTrump’s retributive effort has left the targeted law firms with two stark options.\n\nFirst: surrender. Two of the firms selected by Trump, Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps, did the math and buckled. The (perhaps formerly) megaprestigious New York–based legal practices cut deals with the president — “essentially a settlement,” in his words; “essentially a shakedown,” in mine. These arrangements are voluntary for the law firms in the same sense that the corner butcher voluntarily peels off five hundreds every Friday for the local capo’s collector.\n\nPaul Weiss agreed, first, to do $40 million worth of pro bono legal work for various causes; Skadden Arps coughed up $100 million. Well, that’s not so bad, right? We generally celebrate lawyers for donating their time to pro bono causes, after all. But the catch is that firms agreed to do that work for causes supported by the President. Want to represent a pro-choice abortion advocacy group? A climate change non-profit? A death row inmate challenging his conviction? Good luck getting approval from those government overseers. The problem here isn’t with the causes themselves; it’s that these private law firms will allow the President and his administration to dictate what causes and clients they can and cannot represent.\n\nThese firms are victims in a sense, but they’re not helpless patsies. Paul Weiss in 2024 made over $2.6 billion in total revenues and – brace yourself – $7.5 million in profits per equity partner. Skadden Arps generated $3.2 billion in revenues, and $5.4 million in profits per equity partner. These are collectives of extraordinarily savvy lawyers who make their living navigating the corridors of power. And when faced with the President’s wrath – and the loss of big-money clients – they chose to negotiate revenue-saving deals, at the expense of their independence and professional dignity.\n\nThe other option for the targeted firms is to do the same thing they do for a living, the same thing they thought they’d be doing when they went to law school, years ago: Go to court and take a stand.\n\nThree firms have now challenged Trump’s proclamations; all have achieved some measure of success. In all three cases, federal judges (including two George W. Bush appointees) have placed temporary holds on key aspects of Trump’s targeting actions. One of the Bush-appointed judges called Trump’s scheme “disturbing” and “troubling.”\n\nTrump has picked countless legal fights during his first two months back in office, many aimed at expansion of his own power. He might ultimately prevail on some of those, especially in the conservative-leaning, pro-Executive Supreme Court. But he’s going to get his clock cleaned on his lawyer-targeting initiative.\n\nFor starters, it’s flagrantly unconstitutional. This is about more than a few posh law firms enduring a temporary reduction in revenue. It’s about free speech and association. It’s about due process and access to government. It’s about the freedom of individuals and (yes) corporations to engage counsel of their choosing.\n\nThe courts will have none of it. Keep in mind that every judge is a lawyer – many came through the same type of big-law mega-firms now in the crosshairs – and they’ll understand the threat posed by Trump’s actions. This isn’t about left-against-right or liberals-against-conservatives. This is about the integrity and functioning of the legal profession, writ large.\n\nUltimately from Trump’s perspective, the targeting of law firms is about eliminating an especially potent source of resistance (lower-case “r”) to implementation of his agenda. It’s clear now that Congress will do nothing to check the President’s actions. Nor will there be any meaningful adverse investigation by our fully-neutered DOJ – led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has already shown herself to be completely in the bag for Trump – or from anywhere else in the Executive Branch. The only real pushback will come from the courts and the lawyers. And, as Trump recognizes, if he can incapacitate the lawyers, then he can wipe out one of the few remaining sources of meaningful opposition to his romp through American public (and private) life.\n\nNow those law firms in the president’s crosshairs must decide: Do they cave in to save their own profits-per-partner, or do they stand up and fight?",

      "full_content": "Donald Trump doesn’t like losers. So one has to wonder what he is thinking after Elon Musk, his biggest political donor, fell flat on his face in an attempt to prop up a MAGA-backed candidate in this week’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nWhile it’s important not to overthink the results of an off-cycle election, Trump and Musk’s embarrassing loss is a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nIt came at an unfortunate time, as Trump announced massive across-the-board tariffs that spooked Wall Street, leading to the biggest one-day loss since 2020. Two Florida Republicans also underperformed in special elections for House seats, raising concerns among Republicans about their narrow majority.\n\nBut Wisconsin was the clearest signal of the looming danger for Republicans.\n\nMusk overplayed his hand. The tech tycoon and his super PAC poured tens of millions of dollars into the race, but all that money could not stop the growing pushback against Trump’s trail of destruction. Despite Musk’s efforts, voters elected state Circuit Judge Susan Crawford to the state’s Supreme Court, maintaining the court’s 4-3 liberal majority.\n\nThe victory wasn’t easy. Trump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris in Wisconsin by less than 1 point, making it the closest state race in the 2024 presidential election. Yet Crawford defeated Trump-endorsed Brad Schimel by 10 points.\n\nTuesday’s election in Wisconsin is not the only sign that Republicans need to read the writing on the wall: Trump and Musk’s DOGE tactics are toxic in the minds of voters. While GOP candidates won both special elections for two House seats in Florida, Democrats cut into the margin of victory in each race by double digits. By sticking with Trumpism and enabling an unelected billionaire, the Republican Party has exposed itself to a possible bloodbath during the 2026 midterms.\n\nI know a thing or two about winning tough races. I served as chairman of the Republican National Committee during the 2010 midterms, when a “Republican wave” changed the power dynamics in Washington and state capitals across the country. But 2010 didn’t start out that way. It came about because of a concerted effort to take advantage of an incumbent president’s missteps.\n\nIf I were a state Republican chairman looking at Tuesday’s election results, here’s what I would be thinking: First, voters are already sick and tired of all the chaos Musk has unleashed across America. Trump will be left to clean up the mess that Musk leaves behind on every aisle. Voters will blame the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers who didn’t stand up to Musk. The Republican Party needs to understand this reality.\n\nWe’re already seeing voters express their anger at town halls, and GOP leadership asking Republicans in Congress not to meet with their constituents doesn't help. Republican candidates are stuck with the Trump brand if they don’t offer the electorate an alternative path.\n\nRepublicans in tight House races must differentiate themselves from Trump.\n\nThat brings us to my second point: Republicans in tight House races must differentiate themselves from Trump. They can only do that if they’re more concerned about what their voters want instead of what Trump thinks of them. However, since Republicans seek Trump’s endorsement to win primaries, it becomes nearly impossible for them to distance themselves from his damaging policies.\n\nIt will take individual candidates who are not afraid to draw stark contrasts between their vision for American families and whatever politics Trump is playing. If they are successful, it creates a lane for a new generation of GOP candidates to rise above Trump’s stranglehold on the party.\n\nLastly, Democrats have a role to play if they get out of their own way. Republicans have been masterful at defining the Democratic Party. It’s now time for Democrats to define exactly what this Republican Party is. Voters are just starting to process the chaos, the mixed messages, the damage to institutions and the growing sense of insecurity surrounding Trump’s second term. This can’t be a missed opportunity. Democrats must find a straightforward narrative and make it stick. Drive it home every single day and don’t give an inch.\n\nThe key to success is keeping it simple and standing with voters heading into the midterms next year. GOP communications veteran Doug Heye warned Democrats not to overplay their hand. This week on MSNBC, he said, “Democrats don’t need a wave. They just need a ripple, given how small the House majority is. Stay focused and say the smart things. Don’t make overpredictions.”\n\nThe path forward for the pro-democracy movement will be a balancing act. Tuesday’s elections underscored the weaknesses inside the Republican Party and how that weakness shows up at the ballot box. It’s now up to Democrats to exploit those weaknesses and return power to the American people.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.",

      "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nMarkets around the world plunged on Thursday after President Trump imposed harsh across-the-board tariffs, igniting a probable global trade war. And if there were any hopes that Trump’s tariffs were merely a negotiating tactic, the White House attempted to squash them. Amid the chaos, I spoke with Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities and a longtime prominent tech-sector analyst. Among other things, we discussed why Trump’s tariff numbers are so nonsensical and why Wall Street has been caught off guard by a seemingly predictable development.\n\nIn a note to investors, you wrote that “if a ninth-grader in high school presented this tariff chart to a teacher in a basic economics class, the teacher would laugh and say, ‘Sit down and work on the assignment.’” Have you seen any credible defense of what’s going on here?\n\n﻿The calculations on tariffs are befuddling, insane, and absurd. It just takes away credibility on day one on what the actual numbers are, because this goes against every basic economic theory in the last hundred years. The view on Wall Street is that it’s a laughable calculation at best.\n\nIn other words, the rules of the game from day one make no sense. How do negotiations start when you’re going off of a number that makes no sense, at least on earth? I’ve talked to executives around the world the last 24 hours, and everyone’s saying the same thing. It’s created such chaos and the numbers are so absurd that you have to assume it’s just a negotiation point. Otherwise, it’s an economic Armageddon, and it guarantees a recession, and there’s really no debate about that.\n\nCould you briefly explain why these numbers are so laughable?\n\n﻿Tariffs by definition are a charge that consumers or companies pay to sell into a country. The calculation the White House came up with on the tariff chart is based on the import-export imbalance that’s converted into a tariff. Cambodia is never going to buy almost any goods from the U.S., but the U.S. will buy from Cambodia. That’s why they have a ridiculous tariff, just like Vietnam. Those are not tariffs. It’s the nature of global trade in modern-day society to convert an import-export trade deficit into a tariff percentage — again, if that were presented in high school, the teacher would laugh and tell you to sit down.\n\nIt actually does remind me of a famous scene from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.\n\nNo, but that’s what it’s like. The average American doesn’t fully comprehend how bad this category-five hurricane is going to be until they start to see it over the coming weeks and months at grocery stores, on Amazon, in electronic stores, and in anything they’re buying on a daily basis. What I’m trying to explain is that people want to believe, “Let’s make America better. Let’s build in America.” But that’s so far from reality.\n\nIn my understanding, there are two extremely large barriers to that reality. One is the length of time it would take to bring manufacturing back to America in a serious way.\n\n﻿Four to five years to build a factory.\n\nBut the other one is very much related to this policy, which is uncertainty. How do companies even know what’s going to be happening in a month? They certainly don’t feel like things are stable enough to go, “Okay, we’re going all in on America now,” because this might change in three days.\n\n﻿And the problem is uncertainty almost guarantees negative GDP growth for Q2 and raises the odds of a recession to likely over 50 percent. And once the snowball starts going downhill, you can’t just stop it. That’s part of the problem — the numbers are so absurd, and the calculation is so head-scratching, that investors don’t even know where to start. Look, I’ve covered tech stocks for 25 years on Wall Street, seen everything from the dot-com bubble to the financial crisis to COVID and everything in between this. This one tops the list in terms of a self-inflicted economic Armageddon.\n\nLet’s talk absolute best-case scenario here. This won’t happen, but let’s say these tariffs totally disappear in a few days. Even in that scenario, how much damage would be done, and how difficult would it be to repair that damage?\n\n﻿Already there’s damage with trade partners, friends of the U.S. and companies are in a tailspin, and it’s created natural uncertainty. And I believe many companies are not going to give guidance on their conference calls for Q1 in late April, because right now they’re playing darts blindfolded.\n\nThe impact on inflation is obviously not going to be good, but how bad do you see it getting?\n\n﻿This is the biggest inflationary move a president’s ever made. So to say that this is going to force the Fed to cut rates, you just made the biggest inflationary and uncertain move in modern-day history. It goes against the whole thesis that the Fed could cut. Now, they might have to cut if things get so bad, but inflation was coming down until this.\n\nAnd the Fed was already under the gun from Trump.\n\n﻿The Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place. You just basically created a tariff torpedo that’s going to result in massive inflation. There’s no debate about it. There’s one person that pays the tariff: the U.S. consumer. And I don’t think that’s a debate.\n\nYou’ve been talking to a lot of executives. I assume that the mood is just panic right now?\n\n﻿It’s panic and anxiety, and they don’t even know where to turn because you can’t all of a sudden just change your supply-chain trading partners. And there’s a lot of things you can’t even get in the U.S. So what are you going to do, wait four years to build a factory?\n\nOne thing that has puzzled me is that Trump has been warning about doing this for months. And he’s had these firm beliefs about tariffs since the ’80s. In his first term, the tariffs weren’t so dramatic, but now he’s only surrounded by sycophants, not people like Gary Cohn. So could everyone be so shocked about this? The markets supposedly had it priced in, but it turns out they didn’t.\n\nBut remember, this is worse than the worst-case scenario. No one ever thought in the nightmare of nightmare scenarios that he’d come out with calculations out of a sci-fi movie. If it had come out as like-for-like, as reciprocal, that would be a starting point. When you come out with China at 68 percent, Taiwan at 64 percent — I mean, those numbers are wrong. And investors don’t even know where to start. It would be like a house selling for $500,000 and you bid $2,000.\n\nSo in other words, it’s somewhat defensible that the market didn’t build this in, because it was so unimaginable.\n\n﻿Reciprocal tariffs, baseline tariffs, hard-line stands — the market understood that. But the numbers, they’re basically created out of thin air to build a narrative. That’s the problem.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.",

Christy Akeo said she didn't think they would be released soon.\n\n\"There's so many people who have supported us,\" she told reporters after landing. \"I don't even know how we're going to repay or thank people.\"\n\nThe Akeos, from Spring Arbor, Michigan, were arrested on March 4, shortly after landing in Cancun. Mexican authorities told the couple they faced criminal fraud charges. The couple had a membership with Palace Resorts, a Florida-based company that owns resorts and properties in Mexico.\n\nPalace Resorts claimed that the couple committed credit card fraud and breached a contract agreement, telling CBS News Detroit that \"Between 2016 and 2021, the Akeos knowingly and willingly entered into 19 separate membership agreements with Palace Elite, investing over $1.4 million USD in exchange for exclusive benefits and rates intended strictly for personal use.\"\n\nThe company says the couple was found to be in \"material breach\" of the agreements in 2021 and accuses the Akeos of promoting and profiting from their benefits on social media.\n\nHowever, the Akeos' attorney, John Manly, disputed those claims and said the company's decision to pursue criminal charges was overblown.\n\n\"This is just a bunch of lies, and I think what the documents illustrate is this is a civil dispute,\" Manly said. \"We don't put people in prison in this country or in Mexico for breach of contract. This is a timeshare, not a crime share,\" Manly told CBS News Detroit.\n\nThe couple told reporters that the charges against them have been dropped.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nBad things can happen when presidents seem to lose their grip on reality.\n\nAfter a day of stock market shocks and global recriminations, there are reasons to question whether President Donald Trump fully grasps the consequences of the tariff barrage that he used to fire up a global trade war.\n\n“I think it’s going very well,” Trump told reporters Thursday, in the aftermath of his “Liberation Day” announcement the day before.\n\n“It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on and it’s a big thing,” Trump said. “We’ve never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.”\n\nAs chaos whipped across the planet and American seniors dreaded looking into depleted market-linked retirement savings accounts, Vice President JD Vance said, “We’re feeling good.” He told Newsmax: “Look, I frankly thought in some ways it could be worse in the markets because this is a big transition.”\n\nTheir bravado followed the worst day on Wall Street in five years, where $2.5 trillion was wiped off the S&P index. This financial carnage was not caused by some act of God, like a pandemic, or natural disaster, terrorist attack or foreign crisis. It was the result of a conscious choice by a president making a gut check call.\n\nStocks took another tumble on Friday morning after China imposed 34% reciprocal tariffs on US imports in a move that will make it far harder for US manufacturers to profit from its vast market. Trump, however, suggested he’d outwitted America’s superpower rival.\n\n“CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” he posted on Truth Social.\n\nThere are growing signs of confusion about the White House’s strategy, just weeks after Trump inherited an economy that was humming when President Joe Biden handed it over and stocks hit record highs.\n\nTrump suggested Thursday evening that his single-handed blitz against the global trading system was merely a bargaining position. “Tariffs give us great power to negotiate,” he told reporters on Air Force One as he left the growing crisis behind for one of his Florida resorts to host a tournament for the millionaire players on the Saudi-backed LIV rebel golf tour.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his son Eric Trump drive in a golf cart, after arriving on the ninth hole during previews for LIV Golf Miami at Trump National Doral Miami in Doral, Florida, on Thursday. Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images\n\nBut earlier, on “The Situation Room” on CNN, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, vowed: “The president is not going to back off.” And on Fox News, Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro insisted “this is not a negotiation.”\n\nThe conflicting messages and sense of drift posed fundamental questions of whether a presidential inner circle that critics have long said is delusional about the impact of a tariff war also has the competence to navigate out of the crisis.\n\nThose questions were exacerbated by the sleight of hand that the president used to deliver tariffs that he said were reciprocal and matched those that were a dollar-for-dollar match but in fact were not. The rudimentary formula that was used to arrive at bewildering tariff rates deepened the sense of fury among US trading partners.\n\n“They know nothing,” veteran Wall Street trader Peter Tuchman told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n\n“The formula they used … it’s like apples, oranges, a couple of cashews divided by 10 times four.” He added: “None of it makes any sense and billions and trillions of dollars are being wiped out of the market on a day-to-day basis.\n\n“It was nothing but blood on the streets.”\n\nThe Stellantis car factory in Toluca, Mexico, on Thursday. The company said it would pause production at some factories in Mexico, where it produces Dodge and Ram vehicles, and in Canada. Mario Vazquez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPrice hikes to come?\n\nFinancial experts predicted painful price hikes to consumer goods and a resurgence of inflation — just five months after Trump won reelection with a promise to cut the costs of food and housing that bedeviled the country for years.\n\nThe immediate impact of the tariff announcements was driven home when Stellantis, which produces Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, paused production at plants in Mexico and Canada. Some 900 US-based workers were temporarily laid off. They won’t be the last if the president’s action causes an economic downturn.\n\nThe enormous risk Trump is taking with the financial wellbeing of millions of people in the US and abroad is in tune with an early second term he’s using to conduct the most extravagant power grabs that he was talked out of in his first.\n\nTrump is challenging the rule of law with his expansive claims of executive power, has unleashed Elon Musk to eviscerate the federal government — including health care programs that have saved millions of lives. Migrants are being swept up off the streets or even expelled to a vicious El Salvador jail, often in apparent denial of due process and in defiance of judges and the rule of law.\n\nThe circus that took over the White House between 2017 and 2021 is back in town.\n\nAlmost unbelievable revelations about top officials discussing air attacks on Yemen on a chatroom app were followed by zero accountability for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for posting operational intelligence. The drama provoked the same anxiety about the competence of Trump’s national security team in a crisis as are now surrounding his economic brain trust.\n\nIn another stunning development, the White House fired multiple officials, including three National Security Council staffers after meeting Laura Loomer. The far-right activist who once branded 9/11 an inside job accused the officials of disloyalty to the president.\n\nTrump is causing havoc on his national security team while also upending decades of US foreign policy, as he has fractured confidence among America’s western allies that he’d defend them against Russia.\n\nNews on President Donald Trump's tariff's are seen displayed in New York's Times Square on Thursday. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nWhy Trump’s supporters back tariffs, at least for now\n\nA recurring trend of Trump’s political career is that his most outlandish acts — from his criminal indictments to his most outrageous uses of presidential power — often unleash a hysterical reaction from critics.\n\nIn the eye of the storms of his own creation, the president draws political energy from the controversy and wrong foots his opponents. So, it’s fair to ask whether Thursday’s uproar is an overreaction. After all this is far from the first stocks sell-off in history.\n\nTop officials insist that the tariffs are a first step towards building an economy that protects American workers and rebuilds manufacturing desecrated by the loss of US factory jobs to low wage economies in Asia and elsewhere.\n\n“What you’re going to see is factories going to be built here,” Lutnick told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “Why should US policy basically suggest that you can find the cheapest labor in the world with the worst labor conditions in the whole wide world, the worst pollution … no environmental rules at all, let’s go build there because it’s really cheap, and we will sell it to the great American economy?”\n\nNo one can argue that the toll inflicted on former industrial heartlands is an unworthy issue for a president. And Trump is responding directly to the thwarted aspirations of millions of his voters who don’t care that Wall Street traders took a hammering or that American allies who they regard as freeloaders are angry.\n\nAnd since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization ended up bankrolling its spectacular rise, shouldn’t someone be asking whether a trade policy that created a superpower enemy should be adjusted?\n\nTrump’s supporters — in the democratic election that he won in 2024 — also voted for maximum disruption: He left no doubt that he’d be unleashed in a second term, even if some of his advisers suggested during the campaign, as they have this week, that tariffs would just be used as a negotiating tool rather than a permanent high barrier.\n\nIt’s the same with national security. The disapproving foreign policy elites who condemn Trump officials for lax cellphone use come from the same intellectual class that brought America the lost wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And whether it’s fair or not, many citizens view the federal government as indifferent to their plight and ripe for Musk’s chainsaw.\n\n“To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on CNN Thursday, trying, and failing, to calm the coming stock market mayhem. “This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term.”\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell on Thursday. Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe acid test of Trump’s popularity\n\nWall Street traders may no longer trust Trump, but it will take more than a stock market slump to shatter the rare bond that the president enjoys with his base.\n\nStill, if the markets crisis develops into a recession and if the temporary pain that administration officials say will pave the way to a new economic golden age turns out to be more permanent, Trump’s support may face its steepest test. Coming days may establish whether the president and his supporters are willing to pay a significant economic or political price for the fruition of campaign trail vows.\n\nAnd ahead of midterm elections in November 2026, Trump’s fellow Republicans may soon start to learn whether more moderate and independent voters who bought into Trump’s vaunted dealmaking and business mystique and thought he could supercharge the economy will stick with his party when he’s off the ballot.\n\n“The challenge these tariffs are going to present is that they are almost certainly going to raise the cost of living for Americans at least in the short-term,” Republican pollster and strategist Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNN’s Kasie Hunt.\n\n“What Donald Trump is asking is for everybody to endure a little bit of short-term pain in exchange for some long-term benefit — in his view a healthy reordering of the global economy,” she said. “In politics, because we have elections every two years for Congress — saying that this is going to be very good for you way down the road is a tough sell for a lot of voters.”\n\nBut the administration — beyond unspecific warnings about short term disruption — still isn’t conceding Americans will face price hikes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks to board Marine One on Thursday. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\n“Foreign nations who have to sell here are going to lower their prices and then the next thing they’re going to do is continue to manipulate their currency, so our currency is going to get stronger,” Navarro told CNN’s Phil Mattingly. “We’re going to have more purchasing power for the imports. That’s going to offset it.”\n\nThese predictions could be a trap for the White House. Past presidents have irrevocably severed trust with the public when they insisted on a reality that voters could perceive was false. This includes Lyndon Johnson’s insistence on expanding a war he was losing in Vietnam, George W. Bush’s denial when victory in Iraq degenerated into an insurgency and Joe Biden’s insistence that the chaotic exit from Afghanistan was a success.\n\nJudging by their remarks on Thursday, Trump and Vance risk going down a similar road even as their situation promises to get worse.\n\n“Usually, when you have a terrible stock market experience, it’s because a bank fails or there’s a pandemic or there’s a hurricane or some other country does something,” former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CNN’s Hunt.\n\n“We don’t have these kind of stock market responses in response to polices that the president of the United States is proud of. That is something that is entirely without precedent and it is extremely dangerous.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nThe Trump administration has fired the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, the United States’ powerful cyber intelligence bureau, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation, members of the Senate and House intelligence committees and two former officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe dismissal of Gen. Timothy Haugh, who also leads US Cyber Command — the military’s offensive and defensive cyber unit — is a major shakeup of the US intelligence community which is navigating significant changes in the first two months of the Trump administration. Wendy Noble, Haugh’s deputy at NSA, was also removed, according to the former officials and lawmakers.\n\nThe top Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committee, Sen. Mark Warner and Rep. Jim Himes, denounced the firing of Haugh, who served in the roles since February 2024, in statements on Thursday night.\n\nLt. Gen. William Hartman, an experienced military officer and the deputy of Cyber Command, is expected to serve as acting head of the command and NSA, the two former officials said.\n\nThe news of the dismissals comes as the White House also fired multiple staff members on the National Security Council on Thursday, after Laura Loomer, the far-right activist who once claimed 9/11 was an inside job, urged President Donald Trump during a Wednesday meeting to do so, arguing that they were disloyal.\n\nLoomer, who brought a list with roughly a dozen names of people she deemed insufficient in their support of Trump, also advocated for the firing of Haugh and Noble, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.\n\nDuring the meeting, Loomer told the president that Haugh specifically should be fired because he was handpicked by the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. Haugh was nominated in 2023, while Milley was serving, to head up the NSA and Cyber Command.\n\nIn a social media post overnight Loomer said, “NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired. As a Biden appointee, General Haugh had no place serving in the Trump admin given the fact that he was HAND PICKED by General Milley.” She went on, “Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.”\n\nLoomer did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on Haugh and Noble’s dismissals, however, she told CNN on Thursday that it “was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security.”\n\nCyber Command and the NSA declined to comment. CNN has requested comment from the White House National Security Council.\n\nHaugh told his colleagues to support Trump’s national security priorities in an emotional farewell note that touted the agency and command’s successes in countering threats from China and elsewhere.\n\n“Now, more than ever, the Command and Agency need your courage, commitment and sacrifice,” Haugh wrote in a message to NSA and Cyber Command employees Friday that CNN reviewed. “I ask you to support the President and keep after our Nation’s priorities.”\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell issued a statement on Haugh’s departure on Friday afternoon: “The Defense Department thanks General Timothy Haugh for his decades of service to our nation, culminating as U.S. Cyber Command Commander and National Security Agency Director. We wish him and his family well.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, called the move “insane” and said he hasn’t received an explanation for the decision in a strong reaction on “CNN News Central” Friday morning.\n\n“You’re talking about a moment where you would not want to destabilize the national security agency, and this is exactly what the president has done, without any explanation to any of us, except to listen to Laura Loomer. And you know this is just more again, just pure chaos instead of common sense,” Gottheimer told CNN’s Kate Bolduan.\n\nLast month, Haugh hosted billionaire Elon Musk, who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency, at the NSA and Cyber Command headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland.\n\nSome current and former defense officials say there is a growing culture of fear inside the officer ranks within the Defense Department, among officials who worry that they could be fired at any moment for conduct deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump.\n\nHaugh was not in the now-infamous group chat on the messaging app Signal, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top officials discussed a sensitive military operation targeting the Houthis in Yemen while unaware that a journalist was part of the group. At a House Intelligence Committee hearing last week where Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled about the Signal group chat debacle, Haugh testified that, in general, there are risks to using the app.\n\nNSA is one of the US government’s most powerful and critical spy agencies. Its code breakers and computer operatives conduct intelligence operations all over the world that provide insights to the president and his top advisers. Cyber Command was established over a decade ago to combat growing foreign threats in cyberspace and has matured considerably in the years since.\n\nCyber Command has taken on a prominent role in defending US elections from foreign influence and interference, including by knocking a Russian troll farm offline in the 2018 election and defending against Iranian hackers in the 2020 election.\n\nRenée Burton, a cybersecurity expert who spent more than two decades at NSA, called the news of Haugh and Noble’s ouster “alarming.”\n\n“NSA’s mission is vast and extremely complicated,” Burton told CNN. “General Haugh and Ms. Noble have built the expertise and credibility it takes to oversee such a vital part of our national security. Replacing them will not be easy and the disruption will expose the country to new risk.”\n\nIn an unprecedented purge of the military’s senior leadership in February, Trump fired the top US general just moments before Hegseth fired the chief of the US Navy and the vice chief of the Air Force.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

A judge then dismissed the criminal case and ordered their release, the prosecutor's office said.\n\nThe family has said the Akeos were the victims of “a kidnapping and extortion attempt” by a Mexican timeshare company.\n\nPalace Elite Resorts, a Mexican hospitality company, previously said the couple defrauded it through $117,000 of chargebacks on their American Express card, in which American Express takes back funds from a vendor.\n\nThe couple bought a timeshare membership with the company several years earlier, Palace Elite Resorts said.\n\nThe company said it filed a complaint with the Mexican public prosecutor, which then led to the arrests of the Akeos.\n\nThe couple denies the allegations, and their law firm said Thursday that they were “held captive for 32 days in Cereso Cancun prison.”\n\nJohn Manly, an attorney for the Akeos, previously called the fraud charges “utterly false.”\n\n“The Akeos are being held because they successfully disputed Palace’s charges and failure to deliver services with American Express, criticized the company online and alerted others who felt wronged by Palace,” he said.\n\nThe Akeo family thanked President Donald Trump, his special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, and Rep.

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nAs President Donald Trump departed the White House on Thursday afternoon — his first time in public since announcing sweeping new tariffs that have jolted global markets and sparked recession fears — he likened the duties he imposed this week to a successful medical procedure.\n\n“I think it’s going well,” Trump said, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded down more than 3% and as one US automaker laid off 900 hourly workers, citing reduced production prompted by the tariffs. “It was an operation, when like a patient gets operated on,” the president said.\n\nIn reality, the operation hasn’t even begun. The new duties he announced will take effect at the end of this week and next, likely thrusting the global economy into uncharted territory and putting Trump’s economic acumen to the test.\n\nBut how much the president is willing to bend on his new tariffs was a question foreign leaders, Republican lawmakers and Wall Street investors were all asking as the tariff plan came into sharper focus.\n\nThe message from Trump’s top advisers was one of resolute commitment to the heavy duties applied to all US trading partners, friend and foe alike. “The president is not going to back off,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNN’s Pamela Brown in an interview Thursday.\n\nBut the president himself suggested he was open for talks — if the terms were good enough.\n\n“Every country has called us. That’s the beauty of what we do, we put ourselves in the driver’s seat,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as Lutnick stood behind him.\n\n“If we would have asked these countries to do us a favor, they would have said no,” Trump went on. “Now they will do anything for us.”\n\nTrump and his team have offered sanguine proclamations against the dire economic warnings, suggesting days of red on Wall Street and price increases for American consumers are worth it if it meant Trump’s big goals — the reorientation of the entire global economy and a resurgence of American manufacturing — are met down the road.\n\nBut even Republicans who said they supported Trump’s attempts to realign global trade suggested they were watching for some kind of calibration by the administration.\n\n“Right now we are all kind of waiting and seeing and seeing how the administration reacts and what the ultimate permanent policy may look like,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, suggesting the tariffs Trump announced from the Rose Garden a day earlier were not, in fact, the final word on the matter.\n\nAnd overseas, American diplomats were facing questions from governments who struggled to understand how the new tariff rates were calculated on their countries — or, in some cases, on uninhabited islands that export virtually nothing.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who left the Rose Garden announcement and headed directly to his airplane, was in Brussels, where the new tariffs hung over a meeting of NATO foreign ministers like a black cloud.\n\nMuted reaction on Capitol Hill\n\nAs markets shuttered and global leaders threatened retaliation, the president himself evinced little worry. He emerged from the White House midafternoon Thursday and predicted a quick turnaround in the markets.\n\n“The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” Trump told reporters gathered on the White House South Lawn.\n\nTrump was heading to Florida, where he was scheduled to attend a golf tournament at his Doral club outside Miami before retreating to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. The tariff matter had consumed much of his time this week as the president determined how, precisely, to proceed with the tariffs he’d spent the last six weeks promising.\n\nIn meetings with his trade team, Trump pushed advisers for a plan that couldn’t be labeled soft or weak, mindful that some previous moves on tariffs had the appearance of backing down from his previous threats.\n\nHis team prepared stacks of analyses, reports and individual plans to apply new tariffs that could be described as “reciprocal,” the term Trump has used to justify starting a global trade war.\n\nAfter debating various ideas — including a draft plan applying a 20% universal tariff on all imported goods and a tiered system that placed countries into bands of new tariff rates — by Tuesday the president and his team arrived at the tariff scheme he announced from the Rose Garden a day later.\n\nThe tariff rates assigned to each country — revealed on cardboard signs the president pointed to, with the numbers only visible to those in the front rows — initially prompted confusion. It was only later that it became clear they were not, in fact, dollar-for-dollar comparisons to countries’ own tariffs but a different calculation altogether, using trade surplus numbers.\n\nThe announcement, which was attended by steel workers, pipe fitters, truck drivers and some Republican leaders, received a muted reception even from some of the president’s top allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nThune, who hails from the agricultural state of South Dakota, said the short-term market reaction to Trump’s tariffs proposal was not “unexpected” even as he cautioned there must be vigilance to make sure certain sectors of the economy aren’t damaged by the long-term impacts of the tariffs.\n\n“That’s not unexpected. The markets expectedly were going to react. This is again a policy. It’s a big policy change, bold policy change and I think it is going to take some time to determine what the ultimate impacts are going to be,” he said.\n\nThe wait-and-see approach was echoed by many Republicans in Congress who have argued Trump’s team must be given some runway to see the impact of this massive economic policy.\n\n“Why don’t you ask me in two months,” said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. “I think it’s a wait-and-see proposition.”\n\nBoth South Dakota and Iowa are states with heavy agricultural interests that may have to now pay more to import Canadian fertilizer and find it more difficult to export their commodities. But despite their deep concerns about tariffs, Thune, Grassley and many other Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump’s moves.\n\nQuestions overseas about the administration’s willingness to negotiate\n\nTrump’s tariff rollout stunned foreign diplomats in Washington, some of whom said they stayed up most of the night to analyze and answer questions from their capitals.\n\nSome Trump allies are giving diplomats clear advice: Tell their governments to stay out of it, three sources familiar with the conversations said. Instead, send their companies doing business with the US into White House meetings in order to prompt the administration to make a deal, the sources said.\n\nSome close to the president, however, suggested he would be flexible as leaders scramble to lower the tariff rates.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,” the president’s son Eric Trump wrote on X. “The first to negotiate will win - the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life…”\n\nBut Donald Trump’s claim that other countries “will do anything for us” now wasn’t immediately evident for Rubio in Brussels, where potentially difficult discussions with NATO allies were underway Thursday, every single one of which was slapped with tariffs.\n\nOfficials said the tariffs news was hanging over some of the conversations and meetings, meant to focus on more NATO-specific issues like defense spending and the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Obviously having this trade war going on makes it tough to do normal business,” said a Western official who told CNN that “it seems to be what most people are talking about.”\n\n“And if they are talking about tariffs,” the official continued, “it means they aren’t talking about the other priorities NATO needs to focus on.”\n\nOn the surface, Rubio appeared to have been greeted warmly by the alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, and his NATO counterparts. As they gathered for a group photo, Rubio chatted easily with the others, warmly shaking hands and kissing Canada’s Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on the cheeks.\n\nFinnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told CNN that the conversations have been “very constructive” and “very positive.”\n\n“The tariffs aren’t the best news,” Valtonen said, “but I hope that this is an opening to a fruitful negotiation, especially between friends and allies, whereby we could reach a situation in which we effectively will let go of the existing trade barriers between us. Because that’s what we need.”\n\nCNN’s Alex Marquardt, Ted Barrett, Manu Raju and Kylie Atwood contributed to this story.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nA public health association and one of the nation’s largest worker unions are suing the Trump administration over the abrupt cancellation of hundreds of research grants, arguing that the moves were arbitrary and capricious and that the federal grant process is supposed to be above politics.\n\nThe complaint was filed Wednesday in a Massachusetts court by the American Public Health Association, the United Auto Workers, which also represents research scientists, and several scholars against the US Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nHHS and NIH said they do not comment on pending litigation.\n\nNIH grant cancellations have been extremely rare in previous administrations, and the new cancellations will end hundreds of research projects, many of which have been underway for years.\n\n“People who are trying to wrestle with leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this country – indeed, around the world – are finding that their well-intentioned efforts, ratified for its quality by the NIH itself, has suddenly come under a microscope because it offends the sensibilities of a given political interest, and that’s just exactly what the NIH process is supposed to be insulated against,” said one of the plaintiffs, Dr. Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nNIH grants canceled\n\nLurie, a former associate commissioner at the US Food and Drug Administration, was an adviser and consultant on a project whose NIH grant was canceled after about nine months. The NIH said the grant was canceled because the project, which studied the effects of access to PrEP, medication that can prevent HIV infection, “no longer effectuates agency priorities.”\n\nThe NIH has canceled hundreds of grants since President Donald Trump’s second presidency began, and the agency said last week that it did so “in accordance with the Presidential Memo ‘Radical Transparency About Wasteful Spending.’ ”\n\nThe executive order says that the government spends too much money on “programs, contracts, and grants that do not promote the interests of the American people” and directs all agency heads to let the public know the details of “every terminated program, cancelled contract, terminated grant, or any other discontinued obligation of Federal funds.”\n\nMany of the canceled grants specifically touch on topics that Trump has directed agency heads to de-prioritize through executive orders on “radical and wasteful government DEI programs” and “defending women from gender ideology extremism.” The latter memo declared that there are only two sexes and directed agencies to erase even any mention of and end any program that included people who identify as transgender.\n\nAmong the targets of the cancellations are projects on racial or gender differences and diseases that disproportionately affect minority communities, like HIV.\n\nGone is funding for a project to understand the connection between minority stress and intimate partner violence and another that looked at gender disparities in adolescent mental health. But other canceled grants were not specifically focused on minority communities; one given to Columbia University went toward research on the effectiveness of using wastewater to forecast the severity of Covid-19 outbreaks.\n\nMany of the projects were well under way.\n\n“All those billions of dollars of investment are wasted,” said Lisa Mankofsky, one of the attorneys on the new lawsuit. She represents the Center for Science and the Public Interest, an organization that advocates for evidence-based and nutrition, food safety and health policies, but that group is not a plaintiff in the suit.\n\nThe cancellation of projects won’t just hurt researchers, she said, it will halt treatments for patients and could even cost people their lives.\n\n“The topics that are covered under all of these terminations are some of the most pressing issues in public health: cancer, strokes, cardiac health, Alzheimer’s, suicide prevention, Covid vaccine hesitancy, depression. I could go on and on because NIH’s work is so widespread and so important, all those topics are covered,” Mankofsky said.\n\nThe NIH is by far the biggest single funder of biomedical research in the world, and its backing is considered the gold standard of research support. Thousands of scientists compete for the funding every year. Grant decisions are made by leading scientific experts in the field at NIH who deliberate over the merit of the work for months.\n\nHHS regulations stipulate that there are only limited circumstances in which a grant can be canceled: for cause, such as when the grant fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or with the consent of the grantee.\n\n“None of those apply here,” Mankofsky said.\n\nPolitics, Lurie said, is not supposed to factor into NIH decision-making.\n\n“It’s supposed to be insulated from political interference.\n\nBut what is happening now, this is precisely what the process was designed to protect against,” he said.\n\nThe complaint argues that the grant cancellations were an arbitrary and capricious act, exceeding statutory authority, and are void because they are vague – “so vague that the recipients of the terminations can’t know what is and what isn’t prohibited,” Mankofsky said.\n\nThe complaint also argues that Congress is given exclusive power over spending and lawmaking and that by deciding to pull funding, the executive branch is repealing congressional statues unilaterally.\n\nPulling minority-focused grants directly contradicts a directive of Congress, Mankofsky said.\n\nWith the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000, Congress directed the NIH to conduct and support research with respect to minority health conditions and other populations with health disparities and to give priority to this kind of research.\n\nPart of a wave of lawsuits\n\nIt’s the latest in a wave of litigation against the Trump administration. There have been more than 100 lawsuits filed against the administration’s executive actions in the first months of Trump’s second presidency.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic attorneys general and governors in 23 states and Washington, DC, filed a lawsuit against HHS arguing that the department’s sudden rollback of $12 billion in public health funding was unlawful and harmful.\n\nIn March, faculty and national labor unions sued the Trump administration for cutting off $400 million in federal funds for public health research at Columbia University, arguing that these decisions are compelling speech restrictions on campus. The administration said it acted because of what it said was the school’s failure to end antisemitism on a campus that has seen multiple high-profile pro-Palestinian demonstrations in the wake of the war in Gaza.\n\nIn February, multiple academic institutions sued HHS and the NIH for capping the amount of reimbursements available in medical research grants, arguing that such a policy exceeds the NIH’s authority. In March, a judge issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the implementation of NIH plans to slash research overhead payments. In a separate suit, several nonprofits also sued HHS and the NIH over the issue.\n\nLurie hopes the latest lawsuit will force the Trump administration to continue to fund important public health projects.\n\n“Really, the main thing for people to understand is that this is a fundamental attack on a disfavored group,” he said, “but its implications go beyond even that to include the very edifice of the scientific enterprise itself.”\n\nThe NIH is the “beacon on the hill,” he said, where the most prestigious research is conducted and funded.\n\n“To have it undermined in this way is really to give ourselves a black eye to ourselves as a country,” Lurie said.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a series of false claims about tariffs and trade – most of which he has made before – in the Wednesday speech in which he announced a sweeping set of global tariffs.\n\nHere is a fact check of some of Trump’s remarks.\n\nCanada’s dairy tariffs\n\nTrump correctly noted that Canada has tariffs exceeding 250% on some US dairy products. However, he falsely claimed that merely “the first little carton of milk” exported to Canada faces a “very low price,” but “then it gets up to 275, 300%.”\n\nIn reality, Canada has guaranteed that tens of thousands of metric tons of imported US milk per year, not merely a single carton, will face zero tariffs at all; Canada conceded a certain guaranteed level of tariff-free US access to its dairy market as part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump’s own first administration negotiated.\n\nTrump also didn’t mention something the US dairy industry acknowledges: The US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum level of exports to Canada in any category of dairy product, so the Canadian tariffs aren’t being applied; with regard to milk in particular, the US isn’t even at half of the tariff-free quota. (There is a vigorous US-Canada debate about why the US is so far from the maximum, with each country blaming the other. Regardless of who’s right, the tariffs aren’t hitting US milk.)\n\nTrump has persistently omitted key facts about Canada’s dairy tariffs. You can read more here from a previous CNN fact check.\n\nUS trade deficit with Canada\n\nTrump, claiming “we subsidize a lot of countries,” falsely said “it’s close to $200 billion a year” with Canada. Trump has repeatedly used this $200 billion figure to describe the US trade deficit with Canada in particular, which is actually far lower than $200 billion; official US statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion and $70.6 billion in goods trade alone.\n\nTrump didn’t mention the trade deficit in particular this time, but even if he was intending to use the word “subsidize” more broadly, there is no basis for the claim.\n\nWho pays tariffs\n\nTrump repeated his frequent false claim that, because of the tariffs he imposed on China during his first term, the US “took in hundreds of billions of dollars” that “they paid.” In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on China; it’s easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\n\nPrevious presidents’ tariffs on China\n\nTrump also repeated his frequent false claim that, before his first presidency, China “never paid 10 cents to any other president” from tariffs. Aside from the fact that US importers make the tariff payments, the US was actually generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since 1789. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nUS wealth\n\nTouting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump claimed that “the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been” from 1789 to 1913, when tariffs made up a higher percentage of federal revenue before the passage of a 1913 law reestablishing the federal income tax.\n\nTrump didn’t explain what he meant by “proportionately the wealthiest,” but by standard measures, the US is far wealthier today than it was in the early 20th century and prior. Per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.\n\nDouglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economics professor who studies the history of US trade policy, said in February after Trump had made similar claims, that if Trump’s unclear comments are interpreted to be about per capita income, as “economists usually take this,” it is “obviously not true,” since “real per capita income and standards of living are so much higher today than the past. … It is nice to have indoor plumbing, running water, not outhouses, etc.”\n\nIrwin noted then that it’s possible Trump had been referring to how the federal government after the Civil War “ran consistent budget surpluses and almost paid off the national debt,” since “he seems to view the government taking in more money than it is spending as making the country rich.” Irwin added, though, that “big fiscal surpluses don’t make a country rich, per se.”\n\nInflation under Biden and Trump\n\nTrump falsely claimed that, during Joe Biden’s presidency, the US had “the highest” inflation “in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said that the year-over-year US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920. (And the rate then plummeted. Inflation in the last full month of the Biden administration, December 2024, was 2.9%; it was 3% in January 2025, a month partly under Biden and partly under Trump.)\n\nTrump also claimed that there was “virtually no inflation” during his first presidency. He gave himself some wiggle room with the word “virtually,” but it’s worth noting that there was inflation during his first four years in office; prices rose about 8% from the beginning of that presidency to the end. Year-over-year inflation was 1.4% in the month he left office, January 2021.\n\nGas prices\n\nTrump, claiming he has brought prices “way down” since taking office again in late January, said that “gasoline is way under $3.” That is true in some parts of the country, but the national average for regular gasoline on the day he spoke was about $3.24 per gallon, according to data published by AAA – higher than on Trump’s inauguration day, when the AAA national average was about $3.12.\n\nThat’s not to say Trump is responsible for the increase; presidents have a limited impact on gas prices, and there was a larger increase over the equivalent period last year. But the national average has not fallen during this presidency to date.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

China, one of the United States’ largest trading partners, would be hit with a 54% tariff, the European Union with 20%, India with 26% and Japan with 24%, among many others.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how Trump or the White House had calculated those numbers; a handout listing the tariffs said it included “currency manipulation and trade barriers.”\n\nU.S. stock markets sharply reversed earlier gains as Trump made his remarks. In after-hours trading, S&P 500 futures fell 1.5%.\n\nAmerica has been “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered,” Trump said in announcing the latest iteration of his tariff regime set to begin this week. He said from the White House Rose Garden that American industry “will be reborn” and touted a new “golden age of America.”\n\nThe context: The announcement is an effort to impose sweeping changes on decades-old trading arrangements under which the United States increasingly outsource some labor-intensive manufacturing to foreign countries in return for cheaper goods — at the cost, critics have said, of America’s industrial base.\n\nThe tariffs are expected to take a toll on many companies whose products rely on global supply chains, which could be forced to raise prices or endure thinner profit margins. The White House and its surrogates have tried to communicate a message of patience and endurance, warning that some pain will be ahead but that the trade-off would be worthwhile eventually.\n\nIt’s unclear how that will play with the American public, especially after Trump came into office with promises of stable or even lower prices after an inflation-heavy recovery under President Joe Biden following the vast economic disruptions of the pandemic.\n\nZooming out on the stock market: Rob also notes that after an initial burst in the wake of Trump’s victory in November, stocks have shifted downward as investors began to digest that Trump was planning to make good on significantly increasing trade duties.\n\nHow Congress is responding: Four Senate Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine; Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — are expected to vote for a Democratic resolution to block Trump’s Canadian tariffs, Frank Thorp V, Scott Wong and Sahil Kapur report.\n\nIf all 47 Senate Democrats also support it, the measure would have enough votes to pass through the upper chamber, though it wouldn’t go anywhere in the House. Trump called out those four GOP senators by name on Truth Social.\n\nFollow live tariffs coverage →\n\nRepublicans aren’t panicking about Trump or Elon Musk after Tuesday’s elections\n\nBy Bridget Bowman and Adam Edelman\n\nRepublicans say they’re not panicking as they gear up for major races this year and a fierce battle for control of Congress next year, despite getting shellacked in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race — and seeing their margins decrease notably in a pair of House special election wins in deep-red Florida districts.\n\nDemocrats have largely cast the 10-point win by the liberal candidate in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race Tuesday as a rejection by voters of Elon Musk, the billionaire White House adviser who took on a starring role in the campaign. And while the two wins by GOP candidates in Florida gave the party some breathing room with its narrow House majority, the sizes of their victories paled in comparison which what Republicans enjoyed in those districts five months ago.\n\nRepublicans, however, downplayed the results as expected outcomes — criticizing some of the GOP candidates, discounting the prospect of any broader fallout from the heavy-handed role Musk played in Wisconsin and suggesting that their candidates do a better job doubling down on explaining to voters Trump’s accomplishments, including divisive ones like his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nDemocrats found some early success demonizing Musk in the Wisconsin race and believe they can expand that strategy. But while Musk will “continue to be active” in GOP campaigns, his prominent role in the party may be about to change: Trump told members of his Cabinet on March 24, more than a week before Tuesday’s elections, that Musk would leave his government role in the coming months.\n\nRead more →\n\nSteve Kornacki: How Democratic voter intensity powered Susan Crawford to a win in Wisconsin\n\nRubio prepares to confront an anxious NATO\n\nAnalysis by Andrea Mitchell\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio arrives at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday morning for the first time since he became the country’s top diplomat. He will find European leaders who are increasingly anxious about continued support from the military alliance’s most dominant member and resentful of the Trump White House.\n\nSeveral episodes in recent weeks underscore the challenges Rubio will face. Vice President JD Vance’s and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s recent criticisms revealed in a leaked Signal chat immediately reverberated around European capitals. Western diplomats have told me they are further aggrieved by what they see as Trump and Vance’s ambush of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month in the Oval Office. And there are concerns over the recent negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, notably including the latest U.S. draft of an agreement that would require Ukraine to sign over not only its minerals but also its oil and gas rights to a Delaware-based fund that the United States would control — limiting Ukraine’s access to other financing for reconstruction after the war.\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister will be in Brussels meeting with NATO ministers and the secretary general but is not scheduled to meet with Rubio as negotiations with the United States are on hold pending an anticipated call Trump has said he will soon have with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhile the U.S. goal at NATO is to further press allies to contribute more to mutual defense, European ministers are focusing on how to go it alone without the United States if necessary by creating a European security force for Ukraine. Poland and Germany have suggested trying to obtain nuclear weapons should Trump withdraw from NATO entirely.\n\nThose tensions will only be exacerbated by Trump’s new tariffs. And then there’s Canada’s furor over Trump’s insistence that it become America’s 51st state, even though that will never happen.\n\nFinally, in the category of “manifest destiny,” Trump refused to rule out taking Greenland — a territory owned by Denmark, a NATO ally — by force in his comments to Kristen Welker last Sunday.\n\nWelcome to NATO headquarters, Mr. Secretary. It’s going to be an interesting debut visit.\n\n🗞️ Today’s other top stories ➡️ Deportation fallout: Two women the Trump administration tried to send to an El Salvador prison spoke out after the country refused to take them, saying they were “lied to.” Read more →\n\nTwo women the Trump administration tried to send to an El Salvador prison spoke out after the country refused to take them, saying they were “lied to.” Read more → 🎤 A boost from Booker: Sen.

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump unveiled what he called “our Declaration of Economic Independence” on Wednesday at his “Liberation Day” event, announcing reciprocal tariffs on other countries in order to bring back the “American dream.”\n\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden to members of Congress and the Senate, labor union groups, and the press, Trump said American taxpayers have been “ripped off for more than 50 years, but it’s not going to happen anymore”:\n\nReferring to American workers, some of whom were in the audience, the president said, “They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once-beautiful American dream.”\n\nWe had an American dream that you don’t hear so much about — you did four years ago, and you are now, but you know, too often for many years, and decades even, you didn’t hear too much about our country. And its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it’s not going to happen anymore. It’s not going to happen. In a few moments, I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal — that means they do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple, can’t get any simpler than that.\n\nApplause erupted in the Rose Garden before Trump said, “This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our Declaration of Economic Independence.”\n\n“For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now, it’s our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt and it will all happen very quickly. With today’s action, we are finally going to be able to Make America Great Again — greater than ever before.\n\nA chart displayed by Trump at his podium and posted by his rapid response team on X revealed the breakdown of tariffs:\n\nThe tariffs start with a baseline of 10 percent for all nations, but several received higher, based on half the amount they charge the United States.\n\nChina’s 67-percent tariff on the United States is being met with a 34-percent tariff in response, and the E.U.’s 39-percent tariff is being met with a 20-percent tariff.\n\nTrump added that a 25-percent tariff on “all foreign-made automobiles” will go into effect at midnight.\n\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, D.C.

      "full_content": "Photo: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMy initial reaction to the news that Cory Booker was going to hold the Senate floor for many hours to dramatize his opposition to Trump 2.0 was a bit despairing: Having demonstrated that they no longer have any leverage over the administration and its supine congressional allies, Senate Democrats would now just talk as long as they could, as the chamber’s rules allowed. It wouldn’t change anything, but what was the harm?\n\nBut now that Democrats everywhere are greeting Booker’s historic non-filibuster filibuster with joy, I realize there was a practical benefit to his feat of endurance beyond consigning Strom Thurmond’s 1957 speaking record to the dustbin of history, where it belongs next to the segregationist cause it served. After months of strenuous efforts by Democrats to identify a precise silver-bullet argument against Trump’s agenda and how it was being pursued, Booker showed pretty unmistakably that a general indictment of the administration and its enablers, delivered with passionate intensity, is actually what alarmed Americans are craving.\n\nBooker didn’t concentrate on Trump’s potential Medicaid cuts, illegal deportations, cruelty to public employees, abandonment of Ukraine, violations of civil liberties, reckless tariffs, usurpations of legislative powers, rampant corruption, or thuggish threats to federal judges. He talked about all this and more as a way to dramatize the ongoing assault on both democracy and the well-being of poor and middle-class Americans.\n\nIt’s the sheer avalanche of bad policies, bad administration, and bad faith that makes the current situation such an emergency. And forgetting about that in order to identify some single poll-tested nugget of messaging has been a mistake all along. Among other things, the coolly analytical approach of sorting and weighing Trump outrages robs such criticism of the moral outrage circumstances merit. Booker wasn’t just appealing to a rhetorical tradition in treating today’s challenges as a “moral moment” requiring the “good trouble” exhibited by the civil-rights movement. He was calling attention to the fact that the MAGA movement truly has mounted a sustained, comprehensive assault on decades of slow but steady progress toward a wide array of worthy goals involving the health, wealth, liberty, and happiness of the American people, all in pursuit of a hallucinatory, often destructive vision of “American greatness.”\n\nNone of this means other Democrats should emulate Booker by seizing the nearest megaphone and talking for many hours. But it does mean a broad coalition of resistance to Trump 2.0 may require an equally broad message about what’s going on in this country and why it’s urgent to push back. Calling to mind the wide variety of outrages underway could also help Democrats develop a broad, credible agenda for what they intend to do if and when they return to power. Every day, it’s becoming more obvious that just returning to the federal policies and personnel in place on January 19, 2025, won’t be advisable or even possible. Rebuilding an effective set of public institutions and domestic and international relationships will involve the work of many hands, and many words of inspiration from leaders like Cory Booker.",

      "full_content": "This is what you’d get if Bruce Wayne decided to become the Joker rather than Batman. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe most tiresome intra-Democratic debate of them all soon reached crisis levels after Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory. Should the “party of the people” focus on the threat to democratic institutions MAGA authoritarians most definitely pose? Or should they instead pursue lost non-college-educated voters via the ancient “populist” formula of class warfare over purely economic issues? The debate has often become very personal, with “populists” tending to dismiss arguments about democracy as elitist mumbo jumbo unintelligible to working stiffs who just want to see the money, and people frightened about fascism worrying that Americans will cheerfully sell out our heritage of liberty for $2 a gallon gas.\n\nFortunately, and just in the nick of time, a figure has emerged at the highest levels of government who can instantly unite “populists” and “defenders of democracy.” That would be Elon Musk, who is simultaneously the richest man on earth (and in modern history) and an even greater threat to democratic institutions than Trump. He is, moreover, via the DOGE initiative, waging aggressive war on public-sector programs that restrain his tiny class of corporate predators and benefit the general public while violating every constitutional norm imaginable. And suffusing this entire assault on the people and the institutions to which Democrats should feel loyalty is a nihilistic personality exhibiting some of the worst impulses of the human race: narcissism, messianism, ethnocentrism, worship of power and technology, and a testosterone-poisoned lust for combat and destruction. It’s as though Bruce Wayne had decided to become the Joker instead of Batman.\n\nTerrifying as Musk is, Democrats should thank their lucky stars that he doesn’t simply operate in the background of the MAGA movement, financing Trump’s antics but otherwise remaining anonymous. No: He has insisted on a very public place on the stages of politics, commerce, and culture, rivaled only by his benefactor and enabler in the White House. And the more people see of him, the less they seem to like him.\n\nThis week’s judicial election in Wisconsin shows what happens when this peculiar man makes himself the center of attention in a popularity contest not limited to his sycophants on X. The most polarized electorate in the entire nation fed by the most expensive campaign ever to revolve around judges decided by a healthy margin that they did not want Elon Musk in charge of their destiny (much less the “destiny of humanity” he so fatuously claimed was at stake). And better yet, the dispirited ranks of Democrats turned out disproportionately at the polls in the first electoral test since last November’s disaster.\n\nIt’s now clear that so long as Musk is the most powerful figure in the administration and the living symbol of Trump 2.0, Democrats should make Musk-bashing even more of a daily preoccupation than it has already become. Populists can draw fresh attention to the very real class implications of DOGE’s assault on corporate regulation and on practical services like Social Security offices accessible to old folks and medical facilities that can keep middle-class people alive. Defenders of democratic institutions can continue to expose (and attack in courts) the arrogant pretense that self-appointed engineers who brag about their destructive intentions should be entrusted with “reforming” government. And everyone can keep exposing the deeply sinister tech-bro worldview Musk and his accomplices exemplify, aimed at converting the United States of America into a privately held corporate oligarchy governed by insanely wealthy elites deploying AI at will and treating life itself as a video game in which the losers are the rest of us.\n\nObviously, Musk-bashing won’t solve all the problems facing Democrats. They still need to regain public trust about their own values and competence. For one thing, DOGE’s very existence remains a terrible indictment of the contempt for government that is now so epidemic, and that Democrats have for so long either ignored or tried to buy off with popular benefits; they need their own credible “government reform” agenda and the determination to carry it out.\n\nBut make no mistake: Elon Musk is a political gift, particularly if his ego and Trump’s reliance on his support mean he will insist on keeping himself front and center, showing up at Cabinet meetings and MAGA rallies alike while indulging his endless glossolalia on X. So long as he remains the face of Trump 2.0, Democrats would be wise to make sure that face is the first thing Americans think of when they survey the political landscape. If Musk and DOGE crash or are subdued by the jealous god in the Oval Office (as some reports suggest Trump has signaled may happen), that is a very good thing in itself and a worthy goal for the opposition. The day Musk goes back to his businesses will be a red-letter day for both populists and defenders of democracy.",

      "full_content": "Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nRepublicans have a message for all the Elon Musk haters out there: He isn’t going away.\n\nThat’s even after Musk put himself center stage in Wisconsin and poured $25 million into the race for a supreme-court seat only to see his preferred candidate lose by nine points to Democratic-backed candidate, and after a pair of special congressional elections in Florida revealed a worsening national political environment for the GOP. “This is one of the moments when we separate the men from the boys,” says one longtime adviser to President Donald Trump. “These are battles worth fighting. And anybody that wants to go against Elon or the president is going to reveal what side of the line they are on.”\n\nThe result of Tuesday’s elections left Democrats crowing about what an increasing drag Musk is on Republican fortunes, especially after a series of polls over the past several weeks showed how precisely unpopular Musk and his DOGE initiative to reduce the size of government are. A survey by the Democratic polling outfit Blueprint earlier this month showed Musk’s favorability is 16 points underwater, ten points worse than Trump’s, as voters fret that he will move to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\n“Elon Musk turned what should have been a pretty run-of-the-mill judicial election into a referendum on him and he is the least popular thing in the Republican Party right now,” says Evan Roth Smith, Blueprint’s lead pollster, who pointed out that even 20 percent of voters who approve of the job Trump is doing also disapprove of the job Musk is doing.\n\n“His favorability is dropping at the rate of around five points every two weeks,” Roth Smith says. “It is not sustainable. He is a drag on the national party, he is a drag on the White House, and now somehow he has made himself a drag on state and local candidates and at some point the Republicans are going to have to ask themselves some serious questions about how willing they are to tie themselves to the rock of Elon Musk and let themselves sink to the bottom of the ocean.”\n\nDespite that, Republicans say this amounts to a Democratic psyop to cashier him and it won’t work. Musk is the richest person in the world and he is willing to spend that money to get Republicans elected. Republicans have struggled in off-year elections for a decade now, their thinking goes, especially when Trump is in the White House. For all of the attention on Musk this year, Crawford ran only one point ahead of Janet Protasiewicz, the 2023 Democratic-backed candidate for a judgeship in Wisconsin in a race that also attracted a torrent of national attention. And while in Florida, Democrat Josh Weil ran roughly 16 points ahead of Kamala Harris in a race that attracted over $10 million in Democratic, mostly small-dollar donations, he still lost the deep-red district to Trump-backed Randy Fine. His performance was not as strong as that of Democrat Gay Valimont, who ran roughly 23 points ahead of Harris in a nearby, even deeper-red district in a race that attracted far less interest from the media or out-of-district partisans.\n\nThe lesson for Republicans is that the more attention they can bring to these off-cycle elections, the better they do, and no one besides Trump is better at getting attention than Musk. The billionaire admitted that his stunt of giving away $1 million checks to voters who sign his PAC’s petitions — a stunt of questionable legality, it should be noted — was because “we need to get attention.”\n\n“It causes the legacy media to, like, kind of lose their minds, and then they’ll run it on every news channel,” Musk said at a Sunday-night town hall in Wisconsin. “And I’m like, I couldn’t pay them to, it would cost, like, ten times more … to get the kind of coverage that we get.”\n\nMusk, who only took a late interest in the race, grew to be so invested that he called it existential, telling a rally crowd that the previously sleepy affair could determine who controls the House after the latest round of redistricting, “which then steers the course of western civilization,” adding that “I feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.”\n\nIt was a Trumpian raising of the stakes, only without Donald Trump, who only committed to a tele-town hall in the race, but otherwise mostly steered clear of what looked like a likely Republican defeat.\n\nTrump recently told his inner circle that Musk would soon be stepping away from his White House role. Musk’s status as a “special government employee” only allows him to work as the de facto head of DOGE for 130 days, which means he and the cost-cutting outfit he runs will likely only last until the end of May. He may step away from the government, but not, Republicans hope, from the greater cause of electing more Republicans.\n\n“We have one big problem, which is that when Donald Trump is on the ballot our voters come out to fucking vote, and when he is not, they don’t,” says another Republican strategist close to Trump. “So how do we solve that problem? We let Elon Musk be our sugar daddy and get our voters out.”",

      "full_content": "Disgraced reality show star Alec Baldwin watched Ken Burns’ epic documentary The Civil War and concluded America is “in a pre-Civil War culture now.”\n\nIt’s “awful that this country had to go through that, awful,” he said referring to the Civil War. “I look at the politics of it, of where people are in this country today, in the division and how they’re holding fast, and no one’s going to falter, no one’s going to break or compromise. And it’s bad.”\n\n“So I think in terms of that,” he added, “in order for us to get anywhere, it doesn’t seem likely right now. And watching this show really reminded me of how we are in a very similar state now, in a pre-Civil War culture, in a pre-Civil War environment. It’s hard to believe.”\n\nHay, it is good to know Baldwin’s wife gave him permission to speak, or maybe she was out in the backyard barefoot making homemade tortillas in a sombrero.\n\nWhat is Baldwin talking about — Civil War? We just had a national election with a clear winner who was handed a clear mandate from a majority of the American people. The only people committing violence over this are those among the lunatic left who are on the wrong side of 80/20 issues like auditing the government, deporting gang members and terrorists, mutilating kids to appease the trans loons, and keeping men out of women’s sports.\n\nOther than those wackos, the number of people who say the country is on the right track has hit 20-year highs. President Trump’s approval rating sits at a healthy 50 percent, and there’s an overall feeling that the uptight Woke Terror is ending, so we can all have fun again.\n\nNothing happening today resembles the Bloody Kansas mentality of the Civil War. If anything, we are back in the late 60s and early 70s of the Weather Underground, where spoiled, crybaby, entitled leftists can’t handle not getting their way so they resort to violence.\n\nBaldwin might be so frustrated over Trump’s triumphant reelection that he’s ready for violence, for a Civil War. And I can understand why. Like a lot of insulated celebrities, he thought his “art” (e.g. his terrible Trump impression on Saturday Night Live) would be the end of Trump’s political career. That kind of failure, coupled with his wife’s public emasculation of him, must make Baldwin feel like an incel with no power who is eager to lash out.\n\nThe biggest difference between the actual Civil War and today is this… Back then, half the country felt that the federal government was over-stepping its bounds when it came to telling the individual states what to do. Back then, people did not consider themselves Americans. They saw themselves as citizens of their respective states; as Virginians, Texans, and Tennesseans. Very few Southerners owned slaves. It wasn’t so much about that as it was Mind your own business.\n\nTrump is the exact opposite. No one can claim he’s encroaching on anyone’s freedom. Rather, he’s looking to decrease the power of the federal government and return local authority to the states when it comes to education and natural resources.\n\nMaybe in their warped minds, today’s Democrats are as angry as Civil War-era Democrats. If you think about it, back then, Democrats were furious over Lincoln taking away their slaves. Today, thanks to Trump’s mass deportations, Democrats (like Alec Baldwin) are losing something very similar: all that cheap labor they could exploit and bully.\n\nJust thinking out loud here.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

      "full_content": "Summary The Supreme Court unanimously backed FDA denials of flavored vaping products in a setback for the industry.\n\nAt issue were a series of FDA denials during the first year of the Biden administration for vaping products that officials said are geared toward minors.\n\nPublic health groups praised the ruling as a victory for protecting youth from nicotine addiction.\n\nThe case returns to an appeals court to reconsider a dispute about marketing plans.\n\nVaping companies can reapply for approval, potentially finding favor with President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday backed a series of decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration to deny market access for flavored vaping products in a rare win for government regulators that may limit access to those products across the nation.\n\nThough a partial win for the FDA, it remains uncertain whether President Donald Trump’s administration will shift gears and free up access to the products. During the campaign, Trump vowed to “save vaping.” The vaping companies are also entitled to reapply to the FDA for approval of their products. Meanwhile, the justices sent the case back to an appeals court for further review.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.\n\nAt issue were a series of FDA denials during the first year of the Biden administration for vaping products that officials said are geared toward minors with flavors like “Pink Lemonade,” “Rainbow Road” and “Jimmy the Juice Man Peachy Strawberry.” The vaping companies claimed that the FDA had changed the requirements for approval as it was assessing the applications to market the products.\n\nThe companies “express frustration about the lack of clear prior notice regarding the type of scientific evidence that was essential for approval of an application,” Alito wrote. “But we cannot agree with their argument that the FDA went back on any commitments made in the guidance it provided before ruling on respondents’ applications.”\n\nPublic health groups praised the Supreme Court’s ruling, calling the decision a significant win for American youth and asserting it should embolden the FDA to continue to police the products closely.\n\n“Today’s ruling is a major victory for the health of America’s kids and efforts to protect them from the flavored e-cigarettes that have fueled a youth nicotine addiction crisis,” said Yolonda Richardson, president and CEO of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “It affirms that the FDA’s marketing denials for flavored e-cigarettes have been legally and scientifically sound and should encourage FDA to stay the course.”\n\nThe vaping industry says its nicotine-delivering products help Americans transition off cigarettes and that the dessert-themed flavors are attractive to adults.\n\nEric Heyer, who represented the vaping industry at the high court, said he was “obviously disappointed” in the decision but that the companies “continue to believe in the great harm reduction potential of their products for cigarette smokers.”\n\n﻿Heyer said the companies would continue to fight the FDA in the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nPublic health advocates have been warning for years about a spike in vaping among young Americans. The FDA reports that 19% of high school students and 4.7% of middle school students vaped in 2020 – a far higher share than students who smoked.\n\nRecognizing the harm caused by youth smoking, Congress passed a law in 2009 giving the FDA new powers to regulate tobacco products. In 2016, the FDA decided that e-cigarettes qualified as tobacco products and it began reviewing authorization applications for millions of new vaping products.\n\nThe multi-billion-dollar industry says that the FDA changed its method for that review in the middle of the process, requiring companies to show, with randomized trials, that flavored products are more effective than tobacco-flavored products at helping smokers quit or cut back on cigarettes.\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the industry in January, finding that officials had perpetrated a “regulatory switcheroo,” sending manufactures on a “wild goose chase” to get approval. Seven other appeals courts rejected similar challenges of the agency’s denials.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, a member of the court’s liberal wing, wrote a short concurrence that seemed to take issue with a line from Alito’s opinion. The FDA was not “feeling its way toward a final stance” on how to review vaping products, she said. It was, instead, giving the companies some flexibility to prove their products would be beneficial.\n\nIn light of the law, she wrote, “and the well-documented and serious risks flavored e-cigarette products pose to youth, it should have come as no surprise that applicants would need to submit rigorous scientific evidence showing that the benefits of their products would outweigh those risks.”\n\nThe Supreme Court sent the case back to the 5th Circuit to reconsider a related dispute in the case that deals with marketing plans.\n\nAt first, the FDA asked for the companies to provide those plans to demonstrate how its advertising could reduce misuse of the products by minors. But the FDA then said it didn’t consider those plans because past efforts to address the problem of youth vaping through marketing were not effective.\n\nThe FDA’s handling of the marketing plans prompted a technical legal question about whether the appeals court should have sent the denials back to the agency for further review. Alito wrote that the 5th Circuit read Supreme Court precedents “too broadly” to conclude that the FDA’s decision to not consider the marketing plans necessarily amounted to a legal error.\n\nBut Alito also wrote that the FDA’s argument on the point wasn’t quite right and so it asked the appeals court to “decide the question afresh.” That technical point could bring the case back to the Supreme Court next year.\n\n﻿On the other hand, the vaping companies may have an easier way out of the loss: They can reapply for approval with an administration that may be friendlier to its position. During the oral arguments in December, Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed the parties on the practical effect of a decision either way.\n\n“I’m curious what relief looks like in this case, because the companies can always reapply, correct?” Kavanaugh asked.\n\nCurtis Gannon, an attorney with the Justice Department, agreed that they could.\n\n“They can reapply without a fee,” he said. “And some other applicants have reapplied.”\n\nBut an attorney for the vaping industry countered that the FDA sometimes takes years to resolve applications.\n\n“They can’t afford to wait that out,” Heyer said. “This was their one shot.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Wednesday.",

      "full_content": "Mayor Eric Adams speaking outside of Gracie Mansion on April 2, 2025. Photo: @NYCMayor/X\n\nA federal judge officially dismissed the pending corruption charges against Eric Adams in an unsurprising but big win for the long-embattled mayor, whose public-approval ratings have plummeted after being indicted by the government last year.\n\nAdams addressed the end of his legal battle in prepared remarks outside Gracie Mansion, thanking his attorney Alex Spiro and his supporters. “Let me be clear. As I’ve said all along, this case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,” he said.\n\nThe mayor said he wished to apologize to New Yorkers for having to deal with the “lies spread through false leaks” and “sensational headlines,” but that he never lost his focus on working for them.\n\nIn a notable moment, Adams ended his remarks by holding up a copy of the book “Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth and the Battle for our Democracy” written by now-FBI director and Trump loyalist Kash Patel, urging New Yorkers to read it. “Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,” he said.\n\nIn his ruling, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho acknowledged that both Adams and the Justice Department were aligned in their requests to dismiss the case, concluding that the court lacks the power to force the government to prosecute a case if it doesn’t wish to. “A court cannot force the Department of Justice to prosecute a defendant. That is by design. In our constitutional system of separation of powers, a court’s role in a criminal case is to preside over the matter — not to decide whether the defendant should be prosecuted,” he wrote.\n\nBut in a notable break with the federal government, Ho moved to dismiss the indictment “with prejudice,” which removes the Trump administration’s ability to revive the charges in the future if it so chooses. The judge stated bluntly that his action ensures that the charges “cannot be used as leverage” over the mayor or New York City, addressing a concern held by many that the White House could choose to hold the case over Adams in exchange for support for President Trump’s agenda.\n\n“Dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor’s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,” Ho wrote.\n\nThough the judge largely granted the Justice Department’s request, Ho dismantled its reasoning for the dismissal, writing that its argument that the case held the appearance of “impropriety” was “unsupported by any objective evidence.”\n\nHo also stated his belief that some of the arguments against dismissal had merit, writing that Adams’s ability to assist with federal immigration actions was not impaired as argued by the Justice Department. The judge noted that, in contrast, the mayor did take immigration enforcement actions in line with the Trump administration’s political views. “Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,” he wrote.\n\nHo’s ruling marks the end of an ongoing saga that took a new turn following Trump’s return to the White House. Under new leadership, the Justice Department moved to dismiss the case against Adams, directing Manhattan prosecutors to do so. But the order had a cascading effect, as Danielle Sassoon, the interim U.S. attorney, stepped down from her role, likening the dismissal to a “quid pro quo” between Adams and the new administration. Multiple prosecutors soon followed suit, similarly protesting the directive.\n\nLast September, federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused Adams of knowingly soliciting illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals in exchange for luxury travel perks. Adams has long professed his innocence in the matter and rebuffed calls for him to step down or drop his long-shot bid for reelection. Recent polls have shown Adams trailing behind former Governor Andrew Cuomo and many of his other Democratic challengers have embraced a ranked choice voting strategy, urging voters to leave both men unranked on their ballots.",

That was until this week, when a spectacular court ruling banned her from running in France’s 2027 presidential election — a vote she looked well placed to win.\n\nNow, the future looks difficult for Le Pen, 56, who was found guilty of running a “system” of embezzlement that siphoned $3.4 million of European Union funds to her National Rally party.\n\nThe implications are also unclear for her party and the wider European far-right movement, which has won friends in President Donald Trump’s White House.\n\nJust like Trump in the United States, Le Pen has attacked the French legal system, condemning the ruling as a rigged attempt to block her from power. Those comments are a marked departure from her years of efforts to become a respected, mainstream force in European politics.\n\nThe National Rally leader has vowed to appeal her five-year election ban and two-year suspended prison sentence, plus another two with an electronic ankle tag. She was among two dozen defendants from her party.\n\nBut this is “the kind of obstacle you don’t hop over just by a publicity campaign or ignoring it,” said Cécile Alduy, a French studies professor at Stanford University.\n\nSome opponents fear that like Trump, the sentence will beatify her as a martyr with her supporters. She has already urged the “millions of people” outraged to protest.\n\nThe establishment “brought out the nuclear bomb,” Le Pen told the French Parliament on Tuesday. “And if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it’s obviously because we’re about to win the elections.”\n\nTrump was quick to draw parallels with his own situation.\n\n“She was banned for running for five years and she’s the leading candidate — that sounds like this country,” he told journalists Tuesday in the Oval Office. “That’s a very big deal.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump adviser Elon Musk said it was an example of “the radical left” abusing “the legal system to jail their opponents” when its members can’t win elections. “This is their standard playbook throughout the world,” he wrote on X.\n\nTrump was convicted last year of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.\n\nNeither Trump nor Musk offered evidence of French impropriety, and far from “the radical left,” France is governed by President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist-led alliance.\n\nStill, facts may not dilute the potency of those populist critiques.\n\nFar-right leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Dutch anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders have this week voiced support for Le Pen's cause. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, called it “a violation of democratic norms.”\n\nThat Le Pen was leading the field is undeniable, after softening her party's hard-line image while retaining its staunchly anti-immigration ideology.\n\nAn Ifop poll taken four days before her sentencing projected she would get 36% of the vote in 2027. The two-term Macron is ineligible for a third but his ally, Édouard Philippe was second on 25%.\n\nLe Pen is far from the first high-profile French politician to face legal troubles, with former Presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy both being convicted of corruption.\n\nIf she fails in appealing her disbarment, she has a protégé and heir-apparent in Jordan Bardella, 29, the millennial darling of the far right with a bootstrap backstory of growing up with Italian-Algerian heritage in Paris' grittier suburbs.\n\nJordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen in Paris last year. Bertrand Guay / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nWith 2 million TikTok followers, he became the party’s president at 26 and its first not born a Le Pen. He is deeply loyal, and was poised to become Le Pen's prime minister if she won in 2027.\n\nBut his mentor's conviction “might lead to a change in plans,” according to Tara Varma, a visiting fellow at Washington’s Brookings Institution think tank.\n\nLe Pen acknowledged as much in an interview with French television Tuesday, saying Bardella might have to be deployed to run for the top job “sooner than necessary.”\n\nA survey by the pollster Harris Interactive the day of Le Pen's sentencing put her and Bardella's popularity on equal footing, but his rise is not a fait accompli, analysts say.\n\n“A lot of internal fights are likely to emerge,” said Alduy at Stanford. And Bardella’s “leadership will be put into question by Marine’s allies.”\n\nHis debating and media skills “pale in comparison” to Le Pen’s “steady bulldozer-like calm,” she added. “It’s unclear that at 29 years old he is cut for the role.”\n\nAnother potential successor is Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal, who dropped the family name in 2018. Some commentators said that was an attempt to distance herself from her late grandfather and Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, though she denied it.\n\nThe senior Le Pen founded the National Front, as National Rally was then known, but his daughter later kicked him out in her own attempt to distance the party from his record of racist remarks and Holocaust denial.\n\nMaréchal still “carries the Le Pen name” in spirit at least, said Varma, and would continue a lineage unbroken since the 1970s.\n\nUltimately, the only certain outcome from this week's events for French politics is more drama.\n\nAfter inconclusive snap elections last year, Macron has cobbled together a fragile coalition which could soon face fresh no-confidence votes from Le Pen, who is still a lawmaker, Alduy said.\n\nAnother governmental collapse — there were two last year — is not impossible. If that happens, Alduy added, “more chaos is certainly in store on all sides.”",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nThe judge overseeing the corruption case against Eric Adams has dismissed the charges against the New York City mayor, and in a split with the Trump Justice Department, ordered that the charges cannot be brought again.\n\nJudge Dale Ho said his hands were essentially tied – even though he has concerns about the Justice Department’s reasons to dismiss the case – he could not force them to prosecute a defendant.\n\nHo’s ruling criticized the Trump administration’s motives for dropping the case at a time when the White House is seeking to bolster its authority over the Justice Department and federal prosecutors.\n\nDOJ’s effort to drop the case and retaining the ability to restore charges resulted in the mass resignation of several Justice Department officials, including the acting US attorney in the Southern District of New York and the top career prosecutors overseeing public corruption cases.\n\nIn a strongly-worded opinion, Ho rejected the Justice Department’s core argument – that New York prosecutors were politically motivated in bringing the case and that the charges were impacting the mayor’s ability to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda.\n\n“Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,” he wrote in a 78-page opinion. He said DOJ’s position is “disturbing” because it implies public officials may receive special treatment if they go along with political priorities. “That suggestion is fundamentally incompatible with the basic promise of equal justice under the law.”\n\nA spokesman for the Justice Department said, “This case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources. We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe.”\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney for Adams, said the case “should have never been brought in the first place – and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed.”\n\n“In light of DOJ’s rationales, dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor’s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,” the judge wrote Wednesday.\n\nIn remarks to reporters at his New York City home, the mayor reiterated his claim that the case should never have been brought and that he did nothing wrong. He made no mention of Trump, although he did hold up a copy of “Government Gangsters”– a book written by FBI Director Kash Patel.\n\nAdams, who is up for reelection this fall, was indicted in September on charges related to bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals in exchange for political favors. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Honig on ‘incalculable damage on DOJ’ 01:40 - Source: CNN Honig on ‘incalculable damage on DOJ’ 01:40\n\nThe indictment alleged Adams’ illegal actions stretched back to 2014, when he was Brooklyn Borough president. Prosecutors said Adams received luxury travel benefits including hotel room upgrades, meals and other perks from a Turkish official. In exchange, prosecutors say Adams pressured a New York City Fire Department official to grant permits to open a Turkish consular building that had failed to pass inspection.\n\nIn February, Trump’s DOJ recommended the case be dropped following a meeting with the mayor’s lawyers in Washington. Then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said, “The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that escalated under the policies of the prior Administration.”\n\nBove’s letter spurred several DOJ prosecutors to resign rather than carry out his order. In her resignation letter, then-acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, wrote that during the meeting Adams’ attorneys “repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.”\n\nBoth Adams and Bove appeared in court and denied the existence of any quid pro quo.\n\nThe judge then asked Paul Clement, a well-known conservative attorney, to advise him on DOJ’s request. In his report, Clement said the complete dismissal of the case would resolve any taint over the issue.\n\n“A dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the accused,” Clement wrote. “Dismissal with prejudice avoids those concerns and promotes another important separation-of-powers virtue – namely, accountability.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Ho explained his reasons for dismissing the charges permanently and denying the Justice Department’s full request.\n\n“In light of DOJ’s rationales, dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor’s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,” the judge wrote.\n\n“It ensures that, going forward, the charges in the Indictment cannot be used as leverage over Mayor Adams or the City of New York,” the judge added.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton, one of several key leaders who met with New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul when she was deciding on using her power to remove the mayor, says that the perception that Adams is controlled by the White House should now be gone.\n\n“It takes away the felling that he was under the thumb of the president,” Sharpton told CNN. “It clearly says that now whatever he does, now he’ll be judged on his own decisions.”\n\nThe judge said his decision should not be read as an opinion on the allegations against the mayor. Ho added that it’s ultimately the public’s opinion, not his, that matters. With limited options, the judge said one that he has is to provide transparency.\n\n“Bringing these decisions into the open may, in turn, lead to attempts by the public to influence these decisions through democratic channels,” the judge wrote.\n\nCNN’s Mark Morales contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and comment.",

      "full_content": "Donald Trump is expected to announce new tariffs. Elon Musk’s millions weren’t enough for victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. And two women speak out about the Trump administration’s failed attempt deport them.\n\nHere’s what to know today.\n\nTrump to announce new tariffs on ‘Liberation Day’ in intensifying trade war\n\nIt’s April 2 — the day President Donald Trump has dubbed “Liberation Day,” during which he’s expected to roll out the largest set of new trade barriers in generations. The anticipated announcement is a culmination of months of the president’s big talk about tariffs and adds to the duties he has already imposed.\n\nThe details of this latest round of tariffs aren’t yet clear. Trump has already announced his intention to impose tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, and he has suggested other new tariffs would be both reciprocal with other nations and include duties on specific sectors like pharmaceuticals or computer chips. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged yesterday that Trump and his advisers were still “perfecting” the policies.\n\nSome countries are trying to get ahead of the new duties, with Vietnam and Israel indicating they would relax duties on U.S. goods, while leaders in Europe were still holding out hope for negotiations.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nIn the U.S., the impending tariffs are causing uncertainty in the economy. Stock markets have tanked. Consumer confidence is down. The Federal Reserve shifted its inflation forecasts higher. And businesses said they’re already seeing higher prices.\n\nTrump’s reasons for imposing trade duties are varied. When imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada, he cited a desire to curb the flow of fentanyl and undocumented into the country. Trump has also been fixated on reversing America’s trade deficit, and he has accused countries of “taking advantage of” the U.S. and “ripping us off.”\n\nEconomists have cast doubt on Trump’s policies, saying his views on trade are outdated at best. One expert, who suggested Trump’s policy ambitions are part of “some misplaced nostalgia,” said, “We should not wish for American workers to be sewing tennis shoes together — they can have better jobs than that.”\n\nRead the full story here, and follow our live blog for updates from Trump’s announcement and reactions to the new policies.\n\nMore tariffs coverage:\n\nHere’s how tariffs work , who pays for them in the short and long run and why they’re used in the first place.\n\n, who pays for them in the short and long run and why they’re used in the first place. Metal recycling businesses stand to benefit from Trump’s tariffs, but they fear retaliatory tariffs would blunt whatever advantages they may gain.\n\nTakeaways from the special elections in Wisconsin and Florida\n\nYesterday's special elections in Wisconsin and Florida saw both Democrats and Republicans claim victories that hinted at shifting mindsets since the 2024 election.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Susan Crawford won a seat on the state Supreme Court, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority in the battleground state’s highest court.\n\nWith Crawford’s win, Democrats have a new boogeyman in Elon Musk, who spent millions to bolster Crawford’s opponent, Brad Schimel. After the election, the Trump White House was quick to downplay Schimel’s loss, saying the off-year race was “predictive of nothing” and that Musk would continue to help in Republican campaigns. Whether Democrats can replicate their strategy in other elections in which Musk isn’t playing such a major role will become clearer in time.\n\nThe Wisconsin race also saw Republicans try to use their 2024 playbook, with ads that hit on transgender issues and crime, only for the strategy to not work.\n\nHowever, the GOP’s playbook was successful in Florida. Republicans Jimmy Patronis won in the state’s 1st District, and state Sen. Randy Fine won in the state’s 6th District to replace former Rep. Matt Gaetz and former Rep. Michael Waltz, respectively, and bolster Republicans’ narrow lead in the House. Patronis and Fine head to Congress at a key moment for Republicans as they try to pass a budget that solidifies Trump’s top policy ambitions.\n\nYesterday’s special election also offered hints about Democrats’ strengths and revealed record turnout.

They said they witnessed at least some delay and confusion within ICE in the days leading up to the flights and said that, once aboard their flight, they were told they were going to Venezuela but realized they were deceived when they arrived in El Salvador. Now back in the U.S., the women currently share a cell at a detention center in Laredo, Texas.\n\nMoyetones and Rodriguez’s account of being mistakenly taken to El Salvador, as well as men on the flights declaring their innocence, stands in contrast to the Trump administration’s claims of certainty about the fairness of the deportations.

      "full_content": "Cheesehead. Photo: Getty Images\n\nDemocrats easily won a competitive and much-heralded supreme-court contest in Wisconsin, where the liberal candidate they backed triumphed over a conservative supported by Elon Musk. It’s a humiliating result for the world’s richest man after he spent heavily and campaigned personally in the state for conservative Brad Schimel, who was tied to the DOGE leader’s large and controversial role in the Trump administration. Susan Crawford won by ten points and consolidated liberal control of a crucial battleground state court.\n\nThe Wisconsin race was the most expensive judicial contest in American history by a large margin, with nearly $100 million spent. Groups aligned with Musk represented over $20 million of that total. But money aside, Musk all but took over poor Schimel’s campaign, as the New York Times reported a couple of days before the vote:\n\nHe brought a billionaire friend, $1 million checks and a Packers cheesehead hat. A pastor prayed for him. A superfan begged him for a follow on X.\n\nElon Musk was the star of a 2,000-person rally on Sunday night in Wisconsin — ostensibly for the conservative candidate in a closely watched state judicial race — just 36 hours before polls open on Election Day. Of course he was.\n\nThe billionaire Mr. Musk looked very much like a candidate at this rally, putting himself front and center in the final stretch of an election pitting two rivals against each other, neither of them named Elon Musk.\n\nMusk not only personalized the Wisconsin race: He also boosted the stakes, saying at one point that “the entire destiny of humanity” rested on winning there. Without much question, his involvement helped energize Democrats, who saw a rare opportunity to take the arrogant tech bro down a notch or two. Musk’s profile was nearly as galvanizing as the abortion issue that helped the liberal candidate win in the last Wisconsin supreme-court election in 2023, which overturned a conservative majority on the court. Turnout was again high for this kind of election, with over 2 million votes cast (not far off the 2022 midterms, and about two-thirds of the vote cast in the red-hot 2024 presidential race).\n\nThe results could help produce progressive rulings in a variety of Wisconsin cases and perhaps even lead to a re-redistricting of congressional districts benefiting Democrats. Wisconsin Republicans consoled themselves with the overwhelming approval of a constitutional amendment embedding a voter-ID requirement.\n\nTuesday featured the first major election contests of 2025. Republicans fared better in Florida, where they held two vacant House seats, as expected, winning both by 14 points. The margins were reduced from recent elections in part thanks to the same sort of Democratic grassroots energy that powered Crawford’s victory and filled the coffers of candidates in the Sunshine State. The First District, previously represented by MAGA bad boy and momentary attorney-general nominee Matt Gaetz, has elected Randy Fine, though with less than half the margin Gaetz won in 2024. The Sixth District will be represented by Jimmy Patronis, who also fell over 30 points short of the margin won in 2024 by national security adviser and Signal power-user Michael Waltz. Turnout in both contests was healthy if not astounding: about two-thirds of the numbers posted in 2022, and about 40 percent of 2024 levels.\n\nWe’ll have to see if Musk’s face-plant in Wisconsin affects his standing in Washington, D.C. Trump doesn’t like losers and does enjoy shifting blame for adverse political trends. The liberal win could sharpen knives in Republican and White House circles already concerned about Musk’s sagging approval ratings and regularly outrageous utterances. At a minimum, it’s unlikely he’ll make any more appearances strutting around with a chainsaw or saluting with a stiff arm outward.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

      "full_content": "Illustration: Albert Tercero\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nHolly Davis didn’t believe in luck until she realized just how unlucky she was. Then she couldn’t quite shake it, this sense of having an anti-Midas touch, bad outcomes following her unprovoked. Often, it was the little things. Reservations she made disappeared. Rides she booked never came. Someone else would fill out an annoying but vital online form without a hitch; the site would crash as soon as she tried. Her neighbors’ plants glowed a lustrous green while hers — same soil, same rain — shriveled with disease.\n\nShe knew it sounded crazy, but it all started when she accepted her grandmother’s rings. She was 21, graduating college and getting engaged to her freshman-year sweetheart. They’d both double-majored in sociology and women’s studies. Now they were moving to Portland, Oregon, looking for jobs and housing. Second-hand engagement rings were considered bad luck, but she didn’t give it much thought. To her, that was nonsense — and it wasn’t like she had much money to buy rings of her own.\n\nAlmost immediately, there was acrimony when other relatives grew jealous that Davis had gotten these heirlooms. One lousy event would precipitate another. The job she found in Portland was at a halfway house for sex offenders. It sounds hyperbolic, but somehow, at the time, she always felt like she was the person on duty when a resident came home high on meth or wielding a knife, or when the bosses ordered a room search, which meant she was the one looking under mattresses and pulling back soiled sheets, rummaging for contraband cigarettes and porn. “I was always the member of staff that ended up with jizz on them,” she said. “And it was always on days when I would wear my nicest sweater, or a nice handmade scarf, and then it was like, ‘Great, I’ve got to go handwash this.’”\n\nHer romantic relationships followed the same rule. A grad-school acceptance in sociology at the University of Edinburgh pulled her out of the halfway house, and her fiancé followed her only for him to declare Scotland “the land that God forgot” and move back to his parents’ basement. Years later, she married a Scot — again, using her grandma’s rings — only for the British government to impose an income requirement for spousal visas that neither she nor her new warehouse-worker husband could meet. Their relationship fell apart. She’d get into the car, ask if he might turn down the screamo, “and his response would be to turn it all the way up to the point of, like, almost blowing the speakers out.”\n\nShe knew there were other explanations — more rational explanations. The halfway house was chronically underfunded and understaffed; the work was rough and dirty for everyone. The suite of failed relationships might’ve been a product of her own psychology, the trend of failed bookings a product of inattention. And yet. It felt like there was something else.\n\nShe started wondering whether the rings were hexed. She talked about it the way you might tell a ghost story — as an outlandish dinner-party anecdote you can’t help laughing about but also, in some secret, inadmissible part of your soul, can’t fully discount. Her grandmother had been volatile: a Hungarian Canadian bombshell with black hair, red lipstick, and a personality disorder that went undiagnosed until her 80s. She had a tempestuous second marriage to a soft-spoken man who painted portrait after portrait of the same female figure — decidedly not his wife — whom he described only as “the woman of my dreams.” Ask him about his life in Hungary, and his answers had a quicksilver quality, hard to pin down. Then, once he died, stories started coming out. There was a cupboard, which he’d usually kept locked, full of Nazi memorabilia: swastikas, military maps, gold teeth. There were secret bank accounts for sending money back to relatives in the Old Country, which he’d stashed in secret compartments he had made by cutting holes into the pages of books. There were divorce filings that he’d never finished filling out. True or mythologized, it was hard to say for sure. Still. Marital lies, possible collaboration with the Third Reich — the rings could be carrying an “intergenerational family karma curse.” It made a certain kind of sense.\n\nIt also made no sense at all. Davis was a sociologist, level-headed in her views. Her work was filled with references to redlining and deindustrialization, mandatory sentencing and welfare reform. She’d left behind her parents’ Catholicism. She was a millennial, born in 1984, conversant in the structural and the systemic, the sweeping explanations undergirding the patterns she could see in the world. She knew she’d benefited from stability, a middle-class childhood, a good education that gave her options for what she could do with her life. She didn’t believe in the supernatural.\n\nWas this just adulthood, she wondered, to be waging an endless war against the everyday, your clothes stained and your efforts foiled? Was this normal? The man who would eventually become her second husband didn’t think so, and he knew a thing or two about luck. He’d written a master’s thesis about it, and a 122-page doctoral dissertation, and had co-edited a volume called The Philosophy of Luck. His name was Lee John Whittington, she’d met him on Tinder, and he didn’t believe in the salt-throwing, new-engagement-ring-buying sort of luck, either. At least in most cases he didn’t. Though he too laughed about it, hedged about it, he came to see his wife as the exception, a living counterargument to his philosophizing. He sometimes joked she was the unluckiest person he’d ever met.\n\nIn 2020, a professor at the University of Iowa named Michael Sauder noticed that one subject was tacitly off-limits in sociology. No matter how hard you looked, the literature was curiously silent about luck. There was an exception, he found, that seemed to prove the rule. Some 50 years earlier, a team of Harvard sociologists had published a lightning rod of an academic tome called Inequality. Access to good schools was important, its authors argued, but education alone couldn’t close the country’s divides; to do that, your best bet was to redistribute income.\n\nInequality was, to put it mildly, controversial. But one of the most contentious bits — rivaling even the socialist policy proposal — was the suggestion that some differences were attributable to sheer luck: “chance acquaintances who steer you to one line of work rather than another, the range of jobs that happen to be available in a particular community when you are job hunting” — the myriad little twists that have a big effect on a life. Other sociologists were not so sure. Luck was invoked in only a handful of the book’s 400 or so pages but was mentioned 15 times in the American Journal of Sociology’s review. Such assertions were “merely speculations about the unexplained variance, not findings.” It generated such blowback that the lead author later said he regretted using the word at all.\n\nThe idea was still pissing people off decades later. When the Cornell economist and columnist Robert H. Frank appeared on a Fox Business talk show in 2009 to talk about the importance of luck in economic success, the British-born host wasted no time before telling him off: “Do you know how insulting that was when I read that? I came to America with nothing 35 years ago. I’ve made something of myself, I think through hard work, talent, and risk-taking, and you’re going to write that this is luck.”\n\nThere’s something about luck that inspires skepticism or rejoinder. Partially, it’s a question of terms. It’s hard to agree what exactly we’re talking about. The word is slippery, a kind of linguistic Jell-O. The critiques come from left and right, from those who see luck as a mask for privilege and those who see it as an offense to self-made men. Voltaire, with the confidence of the encyclopedist, once declared that one can locate a cause for everything and thus the word made no sense. Others dismiss it as mere statistics, still others as simply a term the godless use for God. It can call to mind an austere medieval manuscript, two-faced Fortuna, one side beaming, the other weeping, ordinary humans clinging to her fickle wheel.\n\nBut we can’t quite quit it, either. It’s something you might say you don’t believe in but continuously invoke. We’re up all night to get it, are warned not to push it, are sometimes down on it. It haunts our pop songs and expressions, but it isn’t just some rhetorical holdover, like the bony stub of an ancestral tail. This organ is still in active use. Months before he narrowly survived an assassination attempt, a Washington Post op-ed called Donald Trump “the luckiest politician who ever lived”; just two days before he arrived in Butler, Pennsylvania, a columnist at the National Review wondered whether he had a “desk drawer full of four-leaf clovers in his office at Mar-a-Lago.”\n\nIn the tech world, managers ask about it in job interviews. “Are you a lucky person?” was reportedly one of Jeff Bezos’s favorite questions in the early days of Amazon. Now it’s common enough that some college career centers warn students to have an answer prepared. One year at Goldman Sachs, a superior in charge of hiring entry-level analysts divided the résumés he’d gotten into two piles at random, the way you might cut a deck of cards. Then he threw one pile out, saying, “You have to be lucky in this business. We might as well pick from the lucky ones.” According to a Goldman Sachs spokesperson, this story is almost certainly apocryphal — but it keeps getting told, a parable for how luck figures in supposedly meritocratic outcomes.\n\nFor Frank, the Cornell economist, it was the difference between life and death. After an episode of sudden cardiac arrest on the tennis court, his survival depended on the fluke of an ambulance being nearby, having been dispatched to a car accident that involved no serious injuries, allowing those EMTs to scoot a few hundred yards to get to him. In true economist fashion, he saw in his brush with death a force that plays a vital role in markets. A globalized world makes competition fiercer, such that even meaningless variation — which product happens to get a good online review first, say — can have enormous impacts.\n\nOver the last 20 years, sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers have been looking at it, too. In a way, they’re responding to a need. We live in an era of boundless data, an empiricist’s fantasy. Apps count our steps and track our breaths. Websites watch our scrolls and clicks. Scientists trace the viruses and chemicals that get flushed with our urine and feces. We recognize the structural forces at play in our lives, the long tail of history and policy swishing around in the everyday. Our world should be at its most analyzable, explicable — but still it can feel like sorcery. That a hurricane’s path was plotted by satellite and dropsonde, radar and big-data modeling doesn’t dull the eeriness of one house destroyed and its neighbor still standing.\n\n“As social scientists, we have our own demons circling the edges of our enlightenment campfire, reminding us that there are aspects of social processes that we will never be able to account for,” wrote Sauder in a paper called “The Sociology of Luck.” He was urging his colleagues to peer into the darkness, to reopen the forbidden chamber Inequality had cracked way back in 1972. All sorts of forces help explain the world — race and class, gender and geography, redlining and Reaganomics — but they were never entirely sufficient. There were always ripples of randomness within those vast tidal currents, as Washington University in St. Louis sociologist Mark Rank put it after joining the party with his own luck book in 2024, The Random Factor. Luck might draw attention to the limits of a field’s methods, but that wasn’t a good reason to ignore it. To Sauder, luck was real — not an “explanatory junk drawer” for anything that a sociologist’s model couldn’t explain but something specific and consequential that needed to be studied.\n\nThe one dimension of personal luck that transcends all others is to have been born in a highly developed country,” Frank writes, and by that account Whittington was extremely lucky. He was born middle-class in England to parents who worked in pharmaceuticals, the kind of parents who could coach him toward good grades after he skipped every biology class one year to smoke up in a friend’s basement listening to Cradle of Filth. To him and others in philosophy, though, that wasn’t luck per se. Those details were so instrumental in determining the course of his life that changing them would require a cascade of other changes. If he’d been born in a different country, or to a different set of parents, or into a different class, would he even be himself?\n\nLike many luck scholars, Whittington had stumbled on it by chance. In 2009, he was a master’s student in philosophy at the University of Hertfordshire, outside London, staring down a meeting about the subject for his thesis when he happened upon a BBC article about the Monopoly World Championships. That sounds like complete bullshit, he thought. Sure, there might be strategies to boost your chances of winning, but the gameplay depends largely on rolling the dice. The whole point was trying to make your way in a fiction where luck wasn’t just afoot but made visible.\n\nWhittington is a meanderer by nature, prone to following tangents and seeing where they lead. He logged on to PhilPapers, his field’s answer to Google, where he quickly found a 2008 paper called “What Luck Is Not.” It was a riposte to other thinkers who, in the early aughts, had tried to come up with a coherent definition of what we mean when we talk about luck. This paper explained the two predominant accounts in order to tear them both apart.\n\nThe first account saw luck in events that were both significant to us and beyond our control. Imagine two drunk drivers, one who kills a pedestrian and another who is swerving just as wildly but on an empty road. The first might go to jail for manslaughter. The other might receive no more punishment than waking up the next morning with a hangover. To thinkers like Thomas Nagel, this discrepancy — “moral luck” — signals a paradox. Our intuition tells us we can’t be blamed for what isn’t our fault, yet our circumstances are impossible to untangle from our actions and their fallout. Some contemporary philosophers took up that idea of luck, elucidating a concept their predecessors had used but not fully defined.\n\nMore evocative to Whittington was the second account of luck, this one about fragility, how easily things could have turned out differently. Take the example of a piano falling on your head. All of the pieces that had to align for that to happen form an intricate Rube Goldberg machine of ifs. If the stairwell hadn’t been a quarter inch too narrow to fit this baby grand. If the movers hadn’t decided to hoist it by pulley. If the ropes hadn’t been frayed just enough to fail but not so much that they were obviously unusable. If you hadn’t passed below at just the wrong time. The world in which you emerge unscathed is razor close. (The thought experiment sounds absurd. Yet think of the cellist from the Electric Light Orchestra killed in 2010 by a 1,300-pound hay bale that rolled out of nowhere and crushed him in his car.)\n\nOne might analyze such an event through the lens of probabilities. But Whittington hated the image of our brains as machinelike calculators for uncertainty. What drew him to the “fragile worlds” account was a belief that our minds run less on math, more on stories. “When I think about luck, it fundamentally becomes an imaginative activity,” he said — the act of visualizing worlds that might’ve been and still might be.\n\nA defense of the “possible worlds” account of luck became his Ph.D. dissertation at Edinburgh — but toward the end of his degree, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and during his postdoc, he died. There had been times when his dad had been difficult. Once, instead of telling Whittington off for leaving dishes unwashed, he’d slipped them still sticky into his son’s bed. But they had been close. They’d gone to see Rammstein and Tool together. They had spent hours and hours talking about luck — at the dinner table, at the pub, at the whiteboard in his parents’ house — his dad asking question after question, listening, defending a more probabilistic approach, listening again.\n\nNow, his dad was gone, and in that moment, none of the work seemed to matter. He had no stomach for academia’s petty politics and abstractions. He stuck out the postdoc and then he left, went traveling. When he got back to Edinburgh, he wasn’t sure whether to stay, so he played a little game. If he could find a flat and a job in the next five days, this would be home for a bit. If not, he’d move on.\n\nHe found a rundown apartment and a receptionist job in a youth hostel. He matched on Tinder with a sociology postdoc named Holly Davis. She loved breeding chickens for egg color, crossing French Marans with Andalusians for deep green, Easter-eggers with leghorns for mint or pale blue. She was taking both burlesque and mixed-martial-arts classes. She liked bringing her students to a strip club so they could learn how to do ethnographic research.\n\nWhittington and Davis became friends. She was wary after dating another guy off Tinder who’d turned out to be a creep. Whittington started staying over, but chastely. Finally, after a few months, while he was visiting his mother for Christmas, she asked him over the phone if he wanted to “move beyond platonic.” He did. Then her car broke down on New Year’s Eve, and they spent their first official date as a couple waiting for the tow truck.\n\nWhenever Whittington told anyone at Hertfordshire what he was researching, they always said the same thing: Talk to Richard Wiseman. Wiseman was a big name on campus, a psychologist who had, in the 1990s and early aughts, recruited a bunch of categorically lucky or unlucky people as research volunteers. The pseudonymous Patricia, for instance, was 27 and a star-crossed flight attendant. One plane she was on had to make an impromptu landing because passengers were belligerently drunk. Another was struck by lightning. A third was grounded for a different emergency. She had survived so far, but all her attempts at dating were doomed, and she avoided friends who were about to take exams or do job interviews lest they be infected by her miasma of failure. Wiseman’s lucky volunteers, in contrast, had successful careers, satisfying marriages, a lifetime of doorways fortuitously opened in front of them.\n\nWas there any truth in these self-perceptions? To find out, Wiseman subjected them to a series of experiments. In one, he asked people to page through a newspaper and report how many pictures it contained. It was a trick. On the second page, he’d written, “Stop counting — there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.” On another: “Stop counting, tell the experimenter you’ve seen this and win $250.” The unlucky among his volunteers were less likely to notice those messages than their lucky counterparts: They were too anxious to see opportunity and good fortune staring them in the face.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Wiseman started his career as a magician. In his view, luck was little more than illusion, a kind of psychological sleight of hand. Wiseman’s The Luck Factor, from 2003, would become perhaps the most famous entry in a subgenre of self-help. There’s How Luck Happens, from 2018; The Science of Being Lucky, from 2019; and Conscious Luck, from 2020, to name a few. By looking for and seizing opportunity, the argument often goes, luck is something you can make yourself. This has a Hallmarkian neatness, at once attractive and frustrating. As Whittington saw it, it was fine as pop psychology, potentially even helpful, but it carried a Pollyanna-ish, moralizing overtone, as if every sling and arrow were of your own making. Sometimes shit just happened that wasn’t your fault.\n\nDavis was a case in point. Four or five months into their relationship, they were in her cottage in Fife doing some administrative task online. Whittington did it for himself with no issue, but when Davis tried, there was roadblock after roadblock, glitch after glitch. The form would reset itself. Eventually, the whole site would crash. “What the actual hell?” Whittington couldn’t help but say. “You are the unluckiest human being I have ever met.” In his philosophical work, luck was a quality of events, not of people; it denoted the fragility of outcomes, not something that clings to you. And yet. Davis’s car had just been totaled by a van driver, not her doing. The latest brood of eggs she’d incubated had yielded 12 males and one female — the chicken version of a truly lousy hand. She’d have to rehome most of them; with a small yard, she couldn’t keep that many roosters without them squabbling among themselves and harassing the hens.\n\nWas he serious? He knew luck; if that’s what it looked like to him, she thought, then maybe that’s what was wrong with her. She hadn’t used “the L-word” for it, but she knew she was misadventure prone, subject to Murphy’s Law more than most. She’d even gone so far as to get rid of her grandmother’s rings after her first marriage dissolved, leaving them with her mom in Wisconsin. But when her mother started talking about getting them resized, something in Davis protested. Maybe the rings had cooled down, she thought. Or perhaps she wanted them in the way we often want what feels a little dangerous. She took them back.\n\nThe couple kept feeling the rings’ force, at once malevolent and a little absurd. In Davis’s sociology studies, she’d had luck finding sex workers to interview for her master’s thesis, and pimps for her dissertation, but try as she might, the johns at the center of her postdoc research just would not talk. She’d managed to piss off some people in her department. She was cynical about finding a job at the end of the master’s-Ph.D.-postdoc tunnel. She left academia, too.\n\nSo began a footloose few years of bouncing around Europe, of trying on various lives, every juncture a dice roll. In Hungary, they would have to abandon their plans to open a hostel. In Spain, Davis would be diagnosed with a rare spine-fusing condition called ankylosing spondylitis that could make it excruciating to move. In England, she and Whittington would have to leave a hotel because they dared ask a second time for a refill of the coffee pods in their room.\n\nWhat are the chances? That a lapsed luck philosopher meets an unluckiness magnet on Tinder and falls for her? That she falls for him? That she gets diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis? That they lose their accommodations over a coffee-pod dispute? It was the question Whittington the philosopher was initially pushing against. The ankylosing spondylitis could feel like luck in terms of both probability and possibility. Between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of Americans are thought to have it: a short stick Davis easily could not have drawn. Clear data is a bit harder to come by on ejection from hotels on coffee-related grounds. How much does that depend on the guest’s demeanor, the manager’s mood?\n\nThe trouble is that even when we know the chances of chance events, we’re lousy at understanding them. Flip a coin a bunch of times. As soon as you start seeing heads over and over again, you start imagining that tails must be next — and when it isn’t, your spine tingle gets a little more pronounced, as if you’re witnessing a tiny miracle rather than a very predictable sort of unpredictability. This is the gambler’s fallacy: mistakenly thinking that one coin toss has any power or influence over the next. You can feel that instinct at play when looking at this string of 60 digits, courtesy of the mathematician Joseph Mazur:\n\n458391843333834534555555555555185803245032174022234935499238\n\nThe first thing that hits our eyes is that long string of fives. That seems significant, too many repeats to be without meaning. But the digits are randomly generated. We do the same thing in images, finding faces in clouds and Rorschach blots. We create narrative links between unrelated events.\n\nBut not always. There are surprising patterns that are in fact patterns. In the 1980s, when Larry Bird was on fire, swishing basket after basket, some eminent psychologists debunked such lucky streaks. Analyzing Philadelphia 76ers games, Boston Celtics free throws, and some shooting experiments set up with Cornell’s varsity team seemed to show that the outcome of one shot was independent of the last. The Larry Bird effect, the professors declared, was an illusion — a cognitive mistake. Athletes and fans didn’t believe it for a second. They knew the hot hand was real. They’d seen it with their own eyes or felt it with their own fingertips.\n\nThen, in 2018, they were vindicated. Two economists reanalyzed the basketball stats, and realized that the initial study had itself contained a miscalculation. In the original study, the psychologists had expected that if a player’s track record of making a basket after another basket looked the same as his scoring overall, it would be evidence that the hot-hand effect is mere illusion. They didn’t seem to realize that if the streaks were random, then the first value (chances of making a basket after other baskets) would have been lower than the second value (the chance of making a basket after any sort of shot), which meant the similarities they’d seen in those two data points was in fact evidence that the hot-hand effect was real. Thus, the “hot-hand fallacy” became known as “the hot-hand fallacy fallacy,” a debunking debunked.\n\nBut even if the hot-hand effect is real, does it truly count as luck? Or is it simply a mix of skill and psychology, the confidence that comes with being on a roll, the way our narratives can shift our behavior and change our world? The framing definitely had an effect, too. In 1989 two puckish statisticians presented the results of a decade of collecting coincidences. Their notebooks bulged with unexpected intersections. A woman had won the lottery twice in a span of 180 days. Two spouses and their child all had birthdays on the 11th day of different months. The statisticians wrote down every eerie or surprising story they could find. But many of these convergences weren’t nearly as strange as they seemed. “The law of truly large numbers,” the professors called it. If there’s a one-in-a-million chance of winning a lottery and a million people enter, the fact that someone rakes it in isn’t surprising. What is surprising is when that person is you.\n\n\n\nIn other words, if luck lurks in calculations of chance, it all depends on whose perspective you’re inhabiting. Probabilities can say much, but they’re percentages, dispassionate as the weather. What most luck theorists can agree on is that it is predicated on us caring — not just in a general sort of way, but about the fate of something or someone. It could be a city or a sports team, a language or a bacterium, an earwig or a human being. Luck demands a protagonist.\n\nWhittington and Davis knew that Operation Hungary was a crapshoot. The quest had a storybook quality: The housing market in Edinburgh was rough, but they found a fixer-upper in Hungary, where Davis’s forebears were from. It was several hours outside of Budapest in the middle of a magical forest, its hollows snuffling with badgers. They envisioned a farm-hostel. It was off the beaten path — but they’d tried the beaten path. “We didn’t have enough money or job security at the time to play it safe, so we had to take a long-shot gamble,” Whittington said.\n\nIt was a disaster from the start, as if the whole project were overshadowed by the curse of her volatile grandmother’s rings. Davis had gotten a small inheritance from her, which she’d put toward a van for the trip, but almost immediately the vehicle began to have undiagnosable problems, emitting a weird grinding sound if she turned left, shaking violently if she tried to go over 40 miles per hour. She took it to mechanics, but they couldn’t figure it out. The day they were meant to leave for Hungary, the thing wouldn’t start; had they been parked on the street, the automobile association’s jumpstart would’ve been free, but because it was in a driveway, the guy had no choice but to charge them 150 pounds.\n\nThe construction crew they hired trashed their house rather than fixing it. They found themselves sleeping on the floor in a strange demolition zone, toilet leaking, walls full of incomprehensible drill holes — a cross between a lean-to and a loofah. The pandemic arrived. Davis discovered she was pregnant. They needed to leave the country before borders began to close. They tried to sell the bewitched van as scrap but the local official who’d usually take a bribe to help with the paperwork had just gone to jail.\n\nThe philosopher Ronald Dworkin makes a distinction between two kinds of luck. “Option luck” encompasses the gambles we choose to take — throwing a whole week’s pay into the pot for a craps game, say — while “brute luck” finds us of its own accord, without us sitting down at the betting table. By that standard, you might see the Hungary debacle as predictable, a choice they made knowing it might not work out. Sometimes, Whittington wasn’t even sure the trashed house involved luck at all. For contractors to charge more than their estimate is almost a universal law; for them to make a mess that you then might pay them to clean up is hardly unheard of. When he imagined the possible worlds close to our own, the likelihood of something going wrong with their rural Hungarian fixer-upper seemed pretty robust.\n\nThere were lucky moments, too, crazy things that worked against all odds. They drove across Europe, dodging the quicksand of COVID travel restrictions. They smuggled a favorite chicken into England in a lunchbox, hoping it wouldn’t cluck. And yet that didn’t always counterbalance the unease Davis felt, a nagging sense that things could have played out differently. Here they were, two millennial Ph.D.’s in a pandemic, unemployed, their Hungarian farm-hostel dream foiled, living temporarily in Whittington’s mum’s house. A baby girl was born. They got married. They taught English in Spain. They decided to move to China, where the pay for such jobs was better. The company that was supposed to take them the three hours to the airport could only send a car that was too small for them and their luggage. The Chinese government wouldn’t issue their daughter a visa because the middle name on her birth certificate had been left off her British passport. The odd thing about luck is that it can encompass both the trivial and the existential — and an unbroken chain of the former can, in the moment, start to feel like the latter.\n\nThe moving around was exhausting. Sometimes they fought. If she was prone to mishaps, he could be frustratingly bad about making plans. In retrospect, he wishes he’d been more proactive at times, more helpful. Still they stuck together when a weaker marriage might’ve come apart. At times, though, the absurdity became too much. Davis remembered a moment when Whittington became almost angry about her luck. “He — seriously — was like, ‘I didn’t think I’d ever say this in my life, Holly, but I think you need a witch doctor or some sort of alternative religious practitioner. To uncurse you or something,’” she recalled. “He was like, ‘I don’t understand how this keeps happening, but this has got to stop.’”\n\nShe was taken aback. Her atheist husband, who’d written a dissertation about luck in the nerdiest, most jargon-filled, secular sort of way — luck presented almost as symbolic logic — was telling her she needed to get some kind of occult help? “He was like, ‘Yeah, I’ve gotta rewrite the whole thing now.’”\n\nIn order to test their definitions, philosophers often dream up thought experiments, purified world-in-a-jar stories, unmarred by the possible complexities of real life. In “What Luck Is Not,” the 2008 paper that sent Whittington down this rabbit hole, Jennifer Lackey of Northwestern University asks us to consider Ramona, a demolition worker. Ramona is about to blow up an old warehouse but doesn’t know that a mouse has chewed through the wires connecting button to fuse. Right at the last second, though, a co-worker happens to hang his jacket in that precise spot, the metal hanger conducting the electricity that otherwise would’ve been cut off. Kaboom.\n\nLackey uses this story to argue that a lack of control isn’t necessary for an event to be lucky; Ramona’s, after all, was still the finger on the detonator. But for the lay reader, more telling than the question of Ramona’s agency is Lackey’s description of her own microfiction. It is “clearly riddled with luck.” One test of what luck actually means, she implies — which she keeps using to kick the tires of other scholars’ definitions — is our gut. Like the famous Supreme Court justice’s definition of porn, we recognize it when we see it.\n\nBut look closely at Lackey’s thought experiment and you might wonder whether the presence of luck depends on how she’s told this story. After all, what makes Ramona lucky in our eyes but not her own is how much we know: about the mouse, about the co-worker, about the hanger. Cut a detail, add a detail, and watch the luck start flickering in and out. Luck lies deep in our narrative-loving, pattern-seeking brains, in our ability to shift the variables around, to pull a Rashomon and tell the story a different way. It’s precisely this narrative alchemy that helped convince Steven Hales, a philosophy professor at the Commonwealth University of Pennsylvania, that luck is a myth. “The Guinness World Record holder for being struck by lightning? It turns out it’s a park ranger, and the guy’s been hit by lightning seven times,” he said. “So is he a super-unlucky man or is he very lucky to have survived seven lightning strikes?”\n\nBut our hunch that there was some kind of luck at play — good, bad, or both — is hard to shake. Luck emerges from a sense of contingency, an awareness of the myriad possible worlds that lurk close to our own. We invoke it when we hear our inner chorus of what-ifs, glimpse the infinite maze of paths all forking and crisscrossing. After Sauder published an article called “A Sociology of Luck” in 2020, exhorting his fellow social scientists to stop ignoring the concept, scholars responded, their studies full of such close calls. One looked at the role of chance encounters in working-class Britons’ careers. Another looked at how people saw luck in surviving a car accident or breast cancer. There’s a certain randomness to where we end up, which scholars like Sauder and Frank hope can function as an empathy machine. If someone else’s life can take a turn toward destitution through no fault of their own, yours could too.\n\nThat precarity is real, though you might quibble over whether to call it luck — and might not be consistent in your quibbling. Even children, when asked about why a certain stuffed animal works as a lucky charm, sometimes give a rational, adult-sounding answer: It gives them confidence, they’ve told Jacqueline Woolley, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies children’s views about luck. There’s a kind of half-belief there, a version of Pascal’s wager. They aren’t fully committed to the supernatural, but they haven’t totally given up on it either. They’re acknowledging a mixture of powerlessness and control.\n\nEven those who’ve spent years trying to pin luck down can do that same cognitive dance, moving between the magical and the logical. Whittington didn’t believe in the curse, and yet it kept popping into his possible-worlds-filled mind. Becoming a father in 2021 added another twist. He and Davis named their daughter Lilith. She’s 4 now and a minor terror in the way that toddlers often are, screaming for spaghetti, throwing rice in little sticky fistfuls, pulling the cat’s tail even after her parents tell her not to and maybe precisely because her parents tell her not to. She’s also one of the best things that’s ever happened to him. “I cannot imagine a world without Lilith,” he said.\n\nHe knows he sounds like a teenage boy high on Nietzsche. But wasn’t his daughter potentially the product of events he’d previously seen as unlucky?\n\nIf his dad hadn’t died, he wouldn’t have left philosophy. If he hadn’t left philosophy, he might not have been making that internal pact about whether or not he’d stay in Edinburgh. If he hadn’t made that internal pact, he wouldn’t have matched with Davis. If he hadn’t been there to match with Davis, that sperm wouldn’t have met that egg. And on and on and on. Would Lilith be the perfect, idiosyncratic Lilith that she is if she hadn’t been conceived in a deconstructed house in rural Hungary? Would Lilith be Lilith if she hadn’t first gone to day care in Spain and then in China?\n\nHe knows that someone might see danger in this kind of thinking; it could lead to an unseemly valorization of suffering. “I’m not going to say I should be grateful my father died when he did, because that was obviously horrible,” he said.\n\nBut he couldn’t really keep thinking of himself and Davis as unlucky, either. You might say he’d inadvertently taken the psychologist Richard Wiseman’s advice, transmuting bad luck into good. Davis, too, felt the shift. She had left all responsibility of online forms and travel plans to Whittington. She had locked her grandma’s rings away in a box. She didn’t look at it, didn’t touch it. Maybe that broke the curse. Or maybe that just liberated her from the past, from seeing the volatility of her grandmother on her own finger and in her own life.\n\nSettling in one place helped. So did her latest blast of therapy. She’d had a breakdown after weaning Lilith and had gotten in touch with someone she’d known back in Scotland — through “feminist neo-pagan gathering things” — and those online sessions helped. “We had had such a tumultuous and difficult couple years there we got kind of trapped in a lot of the stories we were telling ourselves,” she said. The universe no longer seemed quite so malevolent. It started to seem like things were just happening rather than happening to them.\n\nThings began going unexpectedly right. When she went in for IVF, in the hope of having a second child, doctors kept saying the odds were stacked against her. She was 40, of “advanced maternal age.” She had a history of uterine fibroids. She had an autoimmune disease. Her ovarian reserves were low. Her body didn’t respond to the hormones that were supposed to stimulate a kind of superovulation. Other patients in the clinic came out of their retrievals muttering worriedly about “only” getting eight eggs. Davis only got one.\n\nYet, against all odds, it worked. “We finally got some luck,” she said. That didn’t mean they didn’t half-belive in the curse. They still planned to go see the Zodiac specialist a friend of theirs recommended to help choose the most auspicious date for the C-section.\n\nEven if Whittington wanted to know what in their lives was luck, that was something all his research on the subject couldn’t necessarily tell him. Luck, in his work, is often “epistemically closed off” — philosophy-speak for a black box. You can theorize about how razor close our world is to one with a radically different outcome, you can dream up examples to test your definitions, but when it comes to real life, those forking paths lie mostly beyond our perception. You can’t be sure whether you’ve been lucky or not, because, he said, in many cases, “We often don’t know how the universe would or could have been arranged.” We wonder how our lives might’ve been different, we arm ourselves with amulets and psychological tricks, we get rid of our grandmother’s cursed rings, but we can never be sure. We can’t access the bullets that whiz by us unseen.",

      "full_content": "“Tariff reciprocity” sounds good, right? Not to anyone who has studied U.S. trade policy. As the seminal authority on trade, the former Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, recently put it to Tucker Carlson: “If we just do zero for zero, we’re going to get wiped out. We’re going to end up with nothing, because we don’t have the structure to compete on that basis.”\n\nLighthizer is correct. For over a century, U.S. tariff acts have empowered presidents to adjust tariffs to “non-tariff barriers” that effectively discriminate against U.S. exports. None of it works. Setting tariffs in reaction to policies in other countries doesn’t work, as demonstrated through generations of U.S. trade policy. The historical lessons from reciprocity efforts show much more pernicious effects on the domestic zeitgeist, and that reciprocity is incompatible with a pro-tariff policy of protection and revenue.\n\nReciprocity is immoral, anticompetitive, and leads to the foreign entanglements President George Washington cautioned against. Its ill effects were best summed up in 1903 by a statement of principles adopted by the American Protective Tariff League:\n\nReciprocity in competitive products by treaty is unsound in principle, pernicious in practice, and is contrary alike to the principle of protection, to the fair treatment of domestic producers, and to the friendly relations with foreign countries. Reciprocity is neither ethical nor economic, since it seeks to benefit some industries by the sacrifice of others, which is the essence of injustice. As at present advocated, reciprocity is a policy of favoritism. It would tend to array industry against industry and section against section at home, and forment industrial retaliation and political antagonism abroad. Such a policy would open the door to the grossest favoritism in legislation, promote the growth of a corrupting lobby, and increase the power of debasing bossism. Such a policy has no justification in economics, statesmanship, ethics, or good politics. True American policy is protection of all the opportunities and possibilities of the American market for American enterprise, and fair, equal treatment for all other countries, namely the equal right to compete for American business in the American market by the payment of American wages. This alone is honest protection, good Republicanism, and the true American Policy.\n\nUnfortunately, the League’s cautionary warnings failed to carry the day. But history has since proved them right.\n\nWhat are tariffs for? The first Congress of the United States provided their answer in the first sentence of the first Tariff Act, passed July 4, 1789:\n\nWhereas it is necessary for the support of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States, and the encouragement and protection of manufacturers, that duties be laid on goods, wares, and merchandise imported.\n\nTrump and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick know this history. Both men spoke during the campaign—at length, and in front of hostile audiences—about the importance of tariffs for revenue and protection.\n\nRevenue and protection are not incompatible goals for tariff policy. Since the dawn of civilization, tariff schedules—lists of tariff rates for every imaginable product—have been posted at every civilization’s ports.\n\nSome products’ tariff rates will have a revenue effect, some will have a protective effect, and some rates produce a bit of both for a given product. You can even enjoy both revenue and protective tariff rates on a single product through the use of what are called tariff rate quotas (TRQs). With a TRQ, you have an “in-quota” rate that can be a revenue tariff, and then an “over-quota” rate that is protective.\n\nTariffs were the preferred form of state revenue through most of history, including in the United States. In 1815, Congress asked Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas to propose a budget for the United States, with instructions that two-thirds of the needed $24 million in federal revenue come from tariffs. Dallas returned a detailed memorandum guiding on how to use tariffs for revenue and protection, which informed the “Dallas Tariff” (Tariff Act of 1816) and created a lasting template for U.S. tariffs for generations. Nowhere were preferential tariff rates for certain countries contemplated.\n\nIn March 1824, when he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Henry Clay would go on to give one of the most famous speeches in Congressional history. Rejecting the premise that reciprocity would ever be possible with a foreign nation, Clay went to pains to demonstrate the futility of counting on export markets, especially for agricultural producers. Clay launched what became known as “the American System”: a combination of protective tariffs, federal funding for internal improvements, and a central bank.\n\nThe Whig Party, followed by the Republican Party, would largely carry on the American System into the 20th century. The United States would implement only two “reciprocal tariff” treaties between 1789 and 1891, and both provide cautionary lessons for today.\n\nIn 1854, like a bully pawning off a homework assignment to a weaker student, Britain successfully brow-beat the United States into its first “reciprocal” tariff agreement, a list of duty-free Canadian commodities. This treaty also involved plans for the U.S. annexation of Canada and a subsequent drive to replace America’s first income tax with tariffs, making it remarkably timely.\n\nThe story begins almost a decade before the treaty’s ratification, after the British Parliament infamously embraced free-trade policy with repeal of the “corn laws.” With Britain’s tariff on corn mostly abolished, and the tariff on lumber cut in half, Canada’s exports to her Mother Country collapsed. British merchants abandoned Canada for grain from the Danube and lumber from the Baltic.\n\nCanadians were in trouble. On May 12, 1846, the Canadian parliament passed a resolution asking Britain to open negotiations with the United States for a reciprocal tariff treaty for Canada. Recognizing the distress in Canada, Britain authorized the power for the Canadian provinces to set their own tariff rates. Canada promptly equalized its tariffs for the UK and U.S., seen as a necessary first step to preferential rates with the United States.\n\nThe British and Canadian legislatures felt they had a solid chance. The United States had maintained protectionist tariffs for most of the preceding decades back to the repeal of Jefferson’s Embargo Acts. This changed when Democrats replaced the Whig’s protectionist Tariff of 1842 with the “Walker Tariff” of 1846, named after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Walker. The Walker Tariff reduced rates on all products and completely eliminated “specific tariffs,” which are assessed on volume (that is, so many dollars per unit), not the importer’s declared value. With the Walker Tariff, all tariff rates were reverted to simple ad valorem percentages, assessed on whatever invoice the importer provides. Using ad valorem instead of specific tariffs typically substitutes protection for revenue. As Henry Clay remarked at the time, “It is evident that on the ad-valorem principle, it is the foreigner who virtually fixes the actual amount of the duty paid. It is the foreigner who, by fixing that value, virtually legislates for us—and that in a case where his interest is directly opposed to that of our revenue.”\n\nDespite the less protectionist Congress and the receptive Walker, there was insufficient interest in Washington to generate the momentum necessary for a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada. In 1848, a bill was introduced in the U.S. House, but stalled.\n\nThe economic situation continued to deteriorate in Canada. Lord Elgin, Canada’s governor general, wrote to the Colonial Minister that “property in most of the Canadian towns, and more especially in the capital, has fallen fifty per cent in value within the last three years. Three-fourths of the commercial men are bankrupt, owing to free-trade.”\n\nDespite the dire situation in Canada, Britain proceeded to repeal her navigation laws, a significant blow to the maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, which made use of preferential cabotage to promote a Canadian carrying and shipbuilding industry.\n\nThen, in late 1849, just as Congress was preparing to address slavery in the Mexican Cession, a dramatic development in Canada grabbed headlines: A group of prominent Montrealers published the Montreal Annexation Manifesto, calling for the peaceful separation of the Province of Canada from Britain and union with the United States​. This declaration sent shockwaves through the political press on both sides of the border.\n\nThe manifesto laid blame at Britain’s embrace of global free trade as to why U.S. annexation was necessary: “The reversal of the ancient policy of Great Britain, whereby she withdrew from the colonies their wonted protection in her markets, has produced the most disastrous effects upon Canada. In surveying the actual condition of the country, what but ruin or rapid decay meets the eye.”\n\nBritain’s response? Stiffen her resolve and strengthen free trade by creating a new export market for Canadian products through a “reciprocal” trade deal with the United States.\n\nIt was very much a stick-and-carrot approach, heavy on the stick. On July 5, 1852, Britain sent a communication to the United States announcing that ships from the Royal Navy had been dispatched to assert fishing rights in a disputed 1818 treaty. American fishing vessels found violating Britain’s interpretation of the treaty would be seized. The United States sent Commodore Matthew Perry and the steam frigate Mississippi in response, but finding six armed British cruisers, the Maine and Massachusetts fishermen retreated.\n\nThe message was received; it was known in Washington “that Great Britain would not consider the settlement of the fishery question aside from reciprocal trade.”\n\nBritain’s fisheries gambit was further aided by the Southern delegation in Congress, which was alarmed at the prospect of Canada joining the United States as a non-slave state. According to Republican Senators Jacob Collamer of Vermont and Zachariah Chandler of Michigan, “apprehension on the part of the South, in 1854, was what brought about the treaty.”\n\nOn June 5, 1854, Britain succeeded. U.S. Secretary of State William Marcy and Elgin signed the Reciprocity Treaty. It provided for the mutual enjoyment of the Atlantic coast fisheries north of the 36th parallel, reciprocal free trade in a number of agricultural commodities, and gave the United States free navigation of the St. Lawrence River and of the Canadian canals.\n\nAs would become the pattern throughout American history, however, the “reciprocal tariff” agreement benefited the other country at America’s expense. Representative Frederick Pike, a Republican from Maine, in a speech to Congress in 1862, laid out the results: “In 1854, we exported about three dollars for one of imports, and now, in the last two years, have imported about a million and a half more than our exports.”\n\nPike described the immoral nature of how the reciprocity treaty pitted producers and states against each other: “Massachusetts was willing to sacrifice the interests of Maine, if thereby she could get the cheap wood of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.”\n\nPike condemned the foreign influence and money behind the reciprocity campaign: “It is well known that Canada spent considerable sums to aid in lubricating [the treaty’s] passage through the channels of official routine in this city.” Even today, the Government of Canada continues to spend money throughout the United States attacking U.S. tariffs.\n\nBy 1864, Canadian exports to the United States benefiting from duty-free treatment were double that of the United States to Canada.\n\nUltimately, what would kill the Reciprocity Treaty would be its interference with much-needed tariffs for revenue. Congress had passed the first federal income tax in 1862, which managed to provide for nearly a quarter of the Civil War’s revenue, despite relying on voluntary compliance. But by 1864, the United States was $2.6 billion in debt with only $858,309 of cash on hand.\n\nRevenue was needed, and Republicans were particularly incensed that reciprocity with Canada compelled the Treasury to forgo tariff revenue while collecting a domestic income tax: “There existed a feeling that the American producer should not be loaded with taxes, while at the same time the Canadian producer, who competed with him, contributed nothing to the revenue of our Government.” Several senators made statements in the chamber decrying the admission of duty-free imports while a domestic income tax system existed. Chandler:\n\nThe citizens of Michigan are largely taxed for the support of this Government, taxed directly and indirectly ; taxed upon their income, and upon their products, and upon their consumption ; taxed in every way, while the inhabitants of Canada raise precisely the same articles, are engaged in the same business, and send their products here to compete with ours without contributing one dollar to the support of this Government.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, Congress voted to give the one year’s notice per the treaty’s terms to withdraw, and on March 17, 1866, the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada was terminated.\n\nThe termination would prove a happy ending for both the United States and Canada. The following year, on July 1, 1867, realizing they could not count on Britain nor the United States, the British provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick united into one federation called the Dominion of Canada. Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John A. MacDonald, would go on to implement Henry Clay’s American System for British North America. His government campaigned on a “National Policy” that embraced protective tariffs and Canada’s own transcontinental railway. The United States and Canada would spend the rest of the nineteenth century rapidly industrializing, raising the standard of living in both countries ahead of Europe, all under their respective protectionist tariffs. And indeed, by 1911, Canada out-protectionismed America, rejecting a second reciprocity treaty that year that had been pushed by the United States.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hawaii had first proposed a Reciprocity Treaty with the United States in 1855, but the effort was plagued with similar problems to Canada’s advocacy and did not benefit from the extra push by Britain.\n\nStill, while the Canada Treaty was adopted partially by interests in both Washington and London on quelling annexation talk, the same cannot be said of Hawaiian Reciprocity. As Senator Justin Morrill (R-VT) said in a March 18, 1875 speech, “The most potent argument now offered [in support of Hawaiian reciprocity] is the same suggestion that has heretofore been most prominently presented, as in 1855 and 1869, namely, that if we do not make this arrangement—so feeble are their numbers, so lamentably deficient are their resources—they will be compelled to lean upon some other power. Great Britain or New Zealand will snatch them up and they will be lost to us forever.”\n\nMorrill still cautioned about the bad precedent of Republicans supporting a reciprocal tariff deal: “What may be done with King Kalakaua may be done with the Queen of Great Britain or the Autocrat of Russia.”\n\nThe Hawaiians (or more accurately, the sugar-plantation owners) were ultimately successful, with Hawaiian tariff-free reciprocity effective September 9, 1876. Joseph Nāwahī, a Hawaiian legislator, publicly predicted that the treaty would be “a nation-snatching treaty,” stating, “The Treaty of Reciprocity becoming law will be the first step of annexation later on, and the kingdom, its flag, its independence and its people will become naught.”\n\nA modern observer may readily conclude that this treaty was a “success” insofar as Hawaii is now a U.S. state. After all, if reciprocity is a mere prelude to annexation, then ultimately, reciprocity is not incompatible with tariffs for revenue and protection.\n\nBut this glosses over the history and chronology. The annexation of Hawaii was not a smooth commercial union akin to the Alaska Purchase of 1867. As Congress would acknowledge in the Apology Resolution of 1993, the Kingdom of Hawaii was “overthrown” (Congress’s words) with U.S. military support.\n\nWhether reciprocity was a necessary stepping stone to annexation is beyond the scope of this article. But a few observations are warranted. Reciprocity’s overwhelming benefit to Hawaii was for Hawaiian sugar exports, and on the American side, to sugar refiners in San Francisco. But there were losers: namely sugar-cane plantations in Louisiana and Florida, and western sugar-beet farmers, who were supplying approximately one-tenth of U.S. demand.\n\nAnd as always, hard lessons were learned about the inadvisability of international supply chains. After the Hawaiian Reciprocity Treaty was ratified, between 1875 and 1890, U.S. consumption of Hawaiian sugar increased over 1,400 percent, cementing Hawaii’s economic dependence on U.S. exports. But in 1890, Congress was flush with more revenue than Congress knew what to do with. William McKinley, then chairman of the U.S. Ways and Means Committee, wanted to increase tariffs on manufactured goods, but was under tremendous pressure to offset those tariff increases with tariff cuts elsewhere. McKinley chose sugar, eliminating the tariff of two cents per pound (64 cents per pound today). Hawaii’s duty-free concession on sugar was now worthless, devastating Hawaii economically. U.S. sugar importers immediately switched to Cuba, while American planters in Hawaii set about plotting the overthrow of the queen.\n\nShortly after their successful revolution, the United States restored the sugar duty in 1894, seriously damaging Cuba’s newfound prosperity. Per the tariff historian John Dobson, “In a few months, Cuban revolutionaries had capitalized on the discontent of the impoverished Cuban peasants and had renewed a bloody fight for independence begun 25 years before. This conflict ultimately drew the United States into a war with Spain in 1898… Thus, the seemingly innocent juggling of the sugar duty had important consequences for the United States and for the world.”\n\nUltimately, McKinley’s 1890 nullification of Hawaiian reciprocity seems to have been a necessary step towards the country’s annexation.\n\nA leading figure drawing the Republican Party, and the United States, away from isolationism and defense of the home market above all was James Blaine. A Congressman for Maine, Blaine was elected as Speaker of the House for the 41st Congress beginning in 1869. After President Ulysses Grant selected protectionist Morrill to be his Treasury Secretary, Blaine was appointed to Morrill’s Senate seat. Blaine, like the rest of Maine’s delegation, had been opposed to the reciprocity treaty with Canada, but his views changed. Nominated by President James Garfield to be secretary of state in 1881, Blaine embraced reciprocal trade as a means to get ahead of European involvement in the Western Hemisphere. He negotiated tariff reciprocity treaties with Mexico in 1882, and with the Dominican Republic and Spain (for Cuba and Puerto Rico) in 1884. However, protectionists in the Senate managed to stall consideration of Blaine’s treaties. None would be implemented.\n\nInternational intrigue resulting from the Tariff Act of 1890 did not end with sugar and Hawaii. The Republican Party was now splitting into factions, those singularly focused on protecting the home market versus those led by Blaine who saw reciprocity as a means to create an American empire.\n\nAfter the Democratic interlude of President Grover Cleveland’s first term, Blaine returned as secretary of state in 1890, convening the First International Conference of American States as one of his first orders of business. Blaine went so far as to push for a hemispheric customs union at the Conference, but the idea had little support in Congress or from the other countries.\n\nNevertheless, in Congress, Blaine would win an important battle against McKinley that would cement reciprocity’s future ruination of protection. During Congressional consideration of the Tariff Act of 1890, Blaine was victorious against McKinley over the inclusion of a reciprocity clause in the Tariff Act of 1890 (hereinafter, the Blaine Clause).\n\nThe Blaine Clause did seem innocent enough. While McKinley’s Tariff eliminated the duty on sugar, molasses, tea, coffee, and hides, Blaine’s Clause authorized the President to reinstate the tariffs against countries that treated U.S. exports in a “reciprocally unequal and unreasonable” fashion. McKinley, known as the “Napoleon of Protection”, opposed the Blaine Clause as an improper delegation of Congressional authority. President Benjamin Harrison, however, sided with Blaine, which secured Blaine’s reciprocity clause in the Senate version of the bill, despite McKinley’s resistance. The so-called “McKinley Tariff” would become famous for containing the Blaine Clause despite McKinley’s opposition.\n\nBlaine, by all accounts a master orator, was successful in persuading even some ardent protectionists that reciprocity was compatible with protection. In October 1890, the American Protective Tariff League published a column quoting from a speech Blaine gave in Canton, with the writer saying it “discredits forever and absolutely the Free Trade statements that Mr. Blaine had become indifferent to Protection, or personally hostile to members of the Republican party who did not accept or approve of his views upon Reciprocity.” The column assured protectionists that Blaine would only sacrifice revenue-tariffs (tariffs on certain commodities for which we were import-dependent) to promote exports, and never protective tariffs. This seems impossible to square with Blaine’s desire for a hemispheric customs union.\n\nMarketing reciprocity as compatible with protection would be a major rhetorical strategy for globalist Republicans in the following decades.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1892, under Harrison, Blaine used his clause to secure 10 reciprocity treaties. Key agreements included those with Brazil, Spain (for Cuba and Puerto Rico), and several Latin American nations like the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\n\nBlaine did not think annexation of all these countries was worthwhile. He genuinely believed in promoting international trade in the Western Hemisphere for its own sake, for the promotion of foreign entanglements. Blaine wrote privately to Harrison that only Hawaii, Cuba, and Puerto Rico “are of value enough to be taken.”\n\nThese reciprocity agreements set a terrible precedent, as unlike the Canada and Hawaii treaties, these new ones were not “treaties” per the Constitution's Treaty Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2). They did not require Senate approval, a novel executive power shift. The president would merely be using the Blaine Clause’s delegated power from Congress. This clause was challenged in court by an importer forced to pay duties per the President’s invocation of the clause, but the clause was upheld by unanimous Supreme Court judgment in Field v. Clark (1892).\n\nBlaines’s treaties were immediately followed by the Panic of 1893, and Blaine’s health rapidly declined, leading to his death that year. Democrats dismantled McKinley’s tariff, replacing it with their Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, effectively nullifying Blaine’s agreements and removing the clause.\n\nThe 1896 Republican Party platform declared “Protection and Reciprocity are twin measures.” And McKinley’s views on reciprocity, or at least the president’s use of tariff powers, had apparently changed by 1896 as he ran for the White House. In a recorded campaign speech from 1896, he declared, “Our creed embraces an honest dollar, an untarnished national credit, adequate revenues for the uses of the government, protection to labor and industry, preservation of the home market, and reciprocity which will extend our foreign markets.”\n\nHistory has proven that protection and reciprocity are not, in fact, twin measures, or at all compatible, as Henry Clay had so eloquently demonstrated back in 1824.\n\nBut the 1896 Republican Party had clearly subordinated the home market emphasis, despite still giving it a nod. The platform continued:\n\nResolved, That we favor such reciprocity measures as will enable the United States to secure a proper share of the markets of the world for the products of our labor and our manufactures, and to that end we favor the cession of our right to impose retaliatory duties upon the importations from any country which imposes unequal or discriminating duties upon the products of American labor or manufactures.\n\nMcKinley’s 1897 Dingley Tariff Act raised duties to a record 57 percent, yet included a reciprocity provision allowing negotiated trade deals. Treaties with France and others followed, though protectionism still held sway. Nelson Aldrich, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, championed protection, at least rhetorically.\n\nBy 1901, McKinley’s final speech—days before his assassination—pushed further, advocating tariff flexibility to boost exports. Theodore Roosevelt, succeeding him, initially maintained this balance. His administration negotiated reciprocity with Cuba in 1902, cutting duties by 20 percent, but faced resistance from protectionist “Old Guard” Republicans.\n\nWith the rise of the giant American “trusts” (monopolies and oligopolies) during this period, public sympathy for tariff protection was at a low. While the same Republican Congress that had passed the McKinley Tariff of 1890 also passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, Republican Presidents had failed to adequately make use of its antitrust authorities. In retrospect, failure to more vigorously enforce the Sherman Act surely led to the destruction of protection.\n\nWilliam Howard Taft’s presidency (1909–1913) marked the peak of this tension. The 1909 Payne-Aldrich Tariff aimed to lower rates, but Senate revisions led by Aldrich kept duties high (averaging 40 percent), alienating progressive Republicans who favored reciprocity and reform.\n\nCementing the shift in thinking, it was now Republicans pushing for reciprocity even with Canada. Taft’s push for a Canadian reciprocity agreement in 1911—proposing mutual tariff cuts—split the party. Progressives like Robert La Follette backed it for cheaper goods and markets, while protectionists saw it as betrayal. It was Canada’s rejection in 1911, fearing U.S. dominance, that killed the deal.\n\nBy 1912, the Republican split deepened. Roosevelt ran as a Progressive, splitting the vote and giving Democrats a trifecta with uber-globalist Woodrow Wilson as President. The 1912 Democratic Party Platform led with the proposition that protectionist tariffs were actually unconstitutional, a long since discredited argument made by Confederates decades earlier.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson wasted no time working with “Father of the Income Tax” Cordell Hull, then a Tennessee Congressman at Ways and Means, to eviscerate America’s longstanding protective tariff. They did so with their radical Revenue Act of 1913, drastically slashing tariffs and substituting that revenue with the new income tax and Internal Revenue Service. The protective tariff was now fully destroyed.\n\nThe First World War temporarily held off a flood of imports. When that surge did take off in 1919, wiping out American farmers, Democrats were eviscerated at the polls. In 1920, the GOP swept Congress and the Presidency. The 67th Congress wasted no time in restoring tariffs for revenue and protection with the Emergency Tariff Act of 1921 and then the more sweeping Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922. The 1922 bill did a number of things:\n\nIt raised tariffs on a wide range of goods, including chinaware, pig iron, textiles, sugar, and rails, restoring duties to the high levels of 1907.\n\nIt increased tariffs from 60 to 400 percent on dyes, chemicals, silk and rayon textiles, and hardware;\n\nThe average ad valorem tariff rate for dutiable imports rose to about 38.5 percent\n\nIt was an incredible success. In 1923, tariff revenue surged to over $582 million, an increase of more than $200 million from the Democrats’ tariff. The Roaring ‘20s ensued:\n\nGross National Product from 1923 to 1928 grew roughly three percent annually;\n\nThe national war debt by was shrunk 34 percent;\n\nBy 1927 the unemployment rate was 3.3 percent, and\n\nSignificantly for the Trump administration, income tax was eliminated for 98 percent of the population.\n\nTrump is serious about renewing this success. He has discussed using tariffs to replace the income tax with Congressional Republicans, although as of March 2025, Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader John Thune have not shown much tariff ambition. On the revenue side, the Trump administration aims to raise anywhere from $400 billion to $1 trillion per year, and on the protection side, he has increased tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, and is poised to do so on copper and copper articles, lumber and wood articles, and medicines. On March 3, 2025, Trump channeled Clay’s American System speech from March 1824, pledging protection of the home market to American farmers. On March 12, 2025, when asked by host Stuart Varney on Fox Business’s Varney & Co. about the administration’s tariff strategy, Lutnick said, “The president is here to protect American workers. He’s here to protect American industry.”\n\nThe president has marked April 2 as Liberation Day, promising sweeping new tariffs for revenue. As of March 31, according to the Wall Street Journal, Trump has pushed his Cabinet to embrace the “universal” tariffs he campaigned on, as opposed to country-specific reciprocal tariffs. This further evidences Trump’s bona-fide protectionist instincts.\n\nThe 1922 Tariff Act contained eight “reciprocity” provisions tied to specific products. Notably, Title I, Sec. 1, Par. 369 of the Act set the tariff on cars at 25 percent, much as Trump has just done. Paragraph 369 also mandated that if any other country charges more than 25 percent, then the United States will impose the same tariff as that country, up to a rate of 50 percent.\n\nTitle III Sec. 315 the 1922 Tariff also gave the president broad authority to increase tariffs on any country if that country was found to discriminate against American exports in any manner.\n\nWhile the United States had dabbled in “reciprocity” for a handful of commodities with a handful of countries, mostly for short periods of time, these were aberrations. Per a Senate finance report, “The United States consistently applied a single-schedule tariff to imports from all countries. Reciprocal treaties granting reductions from the general tariff rates were few in number at any given time.”\n\nDuring the 1920s, Cordell Hull was, unfortunately, still ascendant, preparing to seal America’s subsequent ruin. He became chairman of the Democratic National Committee as well as a champion of America’s international creditors. Hull attacked the Fordney tariff on the basis that protective tariffs were making it harder for overseas vendors to export to America, and thus harder for them to earn dollars to repay their debts. He also attacked the settlements of debts owed to U.S. lenders that involved lenders accepting less profit.\n\nHull and his companions around the world who put creditors ahead of producers helped not only lay the foundation for the Great Depression, but exacerbated it. While the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 has been long defamed as playing a role in the Great Depression, no less than the former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other leading economic historians have “largely blamed that catastrophe on the international gold standard.” As Ben Stein noted in the New York Times, “exports were only about 5 percent of the economic output of the United States… To say that the [Smoot-Hawley] Act, which applied to a distinct minority of imports and which raised tariffs generally by only about six percentage points, caused the Depression is almost comical.”\n\nNonetheless, with the Depression in full effect, Democrats swept Congress and the Presidency in 1932. Hull now represented Tennessee in the Senate.\n\nLook in any textbook or ask any AI, and you can learn about the “Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.” In fact, there was no such legislation. What actually happened is that Democrats amended the Tariff Act of 1930 (Smoot-Hawley) with legislation titled “An Act to Promote Foreign Trade.”\n\nMuch like with Blaine’s 1890 clause, it allowed the president to adjust tariff rates based on mere “executive agreement” (no Senate ratification necessary). But that’s where the similarities ended. Hull’s 1934 amendment (hereinafter the Hull Clause) allowed the President to eliminate duties on any item, and worse yet, cemented an “Unconditional Most Favored Nation (MFN) Principle.”\n\nLest there be any doubt about the motivations, Section 3 of the Hull Clause stated that “Nothing in this Act shall be construed to give any authority to cancel or reduce, in any manner, any of the indebtedness of any foreign country to the United States.” Hull gave himself blanket authority to throw domestic producers under the bus so that foreign countries could export more to earn more dollars to repay their debts. But not a single dollar of that indebtedness was to be forgiven.\n\nHull’s Clause permanently launched the presidential tariff era, and to this day Congress has not passed a Tariff Act since 1930.\n\nThe Hull Clause stated that any tariff cuts proclaimed by the president “shall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly” (emphasis added). This is known as “Unconditional MFN,” which applies tariff reductions made to one trade partner to all countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements. Whereas under the Blaine Clause a tariff cut for Brazil was just that, a tariff cut for Brazil, under the Hull Clause the tariff cuts for the 1935 “Reciprocal” Trade Agreement with Brazil applied to virtually the entire world.\n\nIn the subsequent decade, Hull, now secretary of state, entered into 30 trade agreements with 29 foreign nations (he did Canada twice), each one cutting U.S. tariffs globally and on a non-reciprocal basis. This was the end of America’s protective tariff.\n\nHull’s tariff cuts really did apply globally: the Japanese Empire, Nazi Germany, it made no difference. Hull was virulently anti-tariff, and nothing was more important than lenders foreign debts being repaid through exports back to America.\n\nThe Hull Clause did contemplate other countries using “non-tariff barriers” to thwart American exports. It authorized the president to “suspend the application [of the tariff cut to] any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce.” Presidents have had all the tools necessary to deal with lack of genuine reciprocity, but until President Trump, all were overwhelmingly reluctant to use those powers.\n\nAfter the war, in 1947, Hull’s 30 trade agreements were collapsed into the global General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a non-reciprocal tariff agreement with 22 other nations.\n\nBy 1950, the average rate of duty paid on goods imported into the U.S. had fallen to 5.8 percent, and 60 percent of all goods were imported duty-free. Imports from the Soviet-controlled Eastern Bloc became a bridge too far, however. Trade policy was in the service of international lenders, but now also in fighting international communism. President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951. The American tariff schedule was split into “Column 1” and “Column 2.” Column 1 contained negligible tariffs for GATT countries and other non-communist countries, while Column 2 contained higher rates from the Tariff Act of 1930. Section 5 of the 1951 Act directed that communist nations be moved to Column 2. Column 1 and 2 remain today, but as of March 2025, Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, and Russia are the only countries in Column 2.\n\nCongress did get wise to the lack of reciprocity at the outset of the GATT “Tokyo Round” in the early 1970s. Industries from flatware to bicycles had largely been wiped out, with temporary GATT-authorized “safeguard” tariffs only slowing the bleed-out. Congress legislated “Reciprocal nondiscriminatory treatment” as part of the Trade Act of 1974, and it remains the law today (see 19 U.S. Code § 2136).\n\nThe president would only be allowed to proclaim the latest round of tariff cuts if he could certify that we had achieved reciprocity with Canada, Europe, and Japan. The president did so, and indeed, we got it. Ever since, Japan has charged zero tariffs on U.S. cars, while we have charged Japan 2.5 percent. Under this reciprocal regime, Japan sends us 77 cars for every one car we send them. And President Trump stands virtually alone inside the Beltway in identifying this first as a problem, and second as one that can be remedied through tariffs.",

      "full_content": "Donald Trump rode into office—twice now—on a wave of promises to upend the Washington consensus, to drain the swamp of its self-serving mandarins and to keep America out of endless wars. His base cheered when he skewered the neoconservative architects of Iraq and Afghanistan, wars that bled our Treasury, and most importantly, many of our sons for little more than bragging rights in Beltway and Tel Aviv salons. Yet here we are, in the early days of his second term, with whispers growing louder from the usual suspects: advisors and hangers-on nudging him toward a strike on Iran, peddling the old lie that it’ll be quick, clean, and simple. History, that stern teacher we keep ignoring, tells us otherwise. Yet the hawks in the Trump administration appear to be anxious to wreck another country, which would join the long, recurring tragedy of U.S.-caused failed countries in the Middle East.\n\nThe pitch is familiar, isn’t it? A swift blow—maybe a few airstrikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites or a green light for Israel to do the dirty work—and the mullahs will crumble, the region will stabilize, and we’ll be home by Easter. It’s the same tune the warmongers hummed in 1914, when Europe’s leaders promised their boys would be back from the trenches by Christmas. These are also the same deceptions we heard in 2003, when Iraq was sold as a “cakewalk”—a war that would pay for itself with oil and gratitude. Millions of lives and trillions of dollars later, we’re still witnessing that tragedy.\n\nThe U.S. has been either directly bombing or participating in bombing the Houthis on and off since 2015. Why should we believe the war cheerleaders that this time will be more successful?\n\nIran is not Iraq circa 2003, nor is it some tinpot dictatorship ripe for a Predator-drone makeover. It’s a 3,000-year-old culture with a population of 85 million, rugged as the Zagros Mountains, with a military hardened by decades of sanctions, assassinations, military attacks, cyber attacks, proxy wars, and constant threats from top leaders of Israel and the U.S. to destroy their country. The Islamic Republic has spent years preparing for this very fight—dispersing its assets, fortifying its defenses, and cultivating allies from Hezbollah to the Houthis. A strike wouldn’t be a surgical snip; it’d be kicking a hornet’s nest with no apparent interest in an exit strategy. Yet the war hawk advisers circling Trump—some recycled from the Bush era, others eager to prove their toughness—seem unworried about the chaos they’d unleash. Chaos has been their game for decades.\n\nLet’s play this out. Day one: bombs fall, targets burn, and the cable news chyrons scream victory. Day two: Iran retaliates—maybe with missiles on U.S. bases in Qatar or shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, whence a fifth of the world’s oil flows. Day three: oil prices spike, markets tank, and suddenly we’re not talking about a “limited operation” anymore. Hezbollah rains rockets on Tel Aviv, the Houthis blockade the Red Sea, and militia groups in Iraq and Syria start targeting American troops again. Before you know it, we’re waist-deep in another quagmire, with the same generals and pundits who botched the last three wars demanding more troops, more money, and more time. Sound familiar? Lyndon Johnson followed that advice, descended into infamy, and had to exit politics.\n\nThe hawks will scoff at this. Like they’ve done for decades, they’ll say Iran’s on the verge of collapse, it’s a paper tiger, that deterrence demands action, that Trump must show strength. They’ll invoke Reagan or Thatcher, forgetting that both knew when to hold fire. But strength isn’t measured by how many bombs you drop—it’s knowing when to walk away from a bad bet. Trump, at his best, gets this. He resisted the full-court press to bomb Syria into oblivion after Assad’s alleged chemical weapons stunts. He talked Kim Jong Un down from the ledge without firing a shot. He’s not a pacifist, but he’s no fool either. So why let the same clique that cheered on the Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria fiascoes steer him into this buzz saw?\n\nThe main problem is the company he keeps. The swamp didn’t drain—it got a new guest list. Some of these advisers see Iran as a trophy, a chance to flex America’s muscles and settle old scores. Others are tethered to foreign capitals—Riyadh, Jerusalem—that would love to see us do their bidding and wreck Iran.\n\nAmerica has followed the neoconservative Zionists’ foreign policy desires for decades. Every one of their wars ends up killing, wounding, and starving hundreds of thousands of innocent people. Millions are homeless. The target countries become dysfunctional, creating generations of new enemies. The narrative is the same: They say a leader is hurting his people. He is worse than Hitler and he must go. But the warmongers are unapologetic about the disastrous results such as warlords running Libya and Afghanistan, and the chaos and destruction in Iraq. Now that the “horrible” Assad is gone, a dressed-up Al Qaeda is running Syria. How is that not alarming? Our government enabled and supported that destruction for years.\n\nThe Christian Zionists are not crying out about the two-millennia-old Christian communities, which are being driven out of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Israel as a result of the wars they have supported. No apologies here either.\n\nIs it possible that the warmongers calling for the attacks on Iran would be perfectly satisfied leaving a mess like the other countries they have caused us to attack? How is that in America's interest?\n\nThey’re not thinking about the young Americans who will bear the brunt when the “cakewalk” turns into a slog. They’re thinking about their political masters, not Americans in the flyover country.\n\nConservatives used to understand this. They were the ones who questioned the hubris of nation-building, who saw war as a last resort, not a first reflex. Robert Taft and Dwight Eisenhower didn’t fetishize military overreach; they knew it bankrupted nations and eroded liberty. Along the way, we let the neocons and their ilk hijack the movement, turning “peace through strength” into “war for applause.” President Trump’s first term hinted at a return to that older wisdom. His second could cement it—or squander it on Iran’s altar.\n\nThe president should listen to his gut, not his courtiers. He’s a dealmaker, not a warlord. He knows the art of the bluff, and the power of walking away. Iran is no angel—its ambitions troubling—but it’s not an existential threat to America requiring a preemptive strike. Diplomacy worked with the Soviets; it can work here. War, though? War is the wildcard that breaks everything.\n\nSo here’s the request, Mr. President: don’t buy the dishonest hype. Don’t let the warmongers’ desire to wreck another country be your guide. You ran against the forever wars—don’t start another one. America wants jobs, borders, sanity—not body bags and budget deficits. History is littered with failed leaders who thought war was simple. It never is, particularly when it is fomented by people who do not prioritize American interests. You know them by their fruits.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nDemocratic-backed candidate Susan Crawford has won Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race, maintaining the liberal majority on the court in a key battleground state less than three months into President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nCrawford, a liberal circuit court judge in Dane County, will beat the conservative candidate Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County judge who received Trump’s backing in the final stretch of the campaign. The race was officially nonpartisan, but Crawford’s victory will be seen as a bright spot for Democrats in Wisconsin and nationwide as voters handed the president’s preferred candidate a defeat in the first major political test of the second Trump era.\n\nCrawford and her Democratic allies also worked to turn the election into a referendum on Trump ally Elon Musk, who poured millions of his personal fortune into the race. It quickly became the most expensive judicial contest in US history.\n\nAt a victory rally in Madison Tuesday night, Crawford thanked supporters, saying their votes helped send a message to the country.\n\n“Today, Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our supreme court. And Wisconsinites stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price – our courts are not for sale,” she said.\n\nCrawford did not mention Musk by name, but she did reference defeating his big spending in the contest.\n\n“As a little girl in Chippewa falls, I never thought I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin, and we won!” she said to loud cheers.\n\nCrawford said Schimel called her to concede. “I want to thank him. He was very gracious, and I wish him and his family well,” she added.\n\nMusk and groups affiliated with him spent more than $19 million in the state, including funding field operations and television advertisements. Crawford tied the tech billionaire directly to Schimel in her appearances, at times referencing Musk at “my opponent.” Democratic groups ran television ads linking the Tesla CEO to Schimel.\n\nIn all, the candidates and outside groups spent more than $90 million — shattering spending records set just two years ago, when a liberal judge captured an open seat and flipped control of the court.\n\nSchimel and Republicans had hoped to draw on the network of voters who supported Trump in November’s presidential election, when he narrowly won the battleground state. Schimel hugged Trump closely throughout the campaign and even appeared in a live chat with Musk on his social media site X.\n\nBut Democrats bet that seizing on that alignment would pay off with voters at a time when the two men have undertaken a controversial reshaping of the federal government. Issues such as abortion rights and the redistricting of congressional maps also emerged as flashpoints in the campaign.\n\nCrawford, who has represented Planned Parenthood as a private attorney, backs abortion rights.\n\nIn a state with divided government — Gov. Tony Evers is a Democrat, and Republicans control the state legislature — the Supreme Court has become the final arbiter on policies that affect Wisconsites’ lives, including whether a 19th-century law that banned most abortions could be enforced today.\n\nAnd in a state that helps determine who wins the presidency, the high court would have the final word in resolving election disputes.\n\nSince the liberals won a 4-3 majority two years ago, the court has delivered major victories to Democrats — reversing a 2022 high court ruling that had imposed a near-total ban on ballot drop boxes and striking down state legislative maps drawn by Republicans.\n\nThe court could revisit congressional maps that have helped the GOP hold a lopsided advantage of six out of eight US House seats, despite the paper-thin margins of victory for Republicans and Democrats in statewide races.\n\nCrawford will serve a 10-year term.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

      "full_content": "Washington CNN —\n\nA new lawsuit filed Tuesday accuses tech billionaire Elon Musk and his super PAC of failing to pay canvassers who helped his pro-Trump political operation in 2024.\n\nDuring the final stretch of the 2024 campaign, Musk and his political group, America PAC, offered $100 to registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition supporting free speech and gun rights, and another $100 for every additional voter they convinced to sign the petition. The goal was to excite conservative voters and elect then-candidate Donald Trump – who narrowly won Pennsylvania in November.\n\nA man from the Philadelphia suburbs – who filed the lawsuit anonymously because he says he fears retribution – claims he is owed $20,000 for gathering signatures in Pennsylvania. The lawsuit claims there could be at least another 100 victims of Musk’s alleged breach-of-contract. This comes after press reports about allegedly late or missing payments from the super PAC around the presidential election.\n\n“This lawsuit is about keeping promises,” the man’s attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, told CNN. “He was expecting to be able to pay his bills because of this promise. He was pounding the pavement during the campaign because Elon Musk asked him too. He believed in Elon Musk.”\n\nAmerica PAC spokesman Andrew Romeo denied wrongdoing when asked about the lawsuit.\n\n“America PAC is committed to paying for every legitimate petition signature, which is evidenced by the fact that we have paid tens of millions of dollars to canvassers for their hard work in support of our mission,” Romeo said in a statement, adding that the pro-Trump group is “committed to rooting out fraud” and has “the right to withhold payments to fraudsters.”\n\nIn the past week, Musk revived his 2024-style giveaways in Wisconsin, offering $1 million cash prizes as he campaigned in support of a conservative candidate for the state Supreme Court.\n\nMusk and his super PAC denied claims during the 2024 campaign that their cash giveaways to voters violated federal laws against vote-buying or that it operated an illegal state lottery.\n\nThe Justice Department warned the super PAC in October about its $1 million sweepstakes for registered voters. And the Philadelphia district attorney, a Democrat, tried and failed in state court to get the daily giveaways shut down because, he claimed, it was an unlawful operation.\n\nLiss-Riordan, who filed the latest lawsuit Tuesday in Pennsylvania federal court, has previously sued X, the Musk-owned social media platform formerly called Twitter, in a case about Musk’s takeover of the company. She was also involved in an unsuccessful effort to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot in Massachusetts because of the US Constitution’s “insurrectionist ban.”",

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday officially fulfilled a campaign promise to unleash sweeping tariffs, a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war and prompted a major question about what has become the centerpiece of his economic agenda: What’s his endgame?\n\nIn both size and scope, Trump’s ultimate blueprint for global tariffs — a 10% baseline tariff on virtually every country, with higher numbers on countries with which the United States has larger trade deficits — was more than most expected. It has left global financial markets tumbling and Trump’s Republican supporters trying to thread the political needle of not criticizing him while also understanding the economic peril the tariff plan may usher in ahead of 2026 midterm elections in which the GOP will try to defend its slim House and Senate majorities.\n\nTrump’s team has so far not had a clear message to either explain the strategy behind the tariffs that his political allies can echo or his thought process behind the decision to go much further than even supporters were expecting.\n\nWhat’s more, multiple elements of the sweeping measures made it seem as if the administration rushed through the process — including its decision to levy tariffs on uninhabited islands and its initially listing tariff numbers on the White House list published Thursday that were different from the ones on the chart Trump held in the Rose Garden on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks about his tariffs Wednesday at the White House as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick holds a chart showing the rates. Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images\n\nOne day after the announcement, Trump was not helping provide any of that clarity, posting cryptic messages on Truth Social that the “patient lived,” an apparent reference to the U.S. economy, and that the “operation is over,” though the tariffs have yet to be imposed.\n\n“THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,” he posted on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 1,600 points. “THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE.”\n\n“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!,” he added.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump doubled down on the analogy in defending his move to reporters who asked about the financial markets’ tanking one day after his tariff announcement.\n\n“I think it’s going very well,” he said. “It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on.”\n\nTrump at various points has framed the tariff plan as a revenue generator for the country, saying last week that the tariffs would raise “billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars, coming into our country.” At the same time, though, he has discussed them in terms of “fairness,” the idea that they could be used as a tool to rebalance the global economy, which, according to Trump, has been plagued by foreign nations’ taking advantage of the United States.\n\nTrump has long viewed a trade deficit as a “subsidy” the United States provides another country. Economists have almost uniformly rejected that idea, pointing out that many countries are either too small or too poor to buy enough U.S. goods to offset their exports.\n\nThe sheer size of the tariff proposal and the lack of clear communication from the administration have left some Trump supporters skeptical and unsure what’s coming next.\n\n“I have no idea,” a Trump supporter and 2024 donor said when asked what they thought Trump’s end goal was. “This is much larger than I think most thought would happen during the campaign. I guess the best case is he gets some concessions from countries quickly and pulls back. I don’t know.”\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide said White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller spoke at a lunch with Senate chiefs of staff Thursday to address concerns. This person said Miller handled the tough questioning well and made strong points about the national security rationale behind reshoring critical supply chains, given the Covid crisis.\n\nBut this person said the White House has yet to offer effective messaging on other fronts related to the wide-ranging tariffs.\n\n“They’ve got the broad, overarching theme down of what they’re trying to say with reorienting the economy,” this person said. “The difficult part of this is what do you say to the small business that says these tariffs are going to put me under. And I’ve yet to hear a compelling talking point on that.”\n\nThe tariffs give congressional Republicans even more urgency to pass tax cuts to alleviate some of the pressures of the tariffs, said this person, who believes Trump is “willing to make a deal” on the trade measures, though.\n\n“Donald Trump views everything as a negotiation, right?” this person said. “That’s kind of his worldview. So I think this is a negotiation, and there’s going to be countries that come to the table one by one and make a deal to do business with the No. 1 economy in the world.”\n\nSince Wednesday’s announcement, Trump advisers have been dispatched to do rounds of media interviews to explain the plan. At times, the explanations have only muddied the water.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN on Thursday morning that Wall Street should “trust President Trump” and that no level of negotiation by other countries would reduce or eliminate the outlined plan before the tariffs go into effect.\n\n“The president made it clear yesterday this is not a negotiation, this is a national emergency,” she said.\n\nWhite House talking points obtained by NBC News also emphasized that the tariffs were not a negotiating tool.\n\nThe message about “not a negotiation,” however, has been contradicted by Trump’s own economic advisers — who insist the move is part of a negotiating ploy to bring back what they call “fair trade” — as well as his own family and even Trump himself.\n\n\"The tariffs give us great power to negotiate. Always have,\" Trump told reporters Thursday on Air Force One.\n\nTrump’s son Eric posted Thursday morning on X: “I wouldn’t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump. The first to negotiate will win — the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life…”\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday night that the tariffs would prompt negotiations by foreign trade partners.\n\n“I’ve got to imagine that a lot of these countries are not going to like the tariffs that go into effect tonight at midnight, and they are going to want to negotiate,” he said. “You think I’m wrong?”\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that he was not part of tariff talks within the administration and was not sure whether negotiations with foreign countries would happen before the baseline tariffs take effect Saturday.\n\n“I am not part of the negotiations, so we will see,” he said. “I’m sure there will be a lot of calls. I’m just not sure there will be negotiations.”\n\nThough the announcement did broadly fulfill a Trump campaign promise to institute tariffs, it is also seemingly in contradiction with another big message he used on the campaign trail: that he would lower prices.\n\n“When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one,” Trump said in August.\n\nThat theme has transformed in recent weeks as the impact tariffs would be likely to have on the cost of most consumer goods came into view. The administration now says that its tariff-focused economic policy will lead to some “short-term pain” for consumers but that it is all part of a larger plan to usher in what Trump has called the “Golden Age of America.”\n\nIt is the message being echoed by Trump’s most staunch congressional allies, even those concerned about economic and political blowback.\n\n“Sometimes in business you have to have short-term pain to have long-term gain, and we don’t think this is even going to be that long of a short term, if it is at all,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La, acknowledged to reporters that the Trump administration might have to “recalibrate” if the original tariff plans prove negative for the domestic economy.\n\n“If they make things better, they should want more. If it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate,” he said. “If the tariffs end up hurting America, I think you’ll see President Trump recalibrate.”\n\nFor Republicans members of Congress, it has become a delicate balancing act. They are trying not to criticize Trump while keeping an eye toward the 2026 midterms and taking into consideration recent polling that has found the tariff plan to be increasingly unpopular.\n\nA CBS/YouGov poll released this week found that 55% of respondents feel Trump is focusing too much on tariffs, while 64% think he is not focused enough on lowering prices. A Fox News poll released last month found similar sentiment, with 53% of registered voters saying tariffs “hurt the economy.”\n\nEven before Wednesday’s announcement, voters have increasingly questioned Trump’s economic agenda. Last month, an NBC News survey found Trump underwater on the economy for the first time in either of his presidential administrations.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, blasted Trump and his White House as officials say Americans merely need to trust Trump’s instincts on trade as the market takes a nosedive.\n\n“It is insane to me that the stock market has plummeted, economists are sounding the alarm that we’ll plunge head-first into a recession, 900 workers were laid off from Stellantis in Indiana and right here in Michigan and the Trump White House has the gall to call this ‘Liberation Day,’” said Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who announced a bid for an open U.S Senate seat Wednesday.\n\nDespite the polling numbers, most Republicans are maintaining faith in Trump’s trade agenda. They include Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., who said he understands the concerns but trusts Trump to protect West Virginians.\n\n“You've got to grow,” Justice said. “And that’s what I believe our president’s trying to do. I mean, we’re not making anything. We have to grow.”\n\n“Let it play out,” he added. “Let’s see what happens, especially in the next seven days. You’ll see a lot of activity in the next seven days, a lot of different things.”",

      "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today’s edition, our Capitol Hill team explores how Republicans are joining with Democrats in efforts to check President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Plus, Allan Smith dives into the success Democrats have found in elections so far this year.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n— Adam Wollner\n\nLawmakers in both parties ramp up their efforts to rein in Trump on tariffs\n\nBy Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong\n\nThe fallout from President Donald Trump’s aggressive new tariffs has spurred Congress into action, with a growing number of Republicans joining Democrats to express interest in using their power to restrain him.\n\n1. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced a bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., that would reassert Congress’ authority and slap restrictions on the president’s power to levy tariffs.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., praised Grassley for the bill because “he does believe that we’re a coequal branch.” He said he’d vote for it, though it’s unclear if the bill will be brought to the Senate floor.\n\n2. That move came after four Senate Republicans delivered a rare rebuke to Trump on Wednesday evening, joining with every Democrat to pass a measure to revoke his tariffs on Canada. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the author of the resolution, said he’s looking to build on that success with more bills to block Trump’s tariffs.\n\nHe said “many more” than four Republicans were interested in his resolution than ultimately voted for it, predicting that more will come aboard “as the economic reality sets in.”\n\n3. Across the Capitol, senior House Democrats said they were looking to pass a resolution halting Canadian tariffs, similar to what the Senate voted on this week. Since Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is reluctant to show any daylight with Trump, Democrats are exploring an end run around House GOP leaders.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said he would file what’s known as a discharge petition, a legislative tool that would allow supporters to bypass GOP leaders and force a vote on legislation if they can secure 218 signatures. At least one moderate Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he would consider supporting it.\n\nRead more →\n\nStocks plunge: Major U.S. stock indexes on Thursday saw their worst one-day drops since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Rob Wile reports.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 4.8%, while the Nasdaq fell 6% — both their worst since 2020.

The Democrat overperformed in 14 of those 16 contests, including flipping deep-red state Senate districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania.\n\nThose trends continued Tuesday. In Florida, though Republicans comfortably held on to two very pro-Trump House seats, Democrats improved on their margin of defeat in the 1st District by 22 points and by 16 points in the 6th District compared to Harris’ results there last fall.\n\nAnd in the high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race that earned the most national attention of any of the contests held so far this year, liberal candidate Susan Crawford defeated conservative candidate Brad Schimel by 10 points, just months after Trump won the battleground state by less than a point. More than 2.36 million voters turned out in that race, only 300,000 or so fewer than did in the 2022 midterms.\n\nThe election results have injected a jolt of confidence in Democrats, who’ve had little to celebrate since Trump’s win in November and as he and Elon Musk aggressively pursue substantial cuts to federal programs and workforces.\n\nRead more from Allan →\n\n🗞️ Today's other top stories ➡️ Loom-ing pressure: Trump fired at least three National Security Council officials this week after far-right activist Laura Loomer met with the president and expressed dissatisfaction with some members of his national security team.

      "full_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants Americans to see history his way, historians be damned.\n\nOn the one hand, Trump is actively trying to forbid any reevaluation of American racial history, on campuses and in museums, to spare the country any “national shame” for its stained past.\n\nOn the other hand, he is actively rewriting economic history to convince Americans that everything they’ve been taught is wrong and that his jarring new tariff policy won’t be the largest tax hike in American history, as some economists and fellow Republicans argue.\n\nThe accepted version of history, which you might, or might not, recall from Ben Stein’s history teacher in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” is that Congress raised tariffs with the Smoot-Hawley tariff act in 1930 in an effort to “alleviate the effects of the Great Depression.”\n\n“Did it work?” Stein asked the class. “Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work and the United States, sank deeper into the Great Depression.”\n\nBored Kids in the Classroom \"Anyone? Anyone?\": Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)\n\nTrump took the opposite view Wednesday, telling Americans that if only Congress had stuck to tariffs, the Great Depression “would have been a much different story.”\n\nThat Trump should need to goose up the facts to re-educate the population maybe shouldn’t be surprising from the leader of a movement built on a backward-looking promise to make the country “great again.”\n\n“We have a 20th century president in a 21st century economy who wants to take us back to the 19th century,” wrote Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth economics professor, on X.\n\nIrwin is the author of multiple books, including “Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy.” We talked last year, when he gave me a crash course in US tariff history that bore almost no resemblance to what Trump told Americans on Wednesday.\n\nHere’s a look at how Trump described history, with some added context.\n\n“From 1789 to 1913, we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been.” Trump\n\nTrump didn’t say what he meant by “proportionately the wealthiest,” but by any standard definition of the word wealth, he’s not on solid ground.\n\nBy the numbers, the US today is an extremely wealth country, as former Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican, explained on Fox Business as he trashed Trump’s tariff plan.\n\n“For all this discussion about how badly we’ve been abused and ripped off and how terrible it’s been, well, we’re the world’s biggest economy with four percent of the world’s population,” Toomey said. “We have 25 percent of the world’s economic output. We are the biggest agricultural exporter in the world. We – our manufacturing, domestic manufacturing is at an all-time high. We’re doing it with fewer workers, mostly because automation has allowed us to do it much more productively.”\n\nAmericans are wealthy in terms of a standard of living. Most people today have indoor toilets, air conditioning, access to modern grocery stores, vaccines and carry a super computer around in their pocket. Back then, pretty much nobody had any of those things.\n\nThere was no Medicare of Social Security, so older people were left to fend for themselves at a level modern Americans would not understand.\n\n“In the 1880s, they established a commission to decide what they were going to do with the vast sums of money they were collecting. We were collecting so much money so fast, we didn’t know what to do with it. Isn’t that a nice problem to have?” Trump\n\nIt’s not clear what commission Trump is referring to. A tariff commission in 1883 under President Chester A. Arthur recommended lowering tariffs, but was ignored by Congress. The Constitution puts Congress in charge of tariffs, but lawmakers have, over the years, handed much of this authority to the president.\n\nSurpluses of the 1880s probably had more to do with the government being much smaller. Things like Medicare and Social Security, the biggest drain on US tax dollars today, did not exist and the US military, the largest recipient of discretionary funding, was a fraction of what it is today.\n\nTrump has also lionized President William McKinley, who before he was president pushed for the McKinley Tariff, by which Congress raised tariffs in the 1890s. Voters perceived the tariff as benefiting the wealthy and Republicans subsequently lost the House in one of the biggest power swings in US history.\n\nThe Stanford professor emeritus Richard White told me in a Q&A about the Gilded Age that there are structural differences between the country in the 19th Century and the country today that make these comparisons extremely difficult to make.\n\n“One of the things McKinley was trying to do, and the Republicans were trying to do, was to raise the tariff in order to reduce the federal deficit by making the tariffs so high, it would take down tax revenue because they really were worried about the deflation that was coming with the Gold Standard,” White said.\n\n“Now we’re in a very different situation, because now we have great deficits and the idea that the tariff is going to bring in revenue is really not something that’s going to happen,” White added.\n\nIn the 1880s, the US was rapidly industrializing and many other countries, which are industrializing today, were not yet on that path.\n\n“Then in 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government.” Trump\n\nThe reasons for the income tax are pretty simple. Congress tried to establish an income tax earlier in a bill where it tried to lower tariffs, according to the National Archives. But the Supreme Court struck the income tax down. Earlier in US history, an income tax had been temporarily enacted to pay for the Civil War. Enacting a Constitutional Amendment requires the assent of three quarters of states, so this was the will of the majority at the time.\n\nTrump frequently says foreign countries pay tariffs. It’s not true. US importers pay them, but really US consumers and businesses end up footing the bill.\n\n“Then in 1929, it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy. It would have been a much different story.” Trump\n\nHe must be referring here to the aforementioned Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, passed not long after the 1929 stock market crash, according to the National Archives, which notes that historians debate what role the Smoot-Hawley tariff, or already in-place tariffs played in causing or deepening the Great Depression.",

      "full_content": "Photo: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nShortly after noon on Thursday, the staff at Vanity Fair received an email from Condé Nast’s Anna Wintour inviting them to a meeting with editor-in-chief Radhika Jones. To the surprise of almost everyone, including most of the magazine’s senior-most editors, a visibly emotional Wintour announced that Jones would be stepping down after seven years at the post. As Wintour spoke for a few minutes about Jones’s accomplishments, she was seemingly on the verge of tears, according to two sources present. Jones followed up the meeting with a memo in which she said she had accomplished “virtually all” of the goals she had set out to achieve when she started the job in 2017, adding, “I have always had a horror of staying too long at the party.”\n\nIn truth, the party has been over for quite a while. Jones is purportedly leaving of her own accord. She has been privately discussing doing as much since last fall, according to a person familiar with the situation. But, inevitably, rumors are swirling inside One World Trade about whether there’s more to the story, given the long slow slide Vanity Fair (where I used to work) has undergone since its heyday at the top of the magazine industry. “I have to imagine that there were more than enough financial reasons to warrant her leaving,” one Condé staffer said. “We never get good news on the traffic front. It just seems like a constant precipitous decline. We never meet our benchmarks, and there’s just no stated mission or mandate for what we should be doing.”\n\nJones, who prior to leading Vanity Fair was an editorial director of the New York Times’ books department and, before that, a top editor at Time, will stay on until June. Wintour will now have to appoint her successor. If Condé chooses someone within Vanity Fair, executive digital director Mike Hogan will likely be in the mix, as he was last time Vanity Fair was looking for a new top editor after Graydon Carter stepped down. Wintour could also tap a protégé to lead it, like Mark Guiducci, who before joining Vogue ran Vice’s Garage magazine, or Will Welch, a Wintour favorite, who runs GQ.\n\nIn her memo, Jones spoke proudly of her major achievements, such as running the magazine’s “epic party machine,” which includes its vaunted Oscars party, and commissioning Amy Sherald’s painting of Breonna Taylor for the cover. But the mood at Vanity Fair, as at many other Condé publications, has for months been one of general malaise. The weekly features meetings, which Jones used to run but handed over to two of her top editors last year, have been particularly brutal of late — “an astounding dearth of ideas,” as one staffer put it. Condé’s unofficial internal slogan for the past few years has basically been “Do more, but with less!” Now, for the time being anyway, they’ll have to do more with one less editor.",

      "full_content": "Tariff Man. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nExperts’ reactions to President Trump’s big new protectionist push have been mostly negative. From economists, judgments have largely ranged from skeptical to horrified. In the political realm, Democrats have been almost uniformly hostile, while Republicans have generally fallen silent or hoped for the best. From the generally Trump-aligned business community, the glass-half-empty opinion is that the president’s program is so obviously ill advised that he will eventually curtail or abandon it. The glass-half-empty faction is freaking out over its terrible mistake in assuming Trump didn’t mean what he said (over and over) about the need for high permanent tariffs until the end of time.\n\nIf Trump persists in this strategy to build a new Fortress America, the consequences for daily life in this country will determine whether it represents a political catastrophe of historic dimensions, a consolidation of MAGA policies, or something in between. But it’s worth taking a look at public opinion as it existed before “Liberation Day” to determine if the public is predisposed to support or oppose the new universal tariff program before the inevitable international backlash and domestic fallout are known.\n\nFirst of all, Trump’s public standing generally (at least outside his GOP base) is mixed at best and slowly but steadily deteriorating. His job-approval average according to Silver Bulletin is currently at 46.6 percent positive and 49.9 percent negative, or a net minus-3.3 percent. When he began his second term, it was at 51.6 percent positive and 40 percent negative, or plus-11.6 percent. So that’s a 14.9 percent erosion of his popularity in just over ten weeks. Since Trump did not have (and did not pursue) any honeymoon with Democrats, and Republicans remain thrilled with him, much of this deterioration is with the independent voters who were crucial to the 47th president’s 2024 victory. An April 2 Reuters-Ipsos poll, for example, showed Trump deep underwater with independents for a job-approval ratio of 37 percent positive and 59 percent negative.\n\nAt a more general level than tariffs or trade policies, Trump’s job-performance ratings for handling the economy — by general assent the most important issue in 2024 — have been mediocre with ratings on prices and inflation coming in significantly lower. An April 1 Economist-YouGov survey showed a 45 percent to 48 percent approval ratio on Trump’s handling of “jobs and the economy,” which slipped to 40 percent to 53 percent on “inflation/prices.” A March 11 NBC News poll gave Trump a 44 percent approval to 54 percent disapproval job performance rating on “the economy” and a 42 percent approval to 55 percent disapproval rating on “inflation and the cost of living.” Most impressively, a March 31 CBS News survey showed 64 percent of Americans thought Trump’s focus on lowering prices was “not enough.”\n\nAnother potential danger sign on an issue adjacent to the economy has been the deteriorating popularity of DOGE leader Elon Musk, whose profile has become exceptionally high during the first weeks of the Trump administration. The April 2 Reuters-Ipsos survey assessed Musk’s job performance at 39 percent favorable and 57 percent unfavorable (with 43 percent very unfavorable). A March 27 Marquette Law School national poll showed Musk at 38 percent favorable and 60 percent unfavorable (with 46 percent very unfavorable). This is a growing problem for Trump.\n\nDrilling down to public attitudes about Trump’s tariffs, the Washington Post has a good summary of recent data:\n\nA CBS News-YouGov poll last week found 56 percent of Americans oppose “placing new tariffs on goods imported from other countries.” A Fox News poll in March found most registered voters supported tariffs on products from China (55 percent). But the same poll found most opposed tariffs on products from Mexico (56 percent) and Canada (61 percent).\n\nA Post-Ipsos poll in February, the Fox poll and a Reuters/Ipsos poll all found about 7 in 10 saying tariffs will make products U.S. consumers buy more expensive.\n\nThe Fox poll and a separate Marquette poll found majorities saying that tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy. And the Post-Ipsos poll found more Americans saying tariffs would hurt rather than help both U.S. manufacturers and workers.\n\nTo be clear, these not-so-positive assessments are being measured before prices have risen on any of the items affected by Liberation Day. They do not suggest Americans expect a good outcome for Trump’s trade war. And unlike many other aspects of the economy, negative consequences from tariffs imposed by Trump personally with a blare of trumpets can’t and won’t be blamed on his predecessor. It’s his show now.",

      "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nAn adrift Democratic Party received a much-needed jolt of energy this week when Democratic senator Cory Booker took to the Senate floor to speak in protest of the Trump administration’s policies, vowing to hold it for as long as he was physically able. Over the course of 25 hours, Booker railed against the Trump administration’s handling of immigration and education and the looming threats to Social Security and Medicare, urging his fellow Democrats to seize this “moral moment” and, in the words of the late congressman John Lewis, to get into some “good trouble.” Booker’s marathon speech officially broke the record set decades earlier by South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond, the notorious segregationist who took part in a day-long filibuster in protest of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nOne day after his record-breaking speech, I spoke to Booker about why he decided to speak, how his Republican colleagues responded, and where Democrats go from here.\n\nWhat compelled you to do this?\n\nMy constituents and people around the country. People who are hurting as a result of his policies, people who’ve lost health care or have had their Social Security payments undermined by the service cuts that they’re doing, the veterans that are being laid off, the people around the world who, frankly because America is not there, are facing the most incomprehensible horrors. People were demanding that I do more and the demand was sinking into me that even though we were trying — my staff is working, for these last 71 days, working longer hours doing everything we can — it was not enough. As I said in my speech, it was insufficient. Especially after the very contentious fight over the continuing resolution that, I think, left a lot of people just even more discouraged with what Democrats were doing. I just said, okay, I’ve got to think really hard here about other tactics and strategies I could put forward.\n\nYour remarks focused on the impact that the White House’s policies are having on everyday Americans. You shared letters from your own constituents about their concerns. What has the reaction from voters been like?\n\nI mean, that was very important to me. I didn’t want to be one elected leader just talking about another elected leader. I really wanted to elevate the voices of the people affected. I wanted to center their stories. I wanted to try to trigger a more courageous empathy. When people heard these courageous people who would write to me and laid bare their pride, their hurt, their anger, their frustrations, their fears. I mean, those stories were so raw and so real and such a damning indictment of how this administration’s policies over the last 71 days are really affecting people. I’ve just learned that in my whole career — and I’m talking beyond my career in elected office — that speaking from the heart, speaking your own personal truth, is so compelling. And so, that was what we decided to do. A few things shaped the way we organized our official remarks, the ones that were written out. I ended up speaking a lot even away from the binders we’d prepared. But we said, number one, we want to center the voices of Americans who are affected. There were some elected leaders, there were some policy people, think tanks and the like. And then the number-two guiding thing that we said is we want to elevate voices from the right. That we want to quote Republican governors. We want to quote Republican think tanks. We want to talk about everybody from the Manhattan Institute to the Cato Institute and how they themselves are condemning a lot of the actions that are being taken because we didn’t want this to become a call to the Democratic base. No, we wanted to speak to a higher moral calling, to common sense, to the character of our country which, I believe, is far beyond the partisan lines that divide us. I think the character of our country is something that we share in common. It lays the groundwork for our common cause and common purpose.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, one of your Republican colleagues, made a point to congratulate you on Twitter after you broke the Senate record while the White House, unsurprisingly, mocked your speech. What has the response been across the aisle, and has there been anything that’s surprised you?\n\nThis may surprise you, but it has been extraordinarily affirming and really sincere extensions of congratulations, respect, and even comments I would describe as admiring of the physical feat. You saw Lisa’s tweet, but she came up to me at the end and gave me a huge hug. We joked about it today because I was smelling quite ripe, and it was fortifying to me. Senator John Curtis, who was in the chair, slipped me a note beforehand and nobody could see it on TV, but in the chamber, you could see that as I thanked him, he put his hand over his heart and gave me a nod.\n\nI live in a community as a senator where I try to focus on policies and not people. I try to focus on the issues and elevate those, and not demean and degrade other people. I’ve learned that I may have fierce disagreements with you, but if I can find lines of humanity and connection, I can draw upon those at times to get to a compromise. I can draw upon those at times to even get some latitude in getting something done that I might not be able to get done if I didn’t treat people well. And that’s why in the speech, it was important to me to talk about not hating the opposition, about not letting somebody drag you so low as you become what you’re working against.\n\nI saw Curtis on the steps today. It was the first time since I saw him at the end and he kept the parliamentarian’s final instructions to him. He pulled it out and he read it, and he goes, “You know what? I think this is something that I’m going to put in my scrapbook. Would you sign it?” And then when I went to sign it, I saw it had his handwriting on it — in quotes, the words “no hate.” And I looked at that and I knew he wrote that in real time. I said at the end about Strom Thurmond that as much as this segregationist was doing everything he could, not just so nobody like me would serve in the Senate, but that nobody like me would get equality — that moment when I said we shouldn’t hate him, no hate, I think Curtis wrote it down.\n\nI have to say, the journey of 25 hours was healing for me. It was great to be able to confess to my constituents and, indeed my country, that Democrats have made real mistakes. We are where we are because of a lot of mistakes that people made, not just Democrats, but others. It was good to confess to people that I had hit a point where I knew that what I was doing was inadequate. It was insufficient, I think was the word I used. That was important to say on the journey that I took that night towards trying to be someone that is making a difference in inspiring, empowering, encouraging, or even begging all of us to do more in what I believe is a moral moment in our country.\n\nSome have likened your speech to a stunt, pointing out that it didn’t block legislation or a nomination, for example. What were you actually hoping to achieve?\n\nFirst of all, I wanted to take the floor and as I said explicitly, to let us not do business as usual. This is not normal. What we’re seeing is not normal and it’s important for me that we don’t normalize it. And I wanted to take an opportunity to speak directly to the challenges that this nation is facing in the most detailed way possible, to bring before the American people the voices of those who are really suffering and struggling as a result of the decisions this President has made. So, I wanted to disrupt the normal order and center the people in this country who are struggling and try to call to the conscience of the country for all of us to see them, hear them, and do more for them, for each other, for ourselves, for our country.\n\nDo I feel like I achieved our goal of raising consciousness, of breaking through with a really powerful message, and elevating, really breaking through with a powerful message, and the powerful voices of my own constituents? I succeeded far beyond what I thought possible. The fact that hundreds of millions of people on one platform tuned in. Or when I sat down today and my staff started playing me news and the coverage from multiple different countries. The letters I’m getting, from text messages to emails to what I see online when I’m going there — I’m seeing people that are not just saying kind things about me, but I’m seeing people who are showing their new conviction to fight, to stand up, to do what I asked people to do, in the spirit of our ancestors, and one in particular, to cause good trouble.\n\nYour speech comes at a moment when voters are questioning the direction of the Democratic Party, with many feeling as if their leaders are playing it too safe. What can and should the party do to meet the urgency of this moment?\n\nIt’s hard when I hear that. We’re not a homogeneous Democratic Party. I was texting with a state legislator today in Iowa. I communicate regularly with my state attorney general, who’s a Democrat. People treat Democrats and Republicans as homogeneous organizations controlled by one leader. There’s a lot of diversity there. But here in Washington, it’s clear. The Democrats who are in the House and the Senate are faced with legislation that we don’t have the numbers to stop. But that should not stop us from being imaginative, creative in the way that we try to get that legislation stopped. What I mean by that is we did not have the numbers to stop Donald Trump’s attempts to take down the Affordable Care Act, but when we started engaging with other leaders, people around the country to elevate the voices of Americans — when little lobbyists, these beautiful children with disabilities were rolling their wheelchairs around the halls of Congress, when breast-cancer survivors and people with rare diseases were showing up with their medical equipment in tow to talk about preexisting conditions — suddenly, this love army came out from around this country demanding that Democrats and Republicans don’t let this legislation pass. And minds were changed.\n\nSo, this is a moment that demands all of us to figure out how can we be better catalytic agents, so that we may not have the elected leaders to stop something but that we call to something greater, which is the conscience of our country, the moral imagination of a nation, the better angels of the nature of the people that do have the power. I read a lot about John McCain that night because I think he was a profile in courage. I read his whole speech that he gave after he put his thumb down and it was as if he was talking to us in this moment. I know that your question was about this party and that party. But I said during the 25 hours that this is a moral moment. It is bigger than right or left. It is right or wrong and we have to shift our thinking away from traditional politics and start talking about what we stand for and who we are. And when we start with that, it makes it very hard for people to justify taking away health care from 70 million people in Medicaid cuts in order to get more tax cuts that go disproportionately to billionaires. That’s not who we are and I must have repeated that for a dozen or two examples and that’s what I want us to get back to.\n\nAnd as a Democratic Party, as a leader amongst this party, I want our party to learn from its mistakes, to be bolder in its vision, to not define itself by who they’re against, but define themselves by who they’re fighting for, and define themselves not about where we are but what the possibilities are for where we can go. I think it’s time for a new generation in our country. I really do. The baby boomers are slowly leaving the stage, called home by John Lewis. Who’s going to stand up in the next generations, the millennials and Gen Z who are just starting to take official positions of leadership? I want us to dream America anew, redeem the dream that people feel like needs some redemption now. I’m excited about the future. I know we’re in very difficult times. I know what Donald Trump is doing has hurt people already and I know what he intends to do will hurt the character of our country, not to mention people’s health care, people’s retirement security, and more. But I love the fact that in the heat of the painful political times of my parents, what that generation did is not just point at the unacceptable segregation of people like Strom Thurmond, of people like Bull Connor, of people like George Wallace. They also used that moment, that painful moral moment of their generation to go onto a mountaintop and tell America, it is time to dream again. It’s time to think more boldly again. It’s time to use our moral imagination again. That’s the inspiration my parents gave me, and by God, if that’s our inheritance in this generation, we should take some leadership from that, some instruction from that, and yes, fight these tough battles. March, demonstrate, just like our parents did. But never forget to start telling people to stop just looking right or left. It’s time for America to look up again and get our dream back again and inspire some people, so that we can leave the next generation a little bit better, just like my parents did for me.\n\nYou mentioned your mother frequently during your remarks, talking about how she was watching back home in Nevada and sharing your family’s own personal experiences like your father’s battle with Parkinson’s disease. What was it like for her to witness her son making history?\n\nI called all the Las Vegas crew, my mom, her siblings. I think there’s nothing better in this world to give your mom nachas. I don’t know if you know that word, but one of the things I think is a blessing is to make your mother proud. She lived a life of breaking barriers and overcoming challenges and suffering indignities during a whole different generation because she was a woman, because she was Black. My parents were so hard on my brother and I to appreciate the blessings that we had, to never forget what had to happen to have what we have and that we had to pay it back by paying it forward. I know that’s always been the measure my mom has of me, and to hear one of the last voices before I went to bed last night that my mom was proud of me. That meant a lot.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.",

      "full_content": "There’s a lot of sketchy stuff in Lindsey Graham’s so-called budget blueprint. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nTime is running out for House-Senate agreement on a congressional budget resolution necessary to “unlock” a future budget-reconciliation bill, which is the only way to enact Donald Trump’s legislative agenda without any input from Democrats. So Senate Republicans, led by Budget Committee chairman Lindsey Graham, have made a fateful decision. They decided not to bother with a real budget, in the sense of one that would significantly restrain their future actions in cutting or raising taxes or spending. Instead, they adopted a shell resolution in which up to $3.8 trillion in tax cuts is deemed as costing nothing and the budget cuts to pay for the few tax cuts they are willing to commit to are minimal. It’s about as pain free of a “budget blueprint” as you can imagine, given the Trump administration’s determination to vastly cut taxes and spending despite levels of debt and deficit spending that are already deemed unacceptable by Republicans.\n\nThe resolution is fuzzy on what senators are voting on now versus what will ultimately be in the reconciliation bill, as Roll Call reports:\n\nThe measure would punt, for now, on the overall size of offsetting spending cuts, but the text clearly states a preference for a minimum $2 trillion in cuts over 10 years. Given the difficulty of achieving that hefty figure, however, the document provides a huge amount of wiggle room to go lower than that and still meet the Senate’s “Byrd rule” requirements for what can go into a filibuster-proof reconciliation bill.\n\nAnd the draft budget resolution would provide enough fiscal headroom in the Senate to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts that expire after this year, while offering new tax breaks sought by President Donald Trump, such as exempting tips and overtime pay from income tax. The budget appears to carve out room for more than $5.2 trillion in tax cuts overall, including a $1.5 trillion cost ceiling on new provisions that weren’t part of the 2017 law.\n\nIt also would increase the nation’s borrowing limit by as much as $5 trillion — a level designed to give the Treasury enough borrowing authority to get past the midterm elections next year.\n\nThere’s a problem, though: The House passed its own budget resolution in late February that does have real cuts in it (including, almost certainly, Medicaid cuts), that doesn’t pretend tax cuts have no effect on the budget deficit, and that boosts the debt limit a trillion dollars less than the Senate’s. All these differences reflect different GOP factions’ strongly held positions, particularly those of the fiscal hawks in the House Freedom Caucus, who will look for quiet assurances that the reconciliation bill will be a lot more vicious than the Senate’s budget resolution suggests. It’s all very hush-hush and sketchy. Word is Trump himself will be deployed not only to squelch dissent in the Senate but to insist the House accepts the Senate resolution without the kind of changes that could require further votes in the upper chamber. Another major piece of unprecedented deceit is the decision to let the resolution provide vastly different “reconciliation instructions” to House and Senate committees, as though two budgets are actually in play. In a very real sense, there are.\n\nBut the Senate move that was probably the most audacious was Graham’s sudden assertion of the right (previously understood as being exclusively the prerogative of the Senate parliamentarian) to adopt a “current policy” baseline for expiring Trump tax cuts, which makes extending them until the end of time deficit-neutral and thus “free.” Had the parliamentarian ruled otherwise, it could have thrown a major monkey wrench into the entire Trump legislative agenda. Now Republicans are just assuming the answer they want is the right one, and it’s unclear whether the parliamentarian can wrest back that power later on in the process.\n\nFor now, the Senate is on track to adopt its unique and dishonest version of the budget resolution, and the House will then be under pressure to go along with it. All these differences of option between fiscal hawks and “Deficits don’t matter” Republicans won’t go away but will be kicked down the road. In the end, Trump will have to resolve all the problems on highly technical spending and revenue issues that he almost surely doesn’t understand. What he does understand are the dynamics of dominance and submission.",

Protectionism leads nowhere,” the spokesman said. “We urge the U.S. to stop doing the wrong thing, and resolve trade differences with China and other countries through consultation with equality, respect and mutual benefit.”\n\nWATCH — Rubio: Trump Is Going on Offense Against China – “Make It Costly to Be America’s Enemy”:\n\nAn unnamed representative for the Chinese Commerce Ministry also said, “History has proven that raising tariffs will not solve the problems of the United States itself, and will not only harm the interests of the United States itself, but also endanger the global economic development and the stability of the production and supply chain.”\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s protests over tariffs come just days after the U.S. Department of State announced sanctions on six Chinese regime officials in Hong Kong and an unknown number in Tibet over years of human rights abuses in those occupied regions, Breitbart News reported.\n\nGuo denounced those sanctions too, calling them a “vicious attack” on China with “groundless and unjustified” reasoning.\n\nTrump’s full list of reciprocal tariffs on other nations can be found here.\n\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, D.C.

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for “putting his life and career on the line” in overseeing the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation announced Thursday.\n\n“Despite our political differences, it is hard to imagine an act of greater consequence than Vice President Pence’s decision to certify the 2020 presidential election during an attack on the U.S. Capitol,” the Foundation’s Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg said in a statement.\n\n“Upholding his oath to the Constitution and following his conscience, the Vice President put his life, career, and political future on the line,” the pair continued.\n\nThe award, created in 1989, is presented to “public servants who have made courageous decisions of conscience without regard for the personal or professional consequences.”\n\nThe former Republican vice president said he’s “deeply humbled and honored to be the recipient” of the award, which he’ll be presented with in May.\n\n“I have been inspired by the life and words of President John F. Kennedy since my youth and am honored to join the company of so many distinguished Americans who have received this recognition in the past,” Pence said in a statement.\n\nPence broke with his boss President Donald Trump in his decision to not overturn the 2020 election results while he was ceremonially overseeing Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s win on January 6, 2021.\n\nPence later said Trump’s “reckless words” that day, when a mob of the president’s supporters violently breached the US Capitol, “endangered” his family and others at the US Capitol. He ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primary and continued defending his actions on January 6.\n\nPast recipients of the award have been tied to “protecting democracy” against the efforts to overturn the election results, including Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney, Michigan Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, former Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers and Fulton County, Georgia, election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nProsecutors have dropped a charge against a man who Republican Rep. Nancy Mace claimed “physically accosted” her in December, according to recent court filings.\n\nIn December, police charged James McIntyre of Illinois with one misdemeanor charge of simple assault. He pleaded not guilty and was released at the time with a “stay away” order.\n\nIt’s unclear why the charge was dismissed.\n\nMcIntyre said he was “pleased but not surprised” the charge was dropped and called the experience “traumatic” in a statement issued through Illinois state Rep. Kelly Cassidy.\n\n“By falsely accusing me of a violent crime and having me jailed, Congresswoman Mace demonstrated her desire to criminalize anyone who advocates for the needs of our trans youth,” his statement reads.\n\nMcIntyre’s lawyer declined to comment on the matter. CNN has reached out to the US attorney’s office in Washington, DC, for comment.\n\nAsked in December about Mace’s claim, Capitol Police said it received a report from a member of Congress’ office regarding an incident in the Rayburn House Office Building. Officers and agents with the Threat Assessment Section arrested a suspect, charging them with assaulting a government official, the agency said.\n\nMace told law enforcement the person placed their hands over hers and “began to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a hand shaking motion” for a few seconds, according to a police filing.\n\nThe filing also showed she said McIntyre stated “trans youth deserve advocacy” during the shaking motion. Following the interaction in December, Mace posted on X that she was “physically accosted” by “a pro-tr*ns man.”\n\nMcIntyre is the co-founder of the Illinois chapter of Foster Care Alumni and was present to celebrate the 25th anniversary of a law expanding federal support for foster care, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAfter prosecutors dropped the charges, Mace said she “won’t back down.”\n\n“I filed charges, and they were inexplicably ignored. But I will not be. I will not back down. I will not be intimidated. And I sure as hell won’t stay silent,” Mace said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe Imprint first reported the charge had been dismissed.\n\nDespite previously calling herself “pro-transgender rights,” Mace introduced a resolution in November to ban transgender women from using women’s restrooms at the Capitol and filed broader legislation that would apply to every federal building and federally funded school.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker also used a phrase considered a slur to refer to transgender people during a House Oversight Committee hearing in February. Her comments were challenged by Democratic Rep.\n\nGerry Connolly of Virginia, prompting the congresswoman to double down on the slur and respond with, “I don’t really care.”",

      "full_content": "Summary Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to skip next week's Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels.\n\nThe US has been gradually pulling back from the group, which coordinates military equipment delivery to Ukraine.\n\nIn the last administration, the defense secretary or a senior Pentagon official always chaired the group’s monthly meetings, but Hegseth has ceded that role to the UK in recent months.\n\nThe Trump administration has adjusted military support to Ukraine to push Kyiv toward negotiations.\n\nCNN —\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend next week’s meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, marking the first time since the group’s founding three years ago that a senior Pentagon official will not be there to represent the US, officials familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThe US has for months been steadily pulling back from the group, which was founded by former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in 2022 after Russia’s invasion as a way for dozens of countries to streamline the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine to quell Russian military advances.\n\nWhereas Austin or a senior Pentagon official always chaired the group’s monthly meetings, Hegseth has ceded that role to the UK in recent months—even as a senior US general told lawmakers on Thursday that “continuing to assist Ukraine on the battlefield daily” is “very important” when it comes to maintaining leverage over the Russians.\n\nHegseth attended a meeting of the UDCG in February at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where he told allies that the US would no longer be a guarantor of European security and that it was highly “unlikely” that Ukraine would ever join NATO—a comment that, at the time, marked a dramatic shift from the longtime US position that Ukraine would one day join the alliance.\n\nDefense News was first to report Hegseth is likely to skip the meeting next week.\n\nThe Trump administration has turned on and off its military and intelligence support to Ukraine in recent months as a way to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. The US hasn’t imposed any penalties on Russia, even as Moscow has refused to agree to a White House proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and continues to place conditions on even a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea.\n\nRussia also wasn’t on the list of countries the Trump administration announced it is imposing tariffs on this week.\n\nTrump attacked Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly last weekend and threatened tariffs on countries which buy Russian oil, but days later temporarily suspended sanctions on a Russian financier and Putin ally in order to host him for meetings this week in Washington, DC—the first time a Russian official has traveled to DC for such talks since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAs the Russian negotiator, Kirill Dimitriev, was in DC for meetings on Thursday, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the head of US European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe was testifying to Congress that Russia poses a “chronic” and “growing” threat to the US and the west saying Russia is “actively waging a campaign of destabilization across Europe and beyond.”\n\n“Russia’s war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year, has revealed Russia to be a chronic threat, and we see in the future it will be a growing threat, one that is willing to use military force to achieve its geopolitical goals,” Cavoli told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n\n“Further exacerbating this threat from Russia are the deepening partnerships among our adversaries — Iran, the Communist Chinese Party, the DPRK, and Russia itself. And these are increasingly posing a global risk,” he said.\n\nDimitriev and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff met on Wednesday, sources told CNN.\n\nUS and western intelligence officials do not believe that Russia is interested in negotiating a ceasefire deal with Ukraine in good faith, CNN has reported. Moscow still believes it can sustain its war effort and outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.\n\nA senior NATO official reiterated that on Thursday, saying that “Russia still believes that time mostly is on its side.”\n\n“We have had questions for a long time about whether Putin intends to negotiate in good faith,” the official said. Russia is “willing to continue those talks [about mending ties with the US] at the same time that it is delaying and stalling and saying that they can’t accept the US proposals right now, on the actual ceasefire. I think all of that supports the idea that Russia’s goals haven’t changed at all—that right now, what it is trying to do is probably stall for time, make less concessions on the war, and try to instead make progress on sanctions, on Russia’s place in the international community.”",

      "full_content": "Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/Bloomberg/ Getty Images\n\nGive Donald Trump some credit: He is following through, absolutely, on a campaign promise.\n\nWhile few Americans imagined that electing Trump again would make Elon Musk a de facto president, tasked with eviscerating the federal bureaucracy, it was no secret that tariffs would be on the menu if Trump returned to the White House. Tariffs and trade deficits have been a Trump obsession for decades. He could be heard talking them up in the 1980s and 1990s, and he has long romanticized a protectionist economy.\n\nAnd while Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs are unnecessarily punitive and ultimately counterproductive in an inflationary environment, not all of them can be dismissed out of hand. It is true that globalization and free-trade agreements crippled onetime industrial powerhouses in the Northeast and Midwest. The white and Black working classes were punished in cities like Gary and Youngstown and Detroit as manufacturers fled the country and cheap, foreign-produced clothing, toys, and automobiles flooded the market. Joe Biden’s industrial policy targeted China for tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels, and there are plenty of reasons for Trump to continue or even stiffen tariffs on our greatest geopolitical rival. It is true, as his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, recently said, that the American Dream is not merely “access to cheap goods.” The American worker shouldn’t suffer so another export champion overseas can flourish.\n\nOf course, Trump is Trump, and there is no subtlety to his latest tariffs and no sense of proportion. Trump announced a 10 percent universal tariff on all goods — barring certain exemptions — imported into the U.S., beginning April 5. Goods from China were hit with an enormous tariff rate of 54 percent. Japan was taxed at 24 percent, Europe at 20 percent, and there are many more “reciprocal” tariffs, which will take effect on April 9. This morning, a 25 percent tariff on all automobile imports kicked in. Canada and Mexico, already targeted for tariffs, were not a focus of the so-called Liberation Day.\n\nVarious analysts rate these tariffs as among the very highest in American history, surpassing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and rivaling the protectionist regimes of the 1890s. An open question remains how long they will last — or if most of them represent yet another Trump negotiating tactic. Bessent seemed to suggest that the tariffs could be provisional. “One of the messages that I’d like to get out tonight is everybody sit back; take a deep breath; don’t immediately retaliate. Let’s see where this goes,” he said, according to CNN. “Because if you retaliate, that’s how we get escalation.”\n\nIf the tariffs hold, trade wars are coming and life is going to get more expensive, whether American manufacturing glory is restored or not. Inflation could increase, and the economy may, in the short term, tip toward a recession. For the market-conscious Trump, it will be grim times on Wall Street, which wrongly gambled that Trump wasn’t serious about levying heavy tariffs on America’s trading partners. Investors are bound to get more skittish. The postelection stock-market gains have already been wiped out.\n\nThis is the real problem for Trump. His calling card has always been the economy. As Democrats, throughout his first term, fulminated about the state of the Republic, Trump could point to low inflation, low interest rates, and a strong stock market. During Biden’s presidency, Americans felt nostalgia for the pre-pandemic 2010s, and that was Trump’s time in the sun. As much as they may have found his conduct disconcerting, voters believed he could be an adequate steward of the economy. Individual presidents can’t wholly dictate economic conditions, but it’s inarguable that Trump, less radicalized than he is today, did relatively little to destabilize the 2010s’s financial environment. Tariffs were reasonable, the federal bureaucracy was preserved, and the GOP-run Congress failed in its politically toxic bid to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSurveys already show Trump posting poorer numbers on the economy. His strong suit is gone, and it’s probably not coming back — not with tariffs, DOGE, or attempts to gut Medicaid. There is virtually nothing Trump is doing in his second term to improve the everyday reality of working-class people. Mass layoffs of federal employees merely punish those who had stable jobs and make interacting with crucial bureaucracies like the Department of Veterans Affairs all the more challenging. A stiff tariff won’t lower a grocery bill. And if Republicans do follow through on their bid to lower the deficit by slashing Medicaid, which offers health care to some 70 million Americans — plenty of them Republicans in rural areas — the backlash will be severe.\n\nThe bloom is already off the MAGA rose. The Wisconsin Supreme Court race was a devastating outcome for the Trump-Musk wing of the party — at this point perhaps its only real wing — and an indication of where we are probably headed. Democrats and independents are furious and ready to vote against Trump-aligned candidates. Had Elise Stefanik not been returned to her district in the North Country, there’s an outside chance that a special election there could have turned a deep-red seat blue. If Trump is serious about bringing back 1930s- or 1890s-style protectionism to America, he should consult a history textbook and find out what happened to the Republican governments that instituted the tariffs. Neither of them survived, with Herbert Hoover, in the teeth of the Great Depression, giving way to Franklin D. Roosevelt and a Democratic majority that wouldn’t be broken for a generation.\n\nDemocrats have a long, long way to go to reach their FDR-era heights. But Trump, through his chaos, is helping them along plenty.",

His announcement comes just one day after U.S. District Judge Dale Ho officially dismissed the federal government’s pending corruption case against him, which accused Adams of soliciting illegal bribes from foreign nationals in exchange for luxury travel perks.\n\nIn a six-minute direct-to-camera video shared to social media on April 3, Adams said that more than 25,000 city residents signed his Democratic petition, but the drawn-out process of dismissing the case against him made it impossible to mount a reelection campaign for the June 24 primary. The mayor said that while he’s running as an independent, he still identifies as a Democrat.\n\n“I firmly believe that this city is better served by truly independent leadership, not leaders pulled at by the extremists on the far left or the far right. But, instead, those rooted in the common middle, the place where the vast majority of New Yorkers are firmly planted,” Adams said.\n\nAdams once again professed his innocence, but he acknowledged the impact the corruption charges have had on his reputation with New York voters. “I know that the accusations leveled against me may have shaken your confidence in me and that you may rightly have questions about my conduct,” he said. “And let me be clear, although the charges against me were false, I trusted people I should not have, and I regret that.”\n\nThe mayor then turned to the other candidates in the race, urging voters to check their records on addressing their concerns with public safety and rising costs. Without naming anyone directly, Adams said some of his opponents opposed the creation of new housing or the addition of more police officers while advocating for it now in their campaigns. In a not-so-subtle dig against former governor Andrew Cuomo, the current mayoral front-runner, Adams said that some of his challengers “sat at home and did nothing.”\n\n“All the candidates will tell you that they have solutions to all that. You should hear them out. But you should also ask them where they were and what they did over the last four years to address those concerns before they were running for more,” he said.\n\nWhile running as an independent will give Adams more time to make his case to New Yorkers, it’s not immediately clear if his reelection chances will improve. A recent Data for Progress poll showed Cuomo receiving 39 percent of the vote in the first round of ranked-choice voting, followed by Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani with 15 percent and comptroller Brad Lander with 8 percent. Adams trailed behind in fourth place, receiving only 7 percent.\n\nAs news of Adams’s reelection shift spread, the mayor’s mayoral challengers began to weigh in on his decision. In a statement, Mamdani said, “Regardless of what party Adams flees to, New Yorkers deserve better than a self-interested, disgraced mayor who has and always will put his needs before their own.”\n\nBrooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie similarly criticized Adams’s move, invoking Cuomo and the president. ““Let me get this straight. Donald Trump’s doing his best every day to destroy our country. Andrew Cuomo’s trying to use our city for own personal redemption tour. And now Eric Adams… don’t even get me started. This isn’t leadership, this is a circus,” he said.\n\nLander resurfaced an old social media post that predicted that Adams could translate his local success following his 2021 mayoral win to a future Democratic Party presidential nomination. “This aged well,” he quipped.",

      "full_content": "Photo: As Ever\n\nWell before Meghan Markle’s As Ever products launched on April 2, it was clear that confusion was at the heart of her brand. Shouldn’t her jams and teas have gone on sale when her Netflix show launched a month ago? Why is the show called With Love, Meghan while the home-goods line is named after a different sign-off phrase? Should that name be styled “As Ever” or “As ever”? And who, exactly, is Meghan? An expert homemaker graciously sharing her recipe for homemade dog biscuits or a novice eager to learn from her celebrity friends? Real-life fairy-tale princess (okay, duchess) or chill-yet-stylish California girl espousing the joys of Jack in the Box?\n\nI had hoped that the As Ever launch might provide some clarity. Instead, I realized that in addition to being confused about what her whole deal is, Meghan has no idea who I am.\n\nThere’s one thing Meghan does get right about me: I’m a lady who’s highly susceptible to the suggestion that I should slather everything in slightly overpriced raspberry jam. As Ever’s initial collection includes eight products: three teas, honey, raspberry spread, shortbread cookie mix, crêpe mix, and “flower sprinkles.” Each costs a few dollars more than an equivalent product you’d find in Whole Foods; for example, the teas are $12 for 12 sachets and the jam is $9, or $14 if you go for the “keepsake packaging.” But these aren’t outrageous Goop-esque prices.\n\nI can’t speak to the quality of the products or the ordering process, as everything sold out in an hour on Wednesday morning. While that seems like a sign of success, we have no way of knowing if As Ever has sold 50 or 5,000 packages of shortbread-cookie mix.\n\nSo all I could do on launch day was peruse the newly unveiled product information and read a new New York Times profile that takes us “Inside Meghan’s Real Kitchen” (as opposed to the fake one where she filmed the Netflix show). This journey through the Meghan Markle lifestyle brand brought on a mild existential crisis.\n\nEach product page includes an item description and several of Meghan’s “Tips for Enjoyment.” These ping-ponged between insultingly basic and depressingly out of reach. For example, here are Meghan’s ideas for enjoying her “Herbal Peppermint Tea”:\n\nMeghan felt the need to explain (twice!) that tea is prepared by steeping bags in hot water, resulting in a flavorful beverage that can be enjoyed at midday or by a fire. It felt a tad insulting.\n\nBut here are the tips for the “Herbal Hibiscus Tea”:\n\nThis had me reeling. Am I doing enough to create “childhood memories of wonder” for my family? How exactly do I cook down hibiscus tea into a simple syrup? Am I supposed to be hosting virtual happy hours for co-workers I mainly interact with on Slack? Should my loved ones be using clear glass water bottles so they can see the hibiscus-tea ice cubes I lovingly brew, freeze, and add to their drinks each day for a “pop of color”?\n\nNext, I turned to the Times piece for some clarification on whether Meghan wants me to relate to her or aspire to be her. At first it seemed like the former, as she declared that Kraft cheese and Wonder bread make the “best after-school snack”:\n\nAs a self-described latchkey kid, whose parents were divorced, Meghan loved to pick up fast food — Jack in the Box curly fries were a favorite — and go home to watch back-to-back cooking shows on Food Network. “Or I’d go to Grandma Jeanette’s after school,” she said. “She made the best after-school snack: Kraft grilled cheese on white Wonder bread,” Meghan recalled, dreamily. “All that butter.”\n\nYet the As Ever website suggests that after a long school day children should be greeted with freshly made crêpes:\n\nMaybe this is all for Prince Harry’s benefit? The Times reports that when he’s out, Meghan’s kids are mainly eating food handcrafted by the good folks at Tyson and Ore-Ida:\n\nWhen it’s just her and the kids for dinner, she said, she often relies on chicken nuggets, veggie burgers and Tater Tots (the freezer is stuffed with them).\n\nIt’s unclear if Meghan tosses “flower sprinkles” on those tots, or if they’re more of a breakfast garnish:\n\nBy the time I got to the end of the Times piece, I felt like I was annoying Meghan. Don’t I understand her journey from super-relatable mildly famous person to literal royal who is still very relatable?!\n\nBut she is clearly bothered by accusations that she is unrelatable and out of touch. She may be living a fairy tale, but not all that long ago, she was a not-very-famous actress on a medium-popular TV series. She was divorced, in her mid-30s and unsure where her next job or home would be.\n\n“Don’t they know my life hasn’t always been like this?” she said, gesturing at the sweeping views and sleeping dogs.\n\nI’ve consumed a lot of Martha Stewart content and tons of amateur cooking videos on TikTok. I’m fine either way, I just need the Duchess to tell me what she’s going for. When Martha tells me I can make a soufflé as perfect as hers, we both know it’s just a fantasy, and that’s okay. If Meghan truly believes I can replicate her lifestyle because we’re both normal 40-something working women with slightly above-average crafting skills, that’s fine too. What’s stressing me out is Meghan wavering between acting like I’ve never made tea and assuming I regularly throw together Champagne-honey vinaigrette for my ladies’ lunches:\n\nPerhaps it’s not fair to expect Meghan Markle to have a consistent brand identity. Some days I eat fresh-baked muffins with fancy jams, but most mornings I cook my breakfast in the microwave. Hey, maybe “flower sprinkles” would make my Jimmy Dean Delights frozen egg sandwich more joyful! Don’t put me or Meghan in a box! Unless, as Meghan recommended earlier this week, you’re using her jam’s “keepsake packaging” as a “time capsule” to “remember this pivotal moment with me.” For $14, that jam box better contain multitudes.",

      "full_content": "Photo: Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIt’s time to consider the remote possibility that Donald Trump will attempt to violate the Constitution and seek a third term. In a recent interview with NBC News, he appeared distinctly open to the prospect of running again, and The Wall Street Journal reported his attorney had studied the idea in 2023. Whether Trump’s kidding or not, it’s worth pondering the dark logistics of such an endeavor. After all, he did attempt to, quite haphazardly, overturn the results of the 2020 election. How close he genuinely came is up for debate, but he did spur a deadly insurrection at the Capitol. A replay of January 6, at a minimum, should not be ruled out.\n\nThere is a long-standing, if tiring, debate about whether Trump is a fascist. He certainly has authoritarian tendencies and longs for far greater power — whether he can truly attain it in this unwieldy Federalist system remains an open question. Even now, with the malicious new deportation regime and the wanton budget cutting of DOGE, much of what lies before us is distinctly American, as the writer and academic Daniel Bessner recently argued. Trump isn’t the first president to ignore the rule of law or forcibly try to deport legal residents without serious justification. He’s not the first president to flirt with foolhardy imperialism, either.\n\nBut Trump is uniquely unpredictable. George W. Bush never mused about a third term for himself; Bill Clinton once did but made clear it was not allowed under the Constitution. Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he holds political norms in contempt. And the unsettling undercurrent of our current moment — and the American Republic, broadly — is that much of it does rest on these precedents and traditions. If Trump decides never to listen to another federal judge, the judicial branch can’t marshal its own military and arrest him. And if Trump does declare sometime in 2027 that he’s feeling wonderful and would like the unconstitutional third term, what’s to stop him from trying to get it?\n\nLet’s imagine a scenario. Upon announcing at a 2027 campaign rally that he is running again, Trump successfully cows the rest of the Republican Party. If the likes of J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio are deeply ambitious, pining for the presidency themselves, they still defer to Trump. In July or August 2028, the Trump-dominated Republican National Committee renominates him. As is its right, it cancels state primaries or holds them while some nominal anti-Trump opposition is batted away. Come late summer, Trump is the GOP nominee for the fourth straight time. The Democrats declare him illegitimate, but what does it matter? All they can do is run in the election. After a protracted primary fight, they’ve got their own battle-tested nominee. The nominee is ready for Trump.\n\nIn the fall of 2028, it’s difficult to see how Trump, nearing the end of his second term, will be very popular. Approval ratings slide over time, and Americans weary of their leaders. As of now, it doesn’t appear Trump will have a strong hand to play. Inflation persists, tariffs won’t help, and if the Republican Congress slashes Medicaid, there will be a backlash. The economy may boom in a few years, but Americans are, for now, pessimistic. Come 2028, Democrats should have control of the House, assuming a typical midterm wave year and the overperformance Democrats have enjoyed in lower-turnout elections. If Hakeem Jeffries is the speaker, Trump’s legislative agenda is dead on arrival.\n\nCould Trump, attempting his third term, win the Electoral College? Possibly. But a more likely scenario is a version of 2020, where a surge in Democratic turnout dooms him. We can assume, of course, Trump won’t care. He’ll say the election is stolen. He’ll run his old playbook. He’ll declare he wants to remain in the White House and should.\n\nThen the United States will enter a new crisis phase. Trump could refuse to participate in the transition and declare he’ll refuse, on January 20, to vacate the White House. The new Democratic president, in control of the military, would then force Trump out — maybe literally with the MAGA monarch ushered out onto Pennsylvania Avenue. Or consider this scenario, even less likely but worth mulling: Trump does, like the fascist dictators of old, assume absolute control of the military and the so-called deep state. Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Rubio, and the rest are able to install blind loyalists at all levels of the Pentagon, CIA, and FBI. Trump has his own version of the Brownshirts. The new president-elect, a Democrat, comes to the White House without his or her own army. Trump dares the Democrat to come inside, to walk across the lawn. He’s got his shock troops stationed around Washington. Their guns are raised.\n\nThis is the most remote possibility. Trump, at 82, would have to become a far more dominant executive than he is today. Military personnel do have to listen to their commander-in-chief, but they’re also permitted to disobey orders that are blatantly unconstitutional. The federal courts, still not fully under Trump’s dominion, could support them. If Trump’s second administration is more efficient and dastardly than his first, it’s still a long way from imposing a personality cult on the entire federal bureaucracy and military. Xi and Putin are dictators because their nations do not have traditions of democracy or a free press. It is far easier for them to suppress dissent. If Trump wants that kind of control, he’ll need more time — or another country.\n\nWhat’s hardest to imagine is Trump, well into his 80s, successfully governing the U.S. in 2029. This doesn’t mean that the flaws of our Republic aren’t ripe for exploitation or that smarter and younger people won’t rise to power in the future and attempt, on a much more terrifying level, to erode the democracy we have left. Americans should be prepared. In the meantime, Trump will flail about, sometimes meaning what he says and other times clearly not. Whether he’s joking or not right now — arguments can be made for either possibility — it’s worth entertaining his potential for greater lawbreaking. Trump has proved he has few limits.",

      "full_content": "A protest at the U.S. Capitol for equal rights in public accommodations for people with disabilities in 1972. Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIn 1959, a teenage Kitty Cone was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. The daughter of a well-off military family, she discovered that her disability often worked against her family’s wealth and political connections. She attended five different high schools, including the posh Holton-Arms School where her cousins had to carry her up the stairs so she could attend classes. At the Mount Vernon Seminary in Washington, D.C., the headmistress imposed certain rules on Cone: She had to bathe in her housemother’s bathroom under the supervision of an adult even though she couldn’t get out of the unwieldy tub. She improvised and began taking baths in her dorm suite on her own power, but “that was considered disobedience,” she would later say. She also walked down to the hockey field, another infraction. The school expelled her, a decision that humiliated her even though she didn’t think of it as discrimination — and neither did the law.\n\nThe world outside the Mount Vernon Seminary was hardly more progressive. Public schools could, and often did, force students with disabilities into separate classes regardless of their abilities. Businesses were not usually accessible to them, and employers could refuse to hire them. Many were forced into institutions where some were sterilized against their will. Cone came of age in a society that preferred not to think of her at all or, when it did, sought to wipe her out altogether. But Cone, a gay woman in a wheelchair, never surrendered her expectations, or her humanity, to anyone. By the time President Richard Nixon signed the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 into law after vetoing it twice, she had become a professional organizer, and she would soon join the fight for disability rights.\n\nSection 504 of the act barred publicly-funded entities from discriminating against people with disabilities. Yet by 1977, the federal government had not developed the regulations that would allow it to fully implement the law, which forced activists to take dramatic measures. That April, they launched nationwide sit-ins at the offices of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Cone and roughly 100 other demonstrators occupied HEW’s regional office in San Francisco for nearly a month, an effort that may have failed were it not for the participation of Brad Lomax, a member of the Black Panther Party who had multiple sclerosis. The Panthers kept the demonstrators fed, covered the protest in their official newspaper, and paid for Lomax and his attendant to join Cone and others in Washington, D.C., where they confronted top HEW officials. “We will no longer allow the government to oppress disabled individuals. We want the law enforced,” the prominent disability-rights activist Judith Heumann told one representative. HEW secretary Joseph Califano Jr. signed the regulations in the following weeks.\n\nLomax died a few years later, and as one contemporary would later tell the New York Times, “I don’t think that all of his aspirations were fulfilled, even after the demonstration. He really wanted more.” So did the disability-rights movement. In 1990, more than 1,000 activists descended upon Washington to demand passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which banned discrimination in employment on the basis of disability and expanded protections for the disabled in most areas of public life. After a speech, many climbed out of their wheelchairs or cast aside their assistive devices to pull themselves up the steps of the Capitol. The Capitol Crawl was strenuous, and activist Jennifer Keelan-Chaffins remembered years later that she had to stop several times so she could ask for water. Her mother, Cynthia, was arrested the next day as part of a mass demonstration in the Capitol Rotunda. The ADA passed shortly thereafter and President George H.W. Bush signed it into law that July. In a speech, he cited the Civil Rights Act of 1964, adding, “Today’s legislation brings us closer to that day when no Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”\n\nThirty-five years later, the Trump administration has disability rights in its sights. The eradication of so-called “DEI” programs has already reduced accessibility for people with disabilities, as the White House itself made clear in an announcement earlier this month. Trump, it said, had signed a memo removing the “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” precept concerning tenure and promotion within the U.S. Foreign Service. Last week, the Department of Justice removed 11 guidelines that helped businesses comply with the ADA’s public-accommodations requirements. Though the requirements are still in effect, and Trump cannot overturn the ADA by fiat, the news is a warning. The president doesn’t have the constitutional authority to dismantle the Department of Education, either, but he’s ordered the firings of thousands of workers. “I don’t think most Americans recognize how much the Department of Education does for disabled students,” Jess Davidson of the American Association for People With Disabilities tells me. Many of the fired workers handled civil-rights investigations and, Davidson says, without them, disabled students “will fall through the cracks” and potentially suffer abuse.\n\nTrump claimed earlier this month that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who heads the Department of Health and Human Services and who incorrectly believes that vaccines cause autism, would now oversee “special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else.” Nobody knows what exactly that means, and Trump may not, either, but students, parents, and activists all fear cuts to services and the erosion of basic protections that are guaranteed by laws like the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. As the ACLU warned in a recent explainer on its website, “Without the department to enforce these protections, millions of students who rely on IDEA for necessary accommodations, such as specialized instruction and assistive technology, are at risk of losing access to the education they are legally entitled to receive.”\n\nMillions of Americans who cannot work due to their disabilities receive Social Security benefits and they, too, are under threat. Cuts to the Social Security Administration have already led to crashing websites and long wait times as seniors and people with disabilities struggle to reach workers about their benefits. Some field offices have closed, and workers told the Washington Post that they often don’t have the time or the staffing necessary to process complicated benefit cases with any efficiency. Millions of people with disabilities also rely on Medicaid for health-care coverage and in-home care, but proposed spending cuts by Republican lawmakers would jeopardize that lifeline.\n\nEven Section 504 may be in danger. Seventeen Republican-led states sued the Biden administration last year, arguing that updated Section 504 guidelines distorted federal law in order to define gender dysphoria as a disability. The truth is more complicated, says Alison Barkoff, a law professor at George Washington University who helped update the policy. Although the preamble to the new regulations say that gender dysphoria may be considered a disability based on a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the updated rule itself does not mention the condition, a fact that Republican states have ignored in favor of a sweeping demand. “They went on and said, ‘Declare Section 504 unconstitutional,’” Barkoff says. “It’s really breathtaking.” The lawsuit is on pause for now, she adds, but the states have not dropped it, either.\n\nThough the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act had bipartisan support and were signed by Republican presidents, it’s hard to imagine Trump signing either piece of legislation. A more ruthless strain of conservatism always percolated within the party, and now it dominates and threatens the protections that Cone, and Lomax, and so many others once fought to win. At risk is the concept of civil rights itself.\n\nBy the time I was born in 1988, Section 504 had been in place for over a decade and the ADA wasn’t far away. When I began suffering from severe depression at the age of 15, it occurred to me, dimly, that my Christian high school should help me. My parents are conservative, but they sent me to a real psychiatrist. The school was less amenable. When teachers or classmates talked about depression at all, it was to say that any teenager thus afflicted should depend on prayer and preaching, not medication or psychology. The school later expelled me despite my clean disciplinary record, and I could hardly believe my bad luck; I thought my brothers and sisters in Christ would care for me no matter what was going on in my brain. I had never heard of Cone or the disability-rights movement, but the expulsion radicalized me in its own way. This, I thought, was discrimination.\n\nAfter my expulsion, I ended up at a public high school. There, I had something called a “504 plan,” or a set of accommodations undergirded by the Rehabilitation Act, which gave me extra time on assignments and the ability to leave the classroom for short breaks. I was able to graduate and go to college, but I chose a Christian university, and when I was diagnosed with a genetic blood disease during my junior year, I realized that I didn’t want to tell anyone on campus. I’d grown up hearing about Joni Eareckson Tada, a popular Evangelical author and speaker who became a quadriplegic after a diving accident and who campaigns against abortion rights, embryonic-stem-cell research, and IVF. If she was the model, my prospects were limited; I could only be a mascot, not a person. It is a truism to say that the anti-abortion movement wants people like me to be born and will not care for us after the fact, but the argument lingers because it is mostly accurate. I could not pray my way out of a genetic disease — I found no spiritual meaning in it whatsoever. Instead, I had material needs, and the conservative world I lived in told me I had no right to need anything at all. Not health care, not paid sick leave, not even a high-school education.\n\nSome conservative Christians profess what they call a “consistent ethic of life,” which calls for a more robust welfare state in addition to bans on abortion. But they have always been outliers, often within their own churches. Religious schools like the one I attended can discriminate against disabled students because Evangelicals lobbied for an exemption from the ADA. They wanted — and won — the right to bar children and adults with HIV or AIDS from their day cares, schools, and sanctuaries, a carve-out that applies to anyone with a disability. Then there was the matter of finances. Evangelicals, sounding much like secular business owners, said it was simply too expensive to make churches and religious schools accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nThe idea that disabled people might need too much, cost too much, and drain resources better allocated elsewhere is much older than the fight over the ADA, and it has not always been limited to the right wing. Years on, the bipartisan popularity of that basic concern gives it staying power. When Nixon signed the Rehabilitation Act in 1973, he spoke of the need for “fiscal discipline” and “self-sufficiency.” In 1977, Cone and her fellow activists learned that Carter officials had not yet implemented Section 504 in part because they feared the expense. They believed the regulations “just went too far,” she said in an oral history collected in the late 1990s.\n\nEvangelicals would thrill, later, to the “compassionate conservatism” of George W. Bush, who said that the government should have an active role in American life while cutting the very taxes that helped fund it. To Bush and his allies, economic efficiency and benevolent social policy were not inherently at odds, but even their limited vision of charity would soon fall decidedly out of fashion within the GOP. The Tea Party gunslingers had no interest in compassion at all. In 2015, the year Cone died, Trump was taking over the GOP and a decade later, the efforts of conservatives like Eareckson Tada, who lobbied for the ADA, almost look quaint. The day belongs to Trump, who reportedly once said of the disabled, “The shape they’re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.”\n\nA commitment to laissez-faire economics does not make a person a social Darwinist by default, and the term has been popularized by critics to discredit various economic and social theories over the years of its popular use, as the scholar Robert Bannister observed. No one calls themselves a social Darwinist, either, not even Trump’s lieutenant Elon Musk, but the latter’s obsession with efficient public spending and the heritability of IQ provoke bleak comparisons. The historian Richard Hofstadter argued in 1944 that American businessmen saw in Darwin’s theory an opportunity to justify the widespread inequality that enriched them: They had wealth not because of exploitation or greed but because they deserved it. “If the fittest are to be allowed to survive, if the benefits of efficient management are to be available to society, the captains of industry must be paid for their unique organizing talent,” Hofstadter wrote. Those attitudes persist into the 21st century.\n\nAfter Trump first took office, House Republicans introduced a bill that would have made it more difficult to sue businesses for violating the ADA. It failed, but the party wasn’t finished. Later the same year, Republicans attempted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with a bill that would have provided weaker benefits to people with “preexisting conditions,” which sparked dramatic protests from members of ADAPT, a disability-rights group. That bill failed, too, but it belonged to a trend. Keelan-Chaffins, who participated in the Capitol Crawl, said in 2020 that “I kind of feel like we’ve stepped backward a bit,” and her mother added that people “just kind of feel like they don’t have to comply” with the ADA anymore. During the height of COVID, Republican politicians and conservative billionaires like Tim Dunn of Texas urged the Trump administration to prioritize the economy while, in Dunn’s words, allowing the “at-risk population” to “take extreme precautions with support from their communities,” not the government. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce complains that “abusive” ADA lawsuits unfairly penalize small-business owners. In most states, it’s still legal for businesses to pay disabled workers a subminimum wage.\n\nThe reelection of Trump brought us DOGE, and as Elon Musk and his young engineers search for fraud, they spin a familiar tale: Where there is need, there must be waste. Musk has claimed, falsely, that “millions” of dead people are receiving Social Security benefits. Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, tells me that the Social Security Administration’s payment accuracy rate is over 99 percent, and when errors do happen, they’re often caused by paperwork delays. Disabled people who receive benefits aren’t living in luxury, either. Many fall into the “poverty trap,” which happens when “the rules of a program inhibit a person’s opportunities either to work or to otherwise get out of poverty,” Romig explains. To qualify for Supplemental Security Income, an individual with disabilities is subject to an asset limit of $2,000. “And the moment you go over $2,000, if you have $2,500 in your account or something, you lose access to your whole benefit,” she adds. The asset limit has not been updated since 1989. “I think it is very much a poverty threat because there’s a lot of research now on how having at least some kind of financial cushion, or an emergency fund, can really help your situation from spiraling out of control and keep you at a subsistence level of existence,” she says.\n\nSocial Security and Medicaid are popular with voters, but the disabled among them remain vulnerable to the GOP’s social Darwinists. Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, says that Medicaid cuts could threaten the program’s home- and community-based services, which often covers personal and home care for people with disabilities, depending on the state. Most people don’t want to live in a residential or institutional setting, Gross explains. “They’ll be cut off from their communities,” she says. “There’s more abuse in those settings than in community settings, and you just lose a lot of autonomy and choice in your life if you’re put in a residential setting.” That independence is now at risk. “So if states get a big Medicaid cut, like a cut to how much the federal government is giving them to spend on Medicaid, the first place states will cut their own Medicaid spending is HCBS,” she adds, which would jeopardize “one of the most important services the government provides autistic people.”\n\nThe Medicaid cuts as proposed may fund tax breaks for corporations and wealthy households, which the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute recently described as “the clearest legislative priority of the Trump administration and the Republican congressional majority.” There are moral implications to any economic policy, and the abrogation of basic rights and care would plunge millions into uncertainty.\n\nASAN, in a bid to prevent that possibility from coming to pass, is lobbying members of Congress against Medicaid cuts and the Trump administration’s mass layoffs of government workers. “We’re also doing a lot of work to try to empower our community to get more involved in policy,” Gross says. The organization is creating plain-language guides that explain complex policy topics and offers guidelines and scripts that help autistic people contact their representatives. “A lot of autistic people struggle with speaking on the phone or may not be able to speak at all,” she says, so ASAN provides proxy calling where a person will craft the message they want to deliver, and a volunteer places the call for them. “Phone calls are really prioritized over emails and text-based communications in terms of just how Congress works,” she explains. “That’s the way that we’re trying to make sure that all of our grassroots can have their voices heard.”\n\nHours before I spoke to Gross, the Washington Post reported that RFK Jr. had hired David Geier to lead a new government study into the debunked link between vaccines and autism. Geier was disciplined by Maryland regulators in 2011 for practicing medicine without a license, which has not stopped Kennedy from citing his dubious research as part of a crusade against vaccines. But Geier’s problems are far more extensive than his retracted studies. He and his father, Mark, who lost his Maryland medical license in 2012, built a laboratory in their basement and injected autistic children with a prostate cancer drug for years, a treatment they falsely billed as a cure. “The fact that this person has been appointed to run this study just shows that they’re going to really put their thumb on the scale in terms of the results of this study, and that’s going to be terrible for vaccine hesitancy in this country, and people will die as a result,” Gross tells me.\n\nYet the Trump administration and its supporters deny the stakes of their policies. By eliminating “DEI,” they are defending merit; by elevating Geier, or Kennedy himself, they make America healthy again. When they use slurs, they simply exercise their free speech, and anyone who objects is a snowflake. Musk said he is autistic, but he likes to call his critics “retards,” and he is not alone. As one anonymous banker told the Financial Times last year, “I feel liberated. We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pussy’ without the fear of getting canceled.”\n\nSlurs are more than hot air, and Musk uses them to reinforce a revanchist strategy that is as material as it is semantic. Disabled Americans already had to worry about the poverty trap, and now a far-right billionaire wants to kick millions off the socioeconomic ladder into darkness. That he does so while complaining of anti-white bias is no coincidence. Black Americans are likelier than white Americans to have a disability, owing to structural inequalities that Musk and the Trump administration are poised to exacerbate — by design. Lomax, a Black disabled man, spent much of his short life fighting a version of America that is not so distant. To the right wing, “DEI is less ‘white fragility’ and silly posters about ‘white-supremacy culture’ than it is the mere presence of a woman or nonwhite person or disabled or transgender person in any high-skilled, high-status position,” Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times wrote. “And their alternative isn’t some heretofore unknown standard of merit; it is the reintroduction of something like segregation.” Today’s war on disabled people is part of a much older campaign against civil rights for all minorities.\n\nThe integration of people with disabilities into American life only became possible through the restructuring of a hostile society. Autonomy, for the disabled, is not defined by the absence of need but the pursuit of liberation, which means it is about power. It is, as Davidson of the AAPD tells me, “about treating us like human beings.” She adds that we “deserve to be able to speak for ourselves in whatever way we can, for our essential human nature and human desire, to have control over our lives as much as possible to be recognized by the world around us.” Her comment reminded me of a speech by Cone, who, after the 504 sit-in, said that activists had “written a new page in American history.”\n\n“We showed strength and courage and power and commitment,” Cone recalled, adding “that we the shut-ins, or the shut-outs, we the hidden, supposedly the frail and the weak, that we can wage a struggle at the highest level of government and win.” Perhaps it’s time to write another page.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nA wide majority of Americans –– 70% –– oppose impeaching federal judges who are slowing down President Donald Trump’s agenda as the idea continues to gain traction among Republicans in Congress, according to a poll released Thursday morning.\n\nIn addition, 83% say the president must obey US Supreme Court decisions, the Marquette Law School poll found. (That view holds across party lines, including 78% of Republicans, 82% of independents and 90% of Democrats.)\n\nTrump, Republicans and allies like Elon Musk have railed against courts that sided against the administration as the White House pushes a historically aggressive agenda.\n\nAt the forefront has been US District Judge James Boasberg, who has blocked the Trump administration’s ability to use the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport some migrants. Boasberg’s move last month led to Trump calling for his impeachment. Chief Justice John Roberts, in an extraordinarily rare move, rebuked Trump for his comments on March 18.\n\nRoberts’ statement did not mention Trump by name, but it came hours after the president stepped up his attacks on federal judges by specifically calling for Boasberg to be impeached.\n\n“This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nSeveral Trump allies, including Elon Musk, have been calling for weeks to impeach judges amid a slew of preliminary rulings against the Trump administration. Trump’s rhetoric opposing the judiciary has been far more aggressive than during his first term, and the administration’s approach has raised fears of a constitutional crisis.\n\nRepublican members of Congress, responding to the president, have moved to impeach federal judges, who serve lifetime appointments. A Texas Republican, Rep. Brandon Gill, said on social media last month that he introduced articles of impeachment against Boasberg.\n\nImpeaching judges is exceedingly rare, and those resolutions are unlikely to advance.\n\nThe Marquette Law School poll was conducted March 17-27 and surveyed 1,021 US adults, using the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative online panel.

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump just took the greatest political gamble with the US economy of any modern president.\n\nPresidents normally try to do everything they can to avoid upsetting the country’s economic engine and global stability — especially if unemployment is low and growth is ticking over, as it was when he took over from Joe Biden.\n\nBut with his stunning outburst of new tariffs on almost all imports from 185 nations, Trump administered an extraordinary shock that went against the advice of almost every economic expert and the lessons from some of history’s grimmest omens.\n\nHe went with a lifelong belief in the mystical power of making imported goods uncompetitive to boost domestic production. No matter that trade wars tend to end badly and that tariffs are more a feature of the 19th century than the 21st.\n\nIn a surreal appearance in the White House Rose Garden Wednesday, Trump clung onto a big poster that showed new tariff rates as it swayed in the wind. The world saw an unrestrained president in the sole spotlight he adores, hazarding the economic fates of billions of people with an outlandish political bet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nThe biggest political surprise is that Trump — in the name of reviving the economic prospects of post-industrial regions ravaged by the loss of jobs and factories abroad — is about to inflict real pain on Americans.\n\nHe was elected five months ago in large part because voters were frustrated at high prices for groceries and housing after grinding inflation inflicted by Covid-19 and after the Biden administration’s spending helped overheat the economy. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris had few good answers when asked how she’d cut prices. But Trump projected blue-collar solidarity by working the fries station at a Pennsylvania McDonalds.\n\nYet he’s gone all-in on a policy that will make almost everything people buy — from fast food to electronics, cars to new homes — pricier. Poorer people will get hurt more than Trump’s rich friends, as will those who live on fixed incomes and can’t bear to look at their plunging 401ks.\n\nHe told NBC at the weekend that he “couldn’t care less” if the cost of buying cars shoots up. His new tariff experiment suggests that he means it. It’s a staggering piece of political positioning for a billionaire president who heads a Cabinet of fellow billionaires and millionaires.\n\nForeign nations sure to hit back\n\nNo one can predict exactly how this gambit will play out.\n\nAssuming the full range of tariffs are implemented and there are no last minute opt-outs — a possibility that can’t be ignored given Trump’s past reversals — the world is set for a full-scale trade war.\n\nForeign leaders are as subject to political factors as Trump is. And they will be under fierce pressure to hit back at the US for a universal tariff of 10% on almost all nations, plus much higher rates for nations he said are the worst offenders.\n\nIt’s hard to think of a more loyal US ally than Australia. But its Prime Minister Anthony Albanese warned, “This is not the act of a friend.” Foreign reprisals could set up an escalation ladder and make Trump — who always wants to get the last word — feel he’s got no option but to respond.\n\nThe president didn’t explain why it made sense for the world’s mightiest economy to launch a trade war with tiny, troubled nations like Cambodia with a 49% tariff. Or why it’s a good idea to make life even harder for developing countries in Africa. And is he really going to wage economic fights with penguins? The White House tariff list included the tiny Heard and McDonald Islands in Antarctica which are getting hit with a 10% tariff – despite being little more than a haven for seabirds.\n\nThe other great political risk from his new approach — which obliterates the free trade global system the United States spent decades building — is that it’s unlikely Trump will get a short-term political payoff from his wager.\n\nMany analysts believe that it’s a fantasy that manufacturers will decide to build new factories and supply chains in the US as Trump promises they will. But even if they did, the chances of it happening during his term — or even in the third term he’s teasing despite constitutional prohibitions — are very slim.\n\nWhile the tariffs will raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the US Treasury, it’s unclear whether voters will buy into his claim that they will all get compensated for higher prices — an effective new tax — in his promised tax cut bill. And all signs point to a measure, if it passes, that proportionally favors the very rich.\n\nA test of Trump’s brand as defiant businessman\n\nThere is no doubting the audacity of Trump’s big declaration of “Liberation Day” on Wednesday.\n\nFor weeks, he’s made tariff threats and then suggested he’d pull back. His supporters on Capitol Hill voiced the familiar trope that his bluster represented the master chess moves of an unbeatable deal maker. But barring a reversal that would turn into a major political climbdown, given his choreographing of a “historic” turning point for America, Trump is not blinking this time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tries to reach a MAGA hat, on the day of his remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\n“This will be a very big moment. I think you’re going to remember today,” Trump told Cabinet members and congressional leaders. “It’s going to be a day that hopefully you’re going to look back in years to come and you’re going to say, ‘You know, he was right. This has turned out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country.’”\n\nTrump’s sense that he created a turning point is probably right: Some economists predict a return to the kind of trade barriers that caused the 1930s Great Depression will spark a recession.\n\n“This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence,” the president said. For once, Trump’s hyperbole could come back to haunt him.\n\nYet, Trump has an army of faithful voters who share his hatred of experts and establishment economists. His argument that the world is always ripping America off helped him win two elections.\n\nAs he put it on Wednesday, “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.” He added: “American steel workers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen … they really suffered gravely. They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.”\n\nTrump’s two terms are proof that the benefits of globalization are not universally shared. Many of the swing states Trump won in 2016 and 2024 are scarred by industrial decline. Voters there remember promises made to them by previous presidents and think they were lied to.\n\n“In the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsourcers, and special interests and the fake news,” Trump told his audience at the White House — and his supporters sitting at home. “But never forget every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong.”\n\nIf Trump bucks economic orthodoxy and returns prosperity to depressed regions his against-the-grain beliefs will be validated and his legacy will reflect his boldness.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville explained that his constituents still trust the president. “They believe him, and he’s trying something different. We have to have a different game plan.” The Alabama Republican and former Auburn football coach insisted: “We can’t continue to run up the middle; sooner or later, we’re going to have to throw a pass, and that’s what he just did.”\n\nAn opening for Democrats if things go wrong\n\nBut the economic situation is more complicated than a college football playbook.\n\nOne reason why the US has sometimes had smaller tariffs than its rivals is because of the power of the American consumer, the wealth of its own economy and the reasoning that a free trade system in which the United States is the dominant force makes the country even more powerful.\n\nIt’s now going to get much harder for Americans to afford new cars, flat screen televisions and even to fill their grocery carts every week. If prices rise and inflation spikes, consumers could pull back, causing growth to slow into a recession — and the president will have handed Democrats a political gift. Footage of his Rose Garden session will anchor thousands of campaign ads in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 election.\n\nTrump’s trade “Liberation Day” comes at a moment when the turmoil of the last two months may be souring voters on Republicans. In one of the first political tests of Trump’s second term, a liberal candidate easily won a critical election in Wisconsin that decided the political destiny of the state Supreme Court. Chalk up a clear rebuke for Trump and his government-gutting friend Elon Musk.\n\nThe Democratic Party that has struggled to find an effective message against Trump could hardly miss after the pageantry of his tariff party.\n\n“This is a huge tax on American families, all to help billionaires get a tax cut,” Democratic Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nSome Republicans might agree. Four of their number in the Senate tried to send a warning to the president on Wednesday evening, by voting with Democrats on a purely symbolic measure aimed at blocking tariffs on Canada.\n\nBut whether the country is headed over an economic cliff or to the new golden age that he’s promising, his party — and every other American — is going with him.",

      "full_content": "WASHINGTON — Vice President JD Vance told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday evening that he and President Donald Trump are “focused on governing” right now, not on who’s running for president in 2028.\n\nVance said when Trump accomplishes all the agenda items he’s currently focused on, Americans will be clamoring for another Trump term in the White House—but that neither of them are thinking about the 2028 presidential election right now.\n\n“Well, look, I think President Trump is going to accomplish so many great things for the American people, and he already has, but of course, we’re only a few months into this, that I think by the end of his term, the American people were going to say, yeah, we’d love to have a third term of President Trump,” Vance told Breitbart News. “At the same time, President Trump is not focused on politics, and I’m not focused on politics. We’re focused on governing, on actually delivering on the mandate that the American people gave us. So I expect to work with and for President Trump for years to come, not just over the next few years. We’ll see what happens in 2026 and 2028, but I’m focused on doing a good job for the American people right now, and I know that’s what President Trump believes. If we take care of business now, yeah, the American people are going to want four more years of President Trump’s leadership. But we got to deliver first, and that’s what we’re trying to do.”\n\nVance’s comments come after President Trump said in an interview this weekend that he would not rule out seeking a third term in the White House. Trump, who served as the 45th and is currently the 47th president of the United States, is technically term-limited per the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution from seeking a third term as president.\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News this weekend when asked if he would try to run again despite the Constitutional amendment that prohibits it. “But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration.”\n\n“I’m focused on the current,” Trump also told NBC News.\n\nHere’s more from the NBC News story from Kristen Welker and Megan Lebowitz:\n\nWhen asked whether he wanted another term, the president responded, “I like working.” “I’m not joking,” Trump said, when asked to clarify. “But I’m not — it is far too early to think about it.” When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, “There are methods which you could do it.” NBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that “that’s one” method. “But there are others, too,” Trump added. Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded “no.”\n\nIt is hard to see, without another amendment to the Constitution altering the 22nd Amendment, how Trump could run for and win another term in the White House. It is also an understatement to say that amending the Constitution is a notoriously difficult process and unlikely to realistically happen in the timeframe between now and the 2028 presidential election.\n\nWhat’s interesting about this whole thing is that after Trump’s comments to NBC News, the entire political establishment flew into a frenzied furor over the idea, when it’s pretty clear Trump said right from the get-go that he is currently focused on working on the agenda. That’s what Vance is saying to Breitbart News as well, that he and Trump are focused on accomplishing their campaign promises from the last election—they have not even crossed the 100-day mark yet—and this whole uproar seems to have just been a creation of NBC News in its questioning. Nonetheless, now the vice president, thanks to this Breitbart News interview, is on record on the matter as saying he believes in a few years after Trump’s policies benefit Americans, they will be pining for another term of Trump, but he and the president are focused on those policies at this point and not on answering that 2028 presidential election question right now.",

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a deal with the law firm that employs former second gentleman Doug Emhoff, which the president said includes the firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, agreeing to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal services throughout his second term.\n\nIt’s the third example of high-profile firms cutting deals with the White House as Trump has targeted firms that have done work with his perceived political enemies.\n\nWillkie’s pro bono work in recent years has been especially attention-grabbing because it included a defamation win against Rudy Giuliani following his work for Trump after the 2020 election.\n\nThe firm represented two Georgia election workers Giuliani defamed by falsely claiming they switched votes against Trump while ballot counting. The free legal work the firm provided for the women amounted to tens of millions of dollars. After the firm chased Giuliani for a year to give up all his valuable property to compensate the women, Giuliani and the women reached an undisclosed settlement.\n\nEmhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, told Willkie’s leadership he disagreed with their decision to seek a deal with the Trump administration, a person familiar with matter told CNN, telling the law firm they should fight this.\n\nTuesday afternoon, before the agreement was announced, Emhoff participated in an event at Georgetown Law School in his personal capacity where he addressed the matter.\n\n“The rule of law is under attack. Democracy is under attack. And so, all of us lawyers need to do what we can to push back on that,” Emhoff told the students, the person familiar with the matter said. “Us lawyers have always been on the frontlines, fighting for civil rights, for justice. … I love being a lawyer, this is what we do: We fight for people. We fight for what’s right.”\n\nThe firm brought Emhoff on board in January as a partner, saying he works out of both Los Angeles and New York and will focus on advising corporations and others especially in “matters with significant reputational concerns.” Law firms Emhoff previously worked at before Harris became vice president haven’t yet been caught in the crosshairs of Trump’s recent rash of deals with and policies against large American law firms.\n\nTrump said Tuesday the pro bono services would go toward services that he and Willkie support — assisting veterans, members of the military, Gold Star families, law enforcement and other public servants, combatting antisemitism and more broadly, “ensuring fairness” in the United States justice system, according to Trump’s post on Truth Social. The president also said Willkie has affirmed its commitment to “merit-based” hiring by not engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion measures and not discriminating against job candidates based on their political beliefs.\n\n“Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP proactively reached out to President Trump and his Administration, offering their decisive commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession,” according to a statement from the White House included in Trump’s Truth Social post.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, firm chairmen Thomas M. Cerabino and Matthew A. Feldman said the agreement “addresses a $100 million pro bono commitment, access to legal representation to clients across a wide spectrum of viewpoints, and ensuring continued compliance with the law as it relates to our employment practices.”\n\n“The substance of this agreement is consistent with our Firm’s longstanding practices,” the statement said. “The Firm remains committed to serving the needs of our clients, our employees, and the communities of which we are a part.”\n\nTrump made a similar agreement with the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom last week. This comes as Trump has targeted law firms with executive actions limiting their ability to do business with the federal government, including Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which both have ties to former special counsel Robert Mueller. Those two firms have sued the administration to challenge Trump executive orders targeting them and their clients. The firms accused the government of using unconstitutional executive orders to punish or chill speech it doesn’t like.",

      "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Tuesday and welcome to the first major Election Day of the year, with a critical state Supreme Court race in battleground Wisconsin that’s drawn national attention, and two special elections in Florida for deep-red House seats, one of which in particular has made Republicans sweat.\n\nAfter diving into that Florida race yesterday, Steve Kornacki breaks down two key areas to watch in Wisconsin. Plus, our Capitol Hill team looks at how Republicans are bracing for President Donald Trump’s big tariff announcement.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n— Adam Wollner\n\nTwo very different parts of Wisconsin to watch in the state Supreme Court election\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nWhile Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, Democrats and Republicans have both picked sides and are pouring fortunes into their efforts. As the votes are tallied tonight, the ability to claim political momentum amid the upheaval of President Donald Trump’s second term will be on the line.\n\nWhat is being tested, though, is not so much whether large numbers of voters have changed their minds in the five months since the presidential election. When it comes to Trump himself, Wisconsin is an especially polarized state, with three straight presidential elections decided by less than 1 point. More likely, the outcome hinges on whether the pro-Trump side has become more engaged in an election like this than it has been up to this point.\n\nThis is a clear advantage that Democrats have carved out in the Trump era. In stand-alone elections for lower-profile offices, in which turnout is far lower than in races for president or even governor, they’ve had the more motivated set of voters. This has been true in Wisconsin, where the Democratic-backed candidate won the most recent Supreme Court election in 2023 by 11 points. And it has been true nationally, where Democrats have posted a string of wins and overperformances in House special elections the last few years.\n\nThe energy isn’t coming from all corners of the Democratic coalition. Instead, it is concentrated among a largely white set of voters with high levels of education, higher incomes and intensely anti-Trump views.\n\nThey are found in most abundance in college towns and metropolitan areas, but even in places where they are few in number, they’ve been punching above their weight in lower-turnout elections.\n\nOn the flip side, Trump in his three campaigns has generated surge turnout and support from blue-collar, white voters, predominantly in rural and small-town areas. Many of those voters had been on the political sidelines before Trump came along, while others had been voting Democratic. They’ve maintained strong loyalty to Trump but haven’t been as interested in low-profile contests like state Supreme Court races.\n\nTwo particular parts of Wisconsin capture this dynamic starkly and will loom large Tuesday night.\n\nDane County is some of the most demographically fertile ground for Democrats anywhere in the country. Home to both the state capital and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, it has — by far — the highest concentration of college-educated adults in the state. It’s also the fifth-wealthiest county in the state, and with nearly 600,000 residents, it’s the second-most populous. And in lower-profile races like this one, its turnout levels have been the highest of any county.\n\nThen there’s what’s known locally as the “Driftless Area,” a largely rural and small-town swath that extends along and inland of the Mississippi River from the Iowa border to just south of the Twin City suburbs of St. Croix County. The name derives from a lack of glacial coverage tens of thousands of years ago, but politically, the Driftless Area is chock full of white, blue-collar voters who emerged in droves when Trump first ran for the White House in 2016. It is the cultural and political opposite of Dane County.\n\nNow consider what happened in the 2023 Supreme Court election. If we use last year’s presidential race as a benchmark, turnout in Dane County for the 2023 court race was 66% as high. That’s an astronomical sum given the office at stake. And the Democratic-aligned candidate won by 64 points, a much larger spread than Democratic presidential candidates typically enjoy in Dane.\n\nBy contrast, turnout in the 14 counties that make up the Driftless Area was only 51% of the presidential level, meaning that many of those voters who materialized for Trump simply didn’t take part. And without them, the Democratic-backed candidate actually won the Driftless Area, a throwback to the pre-Trump era.\n\nThat encapsulates the challenge for Republicans in Tuesday’s race: Have they found a way to reach pro-Trump voters in places like the Driftless Area and convince them that it’s a test of their loyalty to the president?\n\nRead more: What to watch as Wisconsin and Florida host the first major elections of Trump’s second term, by Adam Edelman, Bridget Bowman, Ben Kamisar and Kailani Koenig\n\nLive coverage: Follow along with live updates from tonight’s elections on our live blog\n\nSome Republicans seek tariff exemptions and express concern over Trump trade war\n\nBy Sahil Kapur, Melanie Zanona and Zoë Richards\n\nSeveral congressional Republicans are publicly voicing concern over the potential for a prolonged trade war and its effect on American farmers as President Donald Trump prepares to announce a new wave of tariffs.\n\nTrump is expected to impose duties as early as Wednesday on imports from other countries in a move that could hit the agriculture community particularly hard. Several GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are seeking last-minute carveouts to blunt the impact of those tariffs.\n\nRep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, told NBC News that he has asked the White House to exempt certain goods that are important to the U.S. agricultural industry, such as fertilizer and peat moss.\n\n“I’ve kind of pointed out the things that I’m hoping” will be excluded, he said. “I talk with anybody who will listen to me. ... They’ve been really good about input.”\n\nThompson also said he hopes Congress won’t need to bail out farmers with an emergency aid package, as it did during the first Trump administration. But, he said, “we’ll be prepared to do that” again if needed.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said exemptions for specific goods are likely to be needed.\n\n“The only thing I can tell you right now is on potash,” Grassley said when he was asked about Trump’s tariffs. Citing the U.S.’s reliance on Canada for much of its potash, Grassley said “we’ll have to ask for” an exemption.\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, indicated a divide between the farming and nonfarming communities.\n\nCole said farmers in his state “export a lot,” so they have concerns about retaliatory tariffs. Those outside the agricultural community, however, are “mostly in favor” of the tariffs, which he said has prompted him to take a “wait and see” approach.\n\nRead more →\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nThe Trump administration carried out mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, aiming to slash around 10,000 full-time jobs from the federal agencies long tasked with regulating food and drugs, and overseeing the nation’s public health policies.\n\nAt least six federal agencies are offering workers a new “deferred resignation” opportunity in the latest attempt by the Trump administration to slash the size of the U.S. government.\n\nThe U.S. government accidentally deported a man to El Salvador due to an “administrative error,” landing him in a notorious mega-jail and leaving him stuck there in legal limbo.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City last year.\n\nNonprofit and Democratic groups filed legal challenges against Trump’s new executive order aimed at overhauling federal elections.\n\nDemocratic officials in 23 states and Washington, D.C., sued the Trump administration over its decision to “abruptly and arbitrarily” terminate $11 billion in federal funds for Covid and other public health projects.\n\nThe administration cut funding to a host of Princeton University research projects, marking the latest Ivy League institution to see its federal backing reduced or revoked.\n\n🗞️ Today’s other top stories 🤷 Shrugged off: Trump told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker over the weekend that he is “not joking” about wanting to seek a third term, which the Constitution prohibits.

Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn March, the government hastily released more than 2000 documents totaling approximately 80,000 pages. Most of what the government released was not new -- in fact, much of what attracted attention on social media and in news reports had long been in the public domain, except for minor redactions, such as the blacking out of personally-identifiable information of CIA sources or employees (names and addresses) that have now been disclosed.\n\nThe newly-declassified versions of these documents did not substantively change what is known about the central Warren Commission finding that Stone has called into question: that Oswald was the lone gunman.\n\nBut they did shed light on details of mid-20th century espionage that the CIA had fiercely fought to keep secret and that are treasure trove for historians and scholars.\n\nRepublican committee members on Tuesday pushed claims, also without evidence, about the investigations into JFK's death, repeatedly getting facts surrounding the probes wrong and even yielding their time to allow witnesses to freely talk about theories rather than asking questions.\n\nIn this May 20, 2024, file photo, Oliver Stone attends the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals in Cannes, France.

It was credited with popularizing conspiracy theories of FBI and CIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination.\n\nThe film was credited by the Assassination Records Review Board as being at least partially responsible for the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. Stone testified before Congress in support of that bill. The act mandated the release of all documents related to the assassination by 2017, though that timeline was delayed several times.\n\nThe movie's release also coincided with an increased degree of public skepticism in the Warren Commission finding that Oswald acted alone.\n\nGallup polling as recent as 2023 has consistently shown that a majority of Americans has consistently believed more than one person was responsible for the assassination. The number believing the official conclusion of a lone gunman saw a sharp decline in the 1970s and 1980s, reaching an all-time low of 10% in 1992.\n\nABC News' Ely Brown contributed to this report.",

      "full_content": "Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough during the first Trump administration. Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photos\n\nThis is a pretty big week in American politics. On Tuesday we’ll see the first special and off-year elections of the second Trump era, and on Wednesday Trump will impose a wide array of new tariffs (an event he calls Liberation Day). But a little-known decision could soon dwarf those important developments in long-term significance. Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough is set to decide whether Congress can treat $4.6 trillion in proposed tax cuts as “free” from the point of view of the budget process. That’s because she is the official referee of what passes muster for inclusion in a Senate budget-reconciliation bill, which cannot be filibustered. Indeed, there is an arcane procedure called a “Byrd bath” (in honor of the late senator Robert Byrd, one of the chief architects of the budget process) through which MacDonough is empowered to rule particular proposed budget provisions in or out.\n\nAs it happens, Senate Republicans very much want to pull a fast one in how the budget bill is put together this year, as NBC News reported:\n\nExtending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in 2017, would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the official nonpartisan scorekeeper. That’s under the “current law” metric that has traditionally been used, as the tax cuts are slated to expire at the end of this year. But Senate Republicans want to use a different scoring method called the “current policy” baseline, which would assume that extending tax cuts costs $0 because they’re already law …\n\nIf the tactic is successful, it would upend long-standing precedent and change the accounting process for current and future lawmakers, with major policy stakes.\n\nThe “tactic,” as NBC calls it, is pretty fundamentally a lie. These tax cuts were initially made affordable under budget rules by utilization of an expiration date. Suddenly wishing away expiration dates makes revenue losses not earlier contemplated magically “free” of any impact on budget deficits. As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explains, this approach creates a sort of perpetual-motion machine where costs are defined out of existence:\n\nA common excuse for using a current policy baseline — which assumes that all temporary policies are actually permanent — is that it better reflects the “reality” of what will happen. However, this argument is nihilistic, ahistorical, and inaccurate.\n\nAssuming anything that is likely to happen will happen effectively assumes Congress has little autonomy or decision-making power and establishes a type of circular logic where any policy that lawmakers want to enact is assumed to be costless because it already reflects “reality.”\n\nNihilistic or not, a whole lot depends on whether MacDonough goes along with the “current policy” scam — not just the tax cuts themselves but the vast and painful budget cuts that Republicans will surely impose to offset them. $4.6 trillion in cuts would almost guarantee big reductions in Medicaid and possible Medicare spending along with massive reductions in the discretionary spending that keeps the federal government functioning, even at the reduced levels being contemplated by Elon Musk’s DOGE. Such a course of action would very much expose the GOP to Democratic claims that its goal is to cut federal programs and services on which lower- and middle-class Americans rely in order to reward Trump’s billionaire buddies and their businesses with tax cuts.\n\nIf, on the other hand, MacDonough does play ball with brand-new rules, it may make Senate Republicans momentarily happy, but it’s unclear the fiscal hawks of the House Freedom Caucus will be willing to go along. And in the longer run, financial markets will see through the gambit, and eventually the Federal Reserve could impose monetary policies designed to offset the real deficit in ways that Trump and congressional Republicans could find very unpleasant.\n\nTheoretically, the Senate could overrule MacDonough or even fire her, though she is a respected nonpartisan figure who has worked under both Republican and Democratic majorities dating back to 2012. Ultimately, the same real-world arbiters of deficits and debt that may disregard “current policy” scoring would look very dimly on an open GOP revolt against the budget rules and their referee.\n\nSo, yes, MacDonough’s decision is likely to be fateful. At stake is nothing less than Donald Trump’s whole legislative agenda.",

Photo: El Salvador Presidency Handout/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nLast month, the Trump administration invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act to place hundreds of Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrants on deportation flights to El Salvador on allegations that they were criminals with extensive gang ties. Though James Boasberg, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued an order for the military flights to be halted as he weighed a legal challenge, the government has continued to transport migrants out of the country to be detained in CECOT, El Salvador’s notorious maximum-security prison.\n\nBut several family members are contesting the allegations against their loved ones, saying they’ve been deported based on faulty information and without due process. While the administration has doubled down on its deportation efforts, reports have emerged that the government is determining gang affiliation in part through an individual’s tattoos or clothing, a clearly imperfect metric. Here, some of the migrants with no reported gang affiliation who have been sent to an uncertain fate.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia\n\nAs The Atlantic reported on March 31, the Trump administration acknowledged in court papers that it had wrongfully sent Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father, to an El Salvador prison despite his protected legal status. “Although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the filing read.\n\nBut on April 4, a Maryland federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must make arrangements to return Abrego Garcia back to the United States, giving the government. According to CBS News, the government has until 11:59 p.m. on April 7 to comply with the order.\n\nAbrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador who fled gang violence and entered the United States in 2011 as a 16-year-old. An immigration judge later granted Abrego Garcia “withholding of removal” status in 2019, which allowed him to stay in the country because he would face a possible risk to his life if he returned to El Salvador.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told The Atlantic that Abrego Garcia has no criminal history and isn’t a member of a gang, as alleged by the federal government. He said Abrego Garcia’s only involvement with the law came in 2019 when he and three other men were detained by police in a Home Depot parking lot in Maryland:\n\nDuring questioning, one of the men told officers that Abrego Garcia was a gang member, but the man offered no proof and police said they didn’t believe him, filings show. Police did not identify him as a gang member.\n\nAbrego Garcia was not charged with a crime, but he was handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the arrest to face deportation. In those proceedings, the government claimed that a reliable informant had identified him as a ranking member of MS-13. Abrego Garcia and his family hired an attorney and fought the government’s attempt to deport him. He received “withholding of removal” six months later, a protected status.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times reports that Abrego Garcia’s family has filed a civil suit urging the government to withhold payments to El Salvador until Abrego Garcia is returned, but the administration’s lawyers have argued that the courts don’t have the jurisdiction to make that order. Vice-President J.D. Vance defended the administration’s action in deporting Abrego Garcia, incorrectly claiming on social media that he was a “convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.”\n\nFranco Caraballo\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to Johanny Sánchez, the wife of Franco Caraballo, one of the many Venezuelan immigrants flown out of the country to El Salvador. According to Sánchez, her husband vanished from ICE’s online detainee locator, and she later learned that he had been deported.\n\nSánchez said her husband had kept up with his mandatory appointments with ICE as his asylum application was being processed, noting that he went to a February meeting at a Dallas office for the agency. She said Caraballo was not a member of Tren de Aragua and believes he could’ve been profiled because of his numerous tattoos, including one of a clock marking their daughter’s birthday.\n\n“He has lots of tattoos, but that’s not a reason to discriminate against him,” she told the AP.\n\nAndry José Hernández Romero\n\nAttorneys for Andry José Hernández Romero, a makeup artist, have said their client was detained and later transported to El Salvador after arriving in the U.S. as an asylum seeker. The New Yorker reports that the 31-year-old, who is gay, fled Venezuela fearing persecution from the country’s government and initially passed a preliminary screening but that officials focused on his tattoos during a physical examination.\n\nAndry denied belonging to any gang. The agent, who asked him about the tattoos, described his “demeanor during interview” as “uncooperative.” A note was added to his file: “Upon conducting a review of detainee Hernandez’s tattoos it was found that detainee Hernandez has a crown on each one of his wrist. The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member.” These crowns, according to the government, were “determining factors to conclude reasonable suspicion.”\n\nHernández Romero was detained for several months and was due for a court appearance in March, but he was deported to El Salvador prior to his hearing. His attorneys have argued that his tattoos are not gang-related. “There is no evidence to believe that he is affiliated in any way with Tren de Aragua and Andry has consistently refuted those claims,” his lawyers wrote, per the Times. “He fled Venezuela due to persecution for his political opinion and his sexual orientation and his tattoos have an obvious explanation that has nothing to do with a gang.”\n\nMervin Jose Yamarte Fernandez\n\nFamily members of Mervin Jose Yamarte Fernandez recognized him in a video showing detainees being transported from a U.S. military flight to the maximum-security prison in El Salvador. He was arrested while working at his job at a Texas restaurant and removed from the country within a day’s time.\n\nHis sister, Jare, told the Miami Herald that her brother joined her in Texas from their home country of Venezuela and that he has no criminal record. Unlike some of the others detained by the federal government, she said her brother has no tattoos owing to their family’s religious upbringing. Though Yamarte Fernandez had moved to the United States in order to send money back home to his wife and child, the family had decided to self-deport because of the Trump administration’s targeting of Venezuelan nationals.\n\n“We came to this country to work and do things right,” she told the outlet. “It’s painful that they blame my brother, and they portray him as a member of the Tren de Aragua. I don’t accept the bad reputation created around my brother.”",

      "full_content": "Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nSince Inauguration Day, party activists have been begging elected Democrats to “do something” to interfere with Donald Trump’s agenda. Senate Democrats had the chance on March 14. They, or at least the ten needed to short-circuit any potential filibuster, decided the “something” involved had unacceptable consequences (a government shutdown they feared they would be blamed for triggering).\n\nThat left the minority party in Congress with no identifiable leverage point until at least the end of the fiscal year on September 30. Nearly everything else Team Trump wants to do legislatively is expected to be dumped into a budget-reconciliation bill that Democrats cannot filibuster or influence because it will be designed to pass on a strict party-line vote, with President Trump personally whipping the congressional GOP (just as he did earlier to pass the spending bill and a budget resolution).\n\nSo what’s a congressional Democrat to do? Make a lot of noise, apparently. Some (e.g., Bernie Sanders and AOC in their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour and Chris Murphy and Maxwell Frost in their Town Hall series) are hitting the road and getting away from Washington to rouse the party faithful directly. But another, New Jersey’s Cory Booker, chose to stay in the Senate and speak against Trump’s agenda “for as long as I am physically able.” Calling the occasion a “moral moment,” Booker, who was not one of the Democrats who caved on the spending bill, took the floor at 7 p.m. Monday and managed to stick it out for over 24 hours. He broke one of those unbreakable records, the legendary Strom Thurmond filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (it’s a nice irony that the old segregationist’s landmark feat of endurance was surpassed by a Black senator!). Booker did not, technically, undertake a filibuster since he is not trying to stop a specific piece of legislation; he is instead trying to dramatize the scope and intensity of the threat that Trump, Elon Musk, and other presidential stooges pose to government as we know it and to democracy itself. Twenty-four hours does provide a lot of time to speak expansively, but the New York Times briefly summarized Booker’s take:\n\n“In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for — from our highest offices — a sense of common decency,” Mr. Booker said in his speech. “These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.”\n\nMr. Musk’s feed on X, his social media platform, was active late into the night, but it made no mention of Mr. Booker or his all-night speech. Neither did Mr. Trump’s Truth Social feed.\n\nAs viewers followed along on Mr. Booker’s official YouTube channel, he quoted from celebrated speeches by Representative John Lewis and Senator John McCain, both of whom have died. At one point, he spent around 30 minutes reading an account by a Canadian citizen, Jasmine Mooney, about her detention in the United States by immigration enforcement officers.\n\nBooker’s McCain reference was part of an extended paean to endangered federal health-care services, notably Medicaid, as CNN reported:\n\nIn his remarks, Booker warned of potential cuts to Medicaid by congressional Republicans and the harm that would cause to his constituents and Americans across the country. …\n\nAt one point, Booker invoked the late GOP Sen. John McCain, reflecting on McCain’s pivotal health care vote in 2017, and drawing parallels to the current moment.\n\n“It is maddening in this country to create greater and greater health care crisis and for us not to solve it but to battle back and forth between trying to make incremental changes or to tear it all down with no plan to make it better, leaving more Americans suffering,” Booker said.\n\nCory Booker is not a stranger to what even his many admirers acknowledge as publicity stunts. A memorable Booker attention-grabber occurred when, as a first-term city councilman in Newark, he moved into a tent in a parking lot outside a squalid housing project to attest to its deterioration and the city’s indifference. He got results and eventually became mayor of the city before winning his first of three Senate elections in 2013. He hasn’t always been successful, though, as reflected in his dismal 2020 presidential campaign that ended before the first contest in Iowa.\n\nAt 55, Booker is young enough to try again if he wishes. But for the moment, he’s just another disempowered Democrat trying to placate angry constituents and activists who may have unrealistic ideas about what a minority party in a governing trifecta regime can actually do to throw sand in the gears of the Trump train. If talk can make them feel better, Booker has become the man with the plan–every hour of the day and night, and every “moral moment.”",

Both Poilievre and Carney are campaigning on the claim that Trump would prefer their opponent win the election, attempting to capitalize on growing anti-American sentiment in the country driven in part by Trump’s “51st state” comments. Bublé’s comments were nonetheless interpreted as defiance against the idea of Canada losing its sovereign to its southern neighbor.\n\n“You guys know I’m a hometown kid – I’m a hometown kid who never left,” Bublé told the audience, “and as I stand here and I look out at my fellow artists … I’m proud to be Canadian.”\n\nBublé attempted to reference a line first popularized by American former First Lady Michelle Obama, asserting, “when they go low, we get high,” which he rapidly corrected. The singer never identified the “they” he was challenging, but continued, “when you love something, you show up for it, and we always will.”\n\n“We will, because we’re formidable, because we’re fearless, because we don’t just acknowledge our differences, we embrace them,” Bublé stated. “Because they don’t just make us stronger, they make us a hell of lot more interesting.”\n\n“We are the greatest nation on earth and we are not for sale,” he concluded.\n\nThe current tensions between Washington and Ottawa began shortly after President Trump won his second term in office. At the time, Trump announced a plan to impose a 25-percent tariff on both Canada and Mexico in response to what he described as an out-of-control crime situation on the northern border and Canada’s failure to stop drug and human trafficking hurting Americans.\n\n“On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,” Trump threatened in November. “This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”\n\nThe prime minister at the time, radical leftist Justin Trudeau, rapidly flew to Florida to discuss the situation with the president-elect. Trump ultimately delayed the tariffs and did not impose them on January 20, but joked that Trudeau was the “governor” of the “state” of Canada, outraging Canadians and eventually dooming Trudeau’s political career. After a decade in power, Trudeau announced in January he would resign, a move largely believed to be fueled by infighting in the Liberal Party over his poor showing with Trump.\n\n“Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,” Trump wrote on social media shortly after Trudeau announced his plan to resign.\n\nTrump has since resumed conversation with Carney, Trudeau’s successor who took power in March after winning the leadership of the Liberal Party in an internal membership election. Trump and Carney most recently spoke on Friday in a phone call that Trump praised as “extremely productive.”\n\n“We agree on many things, and we will be meeting immediately after Canada’s upcoming Election to work on elements of Politics, Business, and all other factors, that will end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada,” Trump wrote, apparently presuming Carney’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump explicitly stated in an interview with Fox News this month that he would prefer Carney win to the conservative Poilievre.\n\n“I think it’s easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal. And maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter to me at all,” Trump said.\n\n“The Conservative that’s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don’t know him, but he said negative things,” Trump said of Poilievre. “So, when he says negative things, I couldn’t care less. I think it’s easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal. And maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter to me at all.”\n\nDespite Trump’s stated preference for and politeness towards Carney, Canadian leftists have attempted to brand Poilievre as the pro-Trump options. Leftist celebrities, most prominently comedian Mike Myers, have embraced Carney.\n\nBublé has openly discussed politics in past interviews but not embraced any particular partisan identity. He was notably a guest on conservative television personality Glenn Beck’s two programs – on CNN and Fox News – in the 2000s, though he did not offer any overt political commentary. Bublé has been a vocal supporter of gay rights, citing in past interviews members of his family who are gay, and once joked it was “sexist” of him to refer to Santa Claus as “buddy” in his version of the Christmas classic “Santa Baby.”\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Bublé described himself as listening “to people like Richard Dawkins and Noam Chomsky on YouTube.”\n\nIn several public instances, when asked about Trump personally, Bublé has offered neither praise nor explicit condemnation.\n\n“I can’t stop the politicians or stupid, uneducated people from thinking and saying and doing stupid things, but I can make a stand, I can talk to you,” he said in an interview with David magazine, “and when I’m with groups of friends or I’m in public places or when I’m with people who I think can use that sense of love and education, I can open my mouth and tell them how I feel. And one at a time, you can change the world like that.”\n\nIn more recent comments in 2023, Bublé lamented that American media was “very conservative” and the country was experiencing a “great divide.”\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

(AP Photo)\n\nNEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Kendrick Lamar, Gracie Abrams, Zoe Saldaña and Nutter Butter are among the nominees for this year’s Webby Awards, recognizing the best internet content and creators.\n\nThe International Academy of Digital Arts & Sciences will announce the nominees on Tuesday, the result of nearly 13,000 entries from over 70 countries. The Associated Press got an early look.\n\nA mullet-filled song about jorts performed by Will Ferrell, Nick Jonas and Jimmy Fallon was nominated for best general music video and film, and it will next face off against Abrams' 20-minute behind-the-music “The Secret of Us.”\n\nThe Generation Alpha phenomenon known as Skibidi Toilet got a nod for the fan multiverse by studio Invisible Narratives, while Donald Duck celebrated his 90th birthday by appearing on “Hot Ones” and earned a nomination for eating spicy chicken wings while steam came out of his mouth.\n\nThe category for top video or film comedy pits Jim Gaffigan, The Onion, the makeover series “Very Important People” and humor from Kai Cenat, Kevin Hart and Druski. They face stiff competition from Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman cracking on each other in a “Tonight” show skit.\n\n“New Heights with Jason & Travis Kelce,” which won two Webby awards last year — including People’s Voice Award for best co-hosts — is back, nominated this time for best podcast video series. Saldaña's appearance on the Netflix podcast “Skip Intro” to discuss her role in the film “Emilia Pérez” earned her a Webby nod for best individual podcast interview.\n\nIn beauty, Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty line faces off against Alexis Bittar's “The Bittarverse,” Byrdie, Retrofête and theSkimm. The language-learning app Duolingo's parody of “The Bear” with its murderous mascot, Duo, got a nod, too.\n\nCynthia Erivo was nominated for an episode of the video series “Celebrity Substitute,” in which she visited a New York City public school to teach elementary students the importance of storytelling. She and Ariana Grande also got nods for their viral “holding space” interview for “Wicked.”\n\nThe awards are selected by the academy, while The Webby People’s Voice Award is voted on by fans around the world. Voting for that award is open now until April 17. Winners for all awards will be announced April 22 and will be invited to a ceremony May 12 hosted by Ilana Glazer.\n\nMedia companies earning the highest number of nominations are NBCUniversal with 24, MTV Entertainment Studios with 18, CNN and National Geographic with 16 each, and tied with 14 are PBS, The Walt Disney Company and The Washington Post.\n\nMatthew McConaughey's Super Bowl ad for Uber Eats that uncovered a conspiracy between football and food made the cut in two categories. Kelley Heyer’s often-copied “Apple” dance to the song by Charlie xcx, and Ogilvy's unhinged commercial for CeraVe with Michael Cera both became elligible for a Webby.\n\nMusic video nominations were handed out to Dua Lipa’s “Illusion,” Megan Thee Stallion’s “Mamushi,” Charli xcx’s “Von Dutch and Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra.” They’ll all face off against Lamar's monster hit “Not Like Us.”\n\nKeke Palmer got two nods — one as the host of her own podcast “Baby, This is Keke Palmer” and another for appearing on “Paging Dr. Chanda.” Oprah Winfrey did the same, netting one for “The Oprah Podcast” and the other for appearing on “The Jamie Kern Lima Show.”\n\nThe 56-year-old cookie brand Nutter Butter went viral in 2024 for hard-to-explain images on TikTok — one looks like a peanut butter crime scene — and landed two Webby nominations. And the popular “SmartLess” podcast earned nominations for best comedy podcast and best co-hosts for Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes.\n\nPodcasts going up against “SmartLess” in the comedy section include “Office Ladies,” “Lovett or Leave It,” “Office Hours Live with Tim Heidecker” and the reigning champ “Las Culturistas with Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang,” which on Monday won a comedy Ambie, an award handed out by The Podcast Academy.\n\n“Pod Save America” is nominated beside “Next Question with Katie Couric” in the best politics podcasts, while “The Pink House with Sam Smith” earned one in the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging category.\n\nAcademy members include writer and actor Quinta Brunson, comedian and writer Amelia Dimoldenberg, Tubi CEO Anjali Sud, Kraft Heinz executive Todd Kaplan, Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez, NFL star Shannon Sharpe, Unilever executive Esi Eggleston Bracey, Wondery CEO Jen Sargent and Hello Sunshine CEO Sarah Harden.",

      "full_content": "Photo: Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n\nFor all the Shohei Ohtani worship or Paul Skenes hype, nothing in baseball breaks through to the broader public like the possibility of a cheating scandal. Think steroids, Pete Rose betting on his own team, or the Astros’ “banging scheme.” Baseball is more amenable to cheating than some other sports, since it doesn’t require — or at least rely upon — superior athleticism, thus making it easy to gain any sort of edge you can around the margins. And the sport feels uniquely vulnerable to the damage cheating can wreak, since fans still hold on to a romantic notion that baseball should be “pure,” despite the fact that it has never been free of rule-bending or outright deception.\n\nSo the minute I saw reports that the Yankees were using a “new” kind of bat, and that they’d used that bat to smash 12 homers and score 36 runs in a season-opening sweep over the Brewers, I knew we were in for it. When a sport is as steeped in lore as baseball is, innovation — whether it’s medical, technological, or just analytical — will always initially be treated as scandalous. Even if it’s not. If you’ve glanced at the news, saw a headline or two, and thought, Those damn Yankees are cheating again, well, here’s a quick FAQ to let you know what’s going on.\n\nSo what are these bats, exactly?\n\nThey’re not made of Vibranium or anything. They’re regular wooden bats, made out of the same kind of trees as every other bat. The difference is their shape. The barrel, or “sweet spot” — a.k.a. the place where hitters try to hit the ball — is simply larger. You know those plastic wiffle-ball bats you owned as a kid, the beginner’s version of which had a comically large section in the middle that made it hard for any 3-year-old to swing and miss? These things? The Yankees’ bats are a very scientific version of those, but adjusted for the Major Leagues.\n\nYes, the Yankees have a literal genius MIT Physicist, Lenny (who is the man), on payroll. He invented the “Torpedo” barrel. It brings more wood - and mass - to where you most often make contact as a hitter. The idea is to increase the number of “barrels” and decrease misses. pic.twitter.com/CsC1wkAM9G — Kevin Smith (@KJS_4) March 29, 2025\n\nThe bats are essentially the invention of an MIT physicist named Aaron Leanhardt, who worked for the Yankees before becoming the Marlins’ field coordinator during the offseason (Note: I am not personally sure what being a “field coordinator” involves.) Leanhardt, in an interview with The Athletic’s Brendan Kuty on Sunday, explained that “it’s just about making the bat as heavy and as fat as possible in the area where you’re trying to do damage on the baseball.”\n\nAre they legal?\n\nOne hundred percent. MLB rules simply say that “bats cannot be more than 2.61 inches in diameter and 42 inches in length.” There is no rule dictating that one part of the bat cannot be thicker than any other part.\n\nWhy didn’t anyone think of this before?\n\nIt’s unclear. Leanhardt wondered the same, saying in the Athletic interview it’s “the nature of our business” that it took so long to innovate. That’s a very nice way of saying, “Baseball people don’t think a lot about bat design.” It’s also possible no one thought it was legal.\n\nIs there a cute nickname for the bats?\n\nOf course. They’re known as “torpedo” bats. This does make one think they will be particularly effective against submarine pitchers.\n\nAre they unfair? Are the Yankees cheating?\n\nFirst off, this weekend wasn’t the first time the Yankees have used torpedo bats. They were in constant rotation throughout spring training, and shortstop Anthony Volpe even used one late in the 2024 regular season. Nobody noticed or cared. So why the uproar now? Because the Yankees went absolute apeshit over the opening weekend, bashing Brewers pitchers all over (and out of) Yankee Stadium, including poor former Yankee Nestor Cortes, who gave up homers on the first three pitchers he threw. Two of those homers came from new Yankees Paul Goldschmidt and Cody Bellinger, both of whom used the torpedo bats. Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Austin Wells also partook and also homered. (Aaron Judge is not a torpedo-bat user, which, it should be said, did not stop him from hitting four homers over the weekend.)\n\nThe Yankees are the only team with access to torpedo bats right now, but it’s not like they’re proprietary or anything. The notion of maximizing the impact of hitting the ball with the barrel of the bat has been a part of bat design since there were bats. “If you were around the clubhouse, all 30 teams, you would see a guy or two that’s adopting a bat that’s kind of fashioned more specifically to their swing,” Orioles batting coach Cody Asche said over the weekend. With the success the Yankees have had so far this season, you can be sure that more and more torpedo bats will start showing up throughout baseball. There is nothing untoward about it, except maybe the team wealth disparity on display: A nice thing about being one of the richest organizations in sports is that you can afford to put an MIT physicist on staff and see if he can big-brain you up something fancy.\n\nAre the bats really making much difference?\n\nIt’s too early to tell. It should be said that Yankees hitters were already good before they used the bats (and of course their best hitter, Judge, isn’t using them). Kevin Smith, a former ballplayer and now an equipment designer, pointed out that “obviously, it’s not going to make you an elite hitter if you aren’t already (I tried). But for the best in the world, any slight advantage could be the difference.” The Yankees hit those homers because they are good baseball players. But Leanhardt, who believes all of baseball will be using the bats in the next five years (which is the sort of thing the guy who invented them would probably say), posits that the bats themselves are all upside: “Ultimately, you’re getting a fatter barrel, a heavier barrel at the sweet spot. So in some sense, you can have your cake and eat it here too. You can get some gains without actually making sacrifices.”\n\nIs there any downside?\n\nYou might want to ask Giancarlo Stanton, who blamed “some bat adjustments” to the torn ligaments in his wrists that landed him on the injured list. Then again, Giancarlo Stanton is always on the injured list.\n\nIs this going to become a whole thing with the Yankees? Are people going to try to credit any success they have to the “juiced” bats?\n\nProbably, but that won’t make those people right. First off, everyone will be using the bats soon (except Judge, apparently), so it won’t just be a Yankees thing. More to the point: There will be a stretch when the Yankees barely hit any homers for, like, a week, and everybody will forget all about this. The baseball season is very long, after all. But for a good juicy topic to kick things off — to get everybody dialed up for a pretend scandal — you couldn’t ask for a better one. Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!",

      "full_content": "Photo: Fabio Lovino/HBO\n\nSaxon Ratliff, the protein-shake–blending, muscle-bound bro at the center of the latest season of The White Lotus, is the man of our moment. Played with impish glee by Patrick Schwarzenegger, Saxon is the sort of young male we’re supposed to care a lot about these days: scornful of political correctness, indifferent to what is happening outside his privileged bubble, definitely voted for Trump. If we could only figure out what makes Saxon tick, if we could only light up some part of his lizard brain that would compel him not to vote for Trump, then maybe everything would be all right. Discovering what Saxon and other young men want has become a veritable holy quest for the liberal press and political class, the skeleton key to saving the Republic. Unfortunately, Saxon’s interests are limited to getting laid, pumping iron, and going to Duke.\n\nOr so it seems. It often feels like the show’s creator, Mike White, is spinning his wheels in this third season, cycling through familiar critiques of the empty materialism of his wealthy and out-of-touch characters, who search for solace and meaning in all the wrong places: sex, money, lorazepam. Nevertheless, through the travails of Saxon, the show has struck upon some devastating psychological territory that shimmers just beneath the discussion of young men and their desires, most notably in a now-notorious scene in which a drug-addled Saxon gets a hand job from his little brother Lochlan during a threesome. This scene has largely been interpreted as the latest example of HBO shocking viewers with depictions of incest — a decadent society’s last sexual taboo — a trick the network has played going back to the first episode of Game of Thrones. But Saxon’s crisis is more significant than that, a glimpse of a larger conundrum for heterosexual males who, in this anti-woke era, are less beholden to women than ever.\n\nWhile Saxon hits on any woman in sight, women are just interchangeable ciphers in a campaign of sexual conquest — picking up chicks, Saxon tells Lochlan, is “a numbers game.” In fact, the person he is really trying to impress is Lochlan, a sensitive boy who is caught in a tug of war between Saxon and their soul-searching sister, Piper, who has come to Thailand to join a Buddhist seminary and escape the suffocating confines of her shallow family. In Saxon’s universe, only men are truly worth wooing — male attention, male recognition, is the prize. The need for such validation naturally extends to his father, Timothy, a smug businessman in serious legal trouble who is Saxon’s whole world. “I’ll always be seen by everyone as Timothy Ratliff’s son, and I’m okay with that, I am, as long as everything at work is going good,” Saxon tells him. Women, in contrast, are the dark side, where manly fulfillment withers and dies.\n\nThe idea that women are an obstacle or a distraction is a hallmark of the so-called manosphere, which differs from the male-exclusive arenas of yore, such as the booze-soaked frat house or the smoky video-game den, in its emphasis on being physically fit and mentally sharp — on becoming your best self. (As Saxon states at one point, he doesn’t take drugs, he is the drug.) The most viral video of 2025 so far involves an extremely jacked wellness influencer named Ashton Hall whose meticulous morning routine includes dipping his face in bowls of ice-cold bottled water and rubbing his cheeks with a banana peel. It is patently, purposefully absurd (the better to tweak the algorithm in its favor) yet also mesmerizing in its heavily ASMR-ed glory. There are many similar videos of chiseled men with torsos as sleek as dolphin skin attending to every facet of their appearance in barely furnished modern apartments. They are cultivating their inner lives as well, meditating in dimly lit rooms and using those beefy arms to jot down their thoughts in journals. All of this seems to be performed for consumption by other men. In a follow-up video, Hall encounters a group of male fans who are stoked to meet him in person and take selfies with him. (“That’s crazy; thank you, bro!”) The only woman we see is a faceless assistant who hands him his slippers and prepares eggs and bacon for him.\n\nThe absence of women is an explicit part of the pitch for the Bali Time Chamber, a White Lotus–esque resort exclusively for men in a “hidden” hilltop location where they can improve themselves and fulfill their potential. If you are a male of a certain age, it is likely that you have been served social-media ads for the resort that proclaim “No junk food, no women, no parties, and no alcohol” over images of shirtless men gnawing Flinstones-size steaks, sparring with each other, dashing up steep inclines, and typing intently on their laptops. “Hundreds of successful businessmen, top-tier athletes, and self-development enthusiasts have already joined the community and completely changed their lives,” the ad says.\n\nIt would be easy to mock these erotically charged videos as ways for straight guys to partake in the pleasures of gay camaraderie without acknowledging the sexual undercurrents — like a Troye Sivan–ian utopia of male flesh except the participants are sucking bone marrow and spending an exorbitant amount of time lacing up their gym shoes. Surely that is a part of it. But there is also a sense that these are safe spaces for heterosexual men to preen and “optimize” and indulge without judgment from women, those harridans who make men feel bad about themselves for being men.\n\nIn a broadly sympathetic profile in The New Yorker of the bro podcasters who dominate the manosphere, young men are presented as being forced by censorious liberals and hectoring feminists into the sculpted arms of Joe Rogan and Hasan Piker. Here, they can finally be among like-minded people — “the contemporary don’t-tread-on-me type who demands both the freedom to have gay friends and the freedom to use ‘gay’ as an insult,” writes Andrew Marantz, as well as the resurrected epithets “retarded” and “pussy.” Or as Piker half-jokingly says, “We’re just here to have fun. And also reach out to the young men out there who are lost — who feel anchorless, rudderless — by lifting some heavy weights.” A producer for Piker’s show, which is politically on the left, says the audience is 60 percent men, on the low side for such fare; the demographic tilt is usually 80 or 85 percent male.\n\nThe new predominantly male space is nowhere more evident than in Trump’s Washington, where his administration is dismantling DEI programs that have allegedly recruited and promoted inferior women (among other historically oppressed people) at the cost of government aptitude and military lethality. The instantly infamous Signal group chat is a window into an executive branch proudly leeched of womanly influence, with the exception of an unidentified female intelligence officer, the practically silent DNI head Tulsi Gabbard, and chief of staff Susie Wiles, who cheers from the sidelines like a soccer mom as the boys bomb Yemen. Mostly, it’s all men all the time, trading fist-bump and fire emoji, talking shit about those “PATHETIC” European freeloaders, and disagreeing with each other in a cagey “my good sir” tone.\n\nI don’t mean to suggest the American war machine would be any less destructive if a few more women had been included in the “Houthi PC small group.” Nor am I trying to censor what young men think or say — as a child of the 1990s, I can assure you that my pals and I used the P-word and the R-word and the G-word (pejorative) more times than Hasan Piker’s posse ever has, and we did it way before those words accrued the rather ridiculous transgressive power they have today. But later we stopped using those words, not because we were forced to by our liberal overlords in the media and the university, or even merely because of shifting cultural norms, but because we grew up. And I would posit that a crucial component of that process was opening ourselves up to women — to their criticisms, their eye-rolling, their pity for our benighted, immature souls. It is so obvious that it shouldn’t bear stating, but maybe these days it does: Self-discovery won’t come from doing handstands on a barbell or masking your mouth with hostage tape before bedtime or receiving constant affirmation of your dumbest prejudices from your favorite parasocial podcasters, but from submitting your intimate self to the terrifying scrutiny of someone other — who, for straight men anyway, is more likely than not going to be a woman.\n\nThat a woman’s perspective might be salutary dawns on Saxon only later in the show, when he develops a crush on a fellow guest, the bright-eyed Chelsea, who sees through him, predicting that in 30 years he will be another rich old man descending on Thailand to hunt for lissome young females. But The White Lotus suggests that this is not the true logical end point for those who live in the manosphere and abide by its diminishment of women, an ethos that brings the contemporary heterosexual man to some pretty interesting existential places. During the fateful threesome, the woman involved with the two brothers is a blur, as hazy as a long-forgotten memory. What is clear is the hand working at Saxon’s crotch and the confused expression on his face — the moment when all this virtual jerking off becomes literal and the dream indistinguishable from the nightmare.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nDemocrats are sounding the alarm over a cluster of recent polls showing that the party’s public image is more bruised and battered than at any point in decades.\n\nThose poor ratings from voters may signal long-term problems for the party if they persist through the 2028 presidential campaign. But the negative reviews probably won’t have nearly as much impact on the upcoming elections in 2025 and 2026 as many analysts in both parties are anticipating.\n\nLooking across recent midterm elections, there’s no evidence that such broad measures of party favorability have influenced the outcome in any consistent way. For instance, the Democrats’ image in most polls was at least as favorable as (and sometimes more favorable than) the Republicans’ in both 2010 and 2014 — and the GOP achieved historic landslides in those midterm elections anyway.\n\nThe best evidence shows that attitudes toward the incumbent president are now exerting far more influence on midterm election results than views about the party out of the White House. What’s more, the historical record suggests the best way for the opposition party to raise its own standing is to weaken the president’s position.\n\nThat means the Democrats’ best chance to recover before 2026 likely depends less on their efforts to refurbish their own image than on their ability to crystallize public discontent with the actions by President Donald Trump and the Republicans who control both chambers of Congress.\n\n“The Democratic party having the lowest negative rating in 30 years has consequence, but midterm elections are about the status of the economy, direction of the country, and presidential approval,” said longtime Republican pollster Bill McInturff. “Trump’s job approval before the election will tell us a lot more about the outcome of 2026 than the rating of the Democratic party.”\n\nThe White House gave a clear sign last week that it agreed when Trump forced an obviously reluctant Elise Stefanik to withdraw her nomination as UN ambassador for fear of losing either her seat or one of the vacant Republican-held Florida seats during special elections this year. Needless to say, for all the teeth-gnashing among Democrats, the White House would not have taken such an unusual step if it believed the other party’s poor image rendered it unelectable in the months ahead.\n\nDemocrats’ ‘deep hole’\n\nFor weeks, Democrats have been rattled by polls showing the party’s public image has hit its lowest point in decades. A recent NBC poll (conducted by McInturff’s firm, Public Opinion Strategies, and a Democratic partner) found just 27% of Americans viewed Democrats favorably, the lowest rating that poll has recorded for the party since 1990. The latest CNN/SRSS poll similarly found just 29% of adults holding a favorable view of the Democrats — also the lowest that survey (and earlier Gallup Polls) had found since 1992.\n\nOne reason Democrats’ ratings have plummeted is that an unusually large share of the party’s own voters are unhappy with it — a reflection of the widespread frustration that the party’s national leadership has not formulated a more effective opposition to Trump. But the Democrats’ decline also reflects brutally low ratings among independents.\n\nAttendees listen to speakers during the Michigan Democratic Party People’s Town Hall in Warren Michigan, on March 29. Rebecca Cook/Reuters\n\nThese dismal readings have inevitably triggered end-is-near style warnings from many Democrats, particularly those who believe the party in recent years has tilted too far to the left. Democrats are “truly in a deep hole,” Ruy Teixeira, a longtime Democratic analyst who has become an unremitting critic of the party, wrote recently. “The party’s severe image, identification, governance, and geographic weaknesses cannot be remedied by mounting the (rhetorical) barricades against Trump and waiting for his administration to self-destruct.”\n\nElection trends in the Trump era indeed offer Democrats plenty of reason for concern about their long-term trajectory. The party has become uncompetitive in what many strategists consider an unsustainably large number of states, and the 2024 presidential results showed substantial movement toward Trump among non-White men and younger White men, as well as some erosion among Latina women. If those geographic and demographic trends harden, Democrats will face an increasingly difficult climb to piece together majorities in the Senate or the Electoral College.\n\nBut history suggests the cries of imminent doom for Democrats significantly overstates the near-term risks the party faces from its weakened public image. In elections through this century, the public’s view of the party outside of the White House has not been nearly as strong a predictor of the results in the midterms as their assessment of the performance of the president and his party.\n\nVoter choices in the midterm are “more a reaction to the party in the White House,” said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. “How people feel about the out-party is probably not that important because if they are not happy with what is going on they are going to blame it on the president’s party and the president, and they are going to vote against them. That’s why the president’s party almost always loses seats.” Indeed, as I’ve written, no president has defended unified control of the White House and Congress through a midterm election since 1978 — the longest such stretch in US history.\n\nAt times, the public’s general attitudes toward the two parties have seemed to presage the midterm results. The clearest example was in 2006, when substantially more Americans in Gallup polling expressed a favorable view of the Democratic Party (52%) than the GOP (37%) — a result that foreshadowed big Democratic gains in both chambers on Election Day.\n\nThe relationship wasn’t quite as direct, but in 2022, the fact that voters were also mostly negative on Republicans (especially after the Supreme Court decision rescinding the constitutional right to abortion) helped Democrats to contain their losses in House elections and gain ground in the Senate, despite the pervasive discontent with President Joe Biden’s job performance.\n\nThe president’s image matters more\n\nBut more often in midterm elections, the relative favorability of the two parties has not been a reliable indicator of the outcome.\n\nIn 2018, for instance, Republicans were viewed favorably by almost exactly as many voters as Democrats in polling by Gallup and NBC that fall, and by only slightly fewer voters than Democrats in CNN’s survey closest to election day. Yet the GOP lost 41 House seats in the election.\n\nIn 2014, the Democrats’ public image was considerably more positive than the Republicans’ in polling that fall from Gallup and what was then the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. But in the election, Democrats lost 13 seats in the House and a crushing nine in the Senate.\n\nThe most dramatic divergence came in 2010. The Gallup and CNN polls that fall showed that the share of voters viewing each party favorably and unfavorably was almost identical; the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll actually put Democrats in a slightly stronger position. Yet on Election Day, Republicans gained six seats in the Senate and 63 in the House — the biggest mid-term gain for either party since 1938.\n\nThe common thread in these consecutive midterm routs was widespread discontent with the president. In Gallup polling, the approval rating for President Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014, and for Trump in 2018, all stood at just 42% to 45%, with most Americans disapproving of their performance.\n\nTo many analysts, those judgments about the incumbent president have become the crucial factor in shaping midterm elections. In exit polls, 85% to 90% of voters who disapprove of the president’s performance now routinely vote against his party’s candidates in House elections, with a comparable share of voters who approve backing his party.\n\nMany strategists believe there’s little reason to expect that will change much in 2026, especially with Trump pursuing such a polarizing conservative agenda. “We are heading into a midterm where Republicans are very much the incumbent party, and if people aren’t happy with what they are doing, and how the country is doing, I think that will matter more than almost anything else,” said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with McInturff’s.\n\nThe Democrats’ path back\n\nIf anything, recent elections strongly suggest that the fastest way for Democrats to rebuild their image is to coalesce public concern about Trump. At other recent points when either party has faced broad public disapproval, it has tended to recover less because of any dramatic changes it made than because voters soured on the other side. In the normal hydraulics of a two-party system, when one party falls, the other tends to rise.\n\nRepublicans, for instance, enjoyed a significant advantage in Gallup over Democrats in party image immediately after President George W. Bush’s reelection in 2004. But amid discontent over the Iraq War and Bush’s attempt to restructure Social Security, Democrats moved to their substantial lead by the fall of 2006.\n\nDemocrats likewise held a big lead in favorability immediately after Obama’s victory in 2008. But amid frustration over the slow recovery from the financial crash of 2008, the bitter controversy over passage of the Affordable Care Act, and a steady decline in Obama’s approval numbers, the parties moved to parity in Gallup polling by fall 2010 (though also with more Americans negative than positive on each). Republicans likewise faced a big deficit after Trump left office in 2021, but moved slightly ahead in favorability by 2022 amid the discontent with Biden (albeit with substantially more voters again negative than positive about each side).\n\nIn each case, the primary means that the party out of power used to redefine itself was opposition to the president’s agenda. In 2010, Mitch McConnell, then the GOP Senate leader, famously said that the party’s highest goal was to make Obama a one-term president.\n\nKen Spain, who served as communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2010, said discontent with Obama opened the door for voters to reconsider Republicans. “Republican favorability had cratered in 2008” as Bush’s second term ended, Spain said. But “in the eyes of voters, Democrats took their eye off the ball — the economy. Within two years, Republican favorability had continued to inch upward, and by the time of the 2010 midterms, the party was once again viewed as a viable alternative.”\n\nDan Sena, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during 2018, described virtually the same dynamic during Trump’s first term. In the DCCC’s private polling, “Going into January of ’17, on every major issue you could think of we were losing to Trump,” Sena said. “Then by August, we had turned them all around.”\n\nDemocrats improved their standing, he argued, initially by pushing back against Trump initiatives that proved unpopular with voters, particularly the tax cuts tilted to the affluent, and the GOP’s unsuccessful attempt to repeal the ACA. “It is important to remember there’s an arc to this, and it takes about six months historically for the resistance to take hold,” Sena said.\n\nA weak public image is hardly without cost for Democrats. Party strategists worry that the low numbers among their own partisans could affect fundraising and the availability of volunteers. Discontent with Democrats likely would not prevent the party from gaining House seats in 2026 if most voters are negative on Trump, but it might reduce those gains, as the GOP’s negative image did in 2022. And if these dismal assessments of the Democrats persist, they would likely represent a greater threat in the 2028 presidential race: The party viewed more favorably in Gallup polling has won every presidential race since 1996, except in 2016.\n\nBut, as Abramowitz noted, the party images in 2028 likely will be shaped less by today’s sparring than by the public’s reaction to their eventual presidential nominees (which may be why party favorability appears to better predict presidential election than midterm results). In the meantime, he believes there’s little chance even Democratic voters frustrated with their leaders will sit out 2026 given their disgust at Trump’s presidency. “Democrats might not be happy with their party, but they still despise Trump,” Abramowitz said.\n\nFighting more forcefully against Trump won’t resolve all the Democrats’ problems with voters. But fanning more doubts about the president may be the party’s indispensable first step toward its own recovery.",

      "full_content": "Judge James Boasberg at the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C., in 2023. Photo: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe Saturday that Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., was assigned the case challenging Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, he was not dressed for the occasion. The case had been filed alongside an urgent motion to prevent the deportation of five people their lawyers feared would soon be disappeared to El Salvador. At an emergency hearing conducted on Zoom that evening, convened to figure out whether judicial intervention was needed to prevent any wrongful deportations, Boasberg had to apologize to everyone present. “I went away for the weekend and brought with me neither a robe nor tie nor appropriate shirt, so thank you all for being appropriately attired and hope you will forgive my casual ones,” he said.\n\nBy the end of the hearing, which was adjourned for about an hour so the government could figure out if any planes carrying migrants had departed, Boasberg made up his mind. “I am prepared to rule,” he said, before proceeding to issue a pair of orders preventing anyone covered by the proclamation from being deported. It was followed by this directive: “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.” He left the details up to the government. “However that’s accomplished, whether turning around a plane or not embarking anyone on the plane or those people covered by this on the plane, I leave to you. But this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.”\n\nThe Trump administration didn’t comply. And in the weeks since, Boasberg and the Justice Department have been in a standoff, with the judge demanding an explanation for why his orders weren’t followed, and the government claiming that once the planes were in the air, there was nothing to be done. “No court has the power to compel the President to return them, and there is no sound basis to read the Court’s minute order as requiring that unprecedented step,” the department wrote last week. On Thursday, Boasberg will hold yet another hearing to get to the bottom of things and potentially determine if holding the government in contempt is warranted.\n\nHow Boasberg rules there, and how the administration responds, will be the first true test of whether the constitutional order that Trump has spent every day of his second term attacking will hold. At a moment when people the nation over are being abducted off the streets or receiving notice that their days here are numbered, without a semblance of even an opportunity to be heard, how Boasberg holds the government to our most basic shared commitments may yet set the tone for the next four years.\n\nTrump has called the judge a “radical left lunatic,” a “troublemaker,” and an “agitator,” to name but a few descriptors the president has used in one of his many Truth Social posts complaining about judges who don’t rule as he would like. Boasberg, who has kept a steady hand over every proceeding and ruling since, appears up for the challenge of judging the administration, applying the same rigor to the case that those who have watched him up close have seen in his more than 20 years as a judge.\n\nTo wit, in a recent ruling he threaded something of a legal needle. Rather than deciding whether courts have the authority to second-guess a president’s invocation of a wartime statute that “lay dormant for 75 years” following World War II, Boasberg — in a studious 37-page opinion that was rich with facts, law, history, and the judge’s own reservations about “a host of complicated legal issues” — boosted Trump in ways that would shock House Speaker Mike Johnson, who all but threatened to defund the court where the judge sits. He fully affirmed that the law the president invoked, the Alien Enemies Act, is constitutional. He did not question that the president has the authority to detain people subject to the law or a proclamation Trump issued earlier this month invoking it. He also noted that none of his court orders thus far, which the Justice Department has fiercely contested and are now at the Supreme Court, prevented the administration from rapidly deporting people who were, in fact, members of Tren de Aragua, the transnational Venezuelan gang Trump targeted with his proclamation. Or that the government couldn’t apprehend other noncitizens who may be subject to Trump’s proclamation. His own orders, Boasberg added, don’t even require a single person to be released.\n\nAfter reviewing the relevant precedents, Boasberg only had one objection: “It follows that summary deportation following close on the heels of the Government’s informing an alien that he is subject to the Proclamation — without giving him the opportunity to consider whether to voluntarily self-deport or challenge the basis for the order — is unlawful.” That’s it.\n\nBoasberg has ordered the administration to explain whether his orders have been violated. In response, the government has done everything but cooperate: It has invoked the state-secrets privilege, essentially telling the judge that he’s entitled to no additional information about the flights he ordered returned; has accused him of misconduct and wants him removed from the case; and has argued that a federal court has no power over how the president exercises his authority abroad. In the coming days, the Supreme Court will have a say on how Boasberg has been ruling and conducting himself in these proceedings so far. Implicit in the Court’s judgment, because the issue is not directly before it, is how the weakest and least dangerous branch deals with the branch that wields executive power, controls the military, and has all the guns and the enforcement authority — and is headed by a president who appears ready to defy it.\n\nThe judges who work at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse, which is right across the Capitol, are not strangers to high-profile political disputes. Because of their proximity to power, they’re accustomed to legal challenges related to presidential authority, government secrecy, the workings of federal agencies, and the relationship between the three branches of government. But over the past four years, another thing set them apart: Together, they handled more than a thousand prosecutions stemming from the January 6 insurrection — arraignments, bail hearings, trials, guilty pleas, sentencings, appeals, you name it.\n\nIn the midst of it all was Boasberg, whose perch as chief judge also gave him visibility into the grand-jury process — a highly secretive endeavor where sometimes witnesses resist subpoenas to testify and choose to litigate them. It was in this capacity that Boasberg ordered former vice-president Mike Pence to testify in the probe led by special counsel Jack Smith. “The bottom line is that conversations exhorting Pence to reject electors on January 6th are not protected,” Boasberg wrote in his 2023 ruling. “There is no dispute in this case that Pence lacked the authority to reject certified electoral votes.” Once Smith secured Trump’s indictment, Boasberg and other judges stood watch in his own packed courtroom as the then-former president was read his charges and pleaded not guilty in front of a magistrate.\n\nA former homicide prosecutor, Boasberg received unanimous confirmation from the Senate when, in 2011, President Barack Obama elevated him from the local Washington court, where he had served for many years as an appointee of George W. Bush, to the federal district court. NBC News recently uncovered a grainy image of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Boasberg’s friend and roommate at Yale Law School, when the two of them sat side-by-side during an investiture ceremony for Boasberg.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who issued an unusual statement noting that impeachment is not the appropriate course when the government disagrees with a judge’s ruling, is also familiar with Boasberg’s work. The chief has hired law clerks who have worked in the judge’s chambers and also appointed him to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which reviews authorization requests for wiretaps and other sensitive methods of foreign-intelligence gathering. In this role, Boasberg oversaw efforts to reform the FBI’s “significant errors and omissions” related to former Trump adviser Carter Page.\n\nNo matter who you talk to in Washington legal circles, you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone with anything bad to say about Boasberg, a native Washingtonian whose close associates call “Jeb” and who, at six-foot-six, is said to cut an imposing figure. More than one person, lawyers and judges alike, have told me that they’re glad that this and other Trump-related controversies have landed in his courtroom and not others’. “Given his credibility across the spectrum,” says one lawyer who practices regularly in the district and appeals courts in Washington, “he’s better equipped to withstand these attacks than many would be.”\n\n“Judge Boasberg is one of the finest judges in the United States, period,” says retired circuit judge David Tatel, who served for nearly 30 years in the appeals court in Washington. “I reviewed his work for years. Some of his decisions might be called conservative. Some of them might be called liberal. But they’re all faithful applications of law to the facts before him.”\n\nIndeed, some of his actions in recent years can be characterized as favorable to Trumpworld. To name but a few examples, Boasberg hasn’t gone as harshly as other judges on people convicted over the Capitol riot, he took a hard stance against FBI lawyers involved in the Page affair, and he once rejected a lawsuit to force the IRS to make public Trump’s tax records.\n\nBy happenstance, Boasberg was again thrust into the spotlight last week for drawing a case challenging the lawfulness of Signalgate — more specifically, to force the Trump administration to preserve every Signal message sent on the app while The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg was an unwitting witness to it all. The judge quickly ordered those messages preserved while the litigation plays out. Once again, Trump is none too pleased. “How disgraceful is it that ‘Judge’ James Boasberg has just been given a fourth ‘Trump Case,’ something which is, statistically, IMPOSSIBLE,” the president wrote. As is with every case filed in the federal court in Washington, the case was assigned randomly.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a Georgetown law professor who has been keeping close track of a number of Trump-related controversies now pending before the Supreme Court, told me that the Venezuelan deportations case Boasberg is overseeing is a touchstone for the rule of law itself. “The Alien Enemy Act case is a flashpoint not only because the legal issues it presents so fundamentally implicate the rule of law in the most elementary sense, but because the Justice Department’s behavior also poses a direct challenge to the ability of even the most principled, well-regarded federal judges to obtain compliance with their mandates,” Vladeck said. “It’s hard to imagine how any other case could so centrally implicate where we are at this moment — and where we’re going.”",

      "full_content": "The intelligence community is the eyes and ears of the White House. Presidents only know what it tells them. The most up-to-date intelligence tells President Donald Trump that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Yet Trump continues to threaten war unless Iran agrees to give up the nuclear weapons program that Washington knows Tehran does not have.\n\nIn March, the new Trump administration received its first Annual Threat Assessment, which compiles insights from the intelligence community. Looking at Iran’s domestic politics, the report says that, “in the past year, there has been an erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public that has emboldened nuclear weapons advocates within Iran’s decisionmaking apparatus.” If true, this development is hardly surprising, given Iran’s increasing vulnerability. The report notes “the degradation to [Iran’s] proxies and air defenses during the Gaza conflict” and the ouster of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who had been an Iranian ally.\n\nNonetheless, the report says that the intelligence community “continue[s] to assess Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and that [Ayatollah] Khamenei has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”\n\nThe findings of the Annual Threat Assessment haven’t had a moderating influence on Trump’s rhetoric, which if anything has become only more bellicose. “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he told NBC News Saturday evening. On March 7, a couple weeks before the Assessment was published, the president had told FOX Business, “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran.” That same day, Trump told reporters, “We’re down to final strokes with Iran…. Final moments. Can’t let them have a nuclear weapon…. Hopefully we can have a peace deal…. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal than the other, but the other will solve the problem.\"\n\nIn the FOX Business interview, Trump revealed that he had sent a letter to Khamenei warning that the alternative to diplomacy was war. Barak Ravid of Axios reported that the letter included a two-month deadline for striking a nuclear deal. “[I]f Iran rejects Trump’s outreach and doesn’t negotiate, the chances of U.S. or Israeli military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities would dramatically increase,” Ravid wrote.\n\nTrump’s threats are disproportionate to, and inconsistent with, the latest U.S. intelligence. And the Annual Threat Assessment is not the first report that has informed Washington that Iran likely isn’t pursuing a nuclear weapon.\n\nA series of reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran was completely and consistently in compliance with its commitments under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—the Iran nuclear deal—up until the time that Trump pulled out of it in May 2018.\n\nThe 2022 U.S. Department of Defense Nuclear Posture Review concluded that “Iran does not today possess a nuclear weapon and we currently believe it is not pursuing one.” In 2023, then-CIA Director William Burns said that “[t]o the best of our knowledge, we don’t believe that the supreme leader in Iran has yet made a decision to resume the weaponization program.” A year later, Burns said, “No, we do not see evidence today that the supreme leader has reversed the decision that he took at the end of 2003 to suspend the weaponization program… We don’t see evidence today that such a decision [to build a bomb] has been made. We watch it very carefully.” As recently as this February, even Trump said that, “There are many people at the top ranks of Iran that do not want to have a nuclear weapon.”\n\nIran has resisted U.S. coercion to negotiate. In February, Khamenei pointed to America’s not honoring the JCPOA and said, “One must not negotiate with a government like the US government. Negotiations with it is not wise, it is not intelligent, and is not honorable.” The next month, Khamenei explained further, in a post on X, why Iran isn’t willing to negotiate. “This same US president tore up the signed JCPOA agreement. How could we hold negotiations with US when we know they don’t fulfill their commitments?”\n\nPrior to Trump’s threats, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had advocated for direct negotiations with the United States, and Khamenei had supported him. Now Pezeshkian insists that Iran “will not yield to foreign pressure.” Earlier this month, Pezeshkian responded to U.S. threats by saying, “the language of threats and coercion is absolutely unacceptable… It is unacceptable for someone to come along and say, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that, or else.’ I won’t come to negotiate with you. Go do whatever the hell you want.”\n\nStill, Iran has said that, though direct negotiations with the U.S. are impossible until “there is a change in the other side’s approach towards” Tehran, the “way is open for indirect negotiations.” Last week on Thursday, after Tehran sent its response to Trump’s letter, Iran’s foreign minister reiterated that, \"Our policy is still to not engage in direct negotiations while under maximum pressure and military threats, however, as it was the case in the past, indirect negotiations can continue.”\n\nTrump, rather than lowering the rhetorical pressure, responded on Friday with one of his most ominous threats yet. While reiterating that his “big preference is that we work it out with Iran,” he told reporters in the Oval Office that “if we don’t work it out, bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran.” The next day, in the NBC News interview, he elaborated on what the “very bad things” would be, threatening Iran with “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”\n\nThe open way to indirect negotiations may have recently become much rockier, and not just because of the president’s harsh rhetoric. On CBS’s Face the Nation, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz seemed to say that Iran would have to give up not only the nuclear weapons program that they don’t have but the civilian nuclear program that they do. Waltz said that the U.S. is demanding “full dismantlement.” Iran, Waltz said, “has to give up its program” and stop “enrichment,” seemingly meaning that Tehran must cease enriching uranium even for civilian purposes. “The full program,” he said, “give it up or there will be consequences.” Waltz added that Iran would also have to give up its “strategic missile program.”\n\nIran is unlikely to negotiate the elimination of its missile program. Especially now, with the degradation of its front-line proxy defense, the missile program is a crucial part of Iran’s defense strategy.\n\nThey are also unlikely to negotiate the elimination of their civilian nuclear program. Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which declares that “Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.”\n\nIt is not clear how threatening Iran with war benefits the U.S. or the world. Iran was in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal that Trump tore up and even today signals some openness to reviving diplomacy. Tehran maintains that it has “never abandoned the negotiating table” and is willing to discuss alleged military aspects of its civilian nuclear energy program. That should be enough, since, according to U.S. intelligence, Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapons program, and according to the NPT, it has the right to civilian nuclear energy.\n\nTrump campaigned against Forever Wars. In his inaugural address, he said his legacy would “be that of a peacemaker” and that his success would be measured “by the wars that we end – and perhaps more importantly, the wars we never get into.” According to the Annual Threat Assessment, Iran presents no pressing need to break that promise mere months into Trump’s second administration. The president says he wants to sign a deal with Iran, but so far, his extreme threats seem to be making that diplomatic goal more difficult to achieve.",

      "full_content": "Fat And Unhappy: How “Body Positivity” Is Killing Us (and How to Save Yourself), by Tristan Justice and Gina Bontempo, Bombardier Books\n\nIf you’re looking for a book that will make you want to wait outside of Coca-Cola’s headquarters in Atlanta with a few liters of soda to dump on an unexpecting executive’s head, go no further: Fat And Unhappy: How “Body Positivity” Is Killing Us (and How to Save Yourself) is that book.\n\nTristan Justice, a reporter for the Federalist, draws on his work writing about the intersection of health, politics, and pop culture, and Gina Bontempo, a writer and mother, draws on her experience as a health and wellness coach to explain why it is so difficult to maintain a healthy weight in America. Together, they share an eye-opening account of how our government, corporations, and scientists colluded to declare what is healthy, unhealthy, and vice versa. But rather than tell readers to just give up and join the so-called body positivity movement, the authors lay out a path to health and healing that can be followed by anyone.\n\n“Our industrialized food supply is killing us,” they write, pointing out that more than 40 percent of the U.S. population is obese. Every person is responsible for his or her own choices, but in a system that sets individuals up for unhealthy lifestyles from childhood, there’s plenty of blame to go around.\n\nSelf-proclaimed traditionalists catch a lot of flak for idealizing a return to the 1950s; Fat And Unhappy also throws cold water on the idea. The decade “saw the invention of high-fructose corn syrup, vitamin-deficient powdered orange juice known as ‘Tang,’ and the near-religious takeover of the low-fat diet craze backed by public health authorities based on discredited science,” Justice and Bontempo write. Our collective health has been on the decline ever since, not just because we’re undernourished and overfed, but because we’re a nation that moves, sleeps, and absorbs sunlight less than ever before.\n\nIn Justice and Bontempo’s view, this isn’t just a byproduct of industrialization. It’s the result of what might be called a corporate conspiracy. Procter & Gamble, the Sugar Association, the list goes on—these interests had products to push, and they used not only misleading advertisements but misleading science to push them. Some of the scientists most closely associated with this era of nutrition guidelines have mixed legacies today. Ancel Keys, who vilified fat but downplayed the negative effects of sugar, was one of the top nutrition experts as the U.S. moved toward industrialized food. (He even appeared on the cover of TIME in 1961.) “Researchers who crossed Keys had their reputations attacked and their funding stripped,” the authors write, comparing Keys to former NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and the results of his research to the damaging coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nKeys died in 2004, but the corporations that supported his research are still raking in cash and have “largely escaped accountability for their role in shaping misguided nutritional guidelines,” the authors write. Even today, prediabetics are told to cook with highly processed vegetable oil rather than with unrefined coconut oil, which naturally contains medium-chain triglycerides that can promote fat loss. Of course, losing weight is not just about looking better. Maintaining a healthy weight can save an individual from a lifetime of chronic illness and medical bills. Big Food and Big Pharma work together to create lifelong customers—and they take seriously any threat to their order, including the possibility of a rogue Health and Human Services secretary like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. At his Senate confirmation hearing in late January, Kennedy uttered a line that sounded like it could have been pulled from this book: “A healthy person has 1,000 dreams. A sick person has only one.”\n\nJustice and Bontempo discuss politics very little, but the unspoken context of their book is the growing politicization of fitness. “Getting fit is great—but it could turn you into a rightwing jerk,” read the title of a June piece published by a Guardian columnist. Kennedy’s endorsement of President Donald Trump brought an entire army of crunchy moms over to the Republican side—no small thing, if a recent report from the New York Times is to be believed. The health of future generations seems like something the left and the right can come together to support, but the food industry and pharmaceutical industry seem to find ways to coopt this vision nearly every time.\n\nJustice and Bontempo are far from the first authors to point out what’s wrong with nutrition in America. They cite research from Nina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet; Robert H. Lustig, author of Metabolical: The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine; and Gary Taubes, author of Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It. Where they start to tread new ground is their reporting on “toxic” body positivity, defining it as a movement that “seeks to eliminate the emotional toll of obesity by demanding the rest of the country normalize and even glorify excess weight.” Justice was even denied a press pass to attend Philly FatCon, a 2023 gathering of pro-fat activists including Joy Cox, author of Fat Girls in Black Bodies, and Sonalee Rashatwar, known online as “The Fat Sex Therapist.”\n\n“The point of the conference was the promotion of far-left activism on social justice, and the organizers placed obesity at the center of it…. None of the conference speakers on the all-women lineup built their profiles by raising the red flag on obesity. They all made money on raising the white one,” Justice and Bontempo write.\n\nSo who’s funding the body positivity movement? All it takes is a little digging to realize that when skincare brand Dove launches a “Campaign for Size Freedom,” it’s actually acting in the interest of parent company Unilever, one of the top ice cream manufacturers in the United States. Companies like Dove act in tandem with fat-positive activists like Virgie Tovar to get the stamp of approval from this new social justice spinoff. Unfortunately, average Americans using social media unknowingly encounter this propaganda. They’re bombarded with videos from dietitians funded by the food industry who recommend soda and packaged snacks but never restricting unhealthy foods. In fact, some of the influencers who dole out health “advice” online refuse to even classify foods as “good” or “bad” because “diet culture, fatphobia, and systems of oppression have created false hierarchies of food” (yes, this is a direct quote from a so-called nutritionist cited by Justice and Bontempo).\n\nYou can’t discuss America’s obesity problem without the mention of another “o” word: Ozempic. Ozempic, Wegovy, semaglutide—the injection goes by many names, and an estimated one in eight Americans have tried some form of the prescription drug, according to a May KFF Health Tracking poll. Opposition to Ozempic is creating some strange bedfellows. Fat-positive influencers proclaim that such drugs only feed into fatphobia. Junk food manufacturers worry they’ll lose customers as Ozempic causes more Americans to lose their appetites. Opponents of Big Pharma point out that weight-loss injections can come with nasty side effects. Justice and Bontempo make it clear what side they come out on: “[I]f there were ever a drug perfectly engineered to capitalize on obesity without actually solving the problem, it would be Ozempic…. Most [patients] find they gain even more weight back once they’re off the Ozempic regimen.”\n\nFortunately, Justice and Bontempo don’t leave readers without hope. In a rapid-fire series of chapters, they extol the virtues of nutrition, exercise, sleep, community, and even prayer for a healthy life. They embrace the “90/10” diet rule, which allows for flexibility and enjoyment. They stress that anyone can take control of his or her health at any point – but sadly, some damage cannot be undone.\n\n“People who were once obese have a higher propensity for weight gain, and a study published in June 2023 shows obesity even causes permanent damage to brain metabolism. Children who are obese can expect to live five years fewer than their parents,” Justice and Bontempo write. But there is hope for the next generation. If there is a main takeaway from Fat And Unhappy, it’s that creating healthy patterns is far from impossible. Parents who want the best for their kids don’t have to get PhDs in nutrition or run ultramarathons—they can simply cook a meal for the family and enjoy it together.\n\nLike many worthwhile things in life, good parenting requires intentionality, whether that means resisting Big Tech by refusing to buy your child a smartphone or resisting Big Food by opting for fruits and veggies instead of prepackaged junk. Giving your children the gift of health just might be the greatest gift of all.",
