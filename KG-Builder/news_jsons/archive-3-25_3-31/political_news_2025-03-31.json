            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s marathon speech on the Senate floor has stretched overnight into Tuesday morning as he protests actions taken by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, saying that he will keep going \u201cas long as I am physically able.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic senator has spoken for more than 12 hours, beginning his remarks at 7 p.m. ET Monday evening, and is undertaking this effort at a time when Democratic leaders in Washington are under pressure from their base to do more to stand up to Trump. Booker is a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team.\n\nAs of 7:30 a.m. ET, Booker was still speaking and had touched on a number of topics.\n\n\u201cI rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,\u201d Booker said at the outset of his remarks. \u201cI rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans\u2019 safety; financial stability; the core foundations of our democracy,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThese are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nThe speech is not a filibuster because Booker is not blocking legislation or a nomination. The Democratic senator\u2019s speech will keep the Senate floor open \u2013 and floor staff working as well US Capitol police members detailed to the chamber \u2013 for as long as he continues speaking, but lawmakers had concluded voting on Monday before he began his remarks.\n\nIn his remarks, Booker warned of potential cuts to Medicaid by congressional Republicans and the harm that would cause to his constituents and Americans across the country.\n\nRepublicans have insisted that they will not cut Medicaid, but have said they will go after waste, fraud and abuse and have proposed deep spending cuts \u2013 without specifying exactly what programs the cuts could come from \u2013 as part of their legislative agenda.\n\nAt one point, Booker invoked the late GOP Sen. John McCain, reflecting on McCain\u2019s pivotal health care vote in 2017, and drawing parallels to the current moment.\n\n\u201cIt is maddening in this country to create greater and greater health care crisis and for us not to solve it but to battle back and forth between trying to make incremental changes or to tear it all down with no plan to make it better, leaving more Americans suffering,\u201d Booker said.\n\nLoudly raising his voice and speaking with emotion, Booker said, \u201cSenator McCain, I know you wouldn\u2019t sanction this, I know you would be screaming, I\u2019ve seen how angry you can get, John McCain. I\u2019ve seen you tear people apart on this floor, Democrat and Republican, for doing the same stupid thing over and over again. Listen to John McCain explain why he voted \u2018no\u2019 the last time the Republican Party tried to unite and tear down health care with no idea how to fix it, threatening to put millions of Americans in financial crisis and health care crisis. I can\u2019t believe we are here again.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, Booker took questions at various points from Senate Democratic colleagues and was able to take brief breaks while he fielded those questions. Per Senate procedure, when Booker yielded for a question, he was able to stop speaking without losing the floor.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was the first to pose a question to his New Jersey colleague, and he praised Booker for his \u201cstrength and conviction.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking the floor tonight to bring up all these inequities that will hurt people, that will so hurt the middle class, that will so hurt poor people, that will hurt America, hurt our fiscal conditions, as you document,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cJust give us a little inkling of the strength \u2014 give us a little feeling for the strength and conviction that drive you to do this unusual taking of the floor for a long time to let the people know how bad these things are going to be.\u201d\n\nBooker then yielded to Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester for further questions, noting that before he began speaking, the Delaware Senator prayed with him on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cMy sister came over and prayed with me that I could stand for a long time, because she knew what we were trying to do, which was to try to create with who we serve, with John Lewis-type good trouble in this institution, to not do things normal,\u201d he said, adding that Blunt Rochester had \u201casked God to give me words of love today.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators, including: Jeff Merkley against Neil Gorsuch in 2017; Chris Murphy on gun control in 2016; Rand Paul over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and Ted Cruz against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n\nThe late Strom Thurmond holds the record for the longest speech when he spoke on the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional information."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration recently stripped Columbia University of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding in a blatant act of authoritarianism that Trump and his allies dubiously say is necessary to stem antisemitism. The university sheepishly acquiesced to virtually all of the administration\u2019s demands in an effort to restart talks to unfreeze that money.\n\nI recently wrote about the absurdity of the MAGA movement\u2019s lobbing claims of antisemitism precisely as some of the most prominent conservative influencers are praising Nazi apologists and even defending Adolf Hitler himself.\n\nThe Trump administration has given a range of rationales \u2014 from diversity-related policies to the recognition of trans people in collegiate athletics \u2014 as it targets American universities, which JD Vance once branded \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Beyond that, the White House has used allegations of antisemitism to pursue deportation of foreign students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nAmid all of this, I\u2019ve been interested in hearing Jewish voices speaking about the administration\u2019s apparent use of Jewish people and their pain to carry out its illiberal goals \u2014 and the concerns they have about the White House\u2019s actions helping fuel antisemitism.\n\nJason Stanley, a philosophy professor who recently decided to leave Yale to go teach in Canada, recently explained on PBS\u2019 \u201cAmanpour & Company\u201d why he thinks the Trump administration\u2019s efforts are actually boosting antisemitic tropes:\n\nThis is reinforcing antisemitic tropes all across the political spectrum. ... What are the most toxic antisemitic tropes? Well, \u201cJews control the institutions.\u201d This is absolutely reinforcing this. Any young American is going to think: Remember what happened when they took down the world\u2019s greatest university system on behalf of Jewish safety? And this will go down in history books \u2014 the history of this era will say that Jewish people were the sledgehammer for fascism. So if we don\u2019t speak out, if we American Jews do not speak out against this, this will be a grim chapter in our history as Americans. It\u2019s the first time in my life as an American that I have been fearful of our status as equal Americans \u2014 not because of the protests on campus, which, as I said, had a lot of Jewish students in them. But because we are suddenly at the center of U.S. politics. It\u2019s never good to be in the crosshairs for us. And we are being used to destroy democracy.\n\nDylan Williams, the vice president for government affairs at the Center for International Policy, a progressive think tank, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly right and I have no doubt that it is how the overwhelming majority of Jewish Americans feel \u2014 we are being exploited in an attack on democracy, rights and the rule of law,\u201d Williams wrote on X.\n\nThis concern isn\u2019t confined to Jewish leftists. In fact, conservative writer Nick Cohen essentially warned about what we\u2019re seeing now back in December. In an article for The Jewish Chronicle headlined \u201cAmerican Jews, beware of being used by Trump,\u201d he wrote:\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying that antisemitism is never really about Jews. Everyone from European fascists to today\u2019s Khomeinists, for example, uses anti-Jewish conspiracy theories to justify the denial of human rights to their own citizens. The same applies to the philosemitism of the Trump movement. It wants to use American Jews \u2014 most of whom still vote Democrat, I should add \u2014 as an excuse to undermine their political opponents in liberal universities and abolish the US Education department.\n\nFurthermore, Kenneth Stern, the director of Bard College\u2019s Center for the Study of Hate and a lead drafter of the working definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, recently told NPR that the Trump administration\u2019s campus crackdown risks scapegoating Jewish students, as well.\n\n\u201cIt puts pro-Israel Jewish students in a situation where they may be seen as trying to suppress speech rather than answer it,\u201d Stern said.\n\nAs NPR noted, the administration has adopted Stern\u2019s definition of antisemitism in its executive orders \u2014 but he says the definition is being distorted and weaponized.\n\nThese concerns, about purported allyship\u2019s being used in ways that ultimately may undermine Jews, mirror what some Asian Americans expressed as conservatives were using their communities to argue against \u2014 and do away with \u2014 race-conscious admissions on college campuses.\n\nNeedless to say, members of more than one marginalized group have shown wariness about the MAGA movement\u2019s claiming to act on their behalf. And they have ample reason to feel that way."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Donald Trump selected Mike Waltz to serve as national security adviser, the choice was widely seen as win-win: A combat veteran with four Bronze Stars would bring his judgment to the White House and his deep-red Florida House district was safe in Republican hands.\n\nNow, both assumptions seem far less certain, as Waltz struggles to restore his credibility inside the West Wing after an embarrassing security breach and Republicans scramble to hold onto his old seat in a special election Tuesday that will stand as one of the most significant tests of Trump\u2019s popularity since taking office.\n\nWith questions still swirling around Waltz on Monday, the White House sought to turn the page. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump stands by Waltz and an investigation had been closed into how the national security adviser invited The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief into a chat on an encrypted messaging app where Trump\u2019s team discussed military plans to strike Yemen.\n\n\u201cAs the president has made very clear, Mike Waltz continues to be an important part of his national security team,\u201d Leavitt told reporters. \u201cThis case has been closed here at the White House, as far as we are concerned. There have been steps made to ensure that something like that can, obviously, never happen again. We\u2019re moving forward.\u201d\n\nLeavitt declined to elaborate what steps had been taken and didn\u2019t say whether the review \u2013 promised last week by the president, and also said to include the White House counsel\u2019s office and Elon Musk \u2013 shed any new light onto how Jeffrey Goldberg was invited to join the chat, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth disclosed a highly sensitive military operation for taking out Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to keep Waltz on board \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 does not mean that Waltz has resolved all of the questions surrounding a bizarre scandal that even the president conceded was the biggest \u201cglitch\u201d of the new administration. The president and other advisers were reticent to give in to a scandal, people familiar with the matter say, particularly involving The Atlantic, a magazine that Trump loathes.\n\nWhile he has publicly downplayed the matter, Trump was frustrated by the appearance of ineptitude by his aides and in disbelief that Goldberg would be communicating with anyone in his close inner circle.\n\nTrump determined early last week that he didn\u2019t want to fire anyone over the messages, wary of appearing to cave to outside pressure. But that didn\u2019t stop him from questioning other advisers and allies about how to proceed, officials said, including whether he should fire Waltz for adding Goldberg to the Signal chat discussing attack plans in Yemen.\n\nTrump\u2019s public support for Waltz was at its most effusive last Tuesday, when he told reporters he believed his aide was \u201cdoing his best\u201d and \u201cwill continue to do a good job\u201d while stopping short of blaming him for the snafu.\n\nBy Wednesday, he seemed somewhat less enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cIt was Mike, I guess. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nBy Thursday, Trump was continuing to consult with senior members of his administration about the wisdom of keeping Waltz on staff.\n\nHe met with Vice President JD Vance, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Sergio Gor, the head of presidential personnel, according to people familiar with the meeting, first reported by The Wall Street Journal. He also was venting in conversations with political allies that Waltz\u2019s old Florida congressional seat had become a much tougher race for Republicans than initially expected.\n\nDismissing Waltz would not prompt another contentious confirmation battle, something Trump and other White House officials are eager to move beyond. The national security adviser position, while one of the most powerful within the US government, doesn\u2019t require Senate approval. Trump has steadfastly stood by Hegseth, who survived a bruising confirmation battle in January.\n\nYet as a new week began, Trump remained set on not shaking up his team, despite the lingering resentment he has voiced to allies over what transpired.\n\nLong-standing questions around Waltz in Trump world\n\nBut the president has yet to learn the biggest question of all: How Goldberg\u2019s number ended up on Waltz\u2019s telephone. Waltz himself has offered less-than-clear explanations in public.\n\n\u201cSomehow it gets sucked in. It gets sucked in,\u201d he said on Fox News last week, in an interview that Trump and other senior officials found less than impressive.\n\nThe Signal incident was, in Trump\u2019s mind, the first glaring misstep of his second term, and marred what he believes to be a successful opening of his second administration that so far has avoided some of the pitfalls of his first term.\n\nEven before the Signal episode unfolded last week, there were voices in Trump\u2019s orbit questioning whether Waltz was enough of an ideological loyalist to serve in the high-profile job.\n\nHe previously served in the administration of President George W. Bush and had publicly questioned Trump ahead of the 2016 election, saying after Trump criticized Sen. John McCain that he \u201chasn\u2019t served this country for a day in his life\u201d and accusing him of \u201ccozying up to Putin.\u201d\n\nBefore assuming his role at the White House, Waltz also vocally encouraged American assistance for Ukraine, even as Trump and some of his allies questioned its value to the United States.\n\nSo, too, have there been questions about his manner in the West Wing, where he is now a senior-level aide rather than a principal, as he was on Capitol Hill.\n\nWaltz, 51, is part of a large contingent of Floridians in the top ranks of the White House. But during the first two months of the administration, Waltz rubbed some Trump loyalists the wrong way, particularly for hawkish foreign policy views, people familiar with the matter say.\n\nThe former congressman also carried himself with a sense of entitlement, in the view of some aides, rather than as a member of the national security staff. White House officials disputed any such characterization, saying all advisers and Cabinet secretaries serve as the pleasure of the president.\n\nWaltz was elected to Congress in 2018 to fill the seat of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and won reelection three times. An Army Ranger, Waltz was selected to serve in the elite Green Beret special forces, notching multiple tours to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nNational security advisers do not have a particularly strong track record in Trump\u2019s West Wing. He ran through four during his first term: Michael Flynn, whom he fired weeks after taking office in 2017 for lying about his contacts with Russia; HR McMaster, who left after differences on Syria and Russia; John Bolton, who Trump fired after 17 months (Bolton said he quit); and Robert O\u2019Brien, who lasted until the end of the term.\n\nThe repeated hirings-and-firings of the top national security aide \u2014 along with the West Wing\u2019s other top job, chief of staff \u2014 contributed to a sense of chaos in Trump\u2019s first term that he has been intent on avoiding this time around.\n\nTrump sought to put the matter to rest this weekend, saying he\u2019d held no discussions about dismissing Waltz or anyone else involved in the matter.\n\n\u201cNope, I\u2019ve never heard that,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cAnd nobody else makes that decision, but me and I\u2019ve never heard it, and I don\u2019t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts.\u201d"

            "full_content": "In spring 2024, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision that found a government official could not use her position to punish a disfavored political organization by going after the third parties that did business with it.\n\nLikewise, President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional. But unless lawyers stand up to the president and clients stand by their lawyers, the damage to the legal system will be profound.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional.\n\nClients and lawyers must band together against these blatantly illegal actions by the Trump administration and flip the script: They need not defend their own actions but, rather, force government attorneys who may seek to punish the clients of any \u201cdisfavored\u201d law firms to justify such unconstitutional efforts, which will be impossible to do.\n\nSo far, the president has targeted five private law firms and the clients they represent, claiming that his administration will punish those clients who have the temerity to do business with those firms. Two of these firms, Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps, have capitulated to this pressure, expressing fears that the president\u2019s attacks threaten their business model, and they will lose clients who might not want lawyers representing them who have such a bad relationship with the federal government.\n\nThis fear is certainly real, but if the president can scare clients away from the firms that might take positions against his administration, there will be fewer and fewer lawyers willing to take such stands. If that happens, our system of rights, protected by law, and not dispensed at the fiat of the executive, will crumble. But here\u2019s the thing: such actions by the president are clearly unconstitutional.\n\nLast year, in a case filed by the National Rifle Association, on facts eerily similar to those surrounding the president\u2019s actions, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, found that the efforts of a state agency in New York to punish companies that did business with the NRA violated its free speech rights enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nWhile it is deeply troubling that some firms feel the need to appease the White House in the face of such unconstitutional retribution, it will take more than just a handful of firms to resist such bullying. And if such resistance does not materialize, the threats to the rule of law will only increase, and our legal system will not serve to protect everyone\u2019s rights or facilitate the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n\nIt is in everyone\u2019s best interest \u2014 even those clients who might fear retaliation from the Trump administration for retaining disfavored firms \u2014 to condemn the president\u2019s efforts to attack members of the legal profession simply for playing their essential role in our legal system. These clients should stand by their lawyers and those lawyers must turn the tables on their opponents. They must force government lawyers who might take punitive action on behalf of the president to justify such unconstitutional behavior in court. Since government lawyers take an oath to the Constitution, they, too, have a duty to resist facilitating such punitive and unconstitutional actions.\n\nAddressing U.S. attorneys in 1940 about the role of the prosecutor in a society that abided by the rule of law, then-Attorney General Robert Jackson \u2014 who would also serve as a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and was later a Supreme Court associate justice \u2014 explained: \u201cWhile the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries.\n\nIn the last light of the first Trump administration, Justice Department lawyers refused to help the president remain in power after losing the 2020 election. Recently, federal prosecutors resisted pressure to dismiss the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. As one of those lawyers, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten, explained: \u201cAny assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way. If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries. Remember, President Richard Nixon, too, cycled through several lawyers until he found someone willing to fire the special prosecutor investigating him, but the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d also helped lead to Nixon\u2019s ultimate demise.\n\nThe ability of lawyers and their clients to operate free of such animus is an essential element of our legal system and the rule of law itself. And everyone benefits by a functioning legal system: a financial institution under investigation, a worker cheated out of a fair wage or someone facing deportation.\n\nIn a democracy that promises \u201cEqual Justice Under Law,\u201d a phrase chiseled above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court building, lawyers are critical to deliver on the promise of such equal justice, not for some, but for all. Attacks on lawyers \u2014 even elite ones \u2014 are designed to bring the entire legal system to heel.\n\nTurning to Robert Jackson once again, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, writing for the Supreme Court, he set forth what should be our national True North when it comes to speech and action disfavored by government officials: \u201cIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s attacks on law firms are designed to not just dictate orthodoxy, but also to bend the legal system to President Trump\u2019s will. These seemingly petty actions, from high officials, are setting us down a path where the legal institutions designed to protect everyone will no longer serve to check abuses of power. Everyone within the legal system \u2014 its judges, lawyers, clients and average citizens \u2014 must resist such efforts and do so together."

            "full_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nTwo astronauts whose planned weeklong stay in low-Earth orbit unexpectedly turned into a more than 9-month mission due to spacecraft problems spoke publicly to reporters Monday for the first time since their return to terra firma on March 18.\n\nNASA\u2019s Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore garnered worldwide attention when issues with their Boeing Starliner vehicle cropped up during a June test flight to the International Space Station. As they waited for an alternative ride home, the pair faced a stream of rhetoric, bolstered by politicians and media, about being \u201cabandoned,\u201d \u201cstranded,\u201d or \u201cstuck\u201d \u2014 descriptors the astronauts themselves have denied.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore and fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague \u2014 who were all part of the Crew-9 mission that ultimately brought the test flight team back to Earth \u2014 addressed questions about the Starliner saga during a NASA news conference.\n\n\u201cWe were always coming back, and I think people need to know that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re back to actually, you know, share our story with so many people, because \u2026 it\u2019s unique, and there\u2019s some lessons learned to it, and part of that is just resilience and being able to take a turn that was unexpected and make the best of it.\u201d\n\nWilliams acknowledged that she and Wilmore knew going into the Starliner test mission that flying a new spacecraft was \u201cunique,\u201d but neither expected all of the attention their extended stay garnered. Once the duo realized they would become part of the space station crew for longer than expected, they \u201cpivoted,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cWe are International Space Station crew members, and we\u2019re doing what all of our other friends in the astronaut office do: Go and work and train and and do amazing science experiments up on the International Space Station,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWilliams said she and Wilmore were honored and humbled by the amount of interest in their journey.\n\n\u201cWhen we came home, (it was) like, wow, there are a lot of people who are interested,\u201d she said. \u201cVery thankful, very amazed that we could hopefully be one positive element to bring people together.\u201d\n\nBoth Williams and Wilmore said that Starliner is \u201cvery capable.\u201d Given the chance, they would fly it again in the future, according to Wilmore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to rectify all the issues that we encountered,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix it, we\u2019re going to make it work. Boeing\u2019s completely committed. NASA is completely committed. And with that, I\u2019d get on in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nThe astronauts were repeatedly asked about any politics that came into play during their time on the station.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re up there operating in space, you don\u2019t feel the politics,\u201d Hague said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel any of that.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News on Monday, Wilmore for the first time said he thought \u201cin certain respects, we were stuck.\u201d\n\nBut he continued to refute the broader narrative that he and Williams were abandoned.\n\n\u201cBased on how they were couching this? That we were left and forgotten and all? We were nowhere near any of that,\u201d Wilmore said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, now one of Trump\u2019s top advisers, have repeatedly taken credit for expediting Williams and Wilmore\u2019s return.\n\nTrump and Musk have also accused the Biden Administration of abandoning the astronauts in space for \u201cpolitical reasons,\u201d though there is no publicly available evidence for that assertion.\n\nWilmore on Monday repeated earlier statements that he \u201cbelieves\u201d Musk and Trump, though he did not say about what, specifically.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given me no reason not to trust you \u2014 either one of them,\u201d Wilmore told Fox News when asked what he would say to Trump and Musk. \u201cI am grateful that our national leaders actually are coming in and taking part in our human spaceflight program.\u201d\n\nAstronauts Nick Hague, Suni Williams, and Butch Wilmore talk to reporters during a news conference at Johnson Space Center on March 31 in Houston. Ashley Landis/AP\n\nReacclimating to life on Earth\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were reassigned to the Crew-9 mission during their monthslong stay on the orbiting laboratory, integrating with space station staff. As their stay faced further extensions, the astronauts acknowledged it was difficult to be away from family and friends on Earth.\n\n\u201cDid I think about not being there for my daughter\u2019s high school year? Of course, but (we) compartmentalize. \u2026 I can\u2019t let that interfere with what I\u2019m called to do at the moment,\u201d Wilmore told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s not about my feelings. It\u2019s about what this human spaceflight program is about: It\u2019s our national goals.\u201d\n\nDespite the controversial rhetoric about the mission, the astronaut duo also relished the time spent in space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic up here. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to spend time up here with these views and with this company?\u201d Williams told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper from the space station in February.\n\nHague on Monday praised Wilmore and Williams as highly skilled astronauts who were welcomed as they helped the current station crew work through experiments and other tasks \u2014 more than \u201cgap fillers on the station,\u201d he said at the news conference.\n\n\u201cThey were productive, pushing the station mission forward and Suni was the station commander, so she was calling the shots,\u201d Hague said. \u201cSo you get in that environment, that operational environment, the politics, they don\u2019t make it up there. We are working as a part of an international team that spans the globe \u2026 and we just figure out how to make it happen. That\u2019s the magic of human spaceflight, is that we can focus on something so positive that pulls people together. And we\u2019ve been doing that for a long time.\u201d\n\nAfter returning home, Williams said she couldn\u2019t wait to hug her husband and her dogs. She said she\u2019s been feeling good and went for a 3-mile run yesterday \u2014 something she says is a testament to the astronauts\u2019 trainers, who are \u201crocking it\u201d in helping the crew reacclimate to life on Earth again.\n\n\u201cI mean, who would even imagine that you come back from roughly 10 months (in space) and within a week, you run 2 miles at an eight-minute pace,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not even conceivable that the body could handle that. But these folks get us ready to where those type of things happen.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s response to the \u2018stuck\u2019 narrative\n\nTo be clear, NASA officials have consistently denied that Williams and Wilmore were ever \u201cstranded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always had a lifeboat, a way for them to come home,\u201d said Steve Stich, who heads NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, under which SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft and Boeing\u2019s Starliner vehicle operate, on March 18.\n\nNASA officials were asked during news conferences around the astronauts\u2019 March 18 return to Earth about exactly how much credit should be given to Trump and Musk.\n\nFor key context: The space agency mapped out Williams and Wilmore\u2019s path home last summer \u2014 well before Musk or Trump began talking about it.\n\nFor their part, NASA leaders have mostly avoided giving the President or Musk overt credit.\n\nFor example, Joel Montalbano, the space agency\u2019s deputy associate administrator for the Space Operations Mission Directorate, addressed the matter after Williams and Wilmore splashed down off the coast of Florida.\n\n\u201cI think many of you heard that back in January, the President asked SpaceX what it would take to bring this crew home. And I will tell you that \u2014 at the time that that question was asked \u2014 we were already looking at options,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter being questioned by journalists, Montalbano added that NASA \u201cgot the input from the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you also have to look at the vehicle readiness,\u201d Montalbano said. \u201cWe talked about looking at weather. We talked about recovery team, (crew) handover, the vehicle traffic going to and from the International Space Station. So when you put all that together, we came up with a, I thought, a pretty good plan that the teams executed over the last four or five days.\u201d\n\n\u201cVehicle readiness\u201d is a key phrase.\n\nDuring the March 18 news conference, Stich said the next available SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that could bring Williams and Wilmore home was the one that brought them home. The fact that the spacecraft was one and the same suggests SpaceX did not have a different vehicle that could have flown a separate, dedicated mission to return the astronauts sooner.\n\nThat would contradict a claim from Musk. He previously indicated SpaceX offered to commission a rescue mission to retrieve the astronauts \u2014 perhaps expediting their return by months \u2014 to someone within the Biden White House, but his proposal was denied for \u201cpolitical reasons.\u201d Musk said he did not make the offer directly to NASA, though it\u2019s unclear why.\n\nNor is it clear what the details of that offer may have been and to whom, specifically, it was directed.\n\nA former senior Biden White House official and former senior NASA official previously told CNN they never heard such an offer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any communications that came directly to the White House, whether directly or indirectly, along the way \u2014 and there was a close team,\u201d the former Biden White House source said.\n\nNotably, NASA had said in December it was expecting to delay Crew-9\u2019s return because of SpaceX. Specifically, the company was tracking some hangups preparing a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule for Crew-10 \u2014 a mission with a fresh astronaut crew that had to arrive at the space station before Crew-9, carrying Wilmore and Williams, was allowed to disembark.\n\nNASA and SpaceX later opted to use a different capsule for the Crew-10 mission, a preflown Dragon vehicle."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, Steve Kornacki dives into how Democrats may be able to cut into the GOP\u2019s margins in a deep-red Florida House district in tomorrow\u2019s special election. Plus, we have more key numbers to know there and in Wisconsin ahead of a big state Supreme Court race.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nWhy Republicans are at risk of underperforming in a Florida special election\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nNo Democrat in America won a House seat last year in a district even remotely as pro-Trump as the two in Florida where special elections will be held Tuesday.\n\nTrump carried Florida\u2019s 1st District by 37 points and the 6th District by 30 points in 2024, according to NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk. The biggest margin for a Democratic-held seat that Trump won at the presidential level was 9 points, coming in Rep. Jared Golden\u2019s 2nd District in Maine.\n\nSo a Democratic win in either Florida race would be beyond stunning. The suspense is more about whether the party can take a bite out of those giant Trump margins and claim political momentum early in his second administration.\n\nThis is particularly the case in the 6th District, where Democrat Josh Weil has outraised Republican Randy Fine by a staggering margin and where early voting has hinted at an energized Democratic base \u2014 a dynamic that has been a pattern in special elections during the Trump era. And last year\u2019s presidential election results from the district suggest there\u2019s plenty of room for slippage for the GOP and overperformance from the Democrats.\n\nMuch of this is due to the growth in Trump\u2019s support from nonwhite voters, many of whom were younger and first-time voters without a history of participating in lower-turnout special elections. In November, they helped boost Trump\u2019s margin in Florida\u2019s 6th District by 6 points, from 24 points in 2020 up to 30. The two places where Trump gained the most new ground are significantly less white and less affluent than the district as a whole.\n\nIn Florida\u2019s 6th District, Trump\u2019s gains with nonwhite voters seem to have come in both heavily Latino and heavily Black areas. In precincts that are majority Black, he cut the Democratic margin from 53 points in 2020 down to 41, a 12-point improvement. The biggest single precinct-level shift toward Trump in the district (a net-gain of 57 points) came in a precinct that is 52% Black.\n\nA key question that emerged from 2024 is whether these types of gains are sustainable for Republicans without Trump on the ballot. Add in the lower-profile nature of this election and the task becomes that much tougher.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s gains were minimal in areas with higher concentrations of white, college-educated and affluent voters. It is among this demographic mix that Democrats have found their most energized supporters nationally during the Trump era. And given that turnout will be much lower on Tuesday than in November, an exercised cohort of anti-Trump, college-educated, white voters could punch well above its weight. The district also has plenty of retirees, and in areas where the average age is over 55, Trump only gained about two points last November.\n\nThis might not all add up to a Democratic win, but it could knock some points off that 30-point Trump margin.\n\nStay tuned tomorrow for Steve\u2019s breakdown of the key areas to watch in Wisconsin for the state Supreme Court election.\n\nTuesday's elections by the numbers\n\nBy Ben Kamisar, Bridget Bowman, Macklin Fishman, Adam Edelman and Scott Bland\n\nOutside of the Florida special elections, a state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin on Tuesday will also have major national implications.\n\nHere are the key numbers to know that have shaped these elections.\n\nA deluge of TV ads: The vast majority of the $80 million-plus spent since Jan. 1 on TV in these off-year elections has been in Wisconsin, where the contest between two state judges, Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel, has been the most expensive state Supreme Court race in history, surpassing Wisconsin\u2019s 2023 campaign.\n\nWisconsin has seen more than $70 million in TV ads on the court race (plus a bit more on other races on the ballot), according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Meanwhile, the special election in Florida\u2019s 1st District has seen $3.4 million in ads, and the one in the 6th District has seen $6.2 million through Election Day.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s spending: Billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk has played a major role in the uptick in spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nMusk\u2019s super PAC, America PAC, has spent $12.2 million and counting to boost Schimel. Musk also donated another $3 million to the state Republican Party. And he gave away million-dollar checks to petition signers at a recent event in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nMeanwhile, another group with links to Musk, the nonprofit Building America\u2019s Future, has also spent $4.8 million in Wisconsin. (It\u2019s unclear whether Musk is currently supporting that group.)\n\nThe biggest liberal-aligned group in the Wisconsin race has been A Better Wisconsin Together, which has spent $8.4 million to benefit Crawford.\n\nMusk\u2019s America PAC has also gotten involved in Florida, but with far smaller sums, dropping nearly $100,000 on phone calls and texts in the two races, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s posting: Musk isn\u2019t just pouring money into the race; he\u2019s been talking a lot about it, too.\n\nHe has posted or reposted 73 times on his X platform about the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this year, as of midday Monday. Most of those posts came in recent weeks, as his money and involvement in the campaign have become a central theme.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udc40 Zooming out: Moving at a rapid-fire clip, Trump has been concentrating power in his hands, pushing the bounds of executive authority while effectively muzzling an array of voices that pose threats to his agenda, Peter Nicholas and Sahil Kapur report.

            "full_content": "Jimmy who? Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nFor all his success in imposing his will on the federal government, Donald Trump may be deliberately engineering his own political downfall by mishandling the very job he was most certainly elected to perform: stewardship of the economy. The risks he\u2019s running were impressively summarized by Washington Post economics columnist Heather Long:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pushing the economy to a breaking point with sweeping tariffs and rapid cuts to immigration and the federal workforce. There is growing fear of not just a recession but stagflation, a frightful situation \u2014 not seen in the United States since the 1970s \u2014 in which the economy contracts and people lose jobs but prices remain high.\n\nThis is a self-inflicted wound from Trump. Many of his economic advisers, including Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore, are urging him to show restraint on tariffs. But Trump is set to unleash the biggest increase in tariffs since the Depression era on Wednesday. He\u2019s calling it \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d It may turn out to be Stagflation Day.\n\n\u201cStagflation\u201d (an economy characterized by both rapidly rising prices and slow growth) is the horrible bogeyman that economic policy wonks scare one another with around the campfire late at night. In theory, it\u2019s not supposed to happen because fiscal and monetary policies tend to push the economy either toward growth with price inflation or toward recession with low price inflation \u2026 or, ideally, toward steady growth accompanied by stable prices.\n\nBut stagflation can definitely happen, as the United States proved in the 1970s when inflation spurred by oil-price shocks and unemployment boosted by restrictive policies from the Federal Reserve gave the country the worst of all possible economic worlds. There were actually two moments of extreme stagflation: in 1975, when the core Consumer Price Index rose 9.1 percent while unemployment reached 8.5 percent, and in 1980, when core CPI was up 12.4 percent and unemployment was at 7.1 percent. Although the causes of this past era of stagflation were complex and some of the foreign and domestic policies of Richard Nixon were significantly responsible, its political consequences fell most heavily on his successors Gerald Ford (in office from August 1974 to January 1977) and Jimmy Carter (January 1977 to January 1981). It\u2019s not an accident that both men became the only electorally defeated incumbent presidents between Herbert Hoover and George H.W. Bush.\n\nTrump in 1980 when stagflation peaked. Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nTo assess the political risks associated with stagflation, it\u2019s important to understand that, despite their bumbling reputations as presidents, Ford and Carter took impressive political assets into their failed reelection campaigns. Ford inherited Nixon\u2019s massive landslide coalition from the 1972 presidential election and added a fresh image of openness, honesty, and bipartisanship. Carter put together a mind-bending coalition based on his strength in southern states that had been lost to Democrats for years and have not gone Democratic for any presidential candidate since. It took some work for either president to lose. But while both had other missteps (e.g., Ford\u2019s pardon of Nixon and Carter\u2019s mishandling of the Iran hostage situation), it\u2019s evident in retrospect that stagflation made both vulnerable to primary challenges (Ronald Reagan\u2019s against Ford, Ted Kennedy\u2019s against Carter) and ripe for defeat.\n\nIn comparing past presidents with Trump, it is very clear his 2024 win was uniquely attributable to the belief (to some extent based on dubious memories) that the U.S. economy had done well during his previous term in office, particularly compared with Joe Biden\u2019s inflation-plagued term. It\u2019s hard to imagine his already-limited popularity surviving a return to rising prices, particularly if there is also a surge in unemployment.\n\nNow, doubtless, Trump is arguing that the potential downside of his tariff program will soon give way to its manifest benefits once the wiseacres in the economics profession and the scaredy-cats of the stock markets are proved wrong in their near-universal expectation that protectionism and trade wars are very bad ideas. Is it possible Trump could survive a burst of stagflation and come out vindicated?\n\nIn the very era examined above, there is some precedent for a bounce-back of presidential popularity once stagflation abates. In Reagan\u2019s first term, the so-called misery index (combined inflation and unemployment) was at 18 percent in 1981 and 17.1 percent in 1982, no better than Carter\u2019s record. But by 1984, Reagan\u2019s reelection year, it was down to 12.5 percent and the positive trend caused the Gipper to claim it was \u201cmorning in America.\u201d Then again, Reagan pursued a simple austerity strategy for quelling inflation, and the subsequent recovery mostly reflected a cyclical development that was especially well timed for the 40th president. Trump is trying something very different with a mixed bag of economic policies that include public-sector austerity, big high-end tax cuts, and the highest tariffs since the Smoot-Hawley rates of the Hoover administration, all on a high wire of unstable congressional majorities, extreme partisan polarization, and likely midterm setbacks. It\u2019s really a big gamble, and if Trump miscalculates, his losses may exceed those he encountered in his ill-fated lurch into the casino business in the 1980s."

            "full_content": "Photo: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix\n\nMeghan Markle has taken a lot of flak for her two recent business endeavors: a Netflix lifestyle show and her product line, As ever. The eight-episode series With Love, Meghan pioneered \u201cnew frontiers in unrelatability,\u201d per Vulture, as the Duchess poured things from one container into a prettier container and passive-aggressively informed Mindy Kaling that her last name is now Sussex. Meanwhile, it\u2019s not entirely clear what products Meghan is selling (definitely food, maybe other stuff) or even how her brand\u2019s new name should be styled (\u201cAmerican Riviera Orchard\u201d is now either \u201cAs Ever\u201d or \u201cAs ever\u201d).\n\nNevertheless, like any true millennial girlboss, Meghan persisted. In a Monday-morning email to people who signed up for As ever updates, the Duchess of Sussex shed light on several of her products \u2014 but not too much light. The email does not say exactly when the products will go on sale. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to introduce the As ever collection to you this week,\u201d Meghan teases. A click on the absolutely stunning photo of raspberry-jam-drenched cr\u00eapes brings you to the As ever website, which is similarly vague. Eight items are shown \u2014 including honey, teas, and \u201cflower sprinkles\u201d \u2014 but don\u2019t bother looking for prices, product descriptions, or an exact launch date.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t learn a ton about Meghan\u2019s wares, the email is full of other useful information. For anyone who subscribed for updates about a British royal\u2019s Montecito-inspired home-goods brand but has never heard of cr\u00eapes, Meghan explains what they are (\u201cstreetside thin pancakes\u201d), what they can do (house various other foodstuffs), and their deeper essence (they are a \u201ccanvas for flavor\u201d).\n\nAnd there are even free tips! Worried about what you\u2019ll do with the packaging from your As ever raspberry spread, should you decide to purchase it for an unknown sum at some undetermined point in the future? Well, you can use the \u201ckeepsake packaging\u201d to hold \u201clove notes or special treasures\u201d and to \u201cremember this pivotal moment\u201d with Meghan.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all: Once you\u2019ve slathered every last drop of jam on those \u201ceasy to make\u201d cr\u00eapes, you can wash the jar out and use it for other stuff! Hopefully the Duchess has trademarked this idea; I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be huge on \u201cshabby chic\u201d wedding Pinterest boards.\n\nUpon further investigation, the most remarkable thing about the jar and its packaging is that Meghan has opted to present jam like fancy perfume:\n\nAnd a video posted to Instagram last week revealed that us plebs will receive factory-produced jam, not the handmade stuff that Meghan sent to several dozen celebrity friends:\n\nBut I am still looking forward to making the \u201ceveryday exceptional\u201d by reusing that jam box. I will surely \u201cthink of it as our time capsule\u201d to remember that time both Meghan and I were kind of confused about the nature of her brand."

            "full_content": "Photo: Chet Strange/Getty Images\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s biggest current star is an 83-year-old who has never technically belonged to it. Bernie Sanders continues to barnstorm across America, drawing tens of thousands of people at every destination, all of whom are desperate to combat Donald Trump, or at least hear from a politician who vocalizes their fury. The \u201cresistance,\u201d certainly, is not as pervasive or culturally widespread as it was eight years ago \u2014 the era of so-called hyperpolitics is mostly done \u2014 but it\u2019s bubbling up where politicians are showing any kind of fight. Sanders plainly is, and Democrats of all ideological stripes seem appreciative of the democratic-socialist senator from Vermont. Of late, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has joined him on the road, and there\u2019s renewed chatter that the 35-year-old member of Congress could run for president in 2028.\n\nSanders, unlike the rest of the Democrats, has never struggled over formulating a coherent political message. He has beliefs and he acts on them. And he understands the outrage many ordinary Americans feel about Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, laying waste to the federal bureaucracy. Hence the tour\u2019s crisp theme: oligarchy. Sanders has railed against income inequality and the influence of the ultrawealthy on American life for at least a half-century. His prominence now illustrates the power of a consistent, easily digestible message, and puts him in stark relief with the mainstream of his party, which conspicuously lacks one.\n\nThe overriding question is what comes next. Neither Sanders or the rest of the Democrats have a great answer. Next year\u2019s midterm elections should be favorable to them: Trump is increasingly unpopular, Americans are weary of DOGE and fearing a recession, and it\u2019s easy to imagine the fragile GOP majority in the House disappearing altogether. The Senate races are much tougher, given the growing share of rural states that vote Republican, but there\u2019s some hope there. At least two Republican-held states, Maine and North Carolina, could be flippable.\n\nBut for now, Democrats must wait. The rallies do offer catharsis, and it\u2019s hard for progressives to demand much more from Sanders since he has accomplished so much for the American left over the last decade. But those looking to build durable power in a post-Sanders world must wonder where this is all headed. The organization Sanders founded to bolster progressives across America, Our Revolution, has had a minimal impact on the political scene. The left-wing group does little beyond doling out endorsements and cash to favored candidates.\n\nA recent email from Our Revolution did seem to recognize that Sanders\u2019s enormous rallies are potential organizing opportunities, promising to mobilize \u201ccommunities to challenge Trump\u2019s regressive policies and demand that the Democratic Party embrace bold economic populism.\u201d The email boasted of \u201cmore than 9,000 members\u201d of Our Revolution \u2014 a minuscule number, especially for an organization that was formed in 2016 to be the political arm that drove Sanders\u2019s movement beyond his presidential campaigns. For context, the Democratic Socialists of America \u2014 which Sanders does not formally belong to \u2014 still claim close to 80,000 dues-paying members with active chapters across America. Notably, DSA is playing a central role in the rise of its New York City mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, but Our Revolution is nowhere to be found. It\u2019s far from becoming a major player in the Democratic Party, much less dominating it.\n\nThat Our Revolution is tangibly weaker than DSA may be an indictment of Sanders, but it\u2019s not as if center-left, Sanders-hating Democrats can feel much schadenfreude. The disaster of 2024 is one they must own. They tamped down any hopes of an open primary and pretended, until the very end, that Joe Biden was fit to run again. They didn\u2019t mind that Kamala Harris had no overarching campaign message, no compelling argument for the next four years.\n\nThese sorts of Democrats should wonder why it isn\u2019t Harris headlining massive anti-Trump rallies. The former vice-president is thought to be mulling running again in 2028. For Democrats, it would be ideal if they just moved on \u2014 there are plenty of fresh faces and more intriguing options \u2014 but the rank and file probably wouldn\u2019t mind seeing their last standard-bearer battle Trump in public. Barack Obama isn\u2019t anywhere to be found, either. (Few sentient adults want Biden near a political rally.) Absent leaders, Sanders has emerged as one. Were he ten years younger, he might have another presidential campaign in him. Now that he\u2019s in what could be his last Senate term, other Democrats must learn from his example and try, at least, to inspire people. It starts with having convictions and acting on them."

Coming soon, the Trump sons will be getting into the business of using ridiculous amounts of energy to feed computers so they can do complex math problems and eventually pop out coins. But if you think the Trumps will be learning the zeros and ones of crypto supercomputing, the deal will look a little different from that. They\u2019ve really just taken one of their many business entities \u2014 a company you\u2019ve definitely heard of called American Data Centers, Inc. \u2014 and merged it with an already-functioning crypto-mining firm. The Trumps and their fellow investors will get 20 percent of the profits moving forward, with Eric serving as strategy officer.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, we\u2019ve backed our conviction in bitcoin, personally and through our businesses,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement. \u201cFrom the start\u201d may be a stretch, considering his father was calling cryptocurrency a scam as recently as 2021. But ever since Trump Jr. helped convince the family head that cryptocurrency was a great way to monetize the family name, Team Trump has been all in on bitcoin and other, lesser coins. Since he was elected for the second time, the Trump crypto rush has been nonstop.\n\nThere was Donald Trump\u2019s meme coin, $Trump, which earned more than $100 million in trading fees alone in January before plummeting in value. Then people in the know made millions on Melania before it immediately tanked. As Trump has pushed for an end to enforcement by regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, he has continued with his crypto plans and glaring conflicts of interest. Last week, Trump launched a crypto investment fund two days after the SEC killed its probe into the company Trump teamed up with. Also last week, a company run by Trump\u2019s eldest sons announced the launch of a stablecoin, a cryptocurrency pegged to treasuries and the U.S. dollar to help provide liquidity for trades. They did so the day before Republicans in Congress put forward a new bill on how to regulate such tokens.\n\nAt a crypto conference last week, Trump Jr. had high expectations for how much money he intends to make in the new crypto era ushered in by his father. \u201cThe sky is the limit for this,\u201d he said.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "full_content": "Photo: Bonnie Cash/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFor many Americans, the big political question is how much of this country as we have known it will be left when Donald Trump leaves the White House in 2029. In an apparent effort to troll Trump\u2019s detractors, MAGA folk keep calling for a third Trump term. And the president himself keeps bringing it up. It has become something of a game for journalists to force Trump to come to grips with the constitutional barriers to a third term (most notably the 22d Amendment, which flatly rules it out). And when NBC News confronted him with that simple fact on Sunday, he rather mysteriously said \u201cthere are methods\u201d whereby he could stay in office beyond the 2028 election.\n\nTo make it worse, Trump said of exploring a third term, \u201cI\u2019m not joking\u201d \u2014 yet he would not further clarify his intentions. This could be Trumpian bluster, but then again, this is a president who appears to be deadly serious about almost-equally preposterous ideas like the military conquest of Greenland.\n\nTo be clear, there is no constitutional path to a Trump third term. The 22nd Amendment, enacted by a Republican Congress infuriated by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s four consecutive presidential-election victories, is categorical: No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice. This amendment wasn\u2019t just a momentary act of partisan spite, either: It essentially codified a tradition set by George Washington, which lasted until the combined emergencies of the Great Depression, then an impending World War II gave FDR an opening to violate that tradition, not without great controversy. Presidents who even considered a third-term bid prior to Roosevelt (notably Ulysses Grant in 1880 and Woodrow Wilson in 1920) were met with considerable public hostility and accusations of dictatorial intentions.\n\nThere is no exception for presidents serving nonconsecutive terms, as Steve Bannon has fatuously suggested. The dodge most often discussed by Trump fans is a scheme whereby the incumbent would run for vice-president in 2028 with, say, J.D. Vance at the top of the ticket, who would quickly resign and let The Boss stay right there in the Oval Office. But this is very clearly banned by the 12th Amendment, which holds that No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States. Sure, you can contrive some wild scenario where Trump would be elected House Speaker, then both the duly elected president and vice-president would resign to return him to power. But obviously, that would require a cult of personality beyond any precedent in America, or much of anywhere else other than clearly authoritarian regimes like Stalin\u2019s USSR, Mao\u2019s China, or Per\u00f3n\u2019s Argentina.\n\nIn theory, of course, the Constitution could be amended to allow Trump a third term, the presidency in perpetuity, or perhaps a title like \u201cemperor of America, Canada, and Greenland.\u201d But there is a reason the Constitution hasn\u2019t been amended since 1992, when the very popular idea of barring members of Congress from voting themselves instant pay raises was added. There is no foreseeable situation where the two-thirds votes in both houses of Congress required to let Trump stick around would exist, unless the Democratic Party has somehow been banned. Even if that happened, three-fourths of the state legislatures would have to ratify it. Republicans are ten short of that number in legislatures they control.\n\nIn other words, the only way Trump can get around the various obstacles to another term would be through some extra-constitutional action that suspends all barriers to his power or disables the opposition to create a one-party state (say, via a Reichstag Fire situation where the Insurrection Act is invoked to ban non-GOP political parties). If that happens, little trifles like hallowed democratic institutions or even the express language of the U.S. Constitution would no longer matter."

Gen. Christopher Norrie, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division, called the soldiers \"a part of our family.\"\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe bodies of three of the four US soldiers who were reported missing after their vehicle was submerged in a bog in Lithuania last week have been recovered, the Army announced on Monday. The vehicle has also been recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Soldiers we have lost in this tragedy were not just Soldiers - they were a part of our family. Our hearts are heavy with a sorrow that echoes across the whole Marne Division, both forward and at home,\u201d Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary \u2018Dogface Soldiers\u2019 during this unimaginable time. But the search isn\u2019t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.\u201d\n\nSearch and recovery operations continue to find the fourth soldier, the statement said.\n\nThe four soldiers were assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, Georgia. Their identities are being until their families are notified.\n\nLithuania\u2019s President Gitanas Naus\u0117da said his country is mourning the loss of the soldiers.\n\n\u201cLithuania mourns together with the American nation. Please accept my heartfelt condolences, as well as those of the Lithuanian people, to you, the loved ones of those who lost their lives, and all the people of the United States of America. During this difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with you,\u201d he said in a tweet that tagged President Donald Trump.\n\nThe soldiers and vehicle, an M88 Hercules, have been missing since the early morning of March 25 when they were conducting a maintenance training mission, recovering another US vehicle in a Lithuania training area. The M88 was found the morning of March 26; US and partner military forces have been working around the clock since to pull the nearly 70-ton vehicle out of the bog.\n\nThe recovery effort involved \u201ctremendous resources from Lithuania,\u201d as well as \u201chundreds of service members from the US Army, US Navy, Lithuanian Armed Forces and the Polish Armed Forces\u2014along with other elements from the Lithuanian government and civilian agencies.\u201d\n\nIndeed, other officials have pointed to the recovery operation as a prime example of the importance of relationships with US allies abroad \u2014 a position that has been strained in recent weeks as Trump administration officials have railed against partner nations for not doing enough, largely regarding the war in Ukraine and NATO funding.\n\nAn Army official told CNN that troops on the ground \u201csee things that others might not\u201d regarding working with allies, and the recovery operation of the last few days has only further shown that.\n\n\u201cFor us, that\u2019s politics, that\u2019s not our bailiwick. \u2026 For those that say our allies aren\u2019t doing enough, those are people that didn\u2019t see this,\u201d the official said. \u201cThose are people that didn\u2019t pay attention to this, that weren\u2019t watching. For all of us soldier, I think if I was the one in that Hercules, Lithuania is the country I would want helping to bring me home to my family.\u201d\n\nAfter finding the submerged vehicle, Lithuanian divers were on the scene \u201cvery rapidly,\u201d Maj. Nicholas Chopp, spokesman for US Army Europe and Africa, told CNN. Poland also started mobilizing dozens of engineers and sappers, or combat engineers.\n\n\u201cThere was literally chief of defense to chief of defense conversations happening between Lithuania and Poland\u201d to coordinate support, Chopp said. He added that the Lithuanian defense minister and prime Minister were on the ground at the recovery site nearly every day, if not daily, to \u201ccome talk to the rescuers on the ground and say, \u2018What do you need that you don\u2019t have?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an entire country bent towards these efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Army\u2019s release on Monday said Lithuania provided helicopters, drones, fixed-wing aircraft, and search and rescue personnel, as well as excavators, pumps to get water out of the bog\ufeff, various technical experts, and \u201cother heavy construction equipment.\u201d The Army official said Lithuania has not asked to be reimbursed for their efforts in the recovery, saying everything they\u2019ve done \u201cis out of pocket.\u201d\n\nThe release on Monday also said the Archbishop Metropolitan of Vilnius \u201cled a mass at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Stanislaus and St. Ladislaus of Vilnius, March 30, to pray for the four Soldiers, their families, and those conducting recovery operations.\u201d\n\nCol. Martin O\u2019Donnell, spokesman for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, told CNN that allies helping allies is \u201cwhat an alliance is all about.\u201d\n\n\u201c[NATO] and these allies have done and continue to do all they can to recover America\u2019s missing soldiers,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cAs the Lithuanian Minister of Defense said earlier this week, \u2018just as America doesn\u2019t leave its own behind, we in Lithuania don\u2019t leave our own behind either.\u2019\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump used contentiousness around transgender people\u2019s access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds. And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt\u2019s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board \u2014 particularly Trump\u2019s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies \u2014 along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president\u2019s spotlight is giving Monday\u2019s Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n\u201cWhat he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,\u201d said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. \u201cWe have to show him we won\u2019t go back.\u201d\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nThe focus on trans people is part of a long-running campaign\n\nTrump\u2019s actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women\u2019s spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort \u201cto reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land\u201d that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt\u2019s not just political gamesmanship. \u201cI think that whether or not that\u2019s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,\u201d Fordham\u2019s Murib said.\n\nMany voters think trans rights have gone too far\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election \u2014 55% \u2014 said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn\u2019t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris\u2019 voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it\u2019s been about right and about one-quarter said it\u2019s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump\u2019s and Republicans\u2019 positions have given them a political edge.\n\n\u201cThey are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\u201cPeople across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,\u201d said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nThe full political fallout remains to be seen\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s so small, it\u2019s relatively unknown,\u201d said Currah, who is transgender. \u201cAnd then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what\u2019s wrong with the left. You know: \u2018It\u2019s just too crazy. It\u2019s too woke.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n\u201cA lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,\u201d Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n\u201cThe Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,\u201d National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women\u2019s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women\u2019s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience \u2026 to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,\u201d she said. But \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nNearly a dozen known students and faculty members at colleges across the country have been detained by federal agents amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration, which on college campuses, has taken aim at pro-Palestinian student activists and Israel critics.\n\nMany of those detained have been granted the right to live in the US either as permanent residents or through temporary work or student visas. Their rights, however, have been put into question under new, sweeping immigration orders that some legal experts fear may be used liberally to clamp down on dissent.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that under his direction, more than 300 visas \u2013\u2013 \u201cprimarily student visas, some visitor visas\u201d \u2013\u2013 have been revoked. Rubio did not specify how many visas belonged to people tied to the pro-Palestinian movement.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re taking activities that are counter to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we\u2019ll revoke the visa,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nWhen asked about freedom of speech concerns, Rubio said international students are \u201chere to study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here to go to class. They\u2019re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it\u2019s lunacy to continue to allow that.\u201d\n\nHere is what we know about the detainment of college activists.\n\nMahmoud Khalil\n\nMahmoud Khalil speaks during a press briefing organized by pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus on June 1, 2024, in New York City. Selcuk Acar/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and one of the school\u2019s most prominent pro-Palestinian activists, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nHe was arrested by federal agents on March 8 and taken to a detention facility in Louisiana after his lawyer said his green card was revoked by the Trump administration.\n\nThe administration ordered for Khalil to be deported after baselessly claiming he is a Hamas sympathizer, a threat to national security, and poses \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d\n\nOfficials later said Khalil\u2019s deportation was justified because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident \u2013\u2013 an argument his attorneys call weak.\n\nOn March 19, a judge blocked the government indefinitely from deporting Khalil and transferred his case to New Jersey.\n\nSince his detention, Department of Justice officials have sought to keep Khalil\u2019s case in Louisiana \u2013\u2013 a move which Khalil\u2019s legal team argue will cause hardship for his attorneys and his family.\n\nA federal district court on Friday declined to say whether the US government\u2019s case against Khalil should be heard in New Jersey. Khalil\u2019s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is an American citizen and 8 months pregnant, sat in the front row of the gallery during the proceedings.\n\nBadar Khan Suri\n\nFlyers in support of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University professor, are seen, demanding his release from a deportation process over his views on Palestinians and the war in Gaza, at Georgetown University in Washington. Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nBadar Khan Suri, an Indian national and Georgetown scholar whose research focuses on peacebuilding in the Middle East was arrested in his Virginia home in mid-March after his J-1 visa was revoked.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Khan Suri was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d and that he had \u201cclose connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d\n\nLike other student detainees, Khan Suri has been accused of posing a threat to national security. He is currently being held in detention in Louisiana.\n\nHis defense team denies the US government claims and argues Khan Suri\u2019s detainment is part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to clamp down on individuals \u201cpurportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech,\u201d according to his court petition.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s attorney also believes he\u2019s being targeted because his wife is a prominent Palestinian activist.\n\nKhan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as Deputy of Foreign Affairs in Gaza until 2010, according to a court filing.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a Georgetown University spokesperson said, \u201cWe expect the legal system to adjudicate (Khan Suri\u2019s) case fairly.\u201d\n\nRumeysa Ozturk\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, poses in an undated photograph provided by her family and obtained by Reuters. Ozturk Family/Reuters\n\nTurkish national Rumeysa Ozturk was on her way to break the Ramadan fast in late March when she was arrested and physically restrained by six plainclothes officers near her apartment by Tufts University\u2019s Somerville campus.\n\nThe arrest, which was captured on surveillance video, was described by Tufts President Sunil Kumar as \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nIn March 2024, the PhD student cowrote an op-ed in the school\u2019s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts\u2019 response to a student government group\u2019s call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands.\n\nWhen asked about Ozturk\u2019s case, Rubio suggested, without evidence, that the 30-year-old participated in disruptive student protests over Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza.\n\nA DHS spokesperson told CNN that Ozturk \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas,\u201d but did not specify what those alleged activities were.\n\nOzturk is currently being held at a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to Homeland Security. While in transit to Louisiana, she suffered an asthma attack, according to an amended habeas corpus petition filed Friday. Ozturk has also not been charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer.\n\nOn Friday, a judge in Boston ordered Ozturk not to be deported until she can determine whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if Ozturk was lawfully detained \u2013\u2013 a decision that drew praise from Ozturk\u2019s lawyers.\n\nA student at the University of Minnesota\n\nThe University of Minnesota said in a campus-wide letter that an international graduate student was detained by immigration officials at an off-campus residence.\n\nThe university did not identify the student but called their arrest \u201ca deeply concerning situation.\u201d\n\nDHS initially declined to comment to CNN on the case and deferred questions to ICE. The attorney for the detained student also declined to comment to CNN, saying it\u2019s a \u201chighly sensitive situation\u201d and they want to protect their client\u2019s privacy.\n\nOn Monday, a senior DHS official told CNN the student was taken into custody because of a prior drunken driving incident.\n\n\u201cThis is not related to student protests,\u201d the official said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThe individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.\u201d\n\nDetaining an international student over a prior DUI conviction seems to suggest a different approach by immigration officials who, so far, appear focused on students who have participated in protests against the Israel Hamas war.\n\nThe unidentified student\u2019s detainment has drawn the ire of local, state and national leaders like Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Democratic Minnesota Gov, Tim Walz \u2013\u2013 all who are demanding answers from ICE.\n\nOther students and scholars targeted\n\nRasha Alawieh, an assistant professor with a valid US visa at Brown Medical School, was deported from Boston to Lebanon after federal agents discovered that she attended former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s funeral in February.

            "full_content": "Tim Walz at a town-hall meeting in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in March. Photo: Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Minnesota Star Tribune/Getty Images\n\nEvery Democrat seems to have their own diagnosis for why the party lost power in Washington last year, but only one of them was on the vice-presidential ticket. Minnesota governor Tim Walz catapulted himself over other Democrats to be Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate by famously calling Republicans, especially J.D. Vance, weird. Today, he has a label for his own party: \u201ctimid.\u201d\n\nFor the past several weeks, Walz has been barnstorming Republican congressional districts to press the case for his party, which has hit rock-bottom approval with its own voters for not fighting harder against Donald Trump. I spoke with him a few hours before a town-hall meeting outside Houston with Beto O\u2019Rourke that drew thousands, where Walz argued that Democrats had let Republicans define DEI and immigration, issues they hammered the party on in 2024. Looking at crowd size alone, Walz seems to be on to something: Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez and Bernie Sanders have drawn even larger crowds of tens of thousands to hear their prescription for \u201cfighting oligarchy.\u201d In our interview, Walz faulted his party for not delivering major change for voters during the Trump era, even saying Harris wasn\u2019t allowed to be bold enough after replacing Joe Biden as the nominee. Democrats, he said, could have the same sort of success he has had in Minnesota during two terms, but the party is afraid to be bold.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the meaning of these crowds we\u2019re seeing for you, AOC, and Bernie?\n\nIt\u2019s good, and it\u2019s good for my soul, too, because after these first couple months I was deeply concerned, and remain concerned, that folks had become disengaged and with the number of people who did not vote. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d But it doesn\u2019t appear that\u2019s happening. I think the Democratic Party would be wise to listen to what folks are saying, to understand why they\u2019re willing to wait in line, and to take some lessons from that. How do we not be a party that seems very misunderstood by a lot of the public?\n\nDoes that mean the people coming to these events were engaged and voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024?\n\nYeah, I think a lot of them were. I felt a primal scream of \u201cJust do something!\u201d People want to be engaged and make a difference, and they don\u2019t know what that looks like. So I think this is a way to gather in community.\n\nAre any of these people ones who didn\u2019t come out to vote or who voted for Trump?\n\nYes. A woman wore a Marianne Williamson shirt the other day to my event in Wisconsin, and she said, \u201cI want to give Democrats a chance.\u201d She was there because she does not agree with Donald Trump, but she wasn\u2019t sure about the Democrats. Look, I think it\u2019s mostly folks who supported the vice-president and myself, but that\u2019s not totally it. And then there\u2019s a lot of folks who are showing up who maybe voted, maybe hadn\u2019t, but the implications of these policies are raining down on them.\n\nThere was a transgender airwoman in Omaha \u2014 highly specialized, highly trained \u2014 who wasn\u2019t able to deploy. I have no idea what her politics were beforehand, but she was there to ask a very specific question: \u201cWhat happens to me now?\u201d So it\u2019s that. \u201cWhat happens to my Parkinson\u2019s disease?\u201d \u201cWhat happens to my son who\u2019s got a million-dollar insurance bill and we\u2019re using Medicaid?\u201d Those are the people showing up.\n\nWhat is the elevator pitch for the Democratic Party?\n\nWhen I was growing up, there was little question the Democratic Party was there for labor unions, was there for workers, and the Republican Party was there for the wealthy \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t necessarily a pejorative, it was just the way it was. Apparently, now, whether it\u2019s our low approval ratings or the millions who stayed home, people aren\u2019t so certain that\u2019s true. I think our policies are popular: paid family medical leave, protection of reproductive rights, investments in infrastructure. But that\u2019s not getting to them.\n\nI keep saying this, and the teacher in me knows this so well: You teach a lesson, and a big chunk of kids don\u2019t get it or don\u2019t understand the concept. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re dumb; you have to teach it differently. Not everybody learns by verbal. Not everyone learns by seeing it. Some of them have to touch. Some of them have to do it themselves. Some of them have to do trial and error.\n\nWe as the Democrats think if there\u2019s a golden message and we get a charismatic leader and we just send it out, everybody\u2019s going to gravitate to us. A whole large number do, and I\u2019ve been making the case that in these special elections, these off-year elections, we do really well. Those are people who watch the news every night. But during a presidential year, there are folks who are busy, they don\u2019t live politics all the time, and we apparently don\u2019t reach them in any meaningful way. This has happened for three cycles. So I\u2019m listening to folks, saying, \u201cWhat can we do to resonate with you better?\u201d\n\nBut even in cycles where Democrats were ultimately successful, it has felt like the party\u2019s self-critique centered on better messaging. To me, this cycle\u2019s results suggest there needs to be bigger change than just reaching voters where they are.\n\nCritics keep saying, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got to message better to them.\u201d Well, I\u2019m not going to demonize immigrants, and I\u2019m not going to advocate for terrorists [after the interview, a spokesman said Walz was referring to defending Vladimir Putin and foreign dictators], and I\u2019m not going to do a white-power thing. I\u2019m not going to get rid of saying \u201cOur diversity is our strength.\u201d\n\nLook, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re very entertaining, either, like Bill Clinton playing his saxophone.\n\nWe need to make sure there\u2019s something in this party for you. The folks who are MAGA got a common uniform, a common language, common things they talk about. Democrats, don\u2019t know if we have that. But look, our policies poll favorably, so if that\u2019s the case yet people are voting against them, then we\u2019re not reaching them, we\u2019re not doing it right, the messenger\u2019s wrong. We need to look at it all.\n\nEven the most prominent Democrats are looking to keep some kind of distance from the party. AOC is aligned with Democratic Socialists. Bernie Sanders is an independent. And you identify as a member of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, a DFL-er, correct?\n\nI\u2019m a DFL-er, yeah.\n\nWhy not identify as a Democrat? I mean, you were on the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nYeah, no, you\u2019re on to it. Look, I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t have this worked out in my mind yet, but you hit on something I\u2019ve been talking about. If it were up to me, since I\u2019m a DFL-er, I think we message our party as Democratic-farmer-labor, Democratic-worker-labor, and get more to the core of who we are. Because sometimes your brand gets damaged, you know?\n\nShould Chuck Schumer stay on as leader?\n\nWell, the Senate\u2019s got to make its own decision on that.\n\nWhat do you say to the people who ask why they should listen to you or to other prominent Democratic officials at this point?\n\nWell, I\u2019m going to say this: I take my lumps, and I\u2019m a team player, and as I say, I am proud to have been with the vice-president. But my work has been done in Minnesota, where we won. We also had a Democratic trifecta where we passed incredibly important legislation with a very slim majority \u2014 things that are very popular. So I have made the case that we are too timid. If you think we win back the presidency in \u201928 and you think we\u2019re going to pass some subsidies for the ACA exchange, you\u2019re sadly mistaken. The people who stand up at my town hall and say, \u201cMy God, I can\u2019t do this anymore. My entire life is dependent on what happens with each presidential election\u201d \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be that way. Health care should transcend presidential elections. So I\u2019ve been making the case \u2014 and we did it in Minnesota, and I think you\u2019re seeing it in some other states \u2014 to be bold. I think that\u2019s the AOC-Bernie message, too.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like the party was very bold when you and Harris got on the ticket in the latter half of the 2024 campaign.\n\nI think we\u2019re cautious by nature. And look, I said this and I told the vice-president, I said I know my strengths and weaknesses. I said about 90 percent of the time, I can be really good, but about 10 percent of the time, I can be a train wreck because I\u2019m speaking from the heart, like a teacher sitting in a teachers lounge or a laborer sitting at the break table.\n\nI thought they would choose the district attorney and the teacher over the hedge-fund manager and the billionaire.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they?\n\nI don\u2019t \u2014 look, the folks who voted for Trump are going to vote for Trump. My biggest concern are the folks who stayed home. And that goes back to this idea of what the Democratic Party is, who\u2019s standing with us, and \u201cWho do I identify more with?\u201d Maybe we\u2019re not aspirational.\n\nI heard this from someone who said, \u201cWith Democratic go-to messages, basically to Black men, these Democratic politicians led with \u2018We restored felon voting rights,\u2019 and the Black men said, \u2018But we\u2019re not felons, we\u2019re MBAs looking for capital.\u2019\u201d The restoration of felon voting rights is important \u2014 I did that in Minnesota \u2014 but it\u2019s not aspirational. With Donald Trump, everything\u2019s gold plated and he\u2019s hanging around with these stars, and I don\u2019t know if we do enough of that.\n\nYou\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t have an opportunity to be bold during the campaign?\n\nWell, I won\u2019t critique the campaign. They need to do what they need to do, but I don\u2019t think Vice-President Harris got to be bold. We were dealing with a short runway. That was that one election. I think it would be foolish for us to take a ton of lessons from that because this has been going on for several cycles, certainly since 2016, that we are really struggling to broaden our appeal and energize folks.\n\nWhat does being bolder look like?\n\nWe\u2019re asking them to come to rallies not so we can get capital and get reelected but so we can burn it as fast as we can to improve their lives. I heard Ezra Klein say, \u201cYeah, Biden was incredibly bold,\u201d and I talked about this: \u201cMore money ever invested in broadband ever,\u201d and we\u2019ve connected like 12 houses. We didn\u2019t get it done. I think this goes back to the bureaucracy. This goes back to us status quo\u2013ing. Look, I\u2019m not going to do the Republican message that government\u2019s horrible, it should get out of our way, it should be involved in nothing. But I am going to say if you\u2019re going to believe in collective will, you need to get it done for people. We need to tell \u2019em we\u2019re going to burn this political capital and we\u2019re going to get these things done whether that is health care, whether that is paid family medical leave, whether that is moving toward climate policies that make sense rather than just talking about it. I think a lot of folks like what the Democrats are saying, but they don\u2019t believe we can get it done.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of scandal right now with the Trump administration, and I don\u2019t see any actual damaging consequences, like with the Signal fiasco. How do you fight, given that?\n\nI agree. Look, there\u2019s nobody who has served in the military who\u2019s buying this bullshit between attack plans and war plans. They were telegraphing where our troops would be before they would be there. My question is will the press give them a pass? Trump saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what was really going on\u201d? What the hell?\n\nKaroline Leavitt is yelling at the Wall Street Journal op-ed page. It feels like the press isn\u2019t sleeping on this scandal.\n\nYeah. No, you\u2019re right. I hope they hold them accountable. We just need a few courageous Republicans.\n\nAnd some Democrats, though, right?\n\nI agree. I saw Tammy Duckworth give the most full-throated talk. I saw Marty Heinrich talk about this. I saw Andy Kim. And look, I\u2019m around some fairly conservative folks saying, \u201cI can\u2019t defend this.\u201d We need to tap into that. At a minimum, I would\u2019ve thought they\u2019d have fired Mike Waltz, which would\u2019ve been good for me because I\u2019m tired of people getting confused.\n\nThis is the time for us to find our spine, push \u2019em \u2014 this should\u2019ve been and would\u2019ve been a slam dunk. It was a screwup. Somebody should\u2019ve taken accountability \u2014 the president \u2014 and they should\u2019ve let these people go. And I hope that\u2019s how it ends."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nRanjani Srinivasan was busy talking to an adviser at Columbia University when the federal agents first came to her door. The day before she\u2019d got an unexpected email that her student visa had been canceled, and she was trying to get information.\n\n\u201cIt was my roommate who heard the knock and immediately recognized (it as) law enforcement,\u201d Srinivasan told CNN. \u201cShe asked them \u2018Do you have a warrant?\u2019 And they had to say \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was stunned and scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember telling the adviser \u2018ICE is at my door and you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m fine? Do something.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey returned another day, also without a warrant, Srinivasan said. Matters escalated when they came a third time, with a judge\u2019s permission to enter the Columbia apartment. By then she had already left the country.\n\nThe biggest question for Srinivasan is why they came at all.\n\nSrinivasan had renewed her student visa just a few months earlier, being granted permission for another five years in the United States \u2014 more than enough time to complete her PhD in urban planning. She was no stranger to immigration rules, having won a Fulbright scholarship to Harvard University for her master\u2019s degree and then returning to her native India for the requisite two years after.\n\nHer dream acceptance at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation coincided with the beginning of the Covid pandemic, so she started her studies in Chennai, India, before making it to New York City.\n\nBy last month, the end of her doctorate was almost in sight, she was grading papers for the students she was teaching and fretting over a deadline for a journal. Far from her mind was a night almost a year before when she got caught up in a crowd.\n\nThat evening in April 2024 she\u2019d been trying to get back to her university apartment from a staff picnic when she was swept up in a police operation against a crowd protesting Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza, she said.\n\nI did not mean to deceive anyone \u2026 If I made a mistake, I would have been happy to clarify it to the state Ranjani Srinivasan\n\nSrinivasan had only just returned to the US, having been away from Columbia since before the war began and generated passionate protests. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know what was going to happen that day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole perimeter of the neighborhood had been barricaded.\u201d Unable to prove she lived there, she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to her street, so she ended up circling the neighborhood, looking for a way through, she told CNN.\n\n\u201cThey kept shifting the barricades, and then I think around 200 cops descended, and they kind of charged at us. It was absolute confusion. People were screaming, falling, people were running out of the way,\u201d she said. Too small to force her way through the melee, she ended up in a large group of people detained by the police.\n\nShe said she was held with the crowd for several hours but never fingerprinted or booked for an arrest. She was given two pink-colored summonses by the New York Police Department \u2014 one for obstructing pedestrian traffic and the other for failure to disperse \u2014 before being released. A lawyer working pro bono for a number of the students got the summonses dismissed even before she had to appear in court. That means there should be no record against her, and as far as Srinivasan was concerned, she could forget the whole thing.\n\nShe did not report the dismissed summonses on her visa renewal.\n\nWhen asked why Srinivasan\u2019s visa was revoked, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement \u201cthese citations were not disclosed.\u201d\n\nThat was never mentioned to Srinivasan when she was told her visa had been taken away.\n\n\u201cI did not mean to deceive anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I made a mistake, I would have been happy to clarify it to the state.\u201d\n\nBut she was never given the chance.\n\n\u2018A punitive dragnet\u2019\n\nAccording to local so-called sanctuary laws, federal authorities should not have even known Srinivasan had ever been detained, according to her lawyer, Nathan Yaffe.\n\n\u201cNew York City is supposed to have protections in place to prevent people who don\u2019t commit crimes, who haven\u2019t been in any kind of trouble, from getting caught in this sort of punitive dragnet that the administration is implementing here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut clearly the federal government has access to the summons database or to other data that allows them to see even when people aren\u2019t fingerprinted, even when people don\u2019t have any criminal case, even when the only allegation against them is entirely dismissed.\u201d\n\nIt was very clear to her, rightly so, that this government would stop at nothing to pursue her, even though their pursuit of her was based on nothing Nathan Yaffe, Srinivasan's lawyer\n\nNo one from DHS, the NYPD or Columbia University responded to CNN requests about how federal authorities became aware of this case. When asked about Srinivasan by CNN at a news conference, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said: \u201cI\u2019ll say it over and over again: New York City Police Department, they do not collaborate for civil enforcement.\u201d He said he would look into it but his office has not got back to CNN.\n\nFor Srinivasan, the sudden escalation was alarming. She says she had attended protests in her time in the US, but as much to experience American culture as to exercise free speech.\n\nDemonstrators rally outside Columbia University in upper Manhattan on March 14. Dave Sanders/The New York Times/Redux\n\nBut she was seeing others being detained under orders from the Trump administration and was afraid.\n\n\u201cYou keep going back, thinking \u2018Have I done something?\u2019 And there are no answers there,\u201d she said.\n\nShe knew Columbia University graduate student and US permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and put in detention in Louisiana, and did not want to take that risk.\n\n\u201cIt was very clear to her, rightly so, that this government would stop at nothing to pursue her, even though their pursuit of her was based on nothing,\u201d Yaffe said.\n\nSrinivasan went to LaGuardia Airport and took a flight to Canada.\n\nAgents searched her home\n\nGovernment officers, now in possession of a warrant, went back to her apartment.\n\nFour agents, three with their faces covered, spent several minutes inside.\n\nThey asked Srinivasan\u2019s roommate to stay in her room. \u201cIf not, you can leave,\u201d one agent said, as heard on a video recording taken by the roommate that CNN has viewed.\n\nAnother said he would explain the warrant \u201cif you would like to put down your phone.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security on X\n\n\u201cWe have a warrant to search this premises for electronics, documents related to Ranjani Srinivasan,\u201d continued the officer who identified himself as coming from \u201cHomeland Security\u201d as the roommate recorded. \u201cDid you get enough video?\u201d he added.\n\nThe officers left, taking nothing for evidence.\n\nA DHS news release heralded Srinivasan\u2019s departure but did not mention unreported summonses, instead alleging she was \u201cinvolved in activities supporting Hamas.\u201d The release was headlined: \u201cColumbia University Student Whose Visa Was Revoked for Supporting Hamas and Terrorist Activities Used CBP Home App to Self-Deport.\u201d The app, introduced the day before Srinivasan left, includes a feature for immigrants without legal permission to be in the US to inform the government they intend to depart.\n\nThere was also a damning post on X from Secretary Kristi Noem: \u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country. I\u2019m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport.\u201d\n\nYaffe said the statements about Srinivasan were \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has basically been a private person, pursuing her studies and pursuing her career,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a student, and they not only took that away from her in the sense of forcing her out of the country \u2026 but they also took away her privacy, obviously, and made her the huge public face of this campaign of repression that they\u2019re undertaking with the deliberate desire, as the administration has said, to send a message to other students.\u201d\n\nSrinivasan also takes issue with how she was portrayed. She denies using the CBP Home app, saying it wasn\u2019t on her phone and anyway her device was almost dead at the airport. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the app existed. I just left,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for her politics, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not a terrorist sympathizer, I\u2019m not a pro-Hamas activist. I\u2019m just literally a random student \u2026 It just seems very strange that they would spend so much, vast resources, in persecuting me.\u201d\n\nFor now, she\u2019s trying to stay optimistic about getting back to her life and doctorate. She was due to complete it in May. She hopes somehow Columbia can reenroll her so her five years of study with them is not for naught.\n\nBut she\u2019s unhappy with the actions of the Ivy League school, which has made policy changes apparently to address demands from the Trump administration since she left. The interim president of Columbia University stepped down the following week.\n\n\u201cI do think that Columbia should have protected me against this. I think that that\u2019s part of their mandate,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re attracting these international students to come and study at Columbia, when you go and do outreach all across the world to attract the best and the brightest, you have a mandate to protect them.\u201d\n\nShe might be an expert in planning, but Srinivasan is not trying to look too far ahead and is set on two goals.\n\n\u201cI want my PhD. I want my name cleared.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Green Bay, Wisconsin CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk has thrust himself into the center of a state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. Democrats are trying to use it to their advantage.\n\nIn the final stretch of the election, Musk has intensified his involvement in the contest, pouring millions of his personal fortune into the state to boost the conservative candidate, Brad Schimel. On Sunday, the tech billionaire made the trek to Wisconsin to directly pitch voters and handed out two $1 million checks to attendees at a town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got to mobilize everywhere like crazy for the next 48 hours,\u201d said Musk, who started the event wearing a cheesehead that he threw into the crowd. \u201cI think this will be important for the future of civilization. It\u2019s that significant.\u201d\n\nThe liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, and her Democratic allies are using Musk\u2019s involvement to frame the race as a referendum on him, betting it will motivate voters turned off by his big spending on the race or by DOGE efforts to slash the federal government.\n\nDane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Crawford, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, greets supporters during a campaign stop in Milwaukee on Saturday. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe push comes as the April 1 contest is set to provide the first electoral gauge of voter sentiment in the opening months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, in which Musk and DOGE have played a central role. The race also will test Musk\u2019s influence on local races after he spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to aid Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign.\n\nThe matchup between Crawford, a Dane County Circuit Court judge, and Schimel, a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and former state attorney general, will determine the ideological balance of Wisconsin\u2019s high court, which currently has a liberal majority. The contest is officially nonpartisan but has attracted attention from the national political parties and will offer insight into how the swing state\u2019s voters are assessing the early months of Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nIn the first major election of the year, Musk and groups aligned with him have poured more than $20 million into the race. America PAC, the super PAC Musk formed to support Trump in 2024, has disclosed more than $12 million in spending on messaging and field operations so far.\n\nMusk has also personally contributed $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party for the contest, while Building America\u2019s Future, another group with links to the DOGE leader, has spent more than $7 million on waves of sharp attack ads targeting the liberal candidate in the race.\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Musk\u2019s PAC reprised controversial get-out-the-vote tactics used in the 2024 election. America PAC launched a petition against \u201cactivist judges,\u201d offering Wisconsin signers $100 and an additional $100 for each additional signer they referred. The group later announced it would offer $1 million awards to signers of the petition, with the first check delivered to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay.\n\nAnd Musk invited fresh controversy with an early Friday X post saying he would speak at an event in Wisconsin on Sunday and present $1 million checks to two people \u201cin appreciation for you taking the time to vote.\u201d Entrance to the event was also limited to those \u201cwho have voted in the Supreme Court election.\u201d\n\nBy Friday afternoon, Musk had deleted the original post and clarified that those who signed the petition would be admitted into the event and the million-dollar checks would be presented to \u201c2 people to be spokesmen for the petition.\u201d\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul attempted to block Musk\u2019s cash giveaway by asking the state Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court denied his initial lawsuit on the matter.\n\nMusk presents a one million dollar check to an attendee during Sunday's town hall in Green Bay. Jamie Kelter Davis/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut the court denied Kaul\u2019s request in a decision that came just minutes before Musk\u2019s event was scheduled to begin.\n\nAt the town hall Sunday, Musk handed out two $1 million checks \u201cin appreciation\u201d to two attendees who had signed the petition \u2014 Nicholas Jacobs and Ekaterina Diestler. He also announced the creation of a \u201cblock captain program,\u201d offering further cash incentives two days before the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to pull a rabbit out of the hat, next level,\u201d Musk said, noting that betting odds strongly favor Crawford. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually got to have a steady stream of rabbits out of the hat, like it\u2019s an arc of rabbits flying through the air and landing in a voting booth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically what\u2019s needed, is we need to generate an anomaly in the matrix,\u201d he continued.\n\nSchimel, who received Trump\u2019s endorsement, has argued Musk\u2019s political operation is working independently of his campaign. But he did team up with Musk for a discussion on X in recent weeks. Asked by CNN about voters who think Musk should have stayed out of the race, Schimel decried big money from Democrats.\n\n\u201cI hope that they also think George Soros and JB Pritzker and others (should) stay out,\u201d Schimel said after an event in Elkhorn. \u201cWhy are they so worried about what Elon Musk does that I can\u2019t control when (Crawford\u2019s) got money coming directly into her campaign that she can control?\u201d\n\nLiberal megadonors have waded into the race, though on a smaller scale than Musk. Financier George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have donated a combined $3.5 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, which can transfer money to Crawford\u2019s campaign. The race has smashed spending records to become the most expensive judicial contest in US history.\n\nCrawford and her Democratic allies have run ads trying to tie Musk to Schimel, and she frequently brings up Musk in her campaign speeches, including at one point jokingly referring to the billionaire as \u201cmy opponent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this comes down to, you know, red or blue or Democrat or Republican,\u201d Crawford told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cI think all voters in Wisconsin should be concerned about this, about somebody coming in and trying to buy a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nDebates over Tesla and redistricting\n\nMusk\u2019s election engagement comes as Tesla is waging a legal battle over a state law that prevents the electric vehicle company from opening company-owned stores in Wisconsin. Crawford has used the lawsuit, which could make its way to the state\u2019s Supreme Court, to argue Musk surged money to the race because of his business interests.\n\n\u201cElon Musk wants to sell more cars here. So that\u2019s one way to do it,\u201d Crawford said at a stop in Janesville. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for access and influence to the Wisconsin judiciary.\u201d\n\nPressed by a reporter on whether he would recuse himself from the Tesla case if it came before the court, Schimel said he would evaluate the circumstances the same as any other case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running to uphold the law as the legislature passes,\u201d Schimel said last week. \u201cSo if his reason is to support me because he thinks he\u2019s going to get a result he wants, he might be supporting the wrong candidate.\u201d\n\nThe potential redrawing of congressional maps also has emerged as a campaign flashpoint. The court could weigh redistricting in a state where Republicans hold six out of eight US House seats even as statewide races have seen narrow victories for both parties. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries recently said the way to address \u201cgerrymandered congressional lines\u201d in the state is with \u201can enlightened Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nA resident drops their ballot into the box during in-person absentee voting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Wednesday. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nMusk also touched on the issue at his event Sunday, portraying the stakes in dramatic terms. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Tuesday is a vote for which party controls the US House of Representatives,\u201d he said. \u201cWhichever party controls the House, to a significant degree controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization. I feel like it\u2019s one of those things that may not seem it\u2019s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.\u201d\n\nCrawford, in an interview, told CNN that if the court took up the validity of congressional maps, she would \u201cexamine what the facts are based on the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll apply the law and make a decision that does not take politics into account but that follows the law,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nVoters are mixed on Musk\u2019s involvement\n\nPolitics usually is not the focus on Monday afternoons at RiversEdge Bowl in Janesville, where several dozen seniors take over most of the lanes for their weekly bowling league. But in the closing stretch of the election, many of the bowling voters were keyed in on the race and frustrated with the flood of outside money.\n\n\u201cThese people are interfering where they shouldn\u2019t interfere,\u201d said Marvin Whitson, a Trump voter who is undecided but leaning toward Schimel in the Supreme Court contest. \u201c(Musk) should stick to figuring out what he\u2019s supposed to be figuring out for the government and let us do our job as voters.\u201d\n\nCircuit Court Judge Brad Schimel, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, speaks to supporters during a campaign stop in Milwaukee on Saturday, Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nRaymond Huntoon, an independent who favors Crawford for the seat, said Musk\u2019s spending in the race is among the issues factoring into his vote.\n\n\u201cFor a judge to have that kind of money going into it, somebody wants something from up above,\u201d Huntoon said. \u201cHe could be like your puppeteer and be pulling, pulling the strings on something that him or the president wants to get through.\u201d\n\nGeorge Buehl, a Trump voter who is supporting Schimel, disagreed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think one side is any better than the other when it comes to the money. That\u2019s part of life,\u201d Buehl said. \u201cI\u2019m not in favor of the left-wing agenda that\u2019s going on with the Democratic Party, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna make sure I\u2019m there, because I\u2019m trying to stop it.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s David Wright and Fredreka Schouten contributed reporting."

            "full_content": "As a conservative woman living in Texas, I often feel like I'm living a dual reality. I'm a mom and a writer, but that's not all. I go to church, laugh with friends and wave at my neighbors while we are walking our dogs.\n\nAt dinner, my kids and I discuss the Beatitudes, the Bill of Rights and the best and worst things that happened that day (we call them highs and lows). I love to cook, hate to clean and probably need to have a better morning routine. My life is similar to millions of other women in America.\n\nBut online, in the legacy news media and in my increasingly ugly inbox, I live in a different world. In that world, I'm portrayed \u2212 and viewed \u2212 through a singular lens: my conservative beliefs. As such, I am easy to hate, mock and scorn.\n\nI am far from the only woman who experiences this abuse. Progressives claim to value women, but they routinely demonize conservative women who refuse to conform to the molds that the left tries to force us into. That's not only bad for women like me and for our society, but it's also a poor reflection of reality. Tens of millions of American women embrace traditional values and conservative ideas.\n\nWe're also more than our politics.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe demonization of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\n\nThe Washington Post provides a recent example of how conservative women are so often demeaned and patronized in the mainstream media. Last Monday's profile of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, written by reporter Kara Voght, drips with condescension, starting with the headline: \"In Karoline Leavitt's world, Trump's word is enough.\"\n\nLeavitt is a 27-year-old devout Christian and conservative who has been an excellent spokeswoman for President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nBut The Post tried to smear her faith, personality and confidence from the start of the article: \"Trump\u2019s newest press secretary is radiant, blond and apple-cheeked \u2012 as if one of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Madonnas had been styled for a Fox News hit. Her delivery is righteous, if a bit smug. God gives everyone gifts, Leavitt believes; hers is public speaking. And for roughly a half hour, once or twice a week, she delivers Trump\u2019s word to a room filled with professional skeptics.\"\n\nIf the trivializing of an accomplished woman wasn't so disgusting, I'd laugh. Can you imagine The Post smugly diminishing a progressive woman (or man) as \"radiant, blond and apple-cheeked\"?\n\nLeavitt isn't the only conservative woman to recently receive The Post's patronizing treatment. A profile of second lady Usha Vance began with this sentence: \"Most of what we know about Usha Vance we know because her husband told us.\"\n\nNever mind that Vance is an accomplished lawyer who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts on the U.S. Supreme Court. Ignore that she graduated from Yale University with a law degree and a bachelor's degree and from Cambridge with a master's. Brush aside that she has served on the boards of the Washington National Opera and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.\n\nWe only know, according to The Post, what her husband allows her to tell us.\n\nAnother Post news story \u2212 a profile of conservative influencer Alex Clark published the day before the elections in November \u2212 is laced with opinionated and condescending observations. Clark, for example, is accused of engaging in conspiratorial thinking about the food industry, \"consistent with the right\u2019s Trump-inspired paranoia about deep-state master planning.\"\n\nEach of those profiles was written or cowritten by Voght, who worked for Mother Jones and Rolling Stone, both ultraliberal publications, before joining The Post as a politics reporter.\n\nThe disdain for conservative women isn't confined to The Post. Recent Salon headlines have been even more pointed in their attacks, including this one: \"The misogynist agenda of \"MAHA moms.\" Conservative aren't just wrong, you see, they hate women, including presumably themselves.\n\nSalon also gave us this affront to good taste \u2012 \"From 'Mar-a-Lago face' to uncanny AI art: MAGA loves ugly in submission to Trump.\" The article, by senior writer Amanda Marcotte, is filled with cruel attacks on the appearance of conservative women in leadership positions, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nThe article includes this gem: \"Drag queens also embrace outlandish gender performance, but it's to subvert rigid gender roles instead of reinforcing them. That, plus your typical drag queen knows how to make five pounds of make-up look cool instead of gross, but they won't share their secrets with the ladies of the GOP.\"\n\nDrag queens are cool. Conservative women are gross. And that is what passes for journalism in 2025.\n\nTune in to ABC's \"The View\" to see the progressive hosts, all women, rip on the conservative women in the Trump administration. No one is more misogynistic to conservative women than liberal women. Again, the irony would be funny if not so disgusting.\n\nVoght and Marcotte are part of a bevy of legacy media reporters who seem to be liberals first and journalists second. That bias has destroyed the news industry's credibility but perversely also has hurt more than helped their allies in the Democratic Party.\n\nConservative women are denigrated for their beliefs\n\nFor all their flaws, Democrats used to promote tolerance and inclusivity. They used to at least say they embraced women's rights.\n\nBut tolerance apparently doesn't extend to the many women who exercise their right to form their own beliefs and to vote for the candidates of their own choosing. In progressives' eyes, those women, conservative women, deserve to have their accomplishments devalued and their appearance mocked.\n\nI'm tired of being the butt of jokes and scorn because I'm a conservative woman and a mother. I'm sick of legacy media acting like women such as Leavitt, Vance and me are an anomaly.\n\nAnd I'm done with seeing progressives in politics and journalism spew hate at women for embracing conservative political and social values.\n\nNicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

            "full_content": "Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux for New York Magazine\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nDo you see that?\u201d said Andrew Cuomo, who was making the rounds over brunch at Melba\u2019s in Harlem one Sunday in March. Earlier that the morning, Cuomo had given a speech at Mount Neboh Baptist Church on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, just down the street from here, calling for the hiring of 5,000 more police officers and levying a blistering attack on the left flank of the Democratic Party\u2014some members of which were running against him for mayor\u2014for uttering what he called \u201cthe three dumbest public-policy words you can utter: \u2018Cut the police.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe speech was well received, and the former governor gained an endorsement from the pastor, a longtime ally, and now here he was remarking on the inverted political landscape of the Democratic Party and trying to get in a couple of more shots at the antagonists to his left.\n\n\u201cThis extremist left wing represents no one. Who does it represent? If you are in Manhattan, or Park Slope, and it\u2019s \u2018No police; police are bad.\u2019 That was Bill de Blasio, and it\u2019s very popular in Park Slope, yes, but who does that help?\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cProgressives were supposed to be about helping the poor, minorities, the disenfranchised. That\u2019s why I wanted to do \u2018more police\u2019 in a Black church, because, by their own theory, progressives care about the poor and the\u200b\u200b downtrodden. No, they don\u2019t. That\u2019s not who your policies help. And meanwhile the city is going backwards and people are leaving.\u201d\n\nCuomo hasn\u2019t been much seen since he resigned his decadelong governorship three and a half years ago in the face of certain impeachment by the State Legislature, and here he reemerges among the post-church crowd like Lazarus. He stops for selfies. Tourists from California remember him from his COVID briefings. He goes into the kitchen to shake hands with the line cooks and busboys and to try out a little Spanish. Grandmothers pinch his cheek and kiss him, ask him if it\u2019s true, if he is really back and running for mayor. He shakes hands with a dad who says he\u2019s from Queens. \u201cOh, me too!\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cHollis.\u201d\n\nNo one asks him about the almost too long to list set of scandals that chased him from office and have hounded him ever since: the nursing-home deaths from COVID and their attendant cover-up, the book he wrote in the middle of the crisis that he used state employees to help work on, how his friends and family received COVID tests before anyone else in the state could, how a close aide went to federal prison for bribery, or even about the sexual-harassment scandal that ultimately led to his resignation.\n\n\u201cMy case goes to nine women. I didn\u2019t even know who they were,\u201d Cuomo said after he finally sat down at a table in the middle of Melba\u2019s dining room to discuss what forced him out of office. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even in a position to defend myself because they never said. I knew some of them, but \u2018Was there ever a woman who on a rope line you put your arm around and took a picture? Did you ever kiss a woman on the cheek at a wedding reception?\u2019 Literally like that. \u2018Did you ever pat a woman on the waist?\u2019\u201d Cuomo said, putting on a face of someone bewildered by the nonsensical question he is being asked. \u201cI mean, yeah. \u2018Did you ever kiss a woman on the cheek? Did you ever say ciao bella?\u2019 Yeah, I probably did. But there were no names.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see all this behavior, for a 25-year-old or younger woman with different mores and sensitivities, it\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t touch me\u2019 and \u2018Ciao bella is offensive\u2019 and \u2018honey\u2019 is offensive and \u2018sweetheart\u2019 is offensive, and that is a legitimate school of thought. I heard that intellectually, and I got it\u2014but I just didn\u2019t actually get it enough.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a report by state attorney general Letitia James found that allegations of sexual harassment by 11 women (seven of whom were named) were credible, including from one who said that Cuomo put his hand on, tapped, and grabbed her buttock at an event and another who said Cuomo used to ask if she had ever cheated on her husband or if she could help him find a girlfriend and a third, a 25-year-old aide who said Cuomo used to ask her intimate questions about her sex life. Later, a report by the Justice Department upped the count to 13 women and found that Cuomo discriminated against women in his office and retaliated against those who spoke out against him.\n\nCuomo has spent his years out of office running these allegations down, even going so far as to sue one of the women who made them\u2014at taxpayer\u2019s expense and a cost of at least $18 million, according to one estimate\u2014and maintains that much of the whole affair was concocted by James, whom Cuomo endorsed for the position and who, in a kind of gubernatorial attempted coup, ran for the job herself after he resigned. He points out that five district attorneys found that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of wrongdoing to bring charges. He blames the leftists in the State Legislature, who never liked him no matter how many left-wing priorities he passed\u2014gay marriage, a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, a fracking ban, free state-college tuition, legal marijuana, and stricter gun laws\u2014and who were lying in wait to take him down. The allegations were just a pretext, in his view, especially at a moment when the progressive wing of the party had the upper hand in the Democratic coalition.\n\n\u201cThat women\u2019s issue was so electric that once somebody lights that fuse, you can\u2019t stop it in that environment. Politicians were like dominoes\u2014boop, boop, boop, boop,\u201d he said, mimicking with his fingers the tumbling of the play tiles. In the end, everyone from Joe Biden\u2014who, Cuomo was quick to point out, said he never read James\u2019s report\u2014to a legislator who was a personal (i.e., nonpolitical) friend told him there was no coming back. \u201cSo that\u2019s how the system works. Do I think it was fair or accurate? No, and it\u2019s been proven not fair or accurate. But I knew the political impact of it. I mean, I wasn\u2019t kidding myself about that.\u201d\n\nThe blast radius of the sexual-harassment scandal extended far beyond Andrew Cuomo. It eventually ensnared his brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, and aides who were working at agencies across the government, and even people in the private sector who had lent Cuomo support. But for all the effort Cuomo has gone to (and continues to go to) to defend himself, the allegations are mostly a dead issue on the campaign trail. When Cuomo made his first press availability after announcing his run, no one from the city press corps even asked him about the sexual-harassment claims. His mayoral rivals have been slamming Cuomo for all sorts of transgressions but have mostly been laying off that angle as polls have shown that most voters don\u2019t care.\n\nAnd so, even though no one ever really thought that Andrew Cuomo would go away after stepping down, it can be a little hard to believe that he is here, running for mayor in a city he hasn\u2019t lived in for decades and seemed to avoid when he was governor. Cuomo is facing a half-dozen serious contenders, most of whom have been running for many months in a still relatively new ranked-choice voting system. He is facing an antagonistic press corps that wants politicians it buried to stay dead and a city business and political Establishment exhausted by the seemingly nonstop battles royale of the Cuomo era and wary of a resurrected Cuomo out hunting for revenge.\n\nCuomo hasn\u2019t run against a serious opponent in two decades, and the three months before the June 24 Democratic primary (which almost certainly will crown the next mayor) are bound to get ugly, with Cuomo\u2019s opponents every day trying to make salient for voters Cuomo\u2019s past behavior and the COVID dead that they say are his fault and, in the case of Mayor Adams, all but accusing Cuomo of racism for even entering the race against the city\u2019s second Black mayor.\n\nAfter finishing off his post-breakfast coffee and the sweet-potato pie with whipped cream, the former governor got up to go. As he does so, two older women, a mother and a daughter, sidle up to him for selfies. He obliges, posing in a three-sided hug, then turns back to the table he just left.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hug anybody, I didn\u2019t kiss anybody, I didn\u2019t touch anybody. It never happened,\u201d Cuomo said with a wink. \u201cI was harassed about 800 times, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nCuomo told me that part of the process of his coming to grips with what had happened to him was reconnecting with his faith\u2014reading the Bible, going to church, prayer. At one point, he said, he wrote down his sins on a piece of paper and tossed it into the waters off the Hamptons, where he was staying with his sister.\n\n\u201cI lived life. I spent time with my kids, I had my eyes opened to the part of life I was missing,\u201d Cuomo said, his eyes reddening. He described a life in public service from the time his children were born, which meant that he missed the day-to-day moments of being together. \u201cYou know, they used to talk about \u2018quality time.\u2019 Like if you didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with your kids it was fine so long as you had \u2018quality time.\u2019 And let me tell you, all of that was bullshit. You have to be there when they are down, when they are up, when they are moody. I did quality time, but it wasn\u2019t a substitute.\u201d\n\nRealizing what he had missed with his children, now adults and scattered around the country, \u201cwas sad for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I always appreciated at the time the cost that I was paying for the life I had chosen. I just wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nCuomo took up running, lost 20 pounds, saw his siblings and their children in ways he hadn\u2019t for years, and practiced a little law \u2014 \u201cprivate clients, business clients, and people with private issues that they were trying to think through.\u201d He also started his own consulting firm, making more than $500,000 in total according to recent Conflict of Interest Board filings. He invested in gold bars and in bitcoin, and was, he insists, at peace and not necessarily sure he would ever return to politics.\n\n\u201cThings happen, and you learn to live with it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of bad things happen and a lot of good things happen, and if you believe in God, you know that men plan and God laughs, and you move on.\u201d\n\nFriends say Cuomo was truly shocked, and more than a little devastated, over how quickly his political career unraveled. He knew there was a rank of fractious leftists in Albany who wanted him gone but not that legislative allies would fold so quickly or that James would deliver such a devastating final report.\n\nCuomo resigned as governor 2021, facing imminent impeachment. Photo: Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nHe had seen all of this unfold before, he said. Cuomo cited Al Franken, the Minnesota senator whose upward political trajectory changed in a moment after New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand said he needed to resign in the aftermath of allegations that he behaved inappropriately around women. In 2018, Cuomo had called on Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general accused by four women of intimate partner abuse, to resign (he was ultimately not charged).\n\n\u201cOne of the things I had to give up was reliving the bad or any bitterness or any anger or any regret or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too negative. You can\u2019t keep that negative in you and be productive and be healthy. I was angry for a period, and it affected everything I did. I couldn\u2019t enjoy anything. You know this is the business. What I did to Eric Schneiderman, you could argue, or what happened to Schneiderman, or what happened to Franken. Things happen and things don\u2019t happen, and you have to give that up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI replayed the game,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, Monday morning, you wake up, you replay the game tape. I always felt good about what I got done, what I got accomplished. But was there a way to do it without pushing the legislature or the whole system, the bureaucracy, as hard? Probably. Could you get enough done if you didn\u2019t push as hard? Probably not. But what\u2019s the trade-off? I don\u2019t know. I still think about it,\u201d he said, trailing off.\n\nAnd yet if you ask those who spoke with Cuomo what he was up to in his wilderness years, the answer they most often give is, \u201cScheming.\u201d They describe a man who was never planning to walk away from politics.\n\nCuomo had considered running against Kathy Hochul almost as soon as he stepped down, but with investigations into his handling of COVID and the sexual-harassment allegations against him still swirling, it was deemed impossible. Instead, he started a podcast, As a Matter of Fact, and brought on guests like Anthony Scaramucci, Kellyanne Conway, and Larry Summers for conversations that often became a litany of complaints about the left or about Joe Biden, politicized prosecutors, and the ongoing migrant crisis. He blasted James and Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg for going after Donald Trump, saying they were politicizing the justice system. He struck up a friendship with Eric Adams, dining with the mayor at his favorite midtown haunts, excursions that were dutifully covered by the New York Post and that helped feed the speculation that the former governor must be up to something.\n\nHe joined the legal team that is supposed to defend Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the International Criminal Court (a move that was widely seen as yet another thumb in the eye of the DSA crowd in New York City), started a gun-control group called Gun Safe America and another group designed to combat antisemitism in America, an initiative he kicked off on the Fourth of July weekend at the Hampton Synagogue. \u201cHe spent a lot of time out here in the Hamptons,\u201d said Rabbi Marc Schneier, who founded the synagogue and counts Cuomo as a personal friend. \u201cYou could tell he missed public life and was looking for a way to reenter the market, as it were. I think the phrase is \u2018testing the waters,\u2019 and why not? Americans love a comeback story, and Andrew Cuomo would be a great comeback story.\u201d\n\nCuomo had been here, in the wilderness, before. Back in 2002, fresh off an eight-year stint at Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton and living in Washington, D.C., Cuomo ran for governor. The party Establishment backed Carl McCall, the state comptroller, who, if he were able to defeat incumbent governor George Pataki, would become the first Black governor of New York. Almost certain to lose, Cuomo dropped out a week before the primary, claiming that he did it for the sake of party unity and not because he was about to get embarrassed. The city\u2019s Black leadership was infuriated.\n\nThe next year, his marriage to Kerry Kennedy, a union of two of the most famous families in Democratic Party politics, blew up in spectacular fashion amid allegations that she was having an affair with a polo-playing restaurateur. A report in this magazine portrayed Cuomo as almost clinically depressed, wandering around his empty Westchester mansion (the mansion was described as her idea; Cuomo had wanted to live in the city) at a loss at what to do next.\n\nWhat he did next was scheme, putting together a master class in how an out-of-work politician returns to power. He threw himself into the cause of reforming New York\u2019s harsh Rockefeller-era drug laws, teaming up with the likes of Russell Simmons and Sean Combs to host a rally and concert outdoors in Manhattan; it was an issue of paramount importance to the Black political leaders Cuomo had irritated with his gubernatorial campaign. He met with labor leaders and bigwig Democratic donors, boxing out his closest competition to run for state attorney general. Once elected AG, Cuomo almost immediately set his sights on the job he had run for five years before, teaming up with Republicans to investigate Governor Eliot Spitzer, sinking Spizer\u2019s popularity before he ultimately resigned in a prostitution scandal.\n\nSpitzer\u2019s lieutenant governor, David Paterson, took over in a similar wave of good feeling that quickly crashed as stories of dysfunction in the governor\u2019s office\u2014in political circles, it was always believed that Cuomo was behind many of them, though Cuomo denies it to this day\u2014led him to decide to not seek reelection.\n\nThis time around, Cuomo\u2019s comeback has taken a lot less work. Neither the anti-gun effort or the antisemitism campaign amounted to much, and the case against Netanyahu has gone nowhere. The podcast never caught on.\n\nIn the end, all he had to do was lie low and take occasional meetings with political power players to keep his name out there\u2014and watch while a mayoral administration collapsed into chaos.\n\nTo be a New York political reporter during these past two years has been to be tipped off every few months by someone who claims to be very much in the know about how Andrew Cuomo is about to announce he is running for mayor, or has already hired a campaign manager, or isn\u2019t running but is instead running for governor. He was going to announce over the holidays, then in early February, then late February, or maybe it was just a week before the April 3 filing deadline. He was pushing Eric Adams out of the race except when he was working to keep Adams in the race to deflect some of the media scrutiny.\n\nSuch is the mystique of Cuomo as a political operator that after four of Adams\u2019s top deputies resigned suddenly in the wake of the mayor\u2019s acquiescence to Trump, a rumor went around city political circles that somehow Cuomo was behind it, a contention his aides said was ridiculous. One labor operative told me that he had been paranoid for weeks that anytime someone called him to talk about the mayor\u2019s race, the person, no matter how close an ally, was secretly working for Cuomo and back-channeling the conversation back to him.\n\nThe rumors were crazy but also evidence of the shadow Cuomo has cast on the political conversation in New York over the past two decades. Cuomo was regularly meeting with labor and business leaders, eating breakfast as often as three times a week at the Regency, still the city\u2019s premier place to see and be seen. Those who met with him say that some of Cuomo\u2019s old feral instincts seemed a bit softer, as if the guy who, as one former aide put it to me, \u201cwoke up every morning wondering how he could get revenge on someone who he thought had fucked him over\u201d had mellowed now that he was no longer consumed with smiting his enemies.\n\n\u201cHe just seemed like a really different person than the one I had always heard about,\u201d said Andrew Yang, the 2021 mayoral candidate who dined with Cuomo at the Regency earlier this year. \u201cJust on a human level, he sounded like he had been on a journey and that he had learned from it.\u201d\n\nHe asked Yang about his ideas for the city, and Yang talked to him about the need for more police and for more specialized high schools. \u201cHe expressed that the city\u2019s future really hangs in the balance right now, that we could end up in the soup if we aren\u2019t careful,\u201d Yang said.\n\nCuomo wouldn\u2019t publicly admit his interest in the race, but privately, as 2024 wore on, Cuomo was increasingly telling business, labor, and religious leaders that he was running, that the city was in the grip of politicians who weren\u2019t just too spineless to stand up to the far left but who were incompetent to boot. He told them that if he entered, he was almost certain to win, with the unspoken warning that they would be wise to not support his opponents. A team of close advisors, including consultants Charlie King and Bill Murrow, along with his former chief aide, Melissa DeRosa, built a turnkey campaign operation on his behalf. Hoping to avoid a perception that Cuomo was running against the political Establishment, she set about lining up endorsements from fellow politicians, many of whom had previously called Cuomo unfit for office, and reigniting Cuomo\u2019s old network of staff and allies for another battle.\n\nCarl McCall had lunch with Cuomo and agreed to endorse even before Cuomo announced he was running, taking some of the heat out of the charge that Cuomo was again elbowing aside a Black political leader. Ritchie Torres, an ambitious congressman from the Bronx who had been making noises about running for governor, did the same. The Staten Island Democratic Party endorsed him. In late February, two weeks before Cuomo was set to announce, Frank Carone, a Brooklyn lawyer and political power broker who has been Adams\u2019s chief political patron, told Politico New York Playbook that while of course he was still supporting the mayor, he had also been in touch with DeRosa and the rest of Cuomo\u2019s team, for whom he has \u201cgreat respect.\u201d Five days later, Adams abruptly canceled an appearance at a candidate forum that was supposed to mark his unofficial entry into the race, citing \u201cthe advice of counsel.\u201d Associates of the former governor even tried to come to some accord with Tish James. One elected official showed up unexpectedly at her house, but James rebuffed their entreaties. (The Cuomo team denies this ever happened.)\n\nWhen Cuomo finally entered the race after weeks of speculation, he didn\u2019t do so with the kind of inspiring, shareable social-media video that most campaigns aim for; instead, he announced with a direct-to-camera, 17-minute address that didn\u2019t so much inspire hope or love for the city as fear. New York, as Cuomo described it, was on the brink.\n\n\u201cYou feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person or when the anxiety rises up in your chest as you\u2019re walking down into the subway. You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence,\u201d he said, his eyes darting across the teleprompter above the lens. \u201cThe city just feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis. These conditions exist not as an act of God but rather as an act of our political leaders \u2014 or more precisely \u2014 the lack of intelligent action by many of our political leaders.\u201d\n\nThe video was Cuomo\u2019s idea, and he knew that almost no actual voters would sit through it. Rather, it was for the press and the political professionals the Cuomo campaign expects will spread its core message: that this is a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d moment and Andrew Cuomo is the voters\u2019 hammer. Let the rest of the field go for social-media virality; this was going to be a campaign built on old-school brute-force logic.\n\nThe next day, Cuomo announced his run in person at the carpenters-union hall on the West Side of Manhattan. The hall was packed with supporters, including, according to a report in Politico, union members who were bussed in without being told they were attending a Cuomo campaign rally. Signature gatherers with clipboards fanned out among the crowd to get Cuomo on the ballot. His three daughters spoke on his behalf and attested to his character, as did a multidenominational array of religious leaders.\n\nThe same day Cuomo announced, his opponents countered. Brad Lander held \u201can emergency press conference\u201d calling Cuomo unfit to be mayor. Scott Stringer released a web ad reminding voters how he had defeated Eliot Spitzer when that former governor tried to make a comeback attempt and run for a city office. Zellnor Myrie slammed him for cutting funds for critical city services as governor.\n\nCuomo didn\u2019t respond to the attacks and scarcely engaged with the media. After his announcement, he ducked behind a blue curtain while his staff and security kept the reporters away.\n\nFriends say that when he was out of office, Cuomo could sound like a retired football coach watching his old team play, yelling at the television, but that his outrage was mostly directed at the governor, not the mayor. Eric Adams was, after all, a moderate like him, someone who seemed to hate the DSA-inflected left and its enablers in the elite media as much as he did and, perhaps most important, governed every day as if his administration were a rebuke of Bill de Blasio. Cuomo even warned Adams against going out on the town so much, telling him that it read to voters much like de Blasio\u2019s late-morning gym habit: a sign that you weren\u2019t much interested in them.\n\nAs Cuomo knows better than anyone, the city is a function of the state. New York City is reliant on Albany not just for its funding but for many of the rules and laws that it implements to govern itself. This stark reality is why, even as Cuomo inched closer to a mayoral run, many political analysts thought he was in fact gunning to get his old job as governor back. Would a Mayor Cuomo really want to go hat-in-hand to the State Legislature that nearly impeached him and ask for more funding or for local control of city schools? But a potential governor\u2019s race was almost two years away, Adams was starting to flounder, and so in late 2023 Cuomo took an apartment on East 54th St.\n\nIn his campaign launch, it could sound sometimes as if Cuomo still thought he was running for governor, especially when he talked about the infrastructure projects that he built as governor, including the Mario Cuomo Bridge, which connects suburban Westchester County to even more suburban Rockland County. Cuomo\u2019s political image was always as someone who understood the suburbs around New York City, especially its more middle-class towns, where he capped property taxes and spent his time off fishing or working on cars. In his first term especially, Cuomo rarely held public events in New York City, according to aides, out of fear of being upstaged by then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg. These days, he gets around town in his own car, a Dodge Charger.\n\n\u201cA big risk for Andrew Cuomo is that he runs a campaign like he is trying to win over swing voters in the Rochester suburbs and not Democratic-primary voters in New York City,\u201d said one Democratic pollster. \u201cSuburban voters want to hear you talk about all the problems the city is for the state, but city voters, to state the obvious, live here, and so they don\u2019t really believe all the doom and gloom about the place. They see New York\u2019s problems, but they want to know your plan to immediately fix them. He is pitching a different audience now.\u201d\n\nEven before Cuomo got into the race, a pair of dark-money groups, funded by business and labor leaders who feared a campaign of retribution, formed in order to drive up his negatives. One, New Yorkers for Better Government, ran digital ads that compared Cuomo with disgraced pols like Spitzer, Anthony Weiner, and George Santos and accused him of covering up COVID-19 nursing-home deaths. Its efforts are echoed by another group called the Nursing Home Justice League, which is supported by a number of leading local Republicans and Democrats and has built a memorial wall in Brooklyn to, as the group puts it, \u201chonor the nursing home victims of Governor Cuomo\u2019s failed leadership during the pandemic crisis.\u201d (Cuomo has always insisted that he complied with federal guidelines.) Meanwhile, the Working Families Party, which Cuomo went to war with during his term as governor, and a coalition of labor groups have been developing a strategy to get all of the non-Cuomo, non-Adams candidates to work together.\n\nUnexpectedly, he also has to contend with the New York Post, a newspaper that in the past has been willing to throw its weight behind favored candidates. As the moderate in the race, Cuomo should be the paper\u2019s favorite, but the early coverage has been brutal, including a welcome-to-the-race editorial on the day Cuomo announced titled, \u201cBehold! Biggest Liar in New York Wants to Be Mayor.\u201d\n\nHis half-dozen or so progressive opponents, who had mostly been muddling through a somnolent mayoral campaign, appear energized at the emergence of a Cuomo candidacy. Lander held a press conference nearly every day after Cuomo first announced, blaming the former governor for many of the ills that now befall the city: \u201cAt a time when we all want to turn the page on endless chaos, Andrew Cuomo\u2019s scandals, corruption, and disregard for our city except for when it serves his personal ambitions, are literally the last thing New Yorkers want to replace Eric Adams.\u201d Stringer led reporters on a tour of \u201cAndrew Cuomo\u2019s Manhattan,\u201d which included stops on Billionaires\u2019 Row to call out Cuomo\u2019s failures to boost the city\u2019s affordable-housing stock. DSA-aligned assemblyman Zohran Mamdani compared him to Trump, and said that Cuomo \u201cshares the president\u2019s love for billionaires, corruption, and harassing women.\u201d Myrie, a state senator from Central Brooklyn, has been hitting Black churches, warning at Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network that Cuomo isn\u2019t one of them. \u201cWe have had so-called leaders who sat in the governor\u2019s mansion, sat in our pews on Sunday, and cut our schools on Monday, and now they are using us to rehabilitate their image,\u201d he said at one in early March.\n\nWith the sexual-harassment scandal not moving voters away from Cuomo \u2014\n\n\u201ceveryone already knows about it, and absolutely nobody cares,\u201d said one operative from a rival campaign \u2014 his competitors have focused their efforts on trying to blame his actions as governor for a lot of what voters say are their current dissatisfactions with New York City. That has meant pinning the mental-health crisis on his decision to reduce psychiatric hospital beds and the poor state of the subways on his decision to raid the coffers of the MTA. Similarly, they point out how he failed to meaningfully address the city\u2019s spiraling housing crisis and suggest that his reforms on bail and discovery have led to a spike in crime.\n\nProgressive attacks on Cuomo in the mayoral race have yet get much traction.

The idea is that together, they can maneuver the relatively new ranked-choice-voting system to their benefit. Their staffs are all on a text chain and in regular contact. Lis Smith, a top Democratic operative who once worked for Cuomo but publicly broke with him last year, has been offering advice unofficially to friends working for Cuomo\u2019s rivals.\n\nThe anti-Cuomo candidates, a group that now includes Adrienne Adams, the City Council Speaker and a relative moderate who was a late entrant into the race, have mostly refrained from attacking one another. And if they do, progressive leaders have been quick to remind them to knock it off. \u201cWe are not going to have a fight between the four or five candidates that are vying for the left,\u201d said Antonio Reynoso, the left-leaning Brooklyn borough president. \u201cWe are going to be working together. I get calls from candidates running for mayor every week, and I am brutally honest with them,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there is a candidate that starts bashing another candidate, I am going to give them a phone call and tell them that their individual goals are not more important than the greater good here and we are not going to allow you to hurt the movement.\u201d\n\nBut operatives for the progressive candidates admit that they are stuck in something of a prisoner\u2019s dilemma: They all think they can win, if only voters will give them a shot, and so want their opponents, who they believe definitely can\u2019t win, to sacrifice themselves and spend all their energy attacking Cuomo. But of course, if everyone thinks they should be the next mayor, and someone else should be the designated attack dog, the strategy falls apart.\n\nCuomo has been consistently polling in the 30s or 40s, and before he entered the race, the question his rivals were facing is whether that is the ceiling of his support or the floor. Cuomo is, after all, a candidate with close to 100 percent name identification. \u201cHe is not going to become better known in the course of this campaign,\u201d said another rival operative. \u201cAnd he is not going to be better liked either.\u201d\n\nOne pollster pointed to surveys that showed Cuomo\u2019s retrospective job approval (i.e., how well you think he did as governor) is somewhere in the high 60s. But ask voters about his personal favorability rating, and it drops to the 50s. Ask voters if they could see themselves voting for him, and the number drops to the 40s. And ask if they will rank him first on their ballots in the city\u2019s ranked-choice-voting system, and the number drops to the 30s\u2014proof, they said, that his current strength is a mirage.\n\nOther recent polling shows that this theory might not be right. A trio of late March polls put Cuomo at around 40 percent, suggesting that since entering the race, Cuomo has, if anything, increased his lead \u2014 that he was, in fact, becoming if not better known, at least better liked. One survey showed Cuomo leading among nearly all demographics, including with over half of women. The poll also found \u2014 matching the conviction of some in the Cuomo camp \u2014 that backers of Eric Adams and Adrienne Adams might ultimately give their support to Cuomo, potentially giving him a route to clear 50 percent and victory in the primary.\n\nThe poll also showed Cuomo\u2019s nearest competitor to be Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old assemblyman from Queens. The Cuomo campaign can scarcely believe their good fortune \u2014 as much as Cuomo likes to deride his opponents as far-left members of the Democratic Socialists of America, Mamdani, whose viral online videos have turned him into a phenom in the early part of the campaign, actually is a member of the group. It is the belief among several of Cuomo\u2019s advisers that Mamdani can\u2019t possibly break 50 percent but that he could win over the left and deprive oxygen and attention from Cuomo\u2019s other competitors, creating a dynamic much like Cuomo faced when he ran statewide against Zephyr Teachout and Cynthia Nixon, both candidates beloved by the progressive left but with little traction beyond it. The Cuomo camp has been privately in conversations with donors and potential supporters, warning them of the possibility that Mamdani could win and that the city is on the brink of electing an avowed \u201cdefund the police\u201d\u2013style socialist unless Cuomo puts a stop to it.\n\nTo Cuomo aides, who derisively refer to his opponents as \u201cthe assistant managers,\u201d none of the attacks on the former governor are working. To those who say he is not a real New Yorker, \u201cjust listen to him talk,\u201d said one aide. The notion that Cuomo is somehow weak on crime will be ludicrous to voters, and as much as his opponents want to criticize his record, he is also the only one with the experience running an entity as large and as complicated as New York City, the argument goes.\n\nCuomo\u2019s rivals\u2019 current strategy is to get him out of his cocoon, to bait him into actually campaigning in unscripted settings, hoping he makes a gaffe. But Cuomo has been disciplined in sticking to a front-runner\u2019s strategy, appearing with local leaders who have endorsed him\u2014many of whom Cuomo donated to out of his sizable state campaign war chest over the past couple of years\u2014at diners and senior centers. He rarely alerts the press to his public schedule, and when he does, he does not often take questions from the media, whom he believes have it in for him. Cuomo is almost certain to max out in fundraising as part of the city\u2019s campaign-finance system and is also the only candidate with a multimillion-dollar super-PAC boosting his chances, one that has already raised more than $2 million from donors like Stephen Ross, the billionaire real-estate developer.\n\nIt is a campaign built on a belief that politics hasn\u2019t changed as much as some pundits might think. \u201cThe backbone of this campaign is labor, the backbone of this campaign is the Black and brown and white ethnic working class in the outer-boroughs,\u201d said DeRosa. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be diners and senior centers and churches, and it is a belief that Twitter is not real life and that is going to go over the top of the press.\u201d\n\nWhat Cuomo has not done much of on the campaign trail is attack Donald Trump, something his opponents have done relentlessly and also wondered aloud why Cuomo is not, positing publicly that Cuomo is trying to avoid prosecution from the Trump Justice Department or that he and Trump have a secret alliance.\n\nPrivately, in making his case to elected officials, Cuomo has been talking up the threat that Trump signifies for the functioning of the city and has been telling members of the city\u2019s congressional delegation especially that he is best suited to be the strong hand against an increasingly vengeful federal government; Cuomo aides say that continually going after Trump publicly on the campaign trail would risk his getting lumped in with the rest of the mayoral field. Plus even before Cuomo announced, there were rumors among New York politicos that the mayoralty was little more than a stepping-stone for a presidential run. Not talking at all about Trump, or any national issues, was a way to tamp some of that down.\n\nCuomo\u2019s is not a campaign that aims to inspire or become a cause. Mayoral campaigns, or any campaign for that matter, tend to succeed when they are built around big ideas and tangible improvement. Think of de Blasio, who ran on the theme of \u201cThe Tale of Two Cities\u201d and pushed for universal prekindergarten to address those inequalities. It was true for Mike Bloomberg too, who pledged to utilize technocratic expertise to help the city recover from 9/11, and even for Eric Adams, who relied on his biography as a working-class former cop from the outer-boroughs to bring attention to crime and small businesses.\n\nThen there is the wild card of this being \u2014 allegedly \u2014 a different Cuomo, one matured and made more human by the battles that led to his resignation. A guy who has discovered a new peace and equanimity and not the person who wakes up every morning thinking about revenge. How that guy runs a government is really anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nToward the end of our interview, Cuomo began recounting all the things that had seemingly gone wrong in the state since he left office\u2014the botched marijuana rollout, a legislature that won\u2019t confirm a governor\u2019s chief-judge pick, a lack of major infrastructure accomplishments. \u201cBut the situation here in the city is much more dire,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, if I wanted to get back to office, the question will be, \u2018Why don\u2019t you run for governor?\u2019 That is not why I got here. I didn\u2019t have a desire to get back into office. I felt that I was needed here, that I have the experience to actually really help.\u201d\n\nHe got up to leave, heading toward his Dodge Charger, out into the city he hopes to lead. Cuomo\u2019s strength among the voters belies how much of the political class, from across the ideological spectrum, wanted to see him gone. Few of course were willing to say that publicly, fearful of a governor with a famous taste for vengeance.\n\nBut this is, he promises, a new Andrew Cuomo, one who is not just scarred by a precipitous fall from grace but aware of how one needs friends in politics.\n\n\u201cYou know this dynamic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I do.\u201d"
