            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy St. Patrick\u2019s Day! In today\u2019s edition, Scott Bland dives into the stark dividing lines revealed by our first NBC News poll of the year. Plus, Curtis Bunn reports on how the Tesla is no longer the status symbol on the left that it once was.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe deep divisions defining American politics\n\nBy Scott Bland\n\nElection results change who holds power, and they change the course of history. But they don\u2019t always change minds, at least in the short term.\n\nThat\u2019s a major takeaway from the latest national NBC News poll, which finds, across dozens of questions, that the U.S. remains as closely and knottily divided on President Donald Trump and many key issues as it did before the November\u2019s election.\n\nConsider the questions on one of the centers of the action in the Trump administration: the Department of Government Efficiency. Asked whether \u201cgovernment should do more to solve problems and help meet the needs of people\u201d or whether \u201cgovernment is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals,\u201d 56% choose \u201cshould do more,\u201d while 42% say government \u201cis doing too many things.\u201d\n\nBut at the same time, voters are open to the idea of finding cuts and greater efficiency in government: 46% say establishing DOGE was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea (and the remainder say they have no opinion or aren\u2019t sure).\n\nAnd at the same time as that, 47% say they view DOGE negatively, compared to 41% who view it positively. And there\u2019s a degree of hesitancy about what DOGE has actually done so far \u2014 as well as a degree of willingness to support it even more, depending on what happens. One-third of voters say it should continue operating as is, another 28% say \u201cit is needed but should slow down to assess the impact,\u201d and another third say \u201cit is reckless and should stop now.\u201d\n\nDivisions like these are in evidence throughout the poll \u2014 and, indeed, all throughout the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating is as high as he\u2019s ever had as president, but a majority of registered voters still disapprove. Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied in an early 2026 midterm election ballot test, but views of the Democratic Party are as negative as they\u2019ve ever been, driven in part by fed-up Democrats.\n\nAnd while the nation has come around on Trump\u2019s immigration policies, at least so far, he\u2019s getting negative scores on other issues, including his handling of the economy, which has always been a bring spot in his numbers as president.\n\nCheck out the full poll here.\n\nMore from the NBC News poll: Most Americans are rooting for Ukraine. But nearly half think Trump prefers Russia, by Ben Kamisar\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nThe Tesla is no longer a progressive status symbol\n\nBy Curtis Bunn\n\nIt was not enough for Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., to announce that he had gotten rid of his Tesla. He did it on X, the social media platform headed by Elon Musk, who took over as CEO of the electric vehicle company in 2008.\n\nKelly made his reason for abandoning the car that one time represented progress and automotive and environmental achievement clear: Musk and his politics.\n\n\u201cEvery time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much damage Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country,\u201d Kelly posted.\n\nOther well-known figures outside the political realm have recently dumped their Teslas as well, including actor Jason Bateman and musician Sheryl Crow.\n\nMusk\u2019s connection to President Donald Trump and the emergence of the Department of Government Efficiency and its vast federal government job cuts were the tipping points for many progressives who owned their once-beloved groundbreaking vehicles, as Tesla remains the top-selling electric car in the country.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83c\udfa4 Exclusive interview: Vice President JD Vance acknowledged in an interview with Henry J.

            "full_content": "A federal judge on Monday denied the Trump administration's request to call off a court hearing involving President Donald Trump's use of a wartime law to deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals, and whether the White House knowingly violated the court order \u2013 an extraordinary effort that came just moments before administration officials were due to testify under oath.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s filing came shortly after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered lawyers to court Monday for a \"fact-finding hearing\" involving Trump's use of the 1798 wartime-era Alien Enemies Act, and whether the Trump administration knowingly violated his earlier court order blocking the Trump administration from invoking the law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals and alleged members of violent gang Tren de Aragua, for 14 days.\n\nThe law has only been used three times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II.\n\nDuring Monday's hearing, which lasted about 45 minutes, Judge Boasberg at times appeared frustrated as he pressed government lawyers for more details as to why his Saturday order\u2014which called for the administration to immediately return all planes with expelled migrants, including the Venezuelan nationals and alleged Tren de Aragua gang members\u2014were not brought back to the U.S.\n\n\"My orders don\u2019t seem to carry much weight,\" Jude Boasberg said near the end of the hearing. Both parties are due back in court Friday for a hearing over the Trump administration's request to vacate the case.\n\nWHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?\n\nDuring the hearing, the Trump administration repeatedly declined to provide information to Judge Boasberg about how many flights carrying migrants took off on Saturday, citing national security protections.\n\n\"Those are operational issues, and I am not at liberty to provide information,\" a lawyer for the Trump administration told the court.\n\nJudge Boasberg, in response, ordered the Justice Department to provide the court with more information in writing by Tuesday at noon.\n\nIn granting the emergency order Saturday Boasberg sided with the plaintiffs \u2013 Democracy Forward and the ACLU \u2013 who had argued that the deportations would likely pose imminent and \"irreparable\" harm to the migrants under the time proposed.\n\nTRUMP POLICY ON BORDER JUMPERS EMPOWERS USE OF \u2018MAXIMUM CONSEQUENCES,\u2019 BORDER AGENT TELLS FOX\n\nJudge Boasberg also ordered the Trump administration Saturday to immediately halt any planned deportations, and to notify their clients that \"any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\" he said.\n\nBut the decision apparently came too late to stop a plane filled with more than 200 migrants who were deported to El Salvador.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview that a plane carrying hundreds of migrants, including more than 130 persons removed under the Alien Enemies Act, had already \"left U.S. airspace\" by the time the order was handed down.\n\nShe also suggested the order itself was not \"lawful\" and noted the Trump administration's intent to appeal.\n\nIn response, the ACLU asked the court to order the government to submit declarations, under oath, that the planes had indeed taken off after the court's order.\n\n\"Whether or not the planes had cleared U.S. territory, the U.S. retained custody at least until the planes landed and the individuals were turned over to foreign governments,\" the ACLU said in their filing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJudge Boasberg, an Obama appointee, at times appeared slightly incredulous that the Trump administration chose to move forward with the deportation of hundreds of migrants to El Salvador, pressing lawyers for the Justice Department over whether they believed there were better options than to comply with the decision he handed down Saturday.\n\n\"Isn\u2019t then the better course, to return the planes to the United States and figure out what to do, than to say, \u2018We don\u2019t care, we\u2019ll do what we want?'\" he asked."

            "full_content": "California Republicans, energized by district gains made during the 2024 general election, selected their new party leader, Corrin Rankin, a former surrogate for President Donald Trump, over the weekend at the CAGOP annual convention in Sacramento.\n\nShe is the first-ever Black woman to hold the position, and she's pro-MAGA.\n\n\"It\u2019s time to end the Democrats\u2019 one-party rule and make California great again,\" the new CAGOP chair said to delegates after her win on Sunday.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Rankin said there is \"an outcry for commonsense politicians in California\" and that the party, which has noticeably been given new life by Trump, is strongly aligned with the president's national agenda. It's an uphill battle against the state's deep-blue Democrat trifecta, but it's one that Rankin has her eyes set on as she prepares to lead the party under a second Trump term.\n\nNEWSOM'S 'UNFAIR' REMARK ON GIRLS' SPORTS BELIES RECORD AS GOVERNOR: 'ABSOLUTE BULLS---'\n\n\"I've worked on every single one of his campaigns for the past 10 years, and I have a great relationship with the Trump administration, and I plan to continue that,\" Rankin said. \"I want to welcome President Trump. We want to invite him to California. We would like to see him here as many times as we can.\"\n\nIn the 2024 general election, Trump flipped several California counties red that had supported former President Joe Biden in 2020. Those counties include Butte, Fresno, Imperial, Inyo, Lake, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Stanislaus.\n\n\"A lot of people are favoring his policies show that through the campaign, a lot of counties flipped from blue to red, and a lot of voters voted for the top of the ticket,\" said Rankin, who was the 2016 statewide coalition director for African Americans for Trump. \"They voted for President Trump, and that goes across the aisle, people were voting for him.\"\n\nNEWSOM CALLS BIOLOGICAL MEN IN WOMEN'S SPORTS 'DEEPLY UNFAIR' IN PODCAST WITH CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST\n\nRankin said there's an \"underlying change\" occurring in California, as the party is hopeful it can make the state less blue while more voters move to the center. The new GOP chair pointed to the newly elected mayor of San Francisco, Daniel Lurie, who is \"a lot more moderate than the former mayor, London Breed,\" as an example of that change.\n\n\"I think that California is moving from the far left and more towards the center, and as the California Republicans, it's our job to make sure that we are offering solutions, that we're articulating our policies and our vision and how we want to represent our constituents,\" Rankin said.\n\nThe economy and public safety are going to be two major platform issues for the CAGOP moving forward, Rankin added. California has some of the highest state income and business taxes in the nation, and Republican lawmakers have doubled down in recent years, introducing bills to address affordability and the uptick in crime across the state's major cities.\n\nThe Golden State will hold its gubernatorial election in November 2026, with the next governor replacing termed-limited Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom. Rankin said the CAGOP has not favored any candidates yet and is waiting to see the full landscape of candidates who throw their hat in the race.\n\nNEWSOM SIGNS $50M 'TRUMP-PROOFING' LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRegarding Trump's contentious relationship with Newsom, who signed a $50 million package bolstering the state's legal defense against potential threats from the administration, Rankin said the CAGOP's role will be contributing to the \"ongoing conversation\" between state and national politics.\n\n\"We're going to make sure that our message is heard and that our message resonates with Californians and [Californians] know and understand the position of California Republicans,\" Rankin said. \"And I think, at the end of the day, we take a look at Prop. 36 and how it passed overwhelmingly, and that was a Republican-led initiative to make sure that we are fighting back on these Newsom-led soft-on-crime policies; and Californians overwhelmingly voted with us, so we're going to take that same approach to every single issue.\""

(El Salvador presidential press office via AP)\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela -- Debates over President Donald Trump\u2019s hardline migration policies are focused on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to some a ruthless transnational criminal organization and to others the pretext for an overhyped anti-migrant narrative.\n\nTrump labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on Saturday when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any noncitizen during wartime. Hours later, the Trump administration transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations. Flights were in the air when the ruling came down.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act requires a president to declare the United States at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners to whom immigration or criminal laws otherwise protect. It had been used only three times \u2014 the last time to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.\n\nThe Trump administration has not identified the more than 200 immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States.\n\nFrom the heartland to major cities like New York and Chicago, the gang has been blamed for sex trafficking, drug smuggling and police shootings, as well as the exploitation of the nearly 1 million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into the U.S. in recent years. Trump told Congress this month that a Venezuelan migrant found guilty of murdering 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus was a member of the gang.\n\nThe size of the gang is unclear as is the extent to which its actions are coordinated across state lines and national borders.\n\nThe Venezuelan gang entered U.S. political discourse after footage from a security camera surfaced on social media last summer showing heavily armed men entering an apartment in the Denver suburb of Aurora shortly before a fatal shooting outside. In response, Trump vowed to \u201c liberate Aurora \u201d from Venezuelans he falsely said were \u201ctaking over the whole town.\u201d\n\nThe city initially downplayed concerns. But most of the apartment complex was closed under an emergency order last month after officials said they suspected Tren de Aragua members in the kidnapping and assault of two residents.\n\nMost of the men seen in the video have been arrested, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement accusing them of gang membership.\n\nThe Tren, which means \u201ctrain\u201d in Spanish, traces its origin more than a decade ago to an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in the central state of Aragua. It has expanded in recent years as more than 8 million Venezuelans fled economic turmoil under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S.\n\nCountries such as Peru and Colombia \u2014 all with large populations of Venezuelan migrants \u2014 have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in a region that has long had some of the highest murder rates in the world. Some of its crimes have spread panic in poor neighborhoods, where the gang extorts local businesses and illegally charges residents for \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nThe gang operates as a loose network in the U.S. Tattoos, which are commonly used by Central American gangs, aren't required for those affiliated with the Tren, said Ronna Risquez, a Venezuelan journalist who wrote a 2023 book about the gang\u2019s origins.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump he took steps to designate the gang a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order Saturday accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami, \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country.\n\n\u201cThe result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order alleged.\n\nWes Tabor, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Venezuela when the gang first came onto law enforcement radar, said Trump's decision to give the DEA and other federal agencies authority to carry out immigrant arrests is a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d that will curtail the Tren's activities in the U.S.\n\nTabor said authorities need to build a robust database like it did when combating El Salvador's MS-13 containing biometric data, arrest information and intelligence from foreign law enforcement partners.\n\n\u201cWe have to use a hammer on an ant because if we don\u2019t it will get out of control,\u201d said Tabor. \u201cWe need to smash it now.\u201d\n\nIn Venezuela, officials originally expressed bafflement at the U.S. interest in the Tren, claiming it had dismantled the gang after retaking control of the prison where the group was born.\n\nAs Trump's immigration crackdown has intensified, they've conditioned their cooperation with U.S. deportation flights on progress in other areas in the long-strained bilateral relationship.\n\nLast month, authorities gave a hero's welcome to some 190 Venezuelan migrants deported by Trump, accusing the U.S. of spreading an \"ill-intentioned\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d narrative about the Tren in the U.S. They said most Venezuelan immigrants are decent, hard-working people and that U.S. officials were looking to stigmatize the South American nation.\n\nOver the weekend they protested the use of Trump\u2019s invocation of the wartime rules, likening it to the \u201cdarkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Fighting along the Syrian-Lebanese border intensified on Monday as deadly clashes erupted between the Syrian military and Hezbollah-aligned forces.\n\nThe escalation follows accusations from Syria\u2019s interim government that Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Syrian territory, kidnapped three soldiers and executed them on Lebanese soil. In response, the Syrian army launched artillery strikes on Hezbollah positions, targeting what it called \"gatherings\" of fighters responsible for the killings. Hezbollah has denied involvement.\n\nThe Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that the Syrian army successfully captured the village of Hawsh al-Sayyid Ali on the Syria-Lebanon border during the confrontations. Currently, most of the fighting is near the village of Al-Qasr.\n\nEarlier this morning, the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya reported intermittent clashes between the Syrian army and Hezbollah forces along the border. The report also claimed that a Hezbollah ammunition depot in Lebanon was destroyed by Syrian artillery fire.\n\nISRAEL FACES NEW SYRIA CHALLENGE AS IT ADJUSTS TO NEW STRATEGY AMID REGIONAL POWER STRUGGLE FOR INFLUENCE\n\nLebanese President Joseph Aoun addressed the escalating violence, saying, \"What is happening on the eastern and northeastern border cannot continue, and we will not accept its continuation. I have instructed the Lebanese army to respond to the sources of fire.\"\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least five additional Syrian soldiers were killed during the clashes. Civilians, including families with young children, were seen fleeing toward the Syrian village of Hermel as violence spread across the border region.\n\nThe newly established Syrian government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa of the U.S.-sanctioned terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, issued a rare statement vowing retaliation against Hezbollah.\n\n\"They took them to Lebanese territory and killed them. The Ministry of Defense will take all necessary measures in response to this escalation by Hezbollah,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe conflict reflects deeper sectarian and ideological divisions. HTS, a Sunni terrorist group with roots in Syria\u2019s jihadist insurgency and former ties to al Qaeda, and Hezbollah, a Shiite terrorist force backed by Iran, represent opposing factions in the ongoing struggle for regional dominance.\n\n\"Hezbollah is trying to take advantage of the new government\u2019s weakness in Syria, but the group itself is in a precarious position. It has suffered major setbacks from Israeli strikes, the fall of Assad, and now new adversaries in Syria,\" Javed Ali, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy and former senior director at the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe collapse of President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in December marked a major turning point, as Hezbollah had spent 14 years backing him alongside Russia and Iran\u2019s pro-Shiite militias. However, in late November, Syrian rebels launched a surprise offensive against Assad\u2019s forces, just as a ceasefire was announced in northern Gaza, leading to the final collapse of his rule.\n\nEVANGELICAL LEADER SAYS US MUST PROTECT SYRIAN CHRISTIANS FROM ATTACKS BY JIHADI TERRORISTS\n\nNow in power, HTS has pledged to crack down on weapons and drug smuggling along the border, a move that directly threatens Hezbollah\u2019s operations. The new Syrian government has already begun military deployments to secure its borders, further restricting Hezbollah\u2019s ability to maneuver.\n\n\"Hezbollah is facing a confluence of threats unlike any time in its history,\" said Ali. \"With HTS consolidating control in Syria, Hezbollah\u2019s overland weapons supply route from Iran has been severely compromised. This disruption could significantly degrade its operational capabilities.\"\n\nThe rise of HTS as a governing force in Syria has also drawn U.S. attention. While Washington has designated HTS as a terrorist organization, analysts suggest that al-Sharaa's pragmatic approach should be assessed cautiously.\n\n\"The U.S. is navigating a complex landscape in Syria, and while it does not officially recognize HTS, there are strategic interests in seeing Hezbollah and Iranian influence further weakened,\" Ali noted.\n\nHTS has attempted to rebrand itself from its extremist origins, portraying itself as a nationalist Islamist movement opposed to Iranian influence and Hezbollah\u2019s expansion in Syria. While skepticism remains, the group\u2019s control over key Syrian territory disrupts Iran\u2019s ability to maintain a direct supply corridor to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nBeyond Syria, Hezbollah is also facing growing challenges in Lebanon. The group\u2019s losses in recent confrontations with Israel have emboldened its domestic opponents, who now see an opportunity to weaken its grip on Lebanese politics.\n\nFormer Lebanese President Michel Aoun echoed these concerns, highlighting three major threats to Lebanon\u2019s stability: ongoing Israeli attacks, Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in cross-border violence, and the unresolved Syrian refugee crisis.\n\n\"Officials must take immediate action to protect the safety of the nation and its citizens,\" he said.\n\nFurther complicating the situation, Mounir Shehadeh, a former Lebanese government coordinator with the United Nations Interim Force peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, said \"there is no presence of Hezbollah in the northeastern Bekaa Valley, and this is known by the people and tribes in the region.\" His statement contradicts reports of Hezbollah\u2019s activity along the Lebanese-Syrian border, raising questions about the true extent of its control.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnalysts say the long-term implications of these developments remain uncertain, but Hezbollah\u2019s regional position is rapidly deteriorating. While Lebanese and Syrian officials are working to contain the crisis, the risk of further escalation remains high."

            "full_content": "The federal judge who temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals could be at the center of a larger battle after Trump's border czar vowed Monday to continue sending migrants back to Latin America.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg made headlines Saturday for granting an emergency restraining order blocking the Trump administration from invoking a 1798 law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua, for 14 days. Boasberg sided with the plaintiffs, Democracy Forward and the ACLU, in ruling that the deportations would likely pose imminent and \"irreparable\" harm.\n\n\"Given the exigent circumstances that [the court] has been made aware of this morning, it has determined that an immediate Order is warranted to maintain the status quo until a hearing can be set,\" Boasberg said in his order, which blocked Trump from invoking any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act for two weeks.\n\nHis decision drew immediate criticism from Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, who declared in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" that, \"We are not stopping.\"\n\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW BAN ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\n\"I don't care what the judges think. I don't care what the Left thinks. We're coming,\" Homan, said, adding, \"Another fight. Another fight every day.\"\n\nThis was not the first time Boasberg found himself in the crosshairs of Trump's supporters \u2013 he previously oversaw the FISA court that authorized surveillance of certain members of Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nBoasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., was appointed to the bench nearly 15 years ago by President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2014, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appointed him to serve a seven-year term on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA Court \u2013 a court comprised of 11 federal judges hand-selected by the chief justice.\n\nThe judges undergo extensive background checks prior to their confirmation, and are tasked with approving surveillance requests and wiretap warrants sought by federal prosecutors, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Most of their work remains classified.\n\nBoasberg served as the presiding judge of the FISA Court from 2020 to 2021.\n\nRUBIO HEADS TO PANAMA, LATIN AMERICA TO PURSUE TRUMP'S 'GOLDEN AGE' AGENDA\n\nA graduate of Yale, Oxford University and Yale Law, Boasberg clerked for the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before later joining the Justice Department as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter returning full-time to the federal bench, Boasberg oversaw the sentencing of former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty to doctoring a 2017 email asking to extend surveillance permissions for its wiretap of former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page.\n\nBoasberg declined to sentence Clinesmith to prison time and instead ordered him to just 12 months of probation and 400 hours of community service \u2013 a notable decision, given his own background on the FISA court.\n\nHe said in his sentencing decision that he believed Clinesmith's role at the center of a years-long media \"hurricane\" had provided sufficient punishment.\n\n\"Anybody who has watched what Mr. Clinesmith has suffered is not someone who will readily act in that fashion,\" Boasberg said.\n\nHERE'S WHY DOZENS OF LAWSUITS SEEKING TO QUASH TRUMP'S EARLY ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT ARE FAILING\n\n\"Weighing all of these factors together \u2013 both in terms of the damages he caused and what he has suffered and the positives in his own life \u2013 I believe a probationary sentence is appropriate here and will therefore impose it,\" he continued.\n\nUntil recently, Boasberg has largely avoided making headlines, including any public broadsides that may have put him at odds with the Trump administration. That changed quickly when he granted the restraining order this weekend.\n\nThe decision was immediately appealed by lawyers for the Trump administration.\n\nAlthough Boasberg's order said any plane carrying migrants removed by the law in question be \"immediately\" returned to the U.S., the decision apparently came too late to stop an early wave of migrants being deported to El Salvador.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that a plane carrying hundreds of individuals \u2013 including more than 130 persons removed under the Alien Enemies Act \u2013 had already \"left U.S. airspace\" by the time the order was handed down.\n\n\"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,\" Leavitt said.\n\nIt is unclear what, if any, steps the judge could take to reverse that action.\n\nThe standoff is the latest in a wave of legal challenges seeking to block or slow the wave of sweeping executive actions or orders Trump has issued in his second White House term, a fight that has come to define Trump's first few months back in office.\n\nCourts have struggled to slow the dizzying pace of executive orders, which have called for the gutting of government personnel from federal agencies, halted billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, and attempted to ban birthright citizenship, among other things.\n\nAs of this writing, Trump has signed at least 200 executive orders and actions \u2013 most of which have been met with multiple court challenges and lawsuits.\n\nMost are in the earliest stages of legal limbo, as courts seek to clarify the intent of the ruling, the alleged harm caused to plaintiffs, and later, to discern whether it is necessary or appropriate for the courts to intervene.\n\nThe White House asserts that lower court judges like Boasberg should not have the power to prevent the president from executing what it argues is a lawful agenda \u2013 though the judges in question have disagreed that the president's actions all follow the law.\n\n\"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,\" Leavitt told Fox News.\n\nAt issue is Trump's use of the 228-year-old Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport Venezuelan nationals presumed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nPlaintiffs have argued that Congress originally passed the law centuries ago to give the president more power during times of war to deport noncitizens. Since its creation, it has been used just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I, and most recently, during World War II.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey argued in their filing that it would be inappropriate for Trump to use the law now as a means of deporting Venezuelan migrants, as the country \"is not invading the United States\" and has not launched a \"predatory incursion\" into U.S. territory.\n\nBoasberg agreed, noting Saturday that the two-week freeze will give the court more time to consider the merits of the case at hand."

This is commonsense security,\" McLaughlin said.\n\n\"Foreign nationals who promote extremist ideologies or carry terrorist propaganda are inadmissible to the U.S., plain and simple,\" Hilton Beckham, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Assistant Commissioner of Public Affairs, added in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"A visa does not guarantee entry \u2013 CBP has the final authority after conducting rigorous security checks. Officers act swiftly to deny entry to those who glorify terrorist organizations, advocate violence, or openly support terrorist leaders and commemorate their deaths. Anyone found with extremist materials linked to a U.S.-designated terrorist group will be removed.\"\n\nRasha Alawieh, a 34-year-old physician specializing in kidney transplants who was most recently living in Rhode Island, was detained at Boston Logan International Airport on Thursday while coming back from a trip to Lebanon.\n\nEL SALVADOR TAKES IN HUNDREDS OF VENEZUELAN GANG MEMBERS FROM US, EVEN AS JUDGE MOVES TO BLOCK DEPORTATIONS\n\nAlawieh was questioned by CBP and allegedly told federal agents she had attended the funeral of Nasrallah, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sady reportedly wrote in a new filing Monday.\n\nThe filing has since been placed under seal, but Politico and The Providence Journal were able to report its contents beforehand.\n\nAlawieh allegedly stated she supported Nasrallah \"from a religious perspective,\" but not politically, according to Politico.\n\nFederal authorities said they also conducted a search of Alawieh's phone and found \"sympathetic photos and videos\" of Hezbollah leaders, as well as materials showing \"various other Hezbollah militants\" in a deleted folder.\n\n\"With the discovery of these photographs and videos, CBP questioned Dr. Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,\" DOJ lawyers wrote, according to the Journal. \"As such, CBP canceled her visa and deemed Dr. Alawieh inadmissible to the United States.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, on Friday ordered an in-person hearing regarding Alawieh's case to take place on Monday.\n\nSorokin ordered that Alawieh not be deported for at least 48 hours without giving the court 48 hours notice.

She went on to complete a fellowship at the University of Washington and an internal medicine program at Yale.\n\nHer cousin, Yara Chehab, attempted to intervene in court last week while Alawieh had been detained at the airport for over 36 hours.

It is affiliated with Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School, but is not operated by the university or the medical school.\n\nAlawieh was issued an H-1B visa on March 11 to pursue an assistant professor of medicine and clinician educator role at Brown University.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nOver the weekend, the Trump administration invoked wartime powers to deport hundreds of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang from the US to El Salvador. After a lawsuit was filed, a federal judge ordered the administration to stop the deportations, for now. Here\u2019s a timeline of where the deportation flights were as the legal case unfolded:\n\nMarch 15 before noon (all times Eastern)\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg issues a written order temporarily blocking the government from removing five specific individuals who sued the Trump administration over President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:00 p.m.\n\nJudge James Boasberg\u2019s hearing begins, according to a CNN reporter covering the proceedings.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:22 p.m.\n\nThe court hearing adjourns for a break, according to a CNN reporter covering the proceedings.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:26 p.m.\n\nThe first flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6143, departs from Harlingen, Texas, according to FlightRadar24 data. FlightRadar24 is a live air traffic tracker showing flight times.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:45 p.m.\n\nA second flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6145, departs from Harlingen, Texas, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 15 at 6:00 p.m.\n\nThe court hearing resumes, according to a CNN reporter covering the proceedings.\n\nMarch 15 between 6:45 p.m. and 6:48 p.m.\n\nDuring the court hearing, the judge verbally tells Justice Department lawyers that they need to turn around any planes carrying anyone being deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The exact timing for this utterance is based on what the defendants who sued the Trump administration put in a court filing. According to a transcript of the hearing, the judge said: \u201cany plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States\u2026 this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\u201d\n\nMarch 15 at 7:26 p.m.\n\nThe judge\u2019s written order is posted to the online federal docket system known as PACER, according to the lawyers who sued the Trump administration. The written order is a formalized version of what the judge said during the hearing. He wrote: \u201cAs discussed in today\u2019s hearing, the Court ORDERS that\u2026 The Government is ENJOINED from removing\u201d from the country any non-citizens in US custody who are covered by Trump\u2019s proclamation about the Alien Enemies Act. The brief written order did not specifically include language about turning flights around.\n\nMarch 15 at 7:36 p.m.\n\nThe first flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6143, arrives in Comayagua, Honduras, according to FlightRadar24. The lawyers who sued the Trump administration pointed out that this and the other flights landed after the judge \u2013 both verbally and in writing \u2013 ordered the government to turn around any planes.\n\nMarch 15 at 7:37 p.m.\n\nThe third flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6122, departs from Harlingen, Texas, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 15 at 8:08 p.m.\n\nThe second flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6145, lands in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, at 8:08 p.m., according to FlightRadar24. (The lawyers who sued the Trump administration inaccurately said in a court filing that this flight landed in San Salvador at 8:02 p.m., but flight tracking data specified otherwise.)\n\nMarch 15 at 9:52 p.m.\n\nThe third flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6122, arrives in San Salvador, El Salvador according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 15 at 11:37 p.m.\n\nThe second flight carrying non-citizens for deportations continues its journey, departing from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 16 at 12:21 a.m.\n\nThe second flight carrying non-citizens for deportations finishes its journey, landing in San Salvador, El Salvador, according to FlightRadar 24.\n\nMarch 16 around 3:46 p.m.\n\nThe Justice Department submits a notice to the judge, acknowledging his rulings, but also saying some people were already deported. The notice said, \u201csome gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory under the Proclamation before the issuance of this Court\u2019s second order,\u201d specifically referring to Boasberg\u2019s written ruling posted to the docket at 7:26pm."

The Marines will continue to help improve the border area east of San Diego, most notably where a gap in this existing structure exists.\n\nBORDER AREA BUSTLING UNDER BIDEN NOW QUIET UNDER TRUMP, SAYS VETERANS GROUP: 'AMAZING DIFFERENCE'\n\n\"We are the engineers that are conducting the construction down on the southern border in order to reinforce the existing primary and secondary barrier that exists in the San Diego sector,\" Lt. Col. Tyrone Barrion, the commanding officer of Task Force Sapper, told Fox News Digital, noting that the Marines' efforts have created an \"obstacle that disrupts any type of activity that tries to cross over the top or through the barrier.\"\n\n\"That allows more reaction time for border patrol,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple companies of Army engineers and military police officers based out of Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, have been deployed to the San Diego sector to assist with surveillance and detection operations, giving CBP agents more eyes on the border and allowing them to move more quickly to apprehend illegal border crossers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe all-hands-on-deck approach since the start of the Trump administration has contributed to the successful missions, Stalnaker said.\n\n\"It\u2019s a force multiplier, it assists us to accomplish our mission,\" Stalnaker said. \"And it\u2019s not just DOD, there are additional federal partners, state and local partners, we have extremely good partnerships here in the San Diego sector that act as force multipliers. And it\u2019s that whole og government approach that it takes for us to accomplish our mission.\""

St. Patrick\u2019s Day has become an opportunity for Ireland and the United States to celebrate their rich cultural and political connections.\n\nNew York City is hosting its 264th St. Patrick's Day Parade today \u2013 marking the oldest and longest standing St. Patrick's Day parade in the world. The first parade was held in 1762, predating America's Declaration of Independence.\n\nMajor cities across the United States hosted their own St. Patrick's Day parades this weekend \u2013 including Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Chicago. Chicago even dyes the Chicago River green each year to mark the celebration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson kicked off the Irish celebrations last week by welcoming \u200bTaoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin to the White House.\n\nIRISH LEADERS BOYCOTT WASHINGTON ST PATRICK'S DAY EVENTS OVER TRUMP'S GAZA COMMENTS\n\n\"America's truly been blessed by the courage and unstoppable spirit of the Irish,\" Trump said at the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon on Wednesday. \"Over the generations, Americans of Irish ancestry have helped build our railroads and raise our cities and man our factories, enrich our culture with art and music and literature \u2013 we see that all over \u2013 and protect our communities by joining the proud tradition of Irish-American police officers and firefighters. And few have done more for the Stars and Stripes than the sons and daughters of the Emerald Isle.\"\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP SLAMS ROSIE O'DONNELL AFTER SHE FLEES US: 'YOU'RE BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING' HER\n\nWhile the first wave of Irish immigrants arrived in the United States in the 1700s, immigration reports reveal the Great Famine in the 1800s nearly doubled the population of Irish in the United States \u2013 as over a million Irish died from starvation while another million immigrated to the United States.\n\nTrump, a native New Yorker, spoke with pride of New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade, watching \"hundreds of citizens decked in Irish green\" marching up Fifth Avenue and past \"the most beautiful cathedral in the world,\" St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nThe Taoiseach's trip to Washington, D.C., began with a breakfast at the vice president's residence, followed by the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon and a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office answering questions from reporters.\n\n\"Irish America has been at the heart of shaping this great nation. The ideals of liberty, democracy and equality of opportunity forged in this country did much to inspire Irish independence. Our histories are interconnected because our people are interconnected. Today, as the president has said, more than 30 million people claim Irish ancestry in the United States,\" Martin said.\n\nThe celebratory events were not without some political tension when Trump said the United States has a \"massive deficit\" with Ireland because they \"took our pharmaceutical companies away from presidents who didn't know what they were doing.\" Trump said the European Union, which includes Ireland, \"treats us very badly.\"\n\nMartin countered Trump's comments, saying, \"It's a two-way street to where we are investing a lot more in America now.\" However, Trump maintained that reciprocal tariffs were only fair.\n\nMartin presented Trump with a crystal bowl filled with shamrocks, a tradition that dates back to 1952 to symbolize the long-standing friendship between Ireland and the United States. Martin said the Shamrock Bowl ceremony is \"an important moment to reflect upon the relationship between our two countries.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill, Sen. Ted Kennedy, and fellow Irish-American lawmakers began the Friends of Ireland Caucus and Luncheon in 1981, during \"The Troubles.\"\n\n\"The Troubles\" were a period of political and sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s and 1998. Irish Republicans, who were predominately Catholic, sought a united Ireland, while Unionists, who were mostly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\nWhen Britain tried to enforce military conscription in Ireland during World War I, Irish nationalists, labor unions and the Catholic Church united in opposition. As support for Irish independence grew, Sinn F\u00e9in, an Irish nationalist party, gained popularity following the 1916 Easter Rising.\n\nAfter winning a majority in the general election in 1918, Sinn F\u00e9in declared Irish independence and established the First D\u00e1il, or the Irish Parliament. But Britain refused to recognize Irish independence, leading the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to launch the Irish War of Independence in 1919.\n\nThe Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 ended the war and created the Irish Free State, which became the Republic of Ireland in 1949 and allowed the six counties of Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. Catholics in Northern Ireland faced discrimination from the unionist government, who favored Protestants. Inspired by the Civil Rights movement, Catholics began peaceful protests demanding equal rights in Northern Ireland in the 1960s.\n\nConflicts between the unionist government and nationalist protesters escalated into \"The Troubles\" \u2013 30 years of violence between British soldiers and the IRA. The United States was instrumental in ending \"The Troubles\" in 1998.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton helped negotiate the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which largely ended the violence in Ireland by establishing a power-sharing agreement between unionists and nationalists \u2013 strengthening the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nMartin on Wednesday said former President Ronald Reagan initiated the United States' role in the peace process, as the first U.S. president to visit Ireland. The Reagan administration helped develop the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, which laid the groundwork for the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n\"Nowhere is the strength of the U.S.-Irish relationship more in evident than in our own peace process. 44 years ago, President Reagan called for a just and peaceful solution to the conflict that has for so long devastated lives on our island. Politicians from both sides of the aisle rose to the occasion, and the lasting peace we enjoyed today on our island is a signature achievement of U.S. foreign policy, and this story of peace is one that we both wrote together,\" Martin said.\n\nMartin commended Trump for leading peace negotiations in Ukraine and the Middle East during his visit to Washington, following Trump's contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office last month.\n\n\"We are ready to play our part in supporting work, to end conflict and to secure peace in the Ukraine, or in the Middle East or wherever. We welcome very much the unrelenting focus and effort that President Trump and his administration has brought to this task from his very first days in office,\" Martin added.\n\nYet, there were Irish officials who disagreed with Martin's sentiment and boycotted the events at the White House last week. Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald and Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O'Neill skipped St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations in the U.S. this year to protest Trump's calling for the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nTrump said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip.\" Trump also suggested relocating Palestinians to rebuild Gaza as the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"\n\nWhen reporters asked Trump about the boycott during the press conference in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said, \"I really haven't heard that.\" However, Trump also seemed to walk back his Gaza comments, telling a reporter: \"Nobody's expelling any Palestinians.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIreland is a long-time supporter of Palestinian independence, as many Irish draw parallels with the British occupation of Ireland. Ireland has advocated for full Palestinian statehood and a two-state solution throughout the war in Gaza. Irish citizens have vocally opposed the war in Gaza and consistently protested in support of Palestinians since the war began."

After forcing their way inside, statues were destroyed, glass smashed and other extensive damage exacted upon this sacred space,\" said the conference.\n\nThe Wichita Police Department also released a statement in which it said it is working with federal law enforcement to launch a \"full-scale investigation.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, police arrested a suspect in connection with the attack, a 23-year-old man from Saline County, at 2:20 a.m. on Sunday. Local outlet Salina Post identified the man as Michael Angel Gonzalez, citing Sedgwick County booking records.\n\nDANCING TRANSGENDER HECKLERS SHUT DOWN PARENTS' EVENT AT BLUE STATE'S CAPITOL: 'SAD AND UNFORTUNATE'\n\nThe man was arrested without incident and was booked into the Sedgwick County Jail on charges of Burglary, Criminal Desecration, and Criminal Damage to Property. The police said the case will be presented to the Sedgwick County district attorney and federal prosecutors for formal charging considerations.\n\nSpeaking at the scene, Wichita Police Chief Joe Sullivan called the attack \"disgusting,\" according to local outlet KSNW.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter what denomination. People should feel safe there, and they should feel that it\u2019s a place that would be respected,\" he said.\n\nSullivan said, \"this reprehensible act of vandalism will not be tolerated.\"\n\nICONIC ST.

And I would suspect that we're going to have to get a decision from the Supreme Court.\"\n\nA senior White House official told Fox News Digital Monday that the Trump Administration \"is currently appealing to the 4th and 9th Circuit.\"\n\n\"In the meantime, the Administration is complying with the Court\u2019s order,\" the official said. \"We fully expect to prevail in court.\"\n\nSECOND JUDGE REQUIRES TRUMP ADMIN TO REHIRE PROBATIONARY WORKERS LET GO IN MASS FIRINGS\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup, issued the order last week during a federal court hearing in San Francisco on a lawsuit brought by labor unions and other organizations challenging the mass firings ordered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\n\"And that's a very dangerous decision for our country, because these are people in many cases, they don't show up for work. Nobody even knows if they exist. And a judge wants us to pay them, even if they don't know they exist and if they exist,\" Trump said to reporters. \"And I don't think that's going to be happening.

In Baltimore, U.S. District Judge James Bredar, ruled the firings should cease for two weeks while the federal workforce returns to its previous regulations, arguing the Trump administration ignored procedures for mass layoffs.\n\nJUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMIN TO REINSTATE PROBATIONARY WORKERS FIRED AT 6 AGENCIES\n\nTrump, calling the order \"absolutely ridiculous,\" ordered the mass layoffs across six government agencies: the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury. The Trump administration has already filed an appeal to the order, arguing that states have no standing to influence the federal government\u2019s relationship with its employees. Trump's attorneys contend the layoffs were performance-related, not subject to the regulations governing large-scale reductions.\n\nProbationary workers \u2013 employees who are still within their initial trial period of employment \u2013 have been the target of the layoffs since they're typically new to the job and lack certain civil protection benefits offered to government employees. Several lawsuits have already been filed over the mass firings.\n\nBLUE STATE OFFERS TO HIRE FEDERAL WORKERS FIRED BY DOGE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Trump administration's lawyers find themselves busy as more than 100 lawsuits have been filed against Trump's orders since he took office in January.

            "full_content": "Johannesburg \u2014 The Trump administration expelled South Africa's Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool on Friday, giving him 72 hours to leave the country. In a social media post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Rasool a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\" and President Trump.\n\nIn a diplomatic notice, the Department of State said that it would no longer recognize Ambassador Rasool as a \"member of the [South African] mission from today, March 17,\" adding that \"his privileges and immunities will cease\" and that he was \"persona non grata\" in the United States.\n\nThe expulsion came after Rasool, during a webinar hosted by the South African Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection, accused Mr. Trump of pursuing policies and practices that the diplomat characterized as \"a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States.\"\n\nRasool was expelled just two months after he arrived in Washington to serve as his country's envoy.\n\n\"Improving our relationship with the United States of America is a priority for us,\" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told journalists on Monday, calling the U.S. \"our second largest trading partner after China.\"\n\n\"We have noted the displeasure that has been expressed by the United States, particularly about the remarks he made,\" Ramaphosa said, adding that he expected Rasool to return to Pretoria and \"give me a full report.\"\n\nEbrahim Rasool speaks onstage on March 18, 2013, in New York City. Donald Bowers/Getty/Shared Interest\n\nIt's the latest in a string of incidents that have seen a marked deterioration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and South Africa since Mr. Trump took office for his second term in January.\n\nSpeaking on South African television on Saturday, the country's foreign minister said the decision by the U.S. to expel Rasool, who previously campaigned against the country's racist Apartheid regime, was \"unprecedented and regrettable,\" before adding: \"We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the U.S. can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them, because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy.\"\n\nA pro-Hamas, anti-Israel ambassador to the U.S.?\n\nRasool's appointment to head the South African diplomatic mission in the U.S., by the ruling African National Congress party, was a contentious one even before he arrived in Washington, dividing opinions within the country's new Government of National Unity (GNU). The ANC had to build the coalition government to maintain power after failing to win a significant enough majority in the last elections to govern on its own.\n\n\"Rasool's appointment was opposed by all of the other political parties in the GNU, and was the first large point of contention between the parties,\" Wiliam Gumede, a professor of public management at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, explained to CBS News.\n\n\"Eventually, the non-ANC partners caved in,\" Gumede said, which led to Rasool getting the job.\n\n\"He is perceived to be pro-Iran and Hamas, as well as strongly anti-Israel, which is largely why it was felt he was the wrong choice for the ambassador post,\" Gumede told CBS News.\n\nRasool has long been a controversial figure in South African politics, having spoken favorably of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas, and even boasting of his ties with the group's leadership. He is a strong backer of the case South Africa filed with the United Nations' top court, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently rejected that accusation, arguing that its war in the Palestinian enclave has been a legitimate self-defense against Hamas following the group's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.\n\nGumede said he believed the way for Ramaphosa to ease the tension with Washington was for the South African president to publicly label Rasool's comments \"unacceptable,\" while also giving a detailed acknowledgement of how important relations and aid from the U.S. are to South Africa.\n\nThe analyst said if such measures were not taken by Pretoria to smooth the relationship, the impasse could deepen, with significant implications for South Africa.\n\n\"I fear the next step steps could be targeted economic sanctions against South Africa, which would mean we are in danger of losing 300,000 to 400,000 direct jobs in the country, as well as hundreds of thousands more jobs through indirect channels,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not too late,\" Gumede added. \"President Trump has a lot of South Africans in his inner circle. We need to engage them and put together a team of non-ANC partners from the Government of National Unity to travel to the U.S. and engage the Trump team. The relationship is simply too important not to.\""

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIf Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, was who I believed him to be, he was not going to acknowledge it. He probably wouldn\u2019t talk to me. And seeing him was going to mean sitting on a plane for 20 hours and driving another eight. But I needed to try to have a conversation with him, and it had to be face-to-face.\n\nNakamoto had disappeared in the spring of 2011. I learned about him that summer, when I wrote one of the first magazine feature articles about Bitcoin, the internet-based currency that operates beyond the control of a government or bank. Twelve years later, Bitcoin\u2019s creator remained unknown and his enormous, multibillion-dollar fortune untouched. The modern history of science supplied no precedent for someone who brought a revolutionary technology into the world without taking credit, or spending a penny of the billions of dollars it earned him.\n\nDenied a flesh-and-blood human to venerate, acolytes of Bitcoin had conferred on the pseudonym the halo of legend. In 2022, Kanye West stepped from an Escalade in Beverly Hills wearing a Satoshi Nakamoto baseball hat. In Budapest, adherents unveiled the first statue of Nakamoto, a depiction in bronze of a hooded, spectral figure. A trio of libertarians bought a decommissioned cruise ship, christened it the MS Satoshi, and recruited settlers for the world\u2019s first sovereign Bitcoin-powered society. More than one fellow technologist lobbied for Nakamoto to receive a Nobel Prize.\n\nWhen I first wrote about Nakamoto in 2011, I couldn\u2019t have foreseen that more than a decade later his identity would remain a mystery. Since then, numerous attempts to unmask Nakamoto had failed, sometimes spectacularly. In 2014, Newsweek confidently identified the wrong guy, a California systems engineer whose real name was Dorian Nakamoto, unleashing a media siege of his house that lasted for days. Even 60 Minutes, with untold resources and a deep bench of seasoned investigative journalists, threw up its hands and declared the challenge \u201cmission impossible.\u201d Yet now, against all odds, I believed I had cracked it.\n\nI was nervous. This was someone who\u2019d gone to great lengths to be unfindable. And what I\u2019d learned about him was disturbing. He was nothing like how people had imagined Satoshi Nakamoto. He\u2019d repeatedly described himself as dangerous. He had guns.\n\nHe also owned at least four properties on two continents. I\u2019d initially thought he was hiding out in a remote part of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, but now, in the summer of 2023, I\u2019d come to believe that he lived in a small beach community on the east coast of Australia.\n\nI was fretting about all this when I met my sister for dinner.\n\nI told her my anxieties. She\u2019d been a TV-news producer for 20 years and had been onsite in Montana with 48 Hours after the FBI raided the Unabomber\u2019s property and arrested him.\n\nShe suggested I take professional security people with me. And that I wear a bulletproof vest. And give local police a heads-up.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumbled.\n\nLater that night, she texted me: \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep not sure why.\u201d\n\nIt was 4:09 a.m.\n\n\u201cTwo thoughts. Maybe doorstep him in a public place if he ever leaves the house. Also might be worth having someone video the encounter (from a safe distance) for evidence.\u201d\n\nCould It Be Elon Musk?\n\nEighteen months earlier, on New Year\u2019s Eve 2021, an email had arrived in my inbox.\n\n\u201cSubject: New information re Satoshi.\u201d\n\nSince writing that early Bitcoin article, I\u2019d periodically receive emails like this. Someone was always shopping a new Satoshi theory.\n\nUsually, I paid little heed to these, which tended to rekindle a fleeting hope of learning something fresh before proving unconvincing. This email had no text, but a link led to a blog post titled \u201cI\u2019m the SpaceX Intern Who Speculated Satoshi Is Elon Musk. There Is More to the Story.\u201d The author, Sahil Gupta, had produced a ripple on the internet four years earlier with another post making the case that Musk was \u201cprobably\u201d Nakamoto. Now he presented further evidence: an account of an interaction he\u2019d had with Musk\u2019s chief of staff, Sam Teller. It seemed slight and ambiguous, and I didn\u2019t respond.\n\nTwo days later, I received another email from the same address. This one contained a link to Gupta\u2019s detailed case for Musk as Nakamoto. I didn\u2019t know what to make of his arguments, which ranged from vague to highly technical. Still, I wrote back.\n\nSahil told me that in 2015, when he was an undergraduate at Yale, he\u2019d scored a summer internship writing inventory-management software at the SpaceX rocket factory in Hawthorne, California. Musk was in the office maybe three days a week, and Sahil would see him in the hallways. Sahil was majoring in computer science, and for a senior thesis he proposed a central-bank digital currency called fedcoin in which the U.S. improved the dollar by taking the best aspects of Bitcoin. The paper\u2019s acknowledgments thanked \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto for being a straight up legend.\u201d\n\nWhile researching the thesis, Sahil steeped himself in cryptocurrency literature, starting with the nine-page white paper where Nakamoto first described Bitcoin. Reading the Bitcoin creator\u2019s writing, he was struck by similarities to Musk\u2019s language. Both spoke of \u201corder of magnitude\u201d reasoning and used the word bloody. Nakamoto talked about money in a conceptual way, as Musk had done when he was an executive at PayPal in the early aughts. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of programming in the C++ language and was knowledgeable about cryptography. Sahil began to wonder: Might the inventor of Bitcoin have been in front of us all along, hiding in the dazzle of his own celebrity?\n\nWhen Sahil graduated from college, he decided he wanted to work directly for Musk. After emailing Musk several times, he got a phone interview with Teller, his chief of staff.\n\nAs the call with Teller drew to a close, Sahil took a chance:\n\n\u201cIs Elon Satoshi?\u201d\n\n\u201cTeller didn\u2019t say anything for 15 seconds,\u201d Sahil told me.\n\n\u201cThen he said, \u2018Well, what can I say?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was another big clue,\u201d Sahil said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s going on. Like, I surprised him. The answer I got is pretty telling.\u201d Later that year, Sahil wrote his \u201cElon Musk Probably Invented Bitcoin\u201d blog post. He argued that the Bitcoin community, which had been riven by strife over how and whether to mainstream the technology, would benefit from the return of its founder to guide it. A few cryptocurrency blogs picked up Sahil\u2019s theory, and Bloomberg News covered it. For his part, Musk tweeted: \u201cNot true. A friend sent me part of a [bitcoin] a few years [ago], but I don\u2019t know where it is.\u201d\n\nAs the years passed and he connected more dots, Sahil became even more convinced that Musk was Nakamoto. He noted that Luke Nosek, a cofounder of PayPal, had once said that the company\u2019s original goal was to develop a currency free from banks. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of using two spaces after a period in his writing. Musk regularly flew in and out of Van Nuys Airport, which matched up with perhaps the only security lapse Nakamoto had ever made: Early in Bitcoin\u2019s history, an email from Nakamoto to another software developer inadvertently betrayed an IP address in north Los Angeles. Sahil learned that early Bitcoin coders had considered Satoshi \u201cbossy\u201d; Musk was certainly that.\n\nIn late 2021, Musk had recently been named Time\u2019s Person of the Year. SpaceX had successfully docked a capsule at the International Space Station. Musk had even tweeted playfully about dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency (it subsequently went parabolic in price, then crashed). Sahil felt that the media might now finally be ready to accept that Nakamoto, who was now seen almost universally as a benevolent genius, and Musk were the same person.\n\nSahil told me he was \u201c99 percent sure\u201d about his theory. He chalked up others\u2019 doubts to prejudice against Musk.\n\nOkay, but Musk wasn\u2019t humble, so why would he deny being Bitcoin\u2019s creator? To Sahil, this was evidence of Musk\u2019s savvy. \u201cUnlike a company that needs marketing, Bitcoin was stronger and could grow faster, in the early days, when it had the aura of an anonymous founder.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know if Sahil was right, but I could relate to his fixation. Bitcoin had recently hit an all-time high of nearly $70,000 for a single coin, and the market value of all bitcoins in circulation had passed $1 trillion. El Salvador had recognized bitcoin as legal tender. In 2011, it hadn\u2019t seemed like such a big deal that no one knew who Nakamoto was. But how was it possible that even now no one knew?\n\nSix months later, I quit my job to devote myself full time to unraveling the mystery that had first beguiled me a decade earlier.\n\nThe Vanishing\n\nOn Halloween 2008, someone going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto had posted a short write-up outlining \u201ca peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d on an obscure, moderated email list about cryptography informally known as Metzdowd. That none of its subscribers had heard of Satoshi Nakamoto didn\u2019t strike anyone as odd. Metzdowd was frequented by people devoted to secrecy. They were used to aliases.\n\nIn his write-up, Nakamoto described a new kind of money. It would run on a network of volunteers\u2019 computers. It would use a transparent public ledger collectively maintained by the network, rather than relying on a bank\u2019s or government\u2019s database of debits and credits. Nakamoto included a link to a more detailed formal description that would come to be known as \u201cthe Bitcoin white paper.\u201d\n\nA few members of the list gave Nakamoto feedback on the software he was writing, and he gamely welcomed it. \u201cI appreciate your questions,\u201d he told one in an email, adding, \u201cI actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.\u201d In early January of 2009, Nakamoto released an alpha version of Bitcoin on SourceForge, then a popular site for open-source software projects, which welcome any programmers who want to take part. The first day, according to one early Bitcoiner, 127 people downloaded the Bitcoin software.\n\nA lot of the first participants were programmers who thought money was overdue for a product update. Paper bills and coins faded, wrinkled, tore, got dirty, spread germs. They were available only in fixed denominations, could be counterfeited, and were hard to move in any significant quantity. Bitcoin was durable, unforgeable, almost infinitely divisible. It might finally realize the internet commerce dream of microtransactions. You could send any amount of it anywhere instantly.\n\nBitcoin, as a currency based on 0s and 1s in a cloud maintained by far-flung, ordinary individuals, was also immune to meddling by central powers. Unlike bars of gold, bitcoin couldn\u2019t be seized. Unlike a bank account, it couldn\u2019t be frozen. Unlike a national currency, it couldn\u2019t be devalued at the whim of a central bank or subjected to capital controls by a dictator.\n\nAt the heart of Nakamoto\u2019s creation was something called the blockchain, an ever-lengthening record of all transactions (buy, sell, etc.) that had occurred in the system. Approximately every ten minutes, the latest batch of transaction records were bundled into a \u201cblock,\u201d and the block was \u201cchained\u201d onto the block that had preceded it using some clever math that made it impractical for anyone to go back and tamper with the block\u2019s contents. This record, or ledger, which in traditional finance would be maintained by an institution such as a government or bank, was maintained by a network of volunteers\u2019 computers, each of which ran the Bitcoin software and stored constantly updating copies of the ledger.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin was an open-source project \u2014 an it-takes-a-village group effort \u2014 someone needed to be in charge, and for the first 20 months that was Satoshi Nakamoto. He would release code, other developers would suggest patches, and he would integrate the ones he liked.\n\nFour months after Gavin Andresen, a software developer, began contributing programming code to the Bitcoin project, his dedication and computer-science chops seemed to have won Nakamoto\u2019s trust. First, Nakamoto gave Gavin direct access to the source code. Then, around September 2010, Nakamoto told Gavin that he was getting busy with other projects, and over the coming months he would hand over control of both the code repository on SourceForge and the project\u2019s \u201calert key,\u201d which allowed the broadcasting of urgent messages to all machines running the Bitcoin software. For an open-source project, these were the closest things to a leadership badge; at that point Gavin effectively became the project\u2019s head developer, guiding a team of five other volunteer coders.\n\nOver the next few months, Nakamoto continued to chime in occasionally on technical questions, but Gavin\u2019s openness chafed against his reclusive tendencies. After PayPal and Visa froze WikiLeaks\u2019s accounts, a faction of Bitcoiners argued that the cryptocurrency could be helpful to the controversial organization. \u201cBring it on,\u201d someone wrote on a forum called BitcoinTalk. Nakamoto bristled. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2018bring it on.\u2019 The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin \u2026 The heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.\u201d\n\nFor journalists covering Bitcoin, Gavin had become the natural person to call first. His mild, reasonable manner and willingness to use his real name made him the Bitcoin ambassador Nakamoto had never been. But Nakamoto seemed to grow uncomfortable with Gavin\u2019s interactions with media. In late April of 2011, Nakamoto emailed Gavin: \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle.\u201d\n\nThis turned out to be the last time Gavin heard from Nakamoto. When I first spoke with Gavin that July, he said he hadn\u2019t communicated with Nakamoto \u201cin a couple months.\u201d After Gavin told Nakamoto in an email on April 26 that he\u2019d agreed to give a talk on Bitcoin to the crypto-curious CIA at its headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Nakamoto never responded. Around the same date, Nakamoto wrote emails to at least one other programmer who\u2019d worked on the project.\n\nThen he went silent. He\u2019s never been heard from again, with the possible exception of a single forum post years later that may or may not have been Nakamoto\u2019s.\n\nGavin and the other early Bitcoin developers agreed on a few things about Satoshi\u2019s identity. The second place Nakamoto had announced his white paper was the website of the P2P Foundation, an idealistic nonprofit dedicated to peer-to-peer networks of all kinds. In his profile on the site, Nakamoto gave his residence as Japan. But no one believed he was Japanese. His English was flawless. He sounded British. In both the Bitcoin source code and his posts to the BitcoinTalk forum, Nakamoto favored Anglo spellings like colour and optimise.\n\nNakamoto guarded his identity closely. When registering the domain bitcoin.org, he had done so through a masking service called anonymousspeech.com, which itself had been registered from a temporary-housing broker in Tokyo. That service gave him an email address at vistomail.com, which offered the option of manipulating the date and time an email was sent. A third email address Nakamoto used was from gmx.com, another free webmail provider. In communication, Nakamoto expressed himself with a practiced opacity. He\u2019d answer technical questions but would ignore attempts to draw him out on personal matters.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s programming style was a bit dated, suggesting he might be on the older side. He used something called Hungarian notation, a convention of variable naming popular among Windows programmers in the 1990s.\n\nGavin had the impression that the Bitcoin code had been written by a small group or even just one person. When programmers collaborate, they tend to insert regular comments in their code, telling one another what this or that block of instructions is supposed to accomplish. The Bitcoin software contained few of these. Others felt that Bitcoin worked too smoothly from the moment it launched to be the product of a single brain. And the white paper used \u201cwe,\u201d which suggested Satoshi Nakamoto must be the catch-all for a group of people or an institution.\n\nEven before Nakamoto evaporated, he was coming to be revered. On April 16, 2011, a BitcoinTalker named Wobber pointed out how varied Nakamoto\u2019s expertise was, and how unusual his behavior \u2014 to come up with something so innovative, not take credit for it or exploit his stature, and leave without telling anyone. Someone likened Nakamoto to Zorro or a masked David who\u2019d aimed his slingshot at the Goliath of banks and governments.\n\nMight the name itself contain a clue? Satoshi Nakamoto, roughly translated from Japanese, could mean \u201ccentral intelligence.\u201d Perhaps this pointed to the role of spies in Bitcoin\u2019s creation. Maybe the National Security Agency was playing a long game, launching an off-the-books financial network it could use either to pay assets in the field, anywhere in the world, or as a honeypot where adversaries would transact with a false sense of security while the spooks at Fort Meade monitored their every move.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a totally crazy idea. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory had birthed the Onion Router, the anonymizing software known as TOR that enabled the dark web. The FBI would later secretly create its own line of encrypted phones and a messaging service, ANOM, that were unwittingly adopted by organized criminals, resulting in more than 800 arrests. And in the summer of 1996, researchers in the Cryptology Division of the NSA\u2019s Office of Information Security Research and Technology had internally published a paper, later made public, titled \u201cHow to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.\u201d\n\nYou could also read Nakamoto\u2019s name as a portmanteau of big tech-company names \u2014 SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi, MOTOrola \u2014 so maybe a corporate cabal was behind it. Redditors pooled their deciphering skills, also finding Satoshi Nakamoto to be an anagram of, among other phrases, \u201cMa, I took NSA\u2019s oath\u201d and \u201cSo a man took a shit.\u201d\n\nDan Kaminsky, who\u2019d shot to prominence as a young programmer in 2008 when he discovered a technical glitch that could have undermined the entire internet, thought Nakamoto might be a group at a bank. \u201cI suspect Satoshi is a small team at a financial institution,\u201d Dan told me. \u201cI just get that feeling.\u201d\n\nBut Kaminsky added that he didn\u2019t think that Satoshi\u2019s identity \u201cis that critical to what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is larger than Satoshi.\u201d This jibed with a sentiment I\u2019d heard voiced more than once: The whole idea of Nakamoto as an unknown pseudonymous entity who\u2019d dematerialized was an integral part of Bitcoin\u2019s design.\n\n\u201cWe Do Not Know Who Satoshi Is\u201d\n\nAt the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, Satoshi Nakamoto was, in absentia, everywhere. The Nakamoto Stage, where the keynotes and most important panels took place, was flanked by illuminated screens featuring a rotating display of snippets from his writings. They had the Dianetics-like quality of being banal to outsiders and profound to insiders.\n\nImagine if gold turned to lead when stolen.\n\nI\u2019m sure that in twenty years there will either be very large Bitcoin transaction volume \u2026 or no volume.\n\nThe network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.\n\nPeter Thiel, the PayPal founder turned venture capitalist, emerged stage right and threw a wad of hundred-dollar bills into the front rows: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy that this stuff still works, you know?\u201d Bitcoin was a warning, he said, that the fiat system was over.\n\nWhat stood in the way of the crypto revolution, Thiel said, were \u201cthe enemies of this movement,\u201d among whom he enumerated Warren Buffett, JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Thiel told the crowd that the enemies he\u2019d named were \u201cextensions of the state.\u201d Bitcoin, by contrast, wasn\u2019t a company and had no board. \u201cWe do not know who Satoshi is,\u201d Thiel added for emphasis.\n\nWe do not know who Satoshi is. Back in 2011, he\u2019d been the no-name coder of an experimental money that was of interest mainly to a fringe community. Ten years later, he was the mythic founder of a project with a $1 trillion market capitalization, making it the ninth-most-valuable asset in the world, just below Tesla and above Meta. Whoever Nakamoto was, he was fantastically rich. Through some clever analysis of the early blockchain, a computer scientist named Sergio Demian Lerner had estimated that, at the time, Nakamoto held some $40 billion worth of bitcoin (today the figure is much higher). Nakamoto was by far the largest holder of the currency.\n\nWhen the crypto exchange Coinbase went public in the spring of 2021, one of the risk factors listed in the prospectus the company filed with the SEC was the public identification of Nakamoto. It wasn\u2019t hard to think of scenarios where who Nakamoto was \u2014 and what his motives and intentions were \u2014 might be relevant. In the Bitcoin realm, the Nakamoto mystery was coming to be seen as necessary \u2014 a feature rather than a bug. To be truly decentralized required that Bitcoin have a virgin birth. Depriving it of a human figurehead, a flawed individual with a particular identity that might be palatable to one group but not to another, gave it the best shot at being taken up en masse.\n\nAnd so the Nakamoto alias had come to be hallowed. While some people conjectured that the Bitcoin creator had gone to ground mainly for his own protection, lest he be prosecuted for tax evasion or physically attacked for his coin stash, the common view was that he\u2019d acted selflessly. The most zealous Bitcoiners treated inquiries into Nakamoto\u2019s identity as a sort of blasphemy, as if they were Scientologists being asked about Xenu.\n\nBut What If Bitcoin\u2019s Founder Is a Toxic Villain?\n\nIn the summer of 2022, I tacked a spreadsheet of the hundred-plus candidates who\u2019d ever been proposed as Satoshi Nakamoto onto my office wall. Most of the leading candidates were cypherpunks whose names had been floated as possible Satoshis many times over the years. There were more obscure names from adjacent fields like math, cryptography, and economics. Some were programmers involved early on with the Bitcoin software project. Others were creators of newer cryptocurrencies. Many were just Famous Smart People: Bill Gates. Steve Jobs. Musk.\n\nFor a number of years, the consensus leading candidates have generally been considered to be Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney. Szabo, a programmer who had advocated for decentralized money years before Bitcoin appeared, had conceived a kind of Bitcoin precursor called \u201cBit Gold\u201d in the late nineties. He had the necessary technical skills, and there were superficial similarities between his writing style and Nakamoto\u2019s. But he has always denied being Satoshi, and no definitive evidence linking him to Nakamoto or to Bitcoin\u2019s early development has ever been produced. Adam Back\u2019s name was mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper as the creator of another cryptocurrency precursor, Hashcash, and his email address is one of the first to have been contacted by Nakamoto. He, too, denies being Nakamoto, and his writing style matches up less closely than Szabo\u2019s. Hal Finney, a legendary programmer and cryptographer, received the first-ever Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto. But Finney, who also denied being Satoshi, was diagnosed with ALS in 2009, declining rapidly to the point where he was physically incapacitated. If ever Satoshi were to be unmasked, Finney is the most hoped-for candidate among Bitcoiners because of his tragic-heroic story and his general aura of kindly benevolence \u2014 and also because, being conveniently deceased (he died in 2014), he can\u2019t create unsavory press with unsavory behavior or associations.\n\nThere had always been the faction hostile to inquiry about Nakamoto\u2019s identity. Last fall, when an HBO documentary posited that a libertarian Canadian computer programmer and crypto enthusiast named Peter Todd was the most likely candidate, the Bitcoin community reacted not just with strong skepticism about the documentary\u2019s conclusion but with anger that such a project had even been undertaken. He has made a valuable contribution, so his wishes for anonymity should be honored. What matters is not the person but the idea, the code.\n\nBut Nakamoto had plunked his gizmo in the public square, so I felt it was reasonable to inquire who\u2019d put it there and why.\n\nI combed through the 60,000 words Satoshi Nakamoto had left behind. He wrote in a plain style, rarely opining or showing personality. Whenever I found the slightest hint of individual style, I\u2019d add it to a list of Nakamoto-isms, which eventually included more than 200 words and phrases. Wet blanket. Sweet. Clobbering.\n\nI wrote a computer program, the Satoshitizer, which trawled through the archived writings of various suspects, scanning for Nakamoto-isms and generating tables of statistics. I could instantly rank an archive using more than a dozen criteria, including users of Nakamoto-isms, users of e-cash terminology, and discussers of software tools employed by Nakamoto.\n\nOne day in late April 2023, I found myself thinking about a word I\u2019d seen in Nakamoto\u2019s writings: hosed.\n\nGiven Nakamoto\u2019s tendency to write in a style stripped of personality or association with any particular milieu, hosed stood out. I hadn\u2019t recently heard the word, in its sense of screwed or wrecked, and vaguely associated it with turn-of-the-1990s surfing or fraternity lingo.\n\nI went back through my scraped archives and noted each time someone used the word. I looked at Metzdowd. In the three years leading up to October 31, 2008, when Nakamoto first announced Bitcoin there, the word had been used four times. Twice it was by the same person: James A. Donald.\n\nThough Donald hadn\u2019t played much of a role in the public discussion of Bitcoin, he\u2019d had a cameo in its early history as the first person on the discussion list to respond to Nakamoto. Donald\u2019s response had been a technical criticism related to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling potential, and after a few exchanges with Nakamoto he\u2019d dropped out of the conversation. He was just one of many cypherpunks who\u2019d been interested in digital money.\n\nAt that point, Donald was only No. 42 on my Suspects spreadsheet, far below the consensus leading candidates and on the list at all primarily because he was a cypherpunk and libertarian who had coded in C++. But intrigued by the \u201chosed\u201d coincidence, I went back and looked at the lists of rare words the Satoshitizer had compiled. I wanted to see whether Donald had used any other rare Nakamoto-isms.\n\nHe had. Donald showed up as the only person on any of the two decades\u2019 worth of lists I\u2019d scraped who had ever used the word fencible \u2014 in the sense of stolen goods \u201cable to be fenced.\u201d This was a word Nakamoto had used once, in the expression non-fencible. And it appeared in a post by Donald on the cypherpunks list in October of 1998. My brain started pinging. The verb fence was common enough slang, but the adjective fencible was an oddity. A Google search turned up hardly any instances on the internet. When I queried the archives of the daily New York Times, which went back to 1857 and included more than 13 million articles, fencible, in the sense I was interested in, hadn\u2019t appeared once.\n\nUnlike, say, trusted third party or zero-knowledge proofs, which are unexceptional in conversations among digital-cash or crypto experts, fencible and hosed weren\u2019t words unique to cryptography or even to computer science. They were more revealing of someone\u2019s voice.\n\nI began looking more closely at Donald. He had a slippery internet presence. Websites variously declared that he was Canadian, that he had died, and that \u201cJames A. Donald\u201d wasn\u2019t his real name. In his posts, he almost never revealed personal details, but a few were strewn here and there. He was Australian but had lived in Silicon Valley for many years. Like Nakamoto, he sometimes used American spellings and other times used Commonwealth spellings.\n\nIdeologically, Donald had fused a libertarianism so extreme that it was really anarcho-capitalism with a fervent conviction in the world-changing power of cryptography. \u201cSo guys, that is the plan,\u201d he wrote in 1996. \u201cWe destroy the state through higher mathematics. We do this by replacing the current institutional mechanisms of corporations with cryptographic mechanisms. This will give more people the opportunity to evade and resist taxes.\u201d\n\nHe had a particular interest in digital money. \u201cEventually people will bypass the banks, directly transferring funds to each other,\u201d he wrote in 1995. On Metzdowd, between 2006 and 2009, Donald employed more of the e-cash vocabulary Nakamoto used than any other poster.\n\nI examined Donald\u2019s programming style. In the late 1990s, he\u2019d promoted a piece of communications encryption software called Crypto Kong. He\u2019d written it in C++, the language Nakamoto used for Bitcoin. Using the Wayback Machine, I found an archived copy of the source code. Crypto Kong bore other similarities to Bitcoin. Like Nakamoto, Donald had coded the software for Windows and, more esoterically, used the Hungarian notation that Nakamoto did. Like Nakamoto, Donald used sweeping lines of slashes to separate sections of code. Like Bitcoin, Crypto Kong used elliptic curve cryptography to generate private-public key pairs.\n\nI gleaned more information about Donald. He was born in 1952, so was now over 70 \u2014 fitting the profile of an older programmer that various early Bitcoin developers had noted Nakamoto\u2019s coding style suggested. Donald wasn\u2019t on Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn, at least under his own name. His $2.8 million Palo Alto house was blurred on Google Street View, as was his $400,000 Austin house. This was an option you could exercise only by submitting a formal request to Google (or perhaps by working at Google, as one of Donald\u2019s two sons had). There were no easily found photographs of him. Like Nakamoto, Donald used a privacy-focused email provider, Switzerland-based Proton Mail. He had a blog titled Jim\u2019s Blog, untethered from his last name. He had spent, he\u2019d told the blog\u2019s readers, \u201ca lot of time off the grid.\u201d Click-click-click. The tumblers were falling into place.\n\nI now began to think about the significance of Donald\u2019s response to Nakamoto being the first. I pictured Nakamoto in 2008: He\u2019d just launched his work of genius into the world and \u2026 crickets. So he decided to both nudge things along (while also creating a useful misdirection) by lobbing a criticism at himself.\n\nJim\u2019s Blog revealed a few more clues. In the run-up to October 31, 2008, Donald had been focused on the financial crisis. His post on October 11, titled \u201cThe Cause of the Crisis,\u201d began: \u201cThe bailout will fail.\u201d This was notable because the London Times headline embedded in the Bitcoin Genesis block, the first block in the chain produced by Satoshi, had been \u201cChancellor on Brink of Second Bailout.\u201d\n\nI found further coincidences. Donald owned several pieces of property in Hawaii. On June 19, 2008, a few months before Satoshi Nakamoto began communicating with the world about his invention, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser had run an obituary for \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto,\u201d a veteran of World War II who\u2019d died at 84. Could Donald have lifted the name when casting about for a pseudonym?\n\nThough \u201cJim\u201d rarely mentioned any details that betrayed his identity or location, he revealed things about his beliefs in various posts. Before he was a libertarian or crypto-anarchist, he\u2019d been a radical leftist. At age 15, he\u2019d joined the Spartacists, a faction of Trotskyites, but \u201cI became disillusioned with the sparts, and disillusioned by participatory democracy\u2014and none too keen on representative democracy either.\u201d At 17, he joined two other radical groups, the anarcho-socialists and the Maoists, \u201cmostly because these were the two groups most hated by the trots.\u201d Eventually he concluded that freedom lay in property rights, and he became an anarcho-capitalist.\n\nI spoke with people who\u2019d known him when he was a graduate student in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney. Bob Hewitt, who was on the department faculty, interviewed Donald as part of the application process. Donald had come from Melbourne, and Bob recalled him as \u201cbohemian\u201d; asked whether he\u2019d arranged for a place to stay in Sydney, Donald said he\u2019d sleep under a bridge. He was \u201ca friendly kind of guy,\u201d Hewitt said, \u201cjust strange.\u201d\n\nDonald never completed the Ph.D. program. Every student was supposed to give a colloquium, but \u201cno one understood what he was saying,\u201d Hewitt recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t say he was brilliant, but he was certainly incomprehensible when he tried to explain his paper.\u201d Donald ended up dropping out after his dissertation, \u201cAssumptions of the Singularity Theorems and the Rejuvenation of Universes,\u201d was rejected.\n\nHe started writing software for Apple computers, then moved to the U.S. and programmed video games for Epyx. Later, he worked at database companies.\n\nPoring over Jim\u2019s Blog, I saw that Donald had an authoritative understanding of Bitcoin and its vulnerabilities; he clearly took a long, historical view of it as a stepping stone toward a particular future he wanted. Bitcoin, he wrote, \u201cis a prototype that is prematurely being used as the final system.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d never shared the presumption, prevalent in the Bitcoin world, that Nakamoto must be a benign figure. I\u2019d always felt that the Bitcoiners who elevated Nakamoto to semi-divine status were indulging in wishful projection: that he was selfless. That he was humble. That he had come from the future to exalt humanity. Hal Finney had made for a particularly appealing Satoshi Nakamoto because he lived up to that image.\n\nDonald did not. On his blog, Donald espoused a dark ideology called neoreaction that had beguiled certain people in Silicon Valley. Neoreactionaries believed that society had been hijacked by what they called the Cathedral \u2014 academic and media and bureaucratic elites. They disdained efforts to achieve social justice. The best way forward, they argued, was to jettison democracy and restore a monarchy. Donald\u2019s particular flavor of neoreaction also incorporated an overtly Christian element and a generous dose of paranoia; he attributed the COVID pandemic to a Jesuit conspiracy.\n\nAlong with his baroque politics, Donald produced a regular feed of racist, homophobic, and misogynist opinions and offensive language. He was so abrasive that, in 2014, even Slate Star Codex, an influential Silicon Valley blog with a history of tolerating discussion of taboo subjects like IQ science, had banned him. But on his blog, hosted on a relatively uncensorable domain in Laos, he advocated \u201cwhipping a woman on the buttocks or upper back\u201d to keep her in line and argued that \u201cvery few rape accusations are true.\u201d Donald had a substantial following in the red-pilled, alt-right blogosphere.\n\nIf Donald was Nakamoto, wasn\u2019t it obvious why he\u2019d chosen a pseudonym when launching Bitcoin? He wanted his work of genius to be taken on its own terms rather than dismissed because it was his. He had hidden not because Bitcoin could be a risk to him but because he could be a risk to Bitcoin.\n\nI wondered whether there were crypto people who knew or suspected that Donald was Nakamoto. If Nakamoto were a harmless private citizen like Dorian Nakamoto, \u201cSatoshi deserves his privacy\u201d would be at least a reasonable position to take. If Nakamoto were a dissident living under an autocratic regime, I\u2019d want to protect his secret too. But if Nakamoto were Donald? It would undermine the narrative of Bitcoin\u2019s inventor as a crypto Christ who\u2019d passed up fame and treasure for the sake of a higher good. Was it possible that some of the Satoshi-deserves-his-privacy people, recognizing that it would be a PR calamity for Bitcoin to have been invented by a far-right whackjob, were really just safeguarding the reputation of their religion and the value of their investments? In June 2020, the HashCash founder Adam Back, himself long suspected by some of being Satoshi, had tweeted: \u201cMaybe we should get mentally prepared to disown Satoshi. Nuke the nym from orbit, just to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatoshi\u2019s identity doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Ray Dillinger, who along with Hal Finney had done code review for Nakamoto before Bitcoin\u2019s launch, wrote. \u201cThe protocol is what it is. If it\u2019s a third-world dictator, a homeless guy living under a bridge in Belize, a Bedouin working from a cell phone as she traverses Bir Tawil on a camel, or a pushcart vendor in Nairobi, the protocol is exactly the same as it would be if it were a cryptanalyst working for the NSA or someone at a \u2018troll farm\u2019 drawing a salary from the GRU, or a well-known Security researcher or Cypherpunk. \u2018Satoshi\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist outside that protocol. Satoshi is just a hat somebody wore while they were developing it. And it doesn\u2019t matter who was wearing the hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Know Who Nakamoto Was\u201d\n\nI wrote to Jim Donald asking for an interview. Several days later, to my surprise, I heard back from him. \u201cEmail discussion would be convenient,\u201d Donald wrote, but he might be able to talk over phone or video. He\u2019d have to let me know in a few days.\n\nTwo months later, Donald still hadn\u2019t made himself available for a live conversation. Should I travel all the way to Australia to find him in person? One thing that gave me pause about Donald as Nakamoto was that Nakamoto, in his communications, displayed a recognizable range of emotion. He could be appreciative (\u201cMany thanks\u201d), compassionate (\u201cpoor thing\u201d), humble (\u201cmy apologies\u201d), and modest (\u201cI\u2019m better with code than with words\u201d). I scrolled through years of Jim\u2019s writings, squinting for a trace of empathy or gratitude or enthusiasm, hoping to see an exclamation point, or an apology, or a moment of sympathy or fellowship. Instead, I saw only flatness.\n\nBut of all the cypherpunks preoccupied with digital cash, only one had ever said they knew Satoshi\u2019s identity. \u201cI know who Nakamoto was,\u201d James Donald had written in a comment on a comment on a post on Jim\u2019s Blog, \u201cand what his political and social goals were.\u201d If true, this would make him the only person on record who credibly possessed this knowledge. I decided I needed to see him.\n\nThough Donald had spent most of his career in California, he clearly owned or had owned a house in Australia. Looking through real-estate assessment records for his various U.S. properties, I\u2019d found that for a couple of years in the aughts, a house he owned in Austin was registered to him at a street address on the northeastern coast of Australia. In more recent assessments, the U.S. properties were registered to him in the same Australian town, though now only a PO box was given. I knew his wife had died in 2016, and using the Find a Grave site, I found a photograph from the Australian town\u2019s cemetery of a plaque memorializing her. Five years later, he\u2019d posted a small photo on his blog of what appeared to be the view from his deck: In the foreground was a small glass and a jug of what he described as homemade moonshine. In the distance was a gleaming blue sea, the horizon disrupted by a couple of small islands. I compared this view with other ocean-view images taken from the same town, and they seemed to match.\n\nI found a private investigator, Daniel Quinn, who lived within a reasonable drive of the seaside town where I suspected Donald was. I sent Quinn the house address and a 20-year-old photo of Donald I\u2019d found on an abandoned college blog of one of his sons.\n\nA few days later, Daniel sent me a surveillance report. \u201cThe yard is in a very unkempt state with very long grass and overgrown shrubbery and trees, he\u2019s definitely not a plant lover.\u201d He attached a photo of James\u2019s house and the patchy driveway it shared with two other homes. There was a lonely palm tree near the curb, and up the hill was a bungalow on stilts, set amid the overgrowth, with a deck looking out at the Coral Sea.\n\nDaniel didn\u2019t see James that day, but several weeks later, I awoke to a message: Daniel had managed to get a photo of a man standing in the house\u2019s doorway. He was a clear 20-years-older match to the man in the photo I\u2019d sent. Same dense beard, though now it was white. Similar large metal-rim glasses. Same fleshy nose. Three days later, I was on a plane to Australia.\n\n\u2018I Have a Tendency to Talk Too Much\u2019\n\nThere was a screen door and no doorbell, so I knocked on James\u2019s doorframe. My mouth was dry from nerves. While I wasn\u2019t convinced that James himself was necessarily Nakamoto, I thought he might have been part of Nakamoto. In any case, he was the sole remaining person I knew of who claimed to know who Nakamoto was.\n\nI worried about how he\u2019d receive me. James had gone out of his way to be unfindable.\n\nCrossing his porch toward the front door, I could see Donald sitting at a computer in the living room and wearing headphones. His latest blog post, put up just a few hours earlier, was a rambling screed about how Georgians (as in the country of Georgia) don\u2019t want \u201ctheir Churches destroyed or turned into shrines of Gaia and gay sex, their old and beautiful buildings bulldozed and replaced by demonic postmodern eyesores.\u201d\n\nWestern NGOs were working to see \u201cGeorgia faggotized and thrown into the meat grinder against Russia.\u201d\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t respond to my knock on the doorframe, I knocked directly on the front door. A moment later James opened it and stepped outside in black long johns and a red camouflage long-sleeved shirt.\n\nI started talking. I\u2019d sent him an email and \u2014\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m rather sporadic at reading my emails,\u201d James said. I reminded him of our exchange the prior year and of the book I was writing.\n\n\u201cAh, right,\u201d James said.\n\nI said something about how I\u2019d have been remiss if I didn\u2019t make every effort to speak with him.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d James said. \u201cWell, the short of it is that I can\u2019t even tell you what I don\u2019t tell you.\u201d His tone was pleasant, bemused.\n\nI pointed out that he\u2019d publicly insisted he knew who Nakamoto was and what his social and political goals were. Could he elaborate?\n\n\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay \u2026 Do you really know? Or do you sort of think you have a strong idea of who it might be?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a very good idea of who it might be, but I don\u2019t actually, uh, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it was Hal Finney?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that just because you\u2019re respecting his privacy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to tell anyone anything, and I\u2019m not allowed to tell people what I\u2019ve already told \u2019em.\u201d\n\nCould I buy him a beer while I was in town?\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d James said. \u201cIn wine there is truth. And I\u2019m obligated not to tell people the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cLunch?\u201d I offered.\n\nJames laughed. \u201cLook,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a tendency to talk too much, and I have a big tendency to talk too much after a few drinks, so I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nI tried to keep the conversation going \u2014 giving him my contact information along with a previous book I\u2019d written \u2014 but his answers became monosyllabic.\n\n\u201cWell, I can understand why you\u2019d live here,\u201d I said, gesturing at his stunning view.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James said, looking down.\n\nI thanked him and made my way back down the hill.\n\nThere Is No Paternity Test for Bitcoin\n\nI\u2019d spent 15 years trying to identify Satoshi. In pursuit of this quest, I\u2019d learned to code, recruited a machine-learning expert and a stylometry specialist and a private investigator, and made a 37-hour journey for a three-minute encounter. I was pretty sure no one had spent as much time as I had in trying to solve this. I was starting to feel a kinship with Sahil Gupta, who couldn\u2019t be persuaded that Nakamoto was anyone other than Elon Musk. At some point, I needed to stop.\n\nPerhaps someday AI will allow us to definitively identify Satoshi. But I am now convinced that, barring some unpredictable declassification of a government secret, we will likely never know beyond a reasonable doubt who he was. Memories fade. People die. There is no paternity test for Bitcoin, no way to prove who Nakamoto is unless he comes forward and demonstrates that he has the relevant private keys, or at least non-forged contemporaneous documents supporting his story. As years pass, the trail, if there was one, grows fainter.\n\nI felt some relief in accepting this. I remained dazzled by the achievement of Nakamoto\u2019s invention \u2014 but almost equally by the perfection of his vanishing. As a utopian project, Bitcoin had never stood a chance. But as a new asset class, it has proved resilient. Its price continues to rise and fall, and rise again, reaching a new all-time high above $109,000 in January. (As of this writing, it\u2019s at $85,000.) Fidelity now advises retail clients to allocate a small portion of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrency. The spread of blockchain technology feels inevitable.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was something that whoever was behind the pseudonym could never be \u2014 an idea that, without a body or a history to drag it down, would live forever.\n\nExcerpted from The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-Year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius Behind Crypto by Benjamin Wallace (Crown), out March 18."

American officials have said Ukraine will likely need to cede territory for the war to end, and Putin has made it a condition of entering into a ceasefire.\n\nConceding territory has long been a nonstarter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and some European leaders have voiced concern about appearing to reward Putin for launching his invasion.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nNegotiators working to end the Russia-Ukraine war have already discussed \u201cdividing up certain assets,\u201d US President Donald Trump said Sunday as he announced he planned to speak to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come after he announced last week that Ukraine had accepted a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire, putting the ball in Russia\u2019s court as to whether it would accept his proposal to swiftly end the war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing pretty well, I think, with Russia. We\u2019ll see if we have something to announce maybe by Tuesday, I\u2019ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday,\u201d he told reporters on board Air Force One during a flight back to the White House after his weekend at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\u201cA lot of work\u2019s been done over the weekend, we want to see if we can bring that war to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we can, maybe we can\u2019t, but I think we have a very good chance.\u201d\n\nTrump said negotiators had already pinpointed certain topics up for discussion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about land. A lot of land is a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We\u2019ll be talking about land, we\u2019ll be talking about power plants, that\u2019s a big question,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much, by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We\u2019re already talking about that \u2013 dividing up certain assets.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin spokesperson confirmed that the two leaders would speak Tuesday but did not disclose any further details.\n\nPutin\u2019s response so far to the Trump-backed ceasefire proposal has been ambiguous. He said that Moscow agreed with the proposal in theory. But he also set out tough conditions and demanded concessions from Kyiv, and repeated his claim that the current Ukrainian government was part of the \u201croot cause\u201d of the war.\n\nMeetings between American negotiators with representatives from Ukraine and Russia will continue this week. The Kremlin also said last week that US negotiators would travel to Russia for further talks, though it did not share details on the participants.\n\nRussia first started seizing parts of Ukraine in 2014 before launching its full invasion in 2022, triggering the largest land conflict in Europe since World War Two. Since the 2022 invasion, Ukraine has lost control of about 11% of its land, according to CNN analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor.\n\nLand concessions are among the most sensitive issues left to hammer out. American officials have said Ukraine will likely need to cede territory for the war to end, and Putin has made it a condition of entering into a ceasefire.\n\nBut conceding territory has long been a nonstarter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and some European leaders have voiced concern about appearing to reward Putin for launching his invasion. Russia has also made clear it has no desire to give up the swathes of Ukrainian territory it has occupied.\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to grant Moscow concessions even before talks began and his embrace of Putin have also rattled NATO allies in Europe who are now openly questioning whether decades of US security guarantees towards the continent can be relied upon.\n\nTrump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN on Sunday that the ongoing talks over Ukraine were productive, but didn\u2019t say how the matter of territorial concessions would be resolved.\n\nPutin \u201caccepts the philosophy of President Trump\u201d in wanting to see the war come to an end, Witkoff said. He described his meeting last week with Putin as a \u201csolution-based discussion,\u201d and voiced confidence that a pause in fighting could arrive within weeks.\n\nPutin also said Friday that his country is working at restoring relations with the US, after they were \u201cpractically reduced to zero, destroyed by the previous American administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, the situation is starting to move,\u201d he said, referring to relations with the Trump administration. \u201cLet\u2019s see what comes out of this.\u201d"
