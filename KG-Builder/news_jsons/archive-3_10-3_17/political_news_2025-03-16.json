            "full_content": "The United States Marine Band was founded in 1798. Thomas Jefferson gave it its nickname, \"The President's Own.\" Today, 135 Marines still perform the score of the White House from parties to inaugurations. So, there was excitement, last year, when the Marines judged a contest for teenage musicians. The winners would perform with the band. Thirty students were chosen. The concert was scheduled. But, last month, it was canceled. President Trump had issued his executive order against diversity programs, and the young musicians were Black, Hispanic, Indian and Asian. Because they were silenced, many wanted to hear them including veterans of military bands who gathered in an improvised orchestra of equity that you might call America's own.\n\nThis past Sunday, at the music center at Strathmore, near Washington, 22 students who had lost their chance to play tuned up with the military band veterans for the concert that was not meant to be heard.\n\nThis music had been planned for the canceled concert. \"Nobles of the Mystic Shrine\" by John Philip Sousa. Sousa directed the Marine Band a century and a half ago and composed \"Stars and Stripes Forever,\" the great classic in the songbook of patriots.\n\nRishab Jain: We're a land that prides itself on being the land of the free, the home of the brave. And I believe that just as much as anyone else does. But for that, we need these different perspectives. We need to see how others think.\n\n18-year-old Rishab Jain was among the students barred from playing with the Marines. He was born in America to Indian parents\u2014a high school senior accepted at Harvard.\n\nRishab Jain: If we're a society that's suppressing art, we're a society that is afraid of what it might reveal about itself. If we're suppressing music, we're suppressing emotions, we're suppressing expression, we're suppressing vulnerability, we're suppressing the very essence of what makes us human. We are devaluing our own humanity. We are degrading our own humanity.\n\n60 Minutes\n\nScott Pelley: You don't seem to believe in limitations.\n\nRishab Jain: Absolutely not.\n\nThere were no limitations but talent, last year, when Rishab Jain and about 60 others, nationwide, posted auditions for the Marines to judge. Zakyya McClenny uploaded her clarinet from Pennsylvania.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you think you were gonna be chosen?\n\nZakyya McClenny: Yes!\n\nScott Pelley: You have a lot of confidence.\n\nZakyya McClenny: I do.\n\nScott Pelley: Why did you think you were gonna be chosen?\n\nZakyya McClenny: I live my life with a lot of confidence.\n\nShe was right. Zakyya was chosen. She and all the contestants had been organized by a Chicago-based nonprofit called Equity Arc, which connects student musicians of color with mentors and opportunities. And here's why \u2014 American orchestras today are 80% White, 11% Asian, 5% Hispanic and 2% Black. No wonder that in 2022, Equity Arc's executive director got an unexpected call.\n\nScott Pelley: The Marines called you?\n\nStanford Thompson: Yes.\n\nThey called Stanford Thompson to ask how the band could reach out to musicians of color. It's part of the band's mission to educate youth.\n\nStanford Thompson: So in that phone call with the Marine Band I shared with them a lot of ideas, a lot that we have learned as an organization. And when I got off the phone, it was just-- it was crazy. It was, like, \"Wait. Let me call this guy back, because I should be offering a way or some ideas that Equity Arc and the Marine Band could work together.\" We identified this high school age, this pre-college age where a lot of musicians of color drop off. We came up with the idea of, \"Can we bring a select group that we would audition through a competitive process to Washington to be able to spend a couple of days with the band?\"\n\nStanford Thompson 60 Minutes\n\nThe 'couple of days' were supposed to look like this. Top music students, like Zakaya McClenny, learning from the best.\n\nTheir wind symphony was set for this May 4th. Until President Trump's executive order banning programs for diversity.\n\nPresident Trump: We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer!\n\nThe president says he is building a \"color blind, merit based\" society --a reaction to what many saw as progressive politics gone too far. His order was comprehensive, calling diversity programs \"illegal and immoral discrimination\" and an \"immense public waste.\"\n\nBut that executive order is just the beginning. All across the government, President Trump is rolling back 60 years of discrimination protections for women, older Americans, the disabled and people of color.\n\nTrump rescinded President Johnson's 1965 ban on employment bias. He closed the Social Security Office of Civil Rights and fired leaders of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, which investigates bias in the workplace.\n\nCari Dominguez: I think we're at a pivotal moment in our society. And we have to make a decision as to which way do we want to go.\n\nCari Dominguez chaired the EEOC for George W. Bush. Her family fled Cuba when she was 12.\n\nScott Pelley: The argument behind the executive order is that America has eliminated racism, that no one in this country is held back by race any longer.\n\nCari Dominguez: The data would not support that.\n\nThe data, Dominguez told us, shows that the EEOC handles around 100,000 discrimination claims from Americans each year.\n\nScott Pelley: The executive order calls the kinds of programs that you used to enforce quote, \"immoral.\"\n\nCari Dominguez: I believe what is immoral is to deny people opportunities. I have witnessed individuals who have beautiful resumes. And they get an interview. They come in, you know, using a wheelchair, and all of a sudden the opportunity is gone. Denying people opportunities because of that lack of fairness is immor-- that's the immoral part.\n\nCari Dominguez 60 Minutes\n\nFairness aside, in this email the Marine Band's commanding officer wrote Equity Arc's Stan Thompson, \"as long as the executive order is in place, we will not be able to reschedule.\" \"I am really sorry to be the bearer of this news.\"\n\nStanford Thompson: My first thought was helplessness in a way and heartbreak.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you have the sense that the concert was canceled because of the color of your skin?\n\nRishab Jain: Absolutely. I mean, I couldn't think of another reason really. I had prepared. I had done everything I could to be at the top. And being Indian, I thought, yeah, what other reason would there be?\n\nAny questions were answered this past week. The students gathered in Washington for rehearsals and the performance. 60 Minutes did what we often do, covered costs of plane tickets and travel to bring all of our interviewees to one place. Equity Arc decided to book the rehearsal space and the concert hall and try to replace the absent marine band\u2014which turned out to be easy.\n\nJohn Abbracciamento: I just felt like, well, there's usually two responses to something. You can complain about it, or you could do something about it. I chose the latter within seconds. And it was the easiest decision ever.\n\nEasy for, John Abbracciamento and Jennifer Marotta, retired Marine Band trumpeters.\n\nScott Pelley: Marines follow orders. They don't have to like them. What do you think the members of the band think of all of this?\n\nJohn Abbracciamento: I know them like the back of my hand. So, I don't think it's too much for me to go out on a limb to say how disappointed they were.\n\nWith the active-duty Marines ordered to stand down, Equity Arc reached out to retirees who answered the call from everywhere, former band members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Westpoint, the Naval Academy and the Marines. Jennifer Marotta flew, on her dime, from LA.\n\nJennifer Marotta: When I got that email, I looked at my schedule and I said, \"I can move all of those things.\" I booked a flight. It was literally one week ago, and I'm here.\n\nJohn Abbracciamento: I challenge anyone, literally, anyone to come to me and say by having this concert does damage to the United States. It doesn't. It brings out the best of us.\n\nJohn Abbracciamento 60 Minutes\n\nScott Pelley: You were not meant to be here today. This ensemble was not meant to be heard. And I wonder what this moment on this stage means to your heart.\n\nSean Mouzon: My name is Sean Mouzon, I'm here from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm a junior at Southwest DeKalb High School. One thing that units us all, is this, music. I'm here because I love it. No other reason than all these amazing, talented people. And I don't want this to be taken away from anybody because of someone else's personal opinion or just anything else besides why we like to do this.\n\nVanessa Cabrera: My name is Vanessa Cabrera, I'm from Rockaway, New Jersey. We work hard to be here. We belong here. We have the talent to be here, and this is not just for us but for children and just people in the same situation that we are, that nobody can tell you what to do, if you put your mind to something that you can accomplish that.\n\nRicardo Lazaro: My name is Ricardo Lazaro. I'm from San Antonio, Texas. I just want the world to be a better place. But it seems like we're slowly straying away from that. And we gotta make a change. And I believe everyone here is capable of doing that. But are we gonna do it?\n\nJulie Angelis Boehler: My name is Julie Angelis Boehler. I retired after 23 years as the timpanist of the U.S. Army Band, Pershing's Own. We need all of this, not just musically. Athletically, academically, we need diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thank you very much.\n\nThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds. Here, tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions. At the podium, Rodney Dorsey of Florida State University conducting \"Gallop\" by Dimitri Shostakovich\u2014in the hands of a band that looks like America.\n\nProduced by Nicole Young and Kristin Steve. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim. Edited by Warren Lustig.\n\nEditor's note: Last month Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, announced it was modifying some of its own DEI policies. The company said the changes were intended to comply with the shift in federal guidelines under the new presidential administration."

Russia's Vladimir Putin responds to a U.S. cease-fire proposal in Ukraine. Plus, the U.S. launches military strikes throughout Yemen.\n\nAmerican bombs rained down on dozens of Iran-backed Houthi militant targets in Yemen Saturday in an attack ordered by President Trump. How long will this campaign last and what kind of a response should we expect from Tehran? Secretary of State Marco Rubio will join us exclusively.\n\nPlus:\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I'm getting, from the standpoint about a cease-fire and ultimately a deal, some pretty good vibes coming out of Russia.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff is back from Russia and his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Is there a chance for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine? We will ask him.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham will also join us.\n\nAnd, finally, Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore weighs in on the impact of cuts to the federal payroll, and Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell on the ripple effects of Trump's trade war with some of America's closest partners.\n\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nAs we come on the air, U.S. forces are in the midst of President Trump's most significant military campaign thus far in his second term.\n\nLet's get straight to it this morning with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida.\n\nMr. Secretary, for our audience, just to explain, this Red Sea area is a really important transit point for global shipping. The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last and will it involve ground forces?\n\nMARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane. And in the last year- and-a-half, last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States, attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times. And 145 times, they have attacked commercial shipping.\n\nSo we basically have a band of pirates with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot.\n\nAnd so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those strikes were retaliation strikes. So they launch one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one-off.\n\nThis is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping. And it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way. It's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here. And it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before. The Biden administration didn't do that.\n\nAll the Biden administration would do is, they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And it could\u2026\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, this will continue until that's finished.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I have heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now.\n\nI can tell you that, as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us. And I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing. And that will continue.\n\nLook, it's \u2013 bottom line, easy way to understand it, OK, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They have attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They have attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis, as you know.\n\nPut this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations.\n\nHave you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it, 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about.\n\nWhat we can't ignore and the reason why the president mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They have provided them intelligence. They have provided them guidance. They have provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, OK, the Houthis, would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran.\n\nAnd so this was a message to Iran. Don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships, in attacking global shipping.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to.\n\nBut I want to ask you about tariffs, because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back and forth the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini-trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs, on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them.\n\nSo here's the way everyone needs to understand this, OK? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War.\n\nBut now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low-wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us?\n\nSo what the president is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability. And the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States.\n\nThe second is global. And that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global \u2013 it's not against Canada. It's not against Mexico. It's not against the E.U. It's everybody.\n\nAnd then, from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness. But, right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements potentially with countries so that our trade is fair.\n\nWhat's not going to continue is \u2013 of course, these countries are upset.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral not free trade \u2013 not North American free trade deals?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, it's not leverage.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Renegotiation?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there we can work on deals and so forth because they will have products we don't make. We have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best.\n\nIt has to be free, but it has to be fair in that country. And, right now, it's only free on one side and it's not fair for the other side.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, sir\u2026\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's an unsustainable position.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pullbacks are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week.\n\nSo I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seemed to negotiate \u2013 you say this was national security-minded.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But then we also see comments by the president of like 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States. That seems more emotional.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that means \u2013 that's called retaliation. That's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on \u2013 they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine.\n\nThen we will have to find something to \u2013 I mean, you tell me. I mean, Canada's going after whiskey and orange juice. And, I mean\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference?\n\nThe point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them. They like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo. And then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides.\n\nBut what we have now cannot continue. We have deindustrialized this country, deindustrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a Rust Belt. That's why we have suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability to other places.\n\nThat cannot and will not continue.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know \u2013 President Trump. This is no mystery. He's been talking about this since the 1980s, actually, even before he was a political figure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia.\n\nYou said Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a cease-fire or whether Putin is using a delay tactic. You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think that was a promising meeting. As I have said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully, we will have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, The exchange was promising.\n\nI don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front with a lot of complexity to it. So, no one's claiming that it's easy.\n\nBut I want everyone to understand here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop, so that we can move to plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not \u2013 maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and that respects everybody's needs and so forth.\n\nNo one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end to a war as long as they're shooting at each other.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so the president wants a cease-fire, and that's what we're working on.\n\nAssuming we can get that done \u2013 and that won't be easy in and of itself \u2013 we move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue.\n\nThe president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We will talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff.\n\nI want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Board writes: \"The administration needs to be careful it's targeting real promoters of terrorism, not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\"\n\nCan you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism specifically to Hamas from this Columbia student? Or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, not just the student. We're going to do more. In fact, we \u2013 every day now, we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well.\n\nAnd here's why. It's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist or what have you. And, in it, you have to make certain assertions. And if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America.\n\nIt's that simple. So you lied. You came \u2013 if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straightforward.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But is there any \u2013 but is there any evidence of a link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Sure. Yes, they take over \u2013 I mean, do you not \u2013 I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges. Well, then you should know that this is\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking about the specific justification for the revocation of his visa. Was there any evidence of material support for terrorism?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson, was the negotiator on \u2013 negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime, in and of itself, that they're involved and being a negotiator, the spokesperson, this, that, the other.\n\nWe don't want \u2013 we don't need these people in our country. We never should have allowed him in, in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library \u2013 the buildings being vandalized, we never would have let him in.\n\nWe never would have let him in to begin with.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave. And so are others. And we're going to keep doing it.\n\nWe are\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: To\u2026\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And, by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas sympathizers\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. they had no problem, OK, pressuring social media to censor American political speech.\n\nSo I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this. If you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. And now that we know it, you're going to leave.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas revoked or are other points of view as well?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor \u2013 look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members.\n\nThey're terrorists too. I \u2013 we \u2013 the president designated them\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 asked me to designate, and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well.\n\nYou \u2013 we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people \u2013 we don't want people in our country that are going to be\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know what we have gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Secretary Rubio, I'd like to have you back, talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who joins us this morning from Miami Beach.\n\nWelcome back to Face the Nation, Ambassador.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a cease-fire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin.\n\nI wonder what your answer to the question is in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a cease-fire.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret.\n\nAnd I agree with the secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was \u2013 it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics. And I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration and where we are today.\n\nWe have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect Presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision-making call, or is this just next steps?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would assume that they have a \u2013 they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They have talked already after the first visit that I had with President Putin.\n\nAnd I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision-maker, our decision-maker, and President Putin for the country of Russia is their decision-maker.\n\nI think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's \u2013 that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a \u2013 an inclination on \u2013 on the part of both countries, and, by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long-term, durable peace here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's president publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting.\n\nWe saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 look, I don't \u2013 I don't know what President Macron said.\n\nI think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have necessarily firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said.\n\nI know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to \u2013 to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000-kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing \u2013 shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000-mile border.\n\nThat's a very, very complicated cease-fire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I \u2013 I regard as promising.\n\nI think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near-term peace agreement.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, beyond the cease-fire, a peace agreement? you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 what I \u2013 what I'm saying, the technical \u2013 what I'm saying is that a cease-fire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border. That's \u2013 that's 1,200 miles.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions.\n\nWe've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to \u2013 to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement.\n\nThere's \u2013 there's just \u2013 there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a cease-fire here. And I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined space as compared to the \u2013 the battle \u2013 where the battle is being fought in Ukraine-Russia.\n\nSo this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza.\n\nI want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the two million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt. You've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans and, by the way, for the people of Israel.\n\nSo we're exploring all of those things. But, right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab summit, where we spent 7.5 hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging.\n\nNow, to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen \u2013 that's a red line for the Israelis \u2013 and maybe could have led to a long-term peace resolution here.\n\nAnd yet Hamas \u2013 Hamas came up with their own construct\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: \u2026 essentially disavowed what we discussed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: And, to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: And I \u2013 I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.\n\nAmbassador Witkoff, thank you for your time today.\n\nWe'll be back with more Face the Nation.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss an interview or a full episode of Face the Nation, you can go back and watch it on FacetheNation.com or on YouTube. Just search Face the Nation for our page.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nations, so stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe turn now to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who joins us this morning from Clemson, South Carolina.\n\nWelcome back.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir. And I - I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these - in this past week. Certainly a lot of action.\n\nI looked at the last time we spoke. You were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said, there's a one in trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy. Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't mind negotiating, as long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So, I think there is a one in trillion chance the ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region.\n\nYes, I think he - I think he's a fanatical, religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him. And if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60 percent. He has enough to make six bombs at 60 percent. So, turn that all over to the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business and we'll help you with your nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long - that's a long to-do list. And so far no - no indication that he's taking the offer.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Not really. He's - if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.\n\nWe did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do - you heard the secretary of state.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Ambassador Witkoff.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know yet. But I do know you play President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So, if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two, ceasefire and peace deal.\n\nWhat I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine or not. If you're not, go back to maximum pressure.\n\nI have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy. And I'm willing to move forward if I have to. But we're talking about a ceasefire and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But, to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting but 30 years of action. And I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have -\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gets from the discussions that Witkoff had. Who, I like Steve, and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing.\n\nI think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the - to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large.\n\nI hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: To engage in a ceasefire and to find a win/win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the U.S. decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I don't know what value these - these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the voice of America really is, Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War. People told us that. So, that's something to consider, is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, you had been an advocate for soft power.\n\nI want to ask you about what's happening here at home.\n\nThere were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The president suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington and Burling as well because they were involved in representing former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you support this?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think all of these things - I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax - a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6th was politically motivated. And people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict - you know, when Biden took - took -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this lawful?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this good for the U.S. legal system, Senator, because\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president's trying to use government power to punish private business because he didn't like some of the work they had been doing.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, private business aided government power in a - in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life.\n\nYou know, on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family. That they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him politically and personally. I believe that. And if these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame. That's what I believe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But these are lawyers working on cases that - you're making it sound like the work they take on is somehow part of a conspiracy and they should be punished for it.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think - I think these law firms were pushing legal theories that, to me, were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes.\n\nYou know, I - we can have a debate about, you know, holding a lawyer accountable for his client's actions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I genuinely don't like that. But these - but these law firms -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's what this sounds like.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And Jack Smith using the power of government, incorporating these law firms, in my - in my view, were trying to disrupt and take down the Republican nominee for president. That this was an orchestrated effort and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So, it was politically motivated. And everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I know, since you're on the Judiciary Committee, and -\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And my answer is not going to change -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And have that oversight. It's important to get your point of view, but I've got to leave it there for today.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.\n\nGood to have you here and a happy early St. Patrick's Day.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Top of the morning to you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, I want to talk about the impact of these tariffs and potential tariffs because you're from the manufacturing hub of Michigan.\n\nWe were looking at the data. Michigan's lost more than 220,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. The vice president was out in Michigan this week. He says this is \u2013 this entire Trump strategy is about industrial resurgence. Is that landing where you live?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, I'm somebody that answers this differently than many. I believe that tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. And if you'll recall, I said Donald Trump would win in 2016, and nobody believed me. And I was right. And it was one issue. It was trade. NAFTA was one of the worst pieces of trade legislation in the history of this country. It sent tons of jobs overseas. And President Trump came in. I worked with him. We renegotiated it. We have the USMCA.\n\nThe way that the tariffs are being done now is - it's made a ping-pong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at. We need to using them against China. But I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying. There's no way that in a month's time, when they have such an integrated inventory and production plan - production plants where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen.\n\nSo, I want to work with this administration. I think the 25 percent tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. Autos are a ping-pong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We needed industrial policy. Tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a way that lets everybody plan for it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the big three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2nd push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion.\n\nDo you have any idea how long it would take to build the kind of plants and to bring all the manufacturing home, like President Trump is asking of them?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, if everything were go right, which, like in this world does anything ever go right, it's going to take two to three years. Our - our suppliers, also, there are many - and, by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Next -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You support this idea. Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral, not North America as a globe -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Totally. I totally - Canada would never let China build a plant in China and then market it as a North American vehicle. And we need to make sure that that never happens. I'm totally on board on that.\n\nBut right now, as we're talking about the aluminum and the steel tariffs, two - 60 percent of aluminum in this country - that's being used is be - coming in from Canada. You take a 25 percent tariff on that, the profit on automobiles is - is very small. It's not a big - the companies just can't eat that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But we've got to figure it out. I am not against trade policy. We just have to do it in a way that doesn't - I - I don't believe Donald Trump wants to destroy the domestic auto industry. I think we all got to work together to keep the domestic auto industry strong. And even as we're doing Canada and Mexico, do you realize that Korea and Japan are still able - they brought 2.5 million vehicles in to - Korea, with no tariff, and Japan with 2.5, not treating everybody equally.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: S&P global says there's potential for North American auto production to drop by 20,000 units a day starting this week. That's because of the tariffs. So, it's - it's having a -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: All companies need certainty. Automobiles need certainly. They need to not be a ping-pong ball.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking to the commerce secretary or the trade representative? Is there any conversation?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I have not talked to the commerce secretary. I've talked to Bob Lighthizer, who I worked very closely with in -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The former advisor.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: The former trade advisor. And I worked very closely with President Trump in - in - I totally -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I said he would win. Democrats did a lousy job on trade and that - MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of Democrats and their performance, I want to ask you, what happened this past week. We came near a shutdown. Ultimately, Democrats, in the Senate, did vote with Republicans on this short-term funding deal.\n\nSenator Murphy of Connecticut was on another network this morning, and he said, \"it would have been a risk to shut down the government, but it was probably worth taking.\"\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: You know -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Well, in the House, we were almost united, except one, and there were very strong feelings in the House about what people thought that the Senate should do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the Senate - the Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, would say, you were able to do that because there was wiggle room on votes. The Republicans voted as a bloc.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But I - I think he sent out mixed signals.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Schumer did?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I think - Senator Schumer sent out mixed signals. And I talked to a lot of laborers last week. AFGE, who's employees were going to be impacted the most, were very torn about what to do because concerned about their employees. Who I'm meeting with daily when I'm out there. Came out against supporting it because they felt like they were already being harmed. There was already just the license for DOGE to go ahead and do whatever it wants. They're not including Congress, not abiding with - people are being hurt.\n\nBut, Margaret, people are angry. We're got to move on. Reconciliation is coming up. We have got to be united as Democrats in making sure reconciliation and we protect people from having their health care cut, Medicaid cut, Social Security cut, or Medicare cut, in any way, shape, or form?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can Leader Jeffries actually maintain that kind of unity in the House?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: He showed you that he could do it last week. And I can tell you that when you - I don't think anybody has been home. If you're home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I'm not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mean people are shouting? People are angry? People are upset?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: They want to see Democrats fighting back. And they're really scared about what's going to happen to them. Particularly on - seniors and - I was in - went to my asthma doctor, and a woman in a wheelchair with her child started crying with me in the hospital, what are you going to do so my child can still come here?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, thank you. We'll have to leave it there for today.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, who joins us this morning from Annapolis.\n\nWelcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-MD): Thank you. Great to be back.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have, in your state, the Port of Baltimore. One of the country's largest ports. The president has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2nd is poised to enact 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these - of these - of these disastrous and frankly not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology. But this administration is using it like an ideology. And so, while these decisions are being made - made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore. It's also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impact on our farmers over in the eastern shore, on our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this - and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on cost. It's having very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses. It's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitive, as well as our national security. And so, these are the type of things, this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about and we are now seeing in real time in our states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1,300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally, and is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean then you look at the - at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's - it's either ineffective, it is performative, or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all of these executive actions are falling under.\n\nAnd the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the president of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally.\n\nAnd so, when we talk about the different tools that we have, just in the past week alone, you know, I signed - I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises because, on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department. And while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, D.C., out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a liberal state, and he said he's going to stop it.\n\nI know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Here - here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is - is - that they - that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives.\n\nAnd so - so the thing that we know about this is, this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place - and we've gone - we went through this process not just for these past couple years since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland - where Maryland won this - this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitively, where we showed that we could be at a place that it was the only site ready place to build, build ready site. So, the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the president has just decided to politicize it by talking about, but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you called him? Have you called the White House?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've tried calling the White House before and - and there - there's - there's no response. And - and, frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break. I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it? But you believe it?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Do I believe the announcement?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, I believe that the president thinks he has the authority to do this. But I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the president does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. And so, I believe the president of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there's a king of king and a lord of lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here. And you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do.\n\nYou also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but - but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering.\n\nYou know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continued resolution, where - where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people.\n\nAnd so I think, when one - when the American people, when they do not have an option or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then, yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. We are doing everything in our power to fight for the people. And I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who offered alternatives, they just weren't listened to. Do you think there's just no leader in the party?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I don't - I don't see a difference. I don't - I don't see a difference.\n\nAnd, frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interests, I think for the American people they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing. The performative politics, people are done, and they're exhausted by it. They just want to see results. And that's exactly what we're trying to provide in the state of Maryland.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week.\n\nFor FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)"

He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.\n\nRubio said after the arrest that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\n\nOn Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"\n\n\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"\n\nThe secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"\n\n\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" March 16, 2025. CBS News\n\nNeither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nA top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nRubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"\n\nMore broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.\n\nAsked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"\n\n\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\""

That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\n\nPresident Trump announced the strikes Saturday, saying the U.S. would use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis cease shipping attacks. U.S. Central Command confirmed the strike in a social media post Saturday, and it's prepared to extend the campaign on the Houthis from the air and the sea for potentially weeks depending on reaction from the Houthis and Iran, a U.S. official told CBS News.\n\nU.S. fighter aircraft shot down about 11 drones the Houthis launched over the course of several hours Sunday morning local time, a U.S. official said. The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S. Truman, the official said.\n\nMr. Trump in January signed an executive order re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. Mr. Trump had designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization in Jan. 2021, but former President Joe Biden removed the designation shortly afterward due to limitations it would place on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, although the Biden administration went on to label the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terror Group\" in 2024.\n\nSaturday's strikes came as the Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit in an important Red Sea transit point for global shipping for months, and the group said earlier this week that it would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza. The U.S., Israel and the United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Rubio said that while the Biden administration responded to previous attacks with retaliatory strikes, the new strikes are \"not a one-off.\"\n\n\"This is not a message,\" Rubio said. \"This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping.\"\n\nThe secretary of state said that over the last 18 months, the Houthis have \"struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States,\" along with 145 attacks on commercial shipping.\n\n\"So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world,\" Rubio said. \"That's just not sustainable.\"\n\nAsked how long the campaign will last, Rubio said it will continue until the Houthis \"no longer have the capability to do that.\" He also acknowledged that he's heard no talk of ground raids so far and doesn't think there's \"a necessity for it right now.\"\n\nRubio said as of Saturday night, \"some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us,\" adding that \"some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue.\"\n\n\"We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy,\" Rubio said. \"It's not going to happen. Not under President Trump.\""

Welcome back to Face the Nation.\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: Thank you. Great to be back.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have in your state the Port of Baltimore, one of the country's largest ports.

They're not an ideology, but this administration is using it like an ideology. And so while the decisions are being made- made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore, which is really one of these country- one of the country's largest and most effective ports. It's the largest port for roll-on, roll-off vehicles. It is also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impacts on our farmers over in the Eastern Shore and our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this- and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on costs, it's having a very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses, it's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitiveness, as well as our national security, and so these are the type of things- this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about, and we are now seeing in real time in our states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1300 workers at the Education Department.

And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the President of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally. And so when we talk about the different tools that we have- just in this past week alone, you know, I signed- I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises. Because on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA. That just this past week, I have focused on things like lowering prescription drugs costs and actually creating partnerships with the private sector to lower prescription drug costs, that we're working on legislation right now to increase housing inventory that can bring housing prices down, and that is all in- that is all contrary to what we're seeing from the federal government. So the legal tool in working with our Attorney General closely to be able to file suit when the federal government oversteps his bounds is one tool, but we are going to use every tool at our disposal to make sure that the people of Maryland are protected, and we're making sure we're putting extra resources and money back into their pockets.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department, and while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, DC out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a \"liberal state,\" and he said he's going to stop it. I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: Here's- here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is- is that they- that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives and so- so the thing that we know about this this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place and we've gone- we went through this process, not just for these past couple years, since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland- where Maryland won this- this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitatively, where we showed that we could be the place that it was the only site-ready place to build, build-ready site. That we're the place that we could actually have national security assets that they could leverage, particularly when you're talking about the future mission of the FBI, which a lot of it is cyber. That we were the only place that had transportation assets that were close and nearby, that the workers could be able to benefit from. And the place that could get it done cheapest to the American taxpayer by talking about putting it anywhere else, you're talking about adding over a billion dollars in costs to the American taxpayer than what we have already gone through this process with the GSA, the General Service Administration for the state of Maryland. So the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the President has just decided to politicize it by talking about- but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Have you called him? Have you called the White House?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: We tried calling the White House before, and there's- there's- there's no response. And frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break\u2013\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe it?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: The announcement?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: Well, I believe that the President thinks he has the authority to do this, but I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the President does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. It's the GSA that made the decision that the new FBI building should be going to the state of Maryland, after going through a thorough and a very transparent process. And so I believe the President of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there is a King of Kings and a Lord of Lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here, and you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do. You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but- but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age? Or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?\n\nGOV. MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering. You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continuing resolution where- where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland, that we would have not only seen our economy completely downturn into- into a recession, that we would have seen our nation's credit being downgraded, and along those lines, each and every one of us as states, our credit would have been downgraded as well because The United States decided that it's now no longer paying its bills. And we would have seen thousands of federal workers unfairly now being laid off or furloughed. So we know the consequences. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people. And so I think when the American people, when they do not have an option, or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. So we've got to do everything in our power. I know in the state of Maryland, we are mobilizing to make sure we're protecting our federal workers, that we're streamlining them into not just private sector jobs, but also state jobs that are open and available. That we're making sure we're increasing our unemployment insurance, and we are doing things like lowering the price of prescription drugs, and we're doing things like increasing housing inventory, which is going to decrease the housing price. We're doing everything in our power to fight for the people, and I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who awful- offered alternatives. They just weren't listened to. Do you think there is just no leader--\n\nGOV. MOORE: I don't see a difference--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in the party?\n\nGOV. MOORE: I don't- I don't see a difference. And frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interest, I think for the American people, they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing, the performative politics. People are done, and they are exhausted by it. They just want to see results, and that's exactly what we're trying to provide here in the state of Maryland.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.\n\nGOV. MOORE: Thank you."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nHundreds of mostly Venezuelan alleged gang members were deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador on Sunday, with the Trump administration invoking wartime powers to speed up removals despite a court ruling halting the move.\n\nIn the latest dramatic showdown between the White House and the judiciary, a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s ability to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act on Saturday evening, and verbally ordered any planes in the air carrying some of those migrants to turn back to the US.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg said the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days \u201cor until further order of the court.\u201d One person familiar with the matter said the planes were already in the air at the time of the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cParticularly given the plaintiffs\u2019 information, unrebutted by the government, that flights are actively departing and planning to depart, I do not believe that I\u2019m able to wait any longer,\u201d said US District Judge James Boasberg during the hearing. \u201cAny plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.\u201d\n\nBut on Sunday night, President Donald Trump defended his use of the Act, telling reporters on board Air Force One: \u201cI can tell you this, these were bad people. That was a bad group of, as I say, hombres.\u201d\n\nPrevious use of the Aliens Enemies Act has taken place during times of war, but Trump argued that \u201cthis was a time of war\u201d and an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants and criminals \u2013 repeating his past claims about the Biden administration\u2019s handling of immigration.\n\nWhen asked whether his government had violated the judge\u2019s order, Trump replied: \u201cYou\u2019d have to speak to the lawyers about that.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said Sunday that the administration did not violate the judge\u2019s order because it was issued after the migrants in question had left the US.\n\n\u201cThe Administration did not \u2018refuse to comply\u2019 with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,\u201d Leavitt said in a statement, insisting there was no conflict between the administration\u2019s actions and the written order.\n\n\u201cA single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,\u201d she added.\n\nLeavitt said earlier Sunday that at the president\u2019s direction, the Department of Homeland Security had arrested nearly 300 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua over the weekend. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that \u201chundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country,\u201d and thanked El Salvador\u2019s President, Nayib Bukele, for offering to imprison the deportees.\n\nHe added that Bukele had requested that two leaders of the MS-13 gang, as well as 21 other Salvadorans being held in the US be returned to \u201cface justice in their homeland.\u201d\n\nBukele announced on X Sunday morning that the alleged Tren de Aragua members have arrived in El Salvador and been transferred to the Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT, \u201cfor a period of one year.\u201d His post included video of men being led off of buses in handcuffs and having their heads shaved.\n\nTrump, on Truth Social, thanked the Salvadorian leader for accepting the deportees hours later.\n\nCooperation between the two leaders has been a possibility for some time. CNN previously reported that Erik Prince, a Trump ally, has been in contact with Bukele since last year about accepting undocumented migrants from the US if Trump was elected.\n\nThe US will pay $6 million to El Salvador to house the deportees. The money, according to Bukele, will help sustain the penitentiary system, which currently costs $200 million annually. He added that the action will help law enforcement gather intelligence and apprehend more members of MS-13.\n\nBukele also appeared to make light of the incident early Sunday morning. Sharing a screenshot of an article about the Saturday ruling, he wrote on X, \u201cOopsie\u2026too late.\u201d Rubio later shared Bukele\u2019s post on his own page.\n\nDeportation flights weren\u2019t in the air long before judges order\n\nBoasberg had initially blocked the administration from deporting five individuals who challenged Trump\u2019s use of the act. Following a hastily scheduled hearing hours later, Boasberg broadened that temporary block, granting a request from the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to cover all noncitizens in US custody who would be subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation.\n\nSenior White House officials convened late Saturday with other administration officials to discuss how to proceed once Boasberg ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act could not proceed, and ultimately determined not to order the deportation planes to turn around, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe planes had not been in the air very long when the judge issued his ruling, the person said.\n\nLeavitt\u2019s assertion that there was no conflict between the administration\u2019s actions and the judge\u2019s \u201cwritten order\u201d appears carefully crafted to exclude the judge\u2019s directive that planes be turned around \u2014 which he issued verbally from the bench.\n\nVerbal orders hold the same legal weight as written directives, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig told CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d Sunday. The big question, Honig explained, was where the planes were when the order was given.\n\n\u201cCould the judge have ordered them to turn around mid-flight while they had already left US territory? There\u2019s at least some gray area there. There\u2019s at least a fig leaf for the administration to use,\u201d he added.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi and other top DOJ officials argued in a Sunday afternoon filing that \u201csome gang members\u201d were deported between Boasberg\u2019s two orders on Saturday after his Alien Enemies Act proclamation. They added that the five plaintiffs from the first order have not been removed.\n\nCarl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said he believes it\u2019s possible the Trump administration defied the court based on Boasberg\u2019s statements on Saturday, though it is still unclear when exactly the planes took off.\n\nIf Boasberg determines that there was, in fact, a \u201cclear violation\u201d of his order, Tobias explained that the judge could issue a stricter order laying out how exactly the administration should be complying with his guidance. If the administration were to defy that order, violators could be held in either civil or criminal contempt, Tobias added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has threatened to defy court orders, Tobias said this case stands out due to its implications for the country\u2019s standing on the world stage.\n\n\u201cThis move, it seems to me, is one of the few orders that that does raise all kinds of questions about national security, as do some of the others, but also about how the United States conducts its business in the world, and so I think it is somewhat more far reaching,\u201d Tobias explained, adding that Boasberg has demonstrated that he is \u201csensitive\u201d to providing due process for the alleged criminals that have been deported.\n\nGOP Sen. Mike Rounds said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he expects the executive branch is following the law, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper \u201cwe don\u2019t know if that happened that way\u201d when pressed on if he\u2019s concerned that the Trump administration potentially violated the court order.\n\n\u201cI think most Americans are going to say, \u2018I don\u2019t care how old the law is, if you can use it to get these guys out and keep my family safe, we\u2019re going to do it,\u2019\u201d the South Dakota Republican added.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday that Democrats \u201cstand strongly in support of the rule of law\u201d in reference to the judge\u2019s order, and warned against the potential impacts of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive deportation strategy.\n\n\u201cAll of us within the Democratic Party, we oppose illegal immigration,\u201d he said MSNBC. \u201cBut we also can\u2019t go down this road that the Trump administration is taking us on and potentially deport American citizens, deport legal and lawful permanent residents and break up law abiding immigrant families who are contributing to this country.\u201d\n\nCecot prison in El Salvador\n\nWith capacity for 40,000 inmates, Cecot is the largest prison in the Americas and a symbol of El Salvador\u2019s brutal crackdown on crime.\n\nIt is also notorious for the ruthless way it has treated prisoners, which human rights organizations say is inhumane and violates human rights. Between 10,000 and 20,000 inmates have been locked up there. There is no privacy, comfort or any indication that the prisoners will ever be released.\n\nCNN visited the prison late last year and saw inmates locked up in crowded cells, with some holding 80 people or so. They slept in metal bunks with no mattresses, sheets or pillows. They had an open toilet, a cement basin and plastic bucket for washing, and a large jug for drinking water. The men were inside these cells for 23\u00bd hours a day. They had a 30-minute daily break to leave the cell for the central hallway for group exercise or Bible readings.\n\nCritics have also pointed out that under the nationwide crackdown on crime in El Salvador, some constitutional rights like due process have been suspended. More than 80,000 people have been arrested throughout the country, accounting for more than 1% of the Salvadoran population. Bukele has admitted that some innocent people have been detained by mistake and that several thousand of them have already been released. He and many of his supporters argue that such collateral damage is part of the difficult process of transforming the country from being the \u201cmurder capital of the world\u201d to one of the safest.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report."

Joe Lieberman\u2019s unexpected death in 2024, a time in Jewish tradition when family members recite the mourners\u2019 kaddish prayer and light candles in memory of their loved one.\n\nThose of us who knew Joe Lieberman continue to mourn his passing and miss his smile and decency. When we have gathered at memorial services and early screenings of \"Centered,\" a new documentary which chronicles his life, we always express the wish that there were more leaders like him in today\u2019s harsh political environment. (\"Centered\" will be in Regal Cinemas nationwide on March 18 and 19.)\n\nThat yearning for comity was accentuated by the partisan atmosphere in the House of Representatives for President Donald Trump\u2019s recent address to a joint session of Congress. We could debate which party or its leaders are more guilty of polluting the public square these days, but that would defeat the purpose of arguing for better behavior from both sides. The political divide (a worrisome \"gulf of America\") leaves us inches away from stalemate, and mere feet from chaos.\n\nWhile Joe Lieberman can no longer speak up on behalf of civility in politics, he left us plenty of examples:\n\nMY FATHER WAS SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN. HIS LAST WORDS ARE WHAT WE NEED TO HEAR RIGHT NOW\n\nWhen he gave the Democratic response to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s last radio address in 1989, Lieberman did not abuse the opportunity to settle political scores. \"Your love of this country and your fervent devotion to freedom inspired us all,\" the new Democratic senator said of the Republican president.\n\nIn 1991, rather than join most Democrats to oppose the use of force after Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, Lieberman became the lead Democratic co-sponsor of the resolution authorizing the first (and successful) Gulf War.\n\nWorking across the aisle with senators like John McCain, Lieberman advocated for the 9/11 Commission to investigate the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, and Arlen Specter for creation of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHe often joined with Republican Sen. Bob Dole in urging both Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton to take a more active role in defending Bosnia from Serbian aggression.\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO REMEMBER ABOUT MY DEAR FRIEND SEN JOE LIEBERMAN\n\nAnd Lieberman collaborated with leaders in both parties to speak out against the plight of inappropriate content in video games, music and television programs, which helped lead to the creation of ratings systems that give parents more power to discern what is best for their children.\n\nThroughout his life, Lieberman\u2019s advocacy of harmony and good will found expression in his fervent support for civil and human rights, from traveling to Mississippi as a student advocating voting rights to his leadership in ending the discriminatory \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\" policy in the military and to his commitment to a cleaner environment (the latter two efforts also involved cross-party cooperation).\n\nThe senator\u2019s many public expressions of cordiality towards people of either or no political party were matched by his behavior in private. As staffers who worked with him beginning more than 45 years ago, through many crises and controversies (rarely of his own making), we can testify to his humor, equanimity and good will. We never heard him raise his voice, even in the most tense and tumultuous of circumstances.\n\nJoe Lieberman\u2019s calm demeanor should not be mistaken for a milquetoast career, however. In the course of the work cited above, and many more, he was friendly, but forthright; decent, but determined.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThanks in good measure to his faith in God and fervent religious beliefs, he had a strong moral compass that almost always pointed him in the right direction for the betterment of society. If he fell short on rare occasions, it was never from base motives or weak principles. He was, in the words of the prophet Isaiah, a \"repairer of the breach,\" not a source of division.\n\nAs nearly lifelong believers in the leadership of Joe Lieberman, we cannot help but feel that America and the world would have been better off if he and Al Gore had succeeded in the 2000 election. But even in the wake of that enormous \u2013 and enormously disappointing \u2013 setback in his life, Lieberman showed the same kind of grace and optimism that characterized his whole life:\n\n\"America is a great country,\" he said on the floor of the Senate the day after Vice President Gore conceded the election to George W. Bush. \"I do think that every one of us should be grateful this morning that here in America we work out our differences not with civil wars, but with spirited elections.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It is time now for all of us to come together in support of these United States and the shared values that have long sustained us,\" he continued. \"Psalm 30 assures us that weeping may linger for the night, but in the morning, there are shouts of joy.\"\n\nOur sorrow over the loss of Joe Lieberman has lingered through the long night of his absence from our lives and politics \u2013 never more than at this yahrzeit of his passing \u2013 but we are encouraged by his stirring words and sterling example to find hope for shouts of joy once again..\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JIM KENNEDY\n\nJim Kennedy is a former spokesman for Joe Lieberman, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, the Clinton Foundation, Sony Pictures, Sony Corporation of America and News Corp.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS military officials believe Russia and China are aggressively testing new offensive space capabilities, pointing to a series of satellite training missions conducted by both countries in recent months as growing evidence of an effort to weaponize outer space.\n\nAs recently as last week, Russian satellites were practicing \u201cattack and defend tactics,\u201d maneuvers intended to increase the proficiency of their space force, according to a US defense official.\n\nUS officials watched multiple Russian satellites work together to surround and isolate another satellite that was positioned in low-Earth orbit, demonstrating how they could potentially target enemy spacecraft in a future conflict, the official added.\n\nRussia\u2019s goal remains to put a nuclear weapon in space, the defense official said. Recent Russian satellite movements also suggest they are actively preparing for a potential armed conflict in space, the official added.\n\n\u201cRussia wants to take away our advantages in space and they don\u2019t care about collateral damage,\u201d the defense official said.\n\nLast year, CNN reported on Russia\u2019s effort to develop a space-based nuclear weapon that would use a massive energy wave, known as an electromagnetic pulse, to potentially knock out a large swath of commercial and government satellites.\n\nIn 2021, Russia also tested an anti-satellite missile that destroyed a Russian satellite, creating a massive debris field in space that forced astronauts on the International Space Station to scramble for safety.\n\nIn this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping attend an official welcoming ceremony in front of the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square in Beijing on May 16, 2024. Sergei Bobylyov/Pool/Sputnik/Getty Images\n\nChina has carried out similar training exercises in space over the last year. In December, Beijing demonstrated advanced capabilities by maneuvering multiple satellites in close formation \u2013 raising concerns about potential military applications.\n\n\u201cThey practiced attack approaches \u2026 those are advanced patrols and advanced tactics,\u201d the official said.\n\nThese co-orbital satellites can directly hit another satellite or disable it, just one of a suite of such technologies that Beijing is developing. China is also developing anti-satellite missiles and directed-energy attacks that use lasers or similar systems to attack other satellites.\n\n\u201cThis is a PLA space force that\u2019s being built, trained and ready to seize the ultimate high ground\u201d from the US, the defense official said.\n\nChina has already shown its rapidly advancing technological prowess in space. The test of a space-launched hypersonic missile in 2021 caught the US by surprise. The top US general at the time called it a \u201cvery significant technological event.\u201d\n\nUS Space Force officials are focused on continuing to develop their own offensive and defensive space capabilities in an effort to ensure neither Russia or China can exploit mobility to gain a military advantage over American assets and conduct a \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d style attack, the official added.\n\n\u201cMobility can lead to breakout,\u201d the official said, pointing to how the Germans took away the mobility of enemy tanks during World War II.\n\nThe US still maintains an advantage over both Russia and China in space, the defense official noted, but both countries are developing new systems to enhance military effectiveness and end any reliance on American technology, according to US Space Force\u2019s intelligence headquarters.\n\nTrump touted the creation of the US Space Force during his first term in office but defense officials stress that increasing competition from Russia and China still poses a national security threat.\n\n\u201cUS needs to be ready to do more than protect and defend in outer space. Stories about playing defense are stories about losing,\u201d the defense official said.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson, right, watches as other nations, including the Soviet Union, signs an international treaty banning weapons in outer space on January 27, 1967, in Washington, DC. Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe US, Russia and China are all signatories to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which bans weapons of mass destruction in space. But with growing concern of an outer space arms race, the treaty appears increasingly like a relic of the past. Last April, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have reaffirmed the opposition to nuclear weapons in outer space.\n\nChina, in particular, has rapidly improved space capabilities that can be used to track and target US military forces, according to US Space Force officials. As of December 2024, China had more than 1,060 satellites in orbit, second only to the United States.\n\nUS Space Force\u2019s intelligence arm has determined that Beijing expects space will play an important role in future conflicts by enabling long-range precision strikes, according to the latest threat assessments.\n\nIn December 2024, China launched a remote sensing satellite that Space Force military officials say could allow it to persistently monitor US and allied forces in the Pacific region.\n\n\u201cIntelligence suggests the PLA likely sees counterspace operations as a means to deter and counter US military intervention in a regional conflict,\u201d according to multiple US Space Force officials.\n\n\u201cMoreover, PLA academics stress the necessity of \u2018destroying, damaging, and interfering with the enemy\u2019s reconnaissance \u2026and communications satellites\u2019 to \u2018blind and deafen the enemy,\u2019\u201d they added.\n\nChina conducted 66 successful space launches in 2024, placing 67 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capable satellites into orbit, according to US Space Force Intelligence Headquarters."

Not under this presidency.\"\n\nTrump appeared to be dressed in golf attire and was wearing his signature red baseball cap with his name emblazoned on the back while watching video of the strikes on a television screen.\n\nAnother photo showed the president from the front with a black headset on.\n\nUS NAVY SHIPS REPEL ATTACK FROM HOUTHIS IN GULF OF ADEN\n\nTrump wrote in a Saturday TRUTHSocial post that he had \"ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen.\"\n\n\"Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists\u2019 bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,\" Trump said. \"No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.\"\n\nU.S. Central Command said Saturday it \"initiated a series of operations consisting of precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen to defend American interests, deter enemies, and restore freedom of navigation.\"\n\nState Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement that Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday.\n\n\"The Secretary informed Russia of U.S. military deterrence operations against the Iran-backed Houthis and emphasized that continued Houthi attacks on U.S. military and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea will not be tolerated,\" Bruce wrote. \"Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov also discussed next steps to follow up on recent meetings in Saudi Arabia and agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia.\"\n\nThe Houthi-run Health Ministry in Yemen said the strikes killed at least 31 people, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly targeted international shipping in the Red Sea and launched missiles and drones at Israel in what the terrorist group said were acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally. The attacks stopped when a fragile Israel-Hamas cease-fire took hold in Gaza in January. The Houthis then threatened to renew them after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month following the Hamas rejection of a U.S. framework for continuing the cease-fire and hostage releases.\n\nThe U.S. and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the Houthis, and the U.S. Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said were bound for the terrorist group, which controls Yemen's capital of Sanaa and the country's north. Gen. Hossein Salami, head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks.\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES 'DECISIVE AND POWERFUL' AIRSTRIKES AGAINST HOUTHI TERRORISTS IN YEMEN\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a post on X, urged the U.S. to halt the strikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.\n\nTrump said, \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.\"\n\nTrump charged that the Houthis \"have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden\u2019s response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going,\" he wrote on TRUTHSocial.\n\nTrump said it has been more than a year since a U.S.-flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden.\n\n\"The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON\u2019T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!\" Trump said.\n\nThe president added, \"To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won\u2019t be nice about it!\"\n\nThe Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023 and January of this year, when the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, according to the AP.\n\nThe U.S., Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Saturday\u2019s operation was conducted solely by the U.S. It was the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt comes two weeks after Trump sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational.\n\nThe Trump administration re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization earlier this month, after the Biden administration had lifted the group's designation in 2021.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nAs President Donald Trump works to dramatically reshape the federal government, he is also in the middle of transforming another historic aspect of the presidency: the Oval Office.\n\nNearly eight weeks since returning to office, Trump has tripled the number of paintings hanging on the office walls. Shelves and surfaces are adorned with flags, statues and ornaments.\n\nAnd in keeping with the style he has adhered to for decades, there is gold everywhere: new gold vermeil figurines on the mantle and medallions on the fireplace, gold eagles on the side tables, gilded Rococo mirrors on the doors, and, nestled in the pediments above the doorways, diminutive gold cherubs shipped in from Mar-a-Lago. Even the remote control for the television down the hall is wrapped in gilt.\n\nHe had even toyed with the idea of hanging a chandelier in the Oval Office, according to two people familiar with his plans, though that seems unlikely now.\n\nTrump meets with Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin in the Oval Office. Behind them are recently added gold medallions on the fireplace and gold vermeil figurines on the mantle. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt all makes for a White House increasingly reminiscent of Trump\u2019s South Florida home. Work is expected to begin within weeks on Trump\u2019s plans to revamp the Rose Garden by paving over the grass and turning it into a patio-style seating area, much like the one where he holds court at Mar-a-Lago. The president personally reviewed the plans for the Rose Garden recently with White House curators.\n\nTrump has discussed his vision for the outdoor space, originally designed by first lady Ellen Wilson, with visiting heads of state as they walk along the South Portico, according to an official in a visiting delegation.\n\nOn the South Lawn, the president hopes to build a new ballroom to host state dinners, modeled after the one at Mar-a-Lago, which in turn was inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. He has reviewed multiple sets of blueprints since taking office, showing them off to visitors and making tweaks to the designs. Trump has long said he\u2019ll pay for the construction himself \u2013 he even offered to build it during the Obama administration \u2013 but it\u2019s still not clear whether the project will proceed on the historic grounds.\n\n\u201cIt keeps my real-estate juices flowing,\u201d Trump told The Spectator recently of the prospective renovations. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be beautiful.\u201d\n\nTrump speaks in the library at Mar-a-Lago on March 4, 2024, in Palm Beach, Florida. Alon Skuy/Getty Images\n\nIt all makes for a most Trump-like workspace, with the president surrounded by far more objects, curiosities and art than the men who preceded him in the office. Never known for a minimalist aesthetic, Trump appears most at home amid all the stuff: trophies, art, papers, memorabilia.\n\nTrump has long seen his office as a showplace as much as a workplace. For decades, his corner suite on the 26th floor of Trump Tower was stuffed with collectibles on the windowsill and tables, with framed photographs and magazine covers donning the walls. The Oval Office, particularly his desk, is far more orderly, yet still reminiscent of the place where he made his fame.\n\nEvery addition to the Oval Office \u2013 no matter how big or small \u2013 comes at his direction, aides say, as he seeks to remake the space as he sees fit.\n\nThe Oval Office is the predominant power center of any administration, but since Trump returned two months ago, the room has become one of the most visible in the White House. He uses it to hold forth with visiting foreign leaders, including the remarkably hostile session with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as a venue to swear-in Cabinet secretaries and as a backdrop for his near-daily question-and-answer sessions with reporters.\n\n\u201cOh, what a great feeling,\u201d Trump said, sitting behind the Resolute Desk on Inauguration Day when asked how it felt to return to the Oval Office. \u201cOne of the better feelings I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nTrump usually arrives mid-morning from the residence, where he is often up and on the phone from 6 a.m. onward, ringing different aides or allies to discuss what he\u2019s just watched on television, read in the paper or various plans for the day. His staff knows to expect him in the West Wing closer to 10 or 11 a.m.\n\nThe space he arrives to these days has taken on the feel of a packed gallery showroom. While he knew immediately some of the portraits he wanted to hang, Trump has also reviewed catalogues upon catalogues of potential portraits from the national collection to hang in the Oval Office, flipping through laminated pages to decide which of his predecessors\u2019 portraits he\u2019d like to adorn the walls of the office they\u2019ve all occupied.\n\nAfter selecting which men he wants on the wall, he moves on to frames. Characteristic of how he prefers the decor at his other properties, Trump usually leans toward darker frames. In all, he has hung close to 20 paintings in the Oval Office, all of predecessors or statesmen he reveres or is inspired by. Joe Biden, by comparison, had six portraits on the walls \u2013 itself well more than Barack Obama, who hung two portraits of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, but gave over the remaining wall space to modern paintings, including two Edward Hoppers on loan from the Whitney Museum.\n\nIn this November 13, 2024 photo, President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office.

Across the room, a new picture of Washington hangs above the fireplace: no longer the small painting that hung there when Trump arrived in January, but an imposing portrait by Charles Willson Peale from 1776, showing the first president with a sword.\n\nAlmost every square inch of wall space has been covered in oil portraits of founding fathers or former presidents; in some places, their frames are almost touching as they compete for space. The gallery wall now includes Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Polk \u2013 on loan from Capitol Hill \u2013 all staring down at the proceedings in the office.\n\nA painting of former President Ronald Reagan hangs behind Trump during a swearing-in ceremony.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nWhile many presidents have found the White House to be a confining bubble, Trump often extols the beauty and grandeur of the executive mansion, particularly the Oval Office. Some presidents have held working meetings in the Roosevelt or Cabinet rooms, but Trump spends most of his day inside the Oval and the small adjoining ante rooms, including a dining room.\n\nSo far, all of the changes in this term have been centered around the d\u00e9cor. But during his first term, Trump presided over an extensive renovation of the Oval Office and other rooms across the West Wing. The $1.75 million renovations were completed while he was on a summer break at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe found gold behind the walls, which I always knew. Renovations are grand,\u201d Trump told TIME magazine then. \u201cRemember how hard they worked? They wanted to make me happy.\u201d\n\nEven as the two-month mark of his return to power approaches, Trump is still adding new pieces of d\u00e9cor or memorabilia to the Oval Office. Some are rotating. Others seem to be on more permanent display.\n\nOn the table behind his desk sits a shiny golden replica of the FIFA World Cup Trophy, known as the Jules Rimet Trophy. Trump talks often about the next World Cup, which will take place in July 2026 across North America, with the majority of matches played in the US.\n\nA photograph of President Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, next to a replica of the FIFA World Cup trophy on a table behind the Resolute Desk.

The plants are descended from cuttings originally gifted to John F. Kennedy by the Irish ambassador to the US. On the mantle now are seven gold artifacts, arranged in a row flanking a tall empire-style centerpiece.\n\nSimple wooden side tables have been replaced by showier, marble-topped consoles, with gilded eagles on the base holding up bronze busts of Martin Luther King Jr. and Winston Churchill.\n\nPhotographs cover a table behind Trump\u2019s desk, including of his mother. The Resolute Desk, gifted by Queen Victoria and crafted from timbers of an Arctic exploration vessel, was sent off for refurbishment last month. A smaller desk has taken its place temporarily.\n\nNext to it, a placard showing the body of water he\u2019s renamed the \u201cGulf of America\u201d sits permanently on an easel.

At times, some guests have used it as a coaster.\n\nAnd there may be more to come. The president spends most weekends at Mar-a-Lago and often returns aboard Air Force One with a new showpiece for the Oval Office or another place of honor in the White House."

            "full_content": "Flushing will be fun this year. Photo: Rich Storry/Getty Images\n\nPeligro Sports employee Randy Rodriguez was smiling sheepishly. Standing in front of an array of caps at a Washington Heights sporting-goods store one day last month, he admitted he was abandoning the Yankees. Never mind that the team has won 27 championships, made it to the World Series last year, and are betting-odds favorites to return this season (despite a raft of injuries), Rodriguez was terminating his fandom. With the aid of a fellow employee translating, he said he was making a switch long unthinkable in New York: to the Mets.\n\nOr at least he was very likely to do so. \u201cOchenta y cinco por ciento, que s\u00ed,\u201d he said \u2014 meaning he was 85 percent sure. Hey, commitment is hard, especially when your co-workers keep insisting you\u2019re going to bring your (alleged) bad luck to your new team. But across Washington Heights and beyond, legions of the area\u2019s more than 1.2 million residents with Dominican roots are making the same choice, dropping pinstripes for orange and blue.\n\nThe singular reason for this fandom exodus: Juan Soto and his record-breaking 15-year, $765 million contract. The greatest of Major League Baseball\u2019s current Dominican stars, Soto spent 2024 in the Bronx before deciding in December to take his talents to Flushing.\n\nAt Peligro, a local baseball institution known for catering to both MLB and Dominican Professional Baseball League diehards, Yankees gear outsold Mets paraphernalia last season at an 80-20 clip, said Freddy Pe\u00f1a, a longtime store manager. Since Soto\u2019s signing, it has flipped to 70-30 Mets. \u201cIt was like a complete stop from, Oh, we were selling Yankees gear, and now it\u2019s Mets, Mets, Mets,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.\n\nAcross the store from Rodriguez, two full racks of Yankees jerseys were hanging alongside a depleted supply of blue Mets Soto jerseys. Previously, Peligro offered more than a dozen varieties of Yankees hats and just a couple of Mets lids. But store owner Jose Mateo said his Mets-cap display will soon match the Yankees one, including a hat with the Dominican flag plus Soto\u2019s name and No. 22 stitched beside the Mets\u2019 curlicued \u201cNY.\u201d\n\nDominican fans in the U.S. tend to follow home-island heroes more than teams, switching clubs when their favorite players do. Mateo, who emigrated from the D.R. when he was 17, explained that while some Dominican fans in New York \u201cdie with the Yankees\u201d and others \u201cdie with the Mets,\u201d most will go with a player. The bigger the star, the stronger the pull. \u201cA guy like Soto brings the fans,\u201d Mateo said.\n\nRodriguez, for example, used to root for the St. Louis Cardinals, back when Santo Domingo native Albert Pujols played for the team. After Pujols decamped for the lowly Angels, Rodriguez drifted from team to team depending on his preferred Dominican player of the moment. When the Yankees traded for Soto, that finally meant the Bombers. \u201cLast year, Soto made it huge for Dominican fans, for Yankee Stadium,\u201d Mateo said.\n\nIt was a major moment. For all their vaunted rings, the club has never locked down control of New York\u2019s most baseball-obsessed population \u2014 one centered, no less, in the Bronx, the home of Yankee Stadium, and uptown Manhattan, just an errant Chuck Knoblauch toss away. Until Soto arrived, the Yankees had simply never had a Dominican megastar capable of drawing fans en masse. (Alex Rodriguez might have qualified had he not been widely disowned by Dominican fans after choosing to represent the U.S. over the Dominican Republic in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.)\n\n\u201cA lot of Dominicans, they\u2019ve never been such good fans of the Yankees,\u201d Mateo said.\n\nWhen City Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa took office in 2022, she became the first Dominican woman to represent Washington Heights and Inwood. She has seen the impact of Soto\u2019s signing around her district \u2014 though she wants it on record that she has always been a staunch Mets devotee, even when her father peeled off several years ago to support Boston and its fleet of Dominican stars led by star pitcher Pedro Mart\u00ednez. (\u201cThat\u2019s where I drew the line,\u201d she said.) De La Rosa believes that, by not holding on to Soto, the Yankees missed an opportunity to finally secure widespread support in New York\u2019s Dominican community.\n\n\u201cWhile maybe it\u2019s not part of the Yankees\u2019 grand scheme in their calculations, it should be,\u201d she said. \u201cDominicans, we bring that energy and that excitement.\u201d\n\nAfter the Red Sox traded for Mart\u00ednez ahead of the 1998 season, Dominican fans flocked to Fenway Park on days he pitched, turning the old bandbox into a raucous fiesta. With Soto onboard, many, like De La Rosa, expect the atmosphere at Citi Field to be turned up, too.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019ll get festive and loud and celebratory,\u201d she said.\n\nIt will be \u201creal, real loud,\u201d echoed Mateo.\n\nLast year, the Mets rode a tide of uncharacteristic good feeling to a surprise appearance in the National League Championship Series, spurred on by Grimace and the vocal and fielding talents of Jose Iglesias, a journeyman shortstop and pop star whose anthem, \u201cOMG,\u201d captured the Mets faithful and the Latin-pop world alike. But the team did not bring back Iglesias for this season, and everyone knows the risks of going back to McDonald\u2019s too quickly. The infusion of fans and excitement caused by Soto\u2019s arrival ought to give the \u201925 squad a chance to forge its own identity \u2014 one no less vibrant, though perhaps less purple.\n\nIt is, of course, common for fans to take a shine to pro athletes with whom they share a background. But given that practically every Major League roster now includes Dominican players \u2014 many of them stars \u2014 the extent to which Dominican fans jump team to team along with their favorite players is unique. When the Mets traded for Mike Piazza, for example, he did not come packaged with Little Italy.\n\nRamona Hern\u00e1ndez, a professor of sociology and the director of the Dominican Studies Institute at the City University of New York, said la pelota has long been a dominant part of Dominican culture and is all the more so today as it is often viewed as a way out of poverty. Some fans see themselves \u2014 or perhaps someone they know \u2014 in the stars who make it; others just feel pride.\n\n\u201cNo matter how large we are, we are still a very small group in the country,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI think that feeling of being a small group makes you click and connect to that which is familiar and that shares this historical legacy.\u201d\n\nSoto\u2019s signing the largest contract in baseball history has been a particular point of pride. \u201cIt is something that I think resonated with Dominicans,\u201d she said. \u201cThis humble young person put the name of the Dominican people way up there in the right way.\u201d\n\nLast season, 142 players born in the D.R. played in MLB, according to the Baseball Almanac, the most by far from any country besides the United States. As recently as 1980, though, the number was just 30. In 1990 it grew to 52, by 2000 it was 104, and by 2010 it was 126. Until then, there was only a single Dominican Hall of Famer, Juan Marichal, who played from 1960 to 1975. Marichal had a loyal following, but it was during the player boom of the late \u201990s and early aughts that the next wave of all-time greats arrived \u2014 and that Dominican fans\u2019 penchant for following players became most pronounced.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez said she recently happened to look at an old picture of herself from 1978, when she was studying at Lehman College in the Bronx, and noticed she was wearing a Yankees cap. But when the Red Sox traded for Mart\u00ednez, that \u201cNY\u201d on her head turned to a red \u201cB.\u201d\n\n\u201cMart\u00ednez was there, are you kidding me? Forget it,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, Led Black, a Washington Heights community activist and the founder of The Uptown Collective blog, recalled that his father was a lifelong Yankees fan until the rival Red Sox became loaded with Dominican superstars: not just Mart\u00ednez but also David Ortiz and Washington Heights\u2019s own Manny Ram\u00edrez.\n\nDuring that period, at the height of the Red Sox\u2013Yankees holy war, Washington Heights became known as a hotbed of Red Sox resistance in the city. \u201cThere was some pushback. You would definitely see it at the barbershop,\u201d Black said. \u201cI think the loyalty to Dominicanness trumped a lot of it.\u201d\n\nOver time, Boston\u2019s stars retired and most Dominican fans in New York moved on, though a lingering corps of Red Sox partisans remains. Mateo said many former Sox fans, who could never quite stomach joining the Yankees\u2019 Evil Empire \u2014 even with Soto \u2014 are now \u201cgoing to feel more free to be with the Mets.\u201d\n\nInside his store, he pointed out one such employee who recently switched from the Red Sox to the Mets after refusing to touch the hated Yankees.\n\nThe Mets are no more guaranteed Dominican fans\u2019 continued allegiance than any other team is. But If Soto performs well and plays out his full 15-year contract in Queens, that\u2019s certainly plenty of time to build up loyalty. And perhaps some fans will stick with the Mets even after the masses move on to a new superstar, as happened with the Red Sox. The Mets may also come to see value in continuing to acquire Dominican stars \u2014 and attract Dominican fans \u2014 based as they are in the Dominican Republic\u2019s unofficial U.S. capital.\n\nEven as Dominicans have become a more established part of both the United States and Major League Baseball, there is little sign that such intense loyalty to individual players will fade. Hern\u00e1ndez said that, as the second and third generations of Dominicans in the U.S. have overtaken the number of immigrants, she has observed a greater emphasis on preserving Dominican culture.\n\n\u201cThere is this understanding, this realization, this developing of consciousness about, If we don\u2019t emphasize who we are, if we don\u2019t pass it on, it can die,\u201d she said. \u201cThat, I think, creates the need for expressing the culture even more than in the past.\u201d\n\nAnd, as she pointed out, Dominican culture is baseball.\n\nAs a sociologist and baseball fan, Hern\u00e1ndez said she will not miss the chance to observe the Juan Soto phenomenon firsthand at Citi Field.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to go simply to see him,\u201d she said. \u201cI am one of those!\u201d"

            "full_content": "Bill Burr talks a whole lot about men in his new comedy special \u201cDrop Dead Years,\u201d which debuted on Hulu on Friday. Why is it, he wonders aloud, that only men \u201cdrop dead,\u201d usually between the ages of 49 and 61, sometimes while manscaping \u201cin the upstairs bathroom while listening to AC/DC\u201d? How come \u201cmen aren\u2019t allowed to be sad\u201d? \u201cWe\u2019re allowed,\u201d he continues, \u201cto be one of two things: mad or \u2018fine.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d If you want to see sad men doing sad things in their natural sad habitat, Burr suggests, visit your local Guitar Center.\n\nBurr is also thinking about men in much more personal terms. \u201cDrop Dead Years\u201d opens up with the comedian, offstage, reflecting candidly:\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a weird thing to be over 50 and realize how f----d up you are. Like, I thought I did stand-up because I loved comedy. And then what I really figured out is that, no, that\u2019s not why I did it. I did stand-up because that was the easiest way to walk into a room full of a bunch of people that I didn\u2019t know and make everybody like me. All of the way I\u2019ve moved through the world has always been like, \u2018Where\u2019s the place I have the least chance of being hurt?\u2019\n\nBill Burr is a therapeutic work in progress. He\u2019s bravely figuring himself out ... in public. The process, however, is not free of contradictions. Nor is it going very smoothly.\n\nIn \u201cDrop Dead Years,\u201d as in previous specials, he copiously mocks women, feminists, gays, liberals, trans people, overweight people, etc. And while the results are often very funny, this sure is an odd way to get \u201ceverybody\u201d in the room to like him.\n\nThe response to his controversial \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d monologue of 2020, in which he lit up \u201ccancel culture,\u201d is a case in point. As is his postelection 2024 \u201cSNL\u201d appearance, when he counseled women not to wear pantsuits like Kamala Harris did. Instead, the ladies who seek elected office should \u201cwhore it up a bit.\u201d\n\nWhat truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to situate a comedian like Burr in the present comedic \u201cmanosphere.\u201d That would be the dank man cave where Joe Rogan, Tony Hinchcliffe, Theo Von and others trash liberal pieties, garner immense crowds and earn success and influence in the process. Like them, Burr\u2019s got the stage rage. He\u2019s got the confrontational \u201cI\u2019m so mad my heart is about to explode!\u201d affect. He too delights in (rhetorically) coldcocking minorities.\n\nBut Burr is different. He\u2019s not only older than these boys, he is infinitely more intelligent. A heady gag in \u201cDrop Dead Years\u201d about KKK members riding in the HOV lane reminds us that Burr is a thinking man\u2019s comic in the style of George Carlin. He\u2019s also an exceptionally skilled physical actor. He uses his body, pasty white face and bald dome (which shines like a diamond under the stage lights) in ways that few can rival: I especially appreciated his imitation of a man dropping dead out of a golf cart.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s what we might call Burr\u2019s balance. He\u2019s not averse to punching up. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Terry Gross this past week, the comic set his sights on Elon Musk. \u201cI just refuse to believe,\u201d Burr declared, reflecting on the billionaire\u2019s Inauguration Day salutes, \u201cthat it was an accidental, two-time \u2018Sieg heil.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet what truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection. As the opening comments in this latest special suggest, Burr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad. He\u2019s boldly marching into the aforementioned room \u2014 a \u201croom,\u201d I might add, that streams to a few million people \u2014 and bleeding out.\n\nBurr\u2019s asking questions. Why can\u2019t men wrap themselves in an afghan, sit in a corner and brood like women can? Why can\u2019t men be sad? The problem is that, like Dave Chappelle, he also demands to know why he can\u2019t use a homophobic slur anymore.\n\nHis public therapeutic turn, with all of its contradictions, is equally evident in the NPR interview with Gross. One second he\u2019s decimating Musk\u2019s \u201claminated face\u201d and the next (like, literally one second later), he\u2019s talking about why he hates liberals. One second he\u2019s confronting his flawed masculinity; moments later, he\u2019s subjecting Gross to the type of off-the-shelf manosphere rebuttals that are guaranteed to drive liberal women, among others, to distraction. (The normally serene Gross, for her part, at some points low-key loses her patience with Burr\u2019s evasions and interruptions.)\n\nBurr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad.\n\nBill Burr is extremely funny. But politically, the man is completely incomprehensible.\n\nIn terms of psychic self-awareness, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite \u201cthere\u201d yet (wherever that may be). Admirably, he\u2019s realized that he performs his comedy to avoid getting hurt. It therefore boggles the mind that he seems to make no effort to interrogate whether and how his jokes, broadcast to multitudes, might hurt other people, whether that\u2019s gay men, or women bemoaning Harris\u2019 election loss (and their personal freedoms).\n\nThe closing sequence of \u201cDrop Dead Years\u201d provides a clue as to how Burr may presently resolve all this psychic tumult. A few moments earlier, he had mentioned that he was touched inappropriately as a child (\u201cI got touched as a kid\u201d). Now the credits have rolled, we\u2019re in the alley behind the theater. Away from the crowd. Everything\u2019s quiet. Burr is sitting on the stoop of the stage door. His buddy is eating a sandwich and drinking a beer. Burr is smoking a cigar. It\u2019s a good cigar. Maybe, the moment suggests, men achieve psychic resolution by being alone with other men."
