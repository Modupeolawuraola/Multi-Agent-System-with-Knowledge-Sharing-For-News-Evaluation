            "full_content": "The United States Marine Band was founded in 1798. Thomas Jefferson gave it its nickname, \"The President's Own.\" Today, 135 Marines still perform the score of the White House from parties to inaugurations. So, there was excitement, last year, when the Marines judged a contest for teenage musicians. The winners would perform with the band. Thirty students were chosen. The concert was scheduled. But, last month, it was canceled. President Trump had issued his executive order against diversity programs, and the young musicians were Black, Hispanic, Indian and Asian. Because they were silenced, many wanted to hear them including veterans of military bands who gathered in an improvised orchestra of equity that you might call America's own.\n\nThis past Sunday, at the music center at Strathmore, near Washington, 22 students who had lost their chance to play tuned up with the military band veterans for the concert that was not meant to be heard.\n\nThis music had been planned for the canceled concert. \"Nobles of the Mystic Shrine\" by John Philip Sousa. Sousa directed the Marine Band a century and a half ago and composed \"Stars and Stripes Forever,\" the great classic in the songbook of patriots.\n\nRishab Jain: We're a land that prides itself on being the land of the free, the home of the brave. And I believe that just as much as anyone else does. But for that, we need these different perspectives. We need to see how others think.\n\n18-year-old Rishab Jain was among the students barred from playing with the Marines. He was born in America to Indian parents\u2014a high school senior accepted at Harvard.\n\nRishab Jain: If we're a society that's suppressing art, we're a society that is afraid of what it might reveal about itself. If we're suppressing music, we're suppressing emotions, we're suppressing expression, we're suppressing vulnerability, we're suppressing the very essence of what makes us human. We are devaluing our own humanity. We are degrading our own humanity.\n\n60 Minutes\n\nScott Pelley: You don't seem to believe in limitations.\n\nRishab Jain: Absolutely not.\n\nThere were no limitations but talent, last year, when Rishab Jain and about 60 others, nationwide, posted auditions for the Marines to judge. Zakyya McClenny uploaded her clarinet from Pennsylvania.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you think you were gonna be chosen?\n\nZakyya McClenny: Yes!\n\nScott Pelley: You have a lot of confidence.\n\nZakyya McClenny: I do.\n\nScott Pelley: Why did you think you were gonna be chosen?\n\nZakyya McClenny: I live my life with a lot of confidence.\n\nShe was right. Zakyya was chosen. She and all the contestants had been organized by a Chicago-based nonprofit called Equity Arc, which connects student musicians of color with mentors and opportunities. And here's why \u2014 American orchestras today are 80% White, 11% Asian, 5% Hispanic and 2% Black. No wonder that in 2022, Equity Arc's executive director got an unexpected call.\n\nScott Pelley: The Marines called you?\n\nStanford Thompson: Yes.\n\nThey called Stanford Thompson to ask how the band could reach out to musicians of color. It's part of the band's mission to educate youth.\n\nStanford Thompson: So in that phone call with the Marine Band I shared with them a lot of ideas, a lot that we have learned as an organization. And when I got off the phone, it was just-- it was crazy. It was, like, \"Wait. Let me call this guy back, because I should be offering a way or some ideas that Equity Arc and the Marine Band could work together.\" We identified this high school age, this pre-college age where a lot of musicians of color drop off. We came up with the idea of, \"Can we bring a select group that we would audition through a competitive process to Washington to be able to spend a couple of days with the band?\"\n\nStanford Thompson 60 Minutes\n\nThe 'couple of days' were supposed to look like this. Top music students, like Zakaya McClenny, learning from the best.\n\nTheir wind symphony was set for this May 4th. Until President Trump's executive order banning programs for diversity.\n\nPresident Trump: We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer!\n\nThe president says he is building a \"color blind, merit based\" society --a reaction to what many saw as progressive politics gone too far. His order was comprehensive, calling diversity programs \"illegal and immoral discrimination\" and an \"immense public waste.\"\n\nBut that executive order is just the beginning. All across the government, President Trump is rolling back 60 years of discrimination protections for women, older Americans, the disabled and people of color.\n\nTrump rescinded President Johnson's 1965 ban on employment bias. He closed the Social Security Office of Civil Rights and fired leaders of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, which investigates bias in the workplace.\n\nCari Dominguez: I think we're at a pivotal moment in our society. And we have to make a decision as to which way do we want to go.\n\nCari Dominguez chaired the EEOC for George W. Bush. Her family fled Cuba when she was 12.\n\nScott Pelley: The argument behind the executive order is that America has eliminated racism, that no one in this country is held back by race any longer.\n\nCari Dominguez: The data would not support that.\n\nThe data, Dominguez told us, shows that the EEOC handles around 100,000 discrimination claims from Americans each year.\n\nScott Pelley: The executive order calls the kinds of programs that you used to enforce quote, \"immoral.\"\n\nCari Dominguez: I believe what is immoral is to deny people opportunities. I have witnessed individuals who have beautiful resumes. And they get an interview. They come in, you know, using a wheelchair, and all of a sudden the opportunity is gone. Denying people opportunities because of that lack of fairness is immor-- that's the immoral part.\n\nCari Dominguez 60 Minutes\n\nFairness aside, in this email the Marine Band's commanding officer wrote Equity Arc's Stan Thompson, \"as long as the executive order is in place, we will not be able to reschedule.\" \"I am really sorry to be the bearer of this news.\"\n\nStanford Thompson: My first thought was helplessness in a way and heartbreak.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you have the sense that the concert was canceled because of the color of your skin?\n\nRishab Jain: Absolutely. I mean, I couldn't think of another reason really. I had prepared. I had done everything I could to be at the top. And being Indian, I thought, yeah, what other reason would there be?\n\nAny questions were answered this past week. The students gathered in Washington for rehearsals and the performance. 60 Minutes did what we often do, covered costs of plane tickets and travel to bring all of our interviewees to one place. Equity Arc decided to book the rehearsal space and the concert hall and try to replace the absent marine band\u2014which turned out to be easy.\n\nJohn Abbracciamento: I just felt like, well, there's usually two responses to something. You can complain about it, or you could do something about it. I chose the latter within seconds. And it was the easiest decision ever.\n\nEasy for, John Abbracciamento and Jennifer Marotta, retired Marine Band trumpeters.\n\nScott Pelley: Marines follow orders. They don't have to like them. What do you think the members of the band think of all of this?\n\nJohn Abbracciamento: I know them like the back of my hand. So, I don't think it's too much for me to go out on a limb to say how disappointed they were.\n\nWith the active-duty Marines ordered to stand down, Equity Arc reached out to retirees who answered the call from everywhere, former band members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Westpoint, the Naval Academy and the Marines. Jennifer Marotta flew, on her dime, from LA.\n\nJennifer Marotta: When I got that email, I looked at my schedule and I said, \"I can move all of those things.\" I booked a flight. It was literally one week ago, and I'm here.\n\nJohn Abbracciamento: I challenge anyone, literally, anyone to come to me and say by having this concert does damage to the United States. It doesn't. It brings out the best of us.\n\nJohn Abbracciamento 60 Minutes\n\nScott Pelley: You were not meant to be here today. This ensemble was not meant to be heard. And I wonder what this moment on this stage means to your heart.\n\nSean Mouzon: My name is Sean Mouzon, I'm here from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm a junior at Southwest DeKalb High School. One thing that units us all, is this, music. I'm here because I love it. No other reason than all these amazing, talented people. And I don't want this to be taken away from anybody because of someone else's personal opinion or just anything else besides why we like to do this.\n\nVanessa Cabrera: My name is Vanessa Cabrera, I'm from Rockaway, New Jersey. We work hard to be here. We belong here. We have the talent to be here, and this is not just for us but for children and just people in the same situation that we are, that nobody can tell you what to do, if you put your mind to something that you can accomplish that.\n\nRicardo Lazaro: My name is Ricardo Lazaro. I'm from San Antonio, Texas. I just want the world to be a better place. But it seems like we're slowly straying away from that. And we gotta make a change. And I believe everyone here is capable of doing that. But are we gonna do it?\n\nJulie Angelis Boehler: My name is Julie Angelis Boehler. I retired after 23 years as the timpanist of the U.S. Army Band, Pershing's Own. We need all of this, not just musically. Athletically, academically, we need diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thank you very much.\n\nThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds. Here, tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions. At the podium, Rodney Dorsey of Florida State University conducting \"Gallop\" by Dimitri Shostakovich\u2014in the hands of a band that looks like America.\n\nProduced by Nicole Young and Kristin Steve. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim. Edited by Warren Lustig.\n\nEditor's note: Last month Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, announced it was modifying some of its own DEI policies. The company said the changes were intended to comply with the shift in federal guidelines under the new presidential administration."

Russia's Vladimir Putin responds to a U.S. cease-fire proposal in Ukraine. Plus, the U.S. launches military strikes throughout Yemen.\n\nAmerican bombs rained down on dozens of Iran-backed Houthi militant targets in Yemen Saturday in an attack ordered by President Trump. How long will this campaign last and what kind of a response should we expect from Tehran? Secretary of State Marco Rubio will join us exclusively.\n\nPlus:\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I'm getting, from the standpoint about a cease-fire and ultimately a deal, some pretty good vibes coming out of Russia.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff is back from Russia and his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Is there a chance for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine? We will ask him.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham will also join us.\n\nAnd, finally, Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore weighs in on the impact of cuts to the federal payroll, and Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell on the ripple effects of Trump's trade war with some of America's closest partners.\n\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nAs we come on the air, U.S. forces are in the midst of President Trump's most significant military campaign thus far in his second term.\n\nLet's get straight to it this morning with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida.\n\nMr. Secretary, for our audience, just to explain, this Red Sea area is a really important transit point for global shipping. The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last and will it involve ground forces?\n\nMARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane. And in the last year- and-a-half, last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States, attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times. And 145 times, they have attacked commercial shipping.\n\nSo we basically have a band of pirates with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot.\n\nAnd so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those strikes were retaliation strikes. So they launch one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one-off.\n\nThis is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping. And it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way. It's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here. And it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before. The Biden administration didn't do that.\n\nAll the Biden administration would do is, they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And it could\u2026\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, this will continue until that's finished.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I have heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now.\n\nI can tell you that, as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us. And I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing. And that will continue.\n\nLook, it's \u2013 bottom line, easy way to understand it, OK, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They have attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They have attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis, as you know.\n\nPut this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations.\n\nHave you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it, 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about.\n\nWhat we can't ignore and the reason why the president mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They have provided them intelligence. They have provided them guidance. They have provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, OK, the Houthis, would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran.\n\nAnd so this was a message to Iran. Don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships, in attacking global shipping.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to.\n\nBut I want to ask you about tariffs, because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back and forth the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini-trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs, on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them.\n\nSo here's the way everyone needs to understand this, OK? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War.\n\nBut now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low-wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us?\n\nSo what the president is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability. And the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States.\n\nThe second is global. And that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global \u2013 it's not against Canada. It's not against Mexico. It's not against the E.U. It's everybody.\n\nAnd then, from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness. But, right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements potentially with countries so that our trade is fair.\n\nWhat's not going to continue is \u2013 of course, these countries are upset.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral not free trade \u2013 not North American free trade deals?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, it's not leverage.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Renegotiation?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there we can work on deals and so forth because they will have products we don't make. We have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best.\n\nIt has to be free, but it has to be fair in that country. And, right now, it's only free on one side and it's not fair for the other side.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, sir\u2026\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's an unsustainable position.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pullbacks are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week.\n\nSo I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seemed to negotiate \u2013 you say this was national security-minded.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But then we also see comments by the president of like 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States. That seems more emotional.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that means \u2013 that's called retaliation. That's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on \u2013 they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine.\n\nThen we will have to find something to \u2013 I mean, you tell me. I mean, Canada's going after whiskey and orange juice. And, I mean\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference?\n\nThe point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them. They like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo. And then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides.\n\nBut what we have now cannot continue. We have deindustrialized this country, deindustrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a Rust Belt. That's why we have suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability to other places.\n\nThat cannot and will not continue.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know \u2013 President Trump. This is no mystery. He's been talking about this since the 1980s, actually, even before he was a political figure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia.\n\nYou said Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a cease-fire or whether Putin is using a delay tactic. You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think that was a promising meeting. As I have said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully, we will have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, The exchange was promising.\n\nI don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front with a lot of complexity to it. So, no one's claiming that it's easy.\n\nBut I want everyone to understand here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop, so that we can move to plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not \u2013 maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and that respects everybody's needs and so forth.\n\nNo one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end to a war as long as they're shooting at each other.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so the president wants a cease-fire, and that's what we're working on.\n\nAssuming we can get that done \u2013 and that won't be easy in and of itself \u2013 we move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue.\n\nThe president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We will talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff.\n\nI want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Board writes: \"The administration needs to be careful it's targeting real promoters of terrorism, not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\"\n\nCan you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism specifically to Hamas from this Columbia student? Or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, not just the student. We're going to do more. In fact, we \u2013 every day now, we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well.\n\nAnd here's why. It's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist or what have you. And, in it, you have to make certain assertions. And if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America.\n\nIt's that simple. So you lied. You came \u2013 if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straightforward.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But is there any \u2013 but is there any evidence of a link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Sure. Yes, they take over \u2013 I mean, do you not \u2013 I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges. Well, then you should know that this is\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking about the specific justification for the revocation of his visa. Was there any evidence of material support for terrorism?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson, was the negotiator on \u2013 negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime, in and of itself, that they're involved and being a negotiator, the spokesperson, this, that, the other.\n\nWe don't want \u2013 we don't need these people in our country. We never should have allowed him in, in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library \u2013 the buildings being vandalized, we never would have let him in.\n\nWe never would have let him in to begin with.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave. And so are others. And we're going to keep doing it.\n\nWe are\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: To\u2026\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And, by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas sympathizers\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. they had no problem, OK, pressuring social media to censor American political speech.\n\nSo I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this. If you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. And now that we know it, you're going to leave.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas revoked or are other points of view as well?\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor \u2013 look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members.\n\nThey're terrorists too. I \u2013 we \u2013 the president designated them\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 asked me to designate, and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well.\n\nYou \u2013 we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people \u2013 we don't want people in our country that are going to be\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know what we have gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Secretary Rubio, I'd like to have you back, talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.\n\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who joins us this morning from Miami Beach.\n\nWelcome back to Face the Nation, Ambassador.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a cease-fire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin.\n\nI wonder what your answer to the question is in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a cease-fire.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret.\n\nAnd I agree with the secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was \u2013 it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics. And I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration and where we are today.\n\nWe have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect Presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision-making call, or is this just next steps?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would assume that they have a \u2013 they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They have talked already after the first visit that I had with President Putin.\n\nAnd I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision-maker, our decision-maker, and President Putin for the country of Russia is their decision-maker.\n\nI think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's \u2013 that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a \u2013 an inclination on \u2013 on the part of both countries, and, by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long-term, durable peace here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's president publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting.\n\nWe saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 look, I don't \u2013 I don't know what President Macron said.\n\nI think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have necessarily firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said.\n\nI know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to \u2013 to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000-kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing \u2013 shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000-mile border.\n\nThat's a very, very complicated cease-fire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I \u2013 I regard as promising.\n\nI think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near-term peace agreement.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, beyond the cease-fire, a peace agreement? you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 what I \u2013 what I'm saying, the technical \u2013 what I'm saying is that a cease-fire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border. That's \u2013 that's 1,200 miles.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions.\n\nWe've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to \u2013 to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement.\n\nThere's \u2013 there's just \u2013 there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a cease-fire here. And I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined space as compared to the \u2013 the battle \u2013 where the battle is being fought in Ukraine-Russia.\n\nSo this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza.\n\nI want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the two million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt. You've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans and, by the way, for the people of Israel.\n\nSo we're exploring all of those things. But, right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab summit, where we spent 7.5 hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging.\n\nNow, to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen \u2013 that's a red line for the Israelis \u2013 and maybe could have led to a long-term peace resolution here.\n\nAnd yet Hamas \u2013 Hamas came up with their own construct\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: \u2026 essentially disavowed what we discussed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: And, to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSTEVE WITKOFF: And I \u2013 I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.\n\nAmbassador Witkoff, thank you for your time today.\n\nWe'll be back with more Face the Nation.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss an interview or a full episode of Face the Nation, you can go back and watch it on FacetheNation.com or on YouTube. Just search Face the Nation for our page.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nations, so stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe turn now to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who joins us this morning from Clemson, South Carolina.\n\nWelcome back.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir. And I - I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these - in this past week. Certainly a lot of action.\n\nI looked at the last time we spoke. You were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said, there's a one in trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy. Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't mind negotiating, as long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So, I think there is a one in trillion chance the ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region.\n\nYes, I think he - I think he's a fanatical, religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him. And if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60 percent. He has enough to make six bombs at 60 percent. So, turn that all over to the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business and we'll help you with your nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long - that's a long to-do list. And so far no - no indication that he's taking the offer.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Not really. He's - if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.\n\nWe did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do - you heard the secretary of state.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Ambassador Witkoff.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know yet. But I do know you play President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So, if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two, ceasefire and peace deal.\n\nWhat I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine or not. If you're not, go back to maximum pressure.\n\nI have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy. And I'm willing to move forward if I have to. But we're talking about a ceasefire and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But, to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting but 30 years of action. And I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have -\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gets from the discussions that Witkoff had. Who, I like Steve, and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing.\n\nI think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the - to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large.\n\nI hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: To engage in a ceasefire and to find a win/win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the U.S. decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I don't know what value these - these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the voice of America really is, Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War. People told us that. So, that's something to consider, is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, you had been an advocate for soft power.\n\nI want to ask you about what's happening here at home.\n\nThere were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The president suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington and Burling as well because they were involved in representing former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you support this?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think all of these things - I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax - a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6th was politically motivated. And people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict - you know, when Biden took - took -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this lawful?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this good for the U.S. legal system, Senator, because\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president's trying to use government power to punish private business because he didn't like some of the work they had been doing.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, private business aided government power in a - in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life.\n\nYou know, on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family. That they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him politically and personally. I believe that. And if these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame. That's what I believe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But these are lawyers working on cases that - you're making it sound like the work they take on is somehow part of a conspiracy and they should be punished for it.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think - I think these law firms were pushing legal theories that, to me, were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes.\n\nYou know, I - we can have a debate about, you know, holding a lawyer accountable for his client's actions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I genuinely don't like that. But these - but these law firms -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's what this sounds like.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And Jack Smith using the power of government, incorporating these law firms, in my - in my view, were trying to disrupt and take down the Republican nominee for president. That this was an orchestrated effort and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So, it was politically motivated. And everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I know, since you're on the Judiciary Committee, and -\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And my answer is not going to change -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And have that oversight. It's important to get your point of view, but I've got to leave it there for today.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.\n\nGood to have you here and a happy early St. Patrick's Day.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Top of the morning to you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, I want to talk about the impact of these tariffs and potential tariffs because you're from the manufacturing hub of Michigan.\n\nWe were looking at the data. Michigan's lost more than 220,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. The vice president was out in Michigan this week. He says this is \u2013 this entire Trump strategy is about industrial resurgence. Is that landing where you live?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, I'm somebody that answers this differently than many. I believe that tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. And if you'll recall, I said Donald Trump would win in 2016, and nobody believed me. And I was right. And it was one issue. It was trade. NAFTA was one of the worst pieces of trade legislation in the history of this country. It sent tons of jobs overseas. And President Trump came in. I worked with him. We renegotiated it. We have the USMCA.\n\nThe way that the tariffs are being done now is - it's made a ping-pong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at. We need to using them against China. But I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying. There's no way that in a month's time, when they have such an integrated inventory and production plan - production plants where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen.\n\nSo, I want to work with this administration. I think the 25 percent tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. Autos are a ping-pong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We needed industrial policy. Tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a way that lets everybody plan for it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the big three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2nd push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion.\n\nDo you have any idea how long it would take to build the kind of plants and to bring all the manufacturing home, like President Trump is asking of them?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, if everything were go right, which, like in this world does anything ever go right, it's going to take two to three years. Our - our suppliers, also, there are many - and, by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Next -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You support this idea. Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral, not North America as a globe -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Totally. I totally - Canada would never let China build a plant in China and then market it as a North American vehicle. And we need to make sure that that never happens. I'm totally on board on that.\n\nBut right now, as we're talking about the aluminum and the steel tariffs, two - 60 percent of aluminum in this country - that's being used is be - coming in from Canada. You take a 25 percent tariff on that, the profit on automobiles is - is very small. It's not a big - the companies just can't eat that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But we've got to figure it out. I am not against trade policy. We just have to do it in a way that doesn't - I - I don't believe Donald Trump wants to destroy the domestic auto industry. I think we all got to work together to keep the domestic auto industry strong. And even as we're doing Canada and Mexico, do you realize that Korea and Japan are still able - they brought 2.5 million vehicles in to - Korea, with no tariff, and Japan with 2.5, not treating everybody equally.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: S&P global says there's potential for North American auto production to drop by 20,000 units a day starting this week. That's because of the tariffs. So, it's - it's having a -\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: All companies need certainty. Automobiles need certainly. They need to not be a ping-pong ball.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking to the commerce secretary or the trade representative? Is there any conversation?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I have not talked to the commerce secretary. I've talked to Bob Lighthizer, who I worked very closely with in -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The former advisor.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: The former trade advisor. And I worked very closely with President Trump in - in - I totally -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I said he would win. Democrats did a lousy job on trade and that - MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of Democrats and their performance, I want to ask you, what happened this past week. We came near a shutdown. Ultimately, Democrats, in the Senate, did vote with Republicans on this short-term funding deal.\n\nSenator Murphy of Connecticut was on another network this morning, and he said, \"it would have been a risk to shut down the government, but it was probably worth taking.\"\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: You know -\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Well, in the House, we were almost united, except one, and there were very strong feelings in the House about what people thought that the Senate should do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the Senate - the Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, would say, you were able to do that because there was wiggle room on votes. The Republicans voted as a bloc.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But I - I think he sent out mixed signals.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Schumer did?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I think - Senator Schumer sent out mixed signals. And I talked to a lot of laborers last week. AFGE, who's employees were going to be impacted the most, were very torn about what to do because concerned about their employees. Who I'm meeting with daily when I'm out there. Came out against supporting it because they felt like they were already being harmed. There was already just the license for DOGE to go ahead and do whatever it wants. They're not including Congress, not abiding with - people are being hurt.\n\nBut, Margaret, people are angry. We're got to move on. Reconciliation is coming up. We have got to be united as Democrats in making sure reconciliation and we protect people from having their health care cut, Medicaid cut, Social Security cut, or Medicare cut, in any way, shape, or form?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can Leader Jeffries actually maintain that kind of unity in the House?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: He showed you that he could do it last week. And I can tell you that when you - I don't think anybody has been home. If you're home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I'm not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mean people are shouting? People are angry? People are upset?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: They want to see Democrats fighting back. And they're really scared about what's going to happen to them. Particularly on - seniors and - I was in - went to my asthma doctor, and a woman in a wheelchair with her child started crying with me in the hospital, what are you going to do so my child can still come here?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, thank you. We'll have to leave it there for today.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, who joins us this morning from Annapolis.\n\nWelcome back to FACE THE NATION.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-MD): Thank you. Great to be back.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have, in your state, the Port of Baltimore. One of the country's largest ports. The president has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2nd is poised to enact 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these - of these - of these disastrous and frankly not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology. But this administration is using it like an ideology. And so, while these decisions are being made - made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore. It's also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impact on our farmers over in the eastern shore, on our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this - and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on cost. It's having very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses. It's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitive, as well as our national security. And so, these are the type of things, this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about and we are now seeing in real time in our states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1,300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally, and is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean then you look at the - at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's - it's either ineffective, it is performative, or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all of these executive actions are falling under.\n\nAnd the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the president of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally.\n\nAnd so, when we talk about the different tools that we have, just in the past week alone, you know, I signed - I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises because, on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department. And while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, D.C., out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a liberal state, and he said he's going to stop it.\n\nI know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Here - here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is - is - that they - that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives.\n\nAnd so - so the thing that we know about this is, this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place - and we've gone - we went through this process not just for these past couple years since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland - where Maryland won this - this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitively, where we showed that we could be at a place that it was the only site ready place to build, build ready site. So, the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the president has just decided to politicize it by talking about, but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you called him? Have you called the White House?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've tried calling the White House before and - and there - there's - there's no response. And - and, frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break. I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it? But you believe it?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Do I believe the announcement?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, I believe that the president thinks he has the authority to do this. But I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the president does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. And so, I believe the president of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there's a king of king and a lord of lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here. And you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do.\n\nYou also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but - but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering.\n\nYou know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continued resolution, where - where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people.\n\nAnd so I think, when one - when the American people, when they do not have an option or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then, yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. We are doing everything in our power to fight for the people. And I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who offered alternatives, they just weren't listened to. Do you think there's just no leader in the party?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I don't - I don't see a difference. I don't - I don't see a difference.\n\nAnd, frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interests, I think for the American people they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing. The performative politics, people are done, and they're exhausted by it. They just want to see results. And that's exactly what we're trying to provide in the state of Maryland.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week.\n\nFor FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)"

He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.\n\nRubio said after the arrest that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\n\nOn Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"\n\n\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"\n\nThe secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"\n\n\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" March 16, 2025. CBS News\n\nNeither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nA top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nRubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"\n\nMore broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.\n\nAsked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"\n\n\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\""

That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\n\nPresident Trump announced the strikes Saturday, saying the U.S. would use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis cease shipping attacks. U.S. Central Command confirmed the strike in a social media post Saturday, and it's prepared to extend the campaign on the Houthis from the air and the sea for potentially weeks depending on reaction from the Houthis and Iran, a U.S. official told CBS News.\n\nU.S. fighter aircraft shot down about 11 drones the Houthis launched over the course of several hours Sunday morning local time, a U.S. official said. The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S. Truman, the official said.\n\nMr. Trump in January signed an executive order re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. Mr. Trump had designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization in Jan. 2021, but former President Joe Biden removed the designation shortly afterward due to limitations it would place on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, although the Biden administration went on to label the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terror Group\" in 2024.\n\nSaturday's strikes came as the Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit in an important Red Sea transit point for global shipping for months, and the group said earlier this week that it would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza. The U.S., Israel and the United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Rubio said that while the Biden administration responded to previous attacks with retaliatory strikes, the new strikes are \"not a one-off.\"\n\n\"This is not a message,\" Rubio said. \"This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping.\"\n\nThe secretary of state said that over the last 18 months, the Houthis have \"struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States,\" along with 145 attacks on commercial shipping.\n\n\"So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world,\" Rubio said. \"That's just not sustainable.\"\n\nAsked how long the campaign will last, Rubio said it will continue until the Houthis \"no longer have the capability to do that.\" He also acknowledged that he's heard no talk of ground raids so far and doesn't think there's \"a necessity for it right now.\"\n\nRubio said as of Saturday night, \"some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us,\" adding that \"some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue.\"\n\n\"We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy,\" Rubio said. \"It's not going to happen. Not under President Trump.\""

Welcome back to Face the Nation.\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: Thank you. Great to be back.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have in your state the Port of Baltimore, one of the country's largest ports.

They're not an ideology, but this administration is using it like an ideology. And so while the decisions are being made- made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore, which is really one of these country- one of the country's largest and most effective ports. It's the largest port for roll-on, roll-off vehicles. It is also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impacts on our farmers over in the Eastern Shore and our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this- and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on costs, it's having a very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses, it's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitiveness, as well as our national security, and so these are the type of things- this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about, and we are now seeing in real time in our states.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1300 workers at the Education Department.

And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the President of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally. And so when we talk about the different tools that we have- just in this past week alone, you know, I signed- I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises. Because on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA. That just this past week, I have focused on things like lowering prescription drugs costs and actually creating partnerships with the private sector to lower prescription drug costs, that we're working on legislation right now to increase housing inventory that can bring housing prices down, and that is all in- that is all contrary to what we're seeing from the federal government. So the legal tool in working with our Attorney General closely to be able to file suit when the federal government oversteps his bounds is one tool, but we are going to use every tool at our disposal to make sure that the people of Maryland are protected, and we're making sure we're putting extra resources and money back into their pockets.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department, and while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, DC out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a \"liberal state,\" and he said he's going to stop it. I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: Here's- here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is- is that they- that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives and so- so the thing that we know about this this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place and we've gone- we went through this process, not just for these past couple years, since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland- where Maryland won this- this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitatively, where we showed that we could be the place that it was the only site-ready place to build, build-ready site. That we're the place that we could actually have national security assets that they could leverage, particularly when you're talking about the future mission of the FBI, which a lot of it is cyber. That we were the only place that had transportation assets that were close and nearby, that the workers could be able to benefit from. And the place that could get it done cheapest to the American taxpayer by talking about putting it anywhere else, you're talking about adding over a billion dollars in costs to the American taxpayer than what we have already gone through this process with the GSA, the General Service Administration for the state of Maryland. So the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the President has just decided to politicize it by talking about- but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Have you called him? Have you called the White House?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: We tried calling the White House before, and there's- there's- there's no response. And frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break\u2013\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe it?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: The announcement?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: Well, I believe that the President thinks he has the authority to do this, but I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the President does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. It's the GSA that made the decision that the new FBI building should be going to the state of Maryland, after going through a thorough and a very transparent process. And so I believe the President of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there is a King of Kings and a Lord of Lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here, and you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do. You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but- but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age? Or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?\n\nGOV. MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering. You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continuing resolution where- where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland, that we would have not only seen our economy completely downturn into- into a recession, that we would have seen our nation's credit being downgraded, and along those lines, each and every one of us as states, our credit would have been downgraded as well because The United States decided that it's now no longer paying its bills. And we would have seen thousands of federal workers unfairly now being laid off or furloughed. So we know the consequences. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people. And so I think when the American people, when they do not have an option, or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. So we've got to do everything in our power. I know in the state of Maryland, we are mobilizing to make sure we're protecting our federal workers, that we're streamlining them into not just private sector jobs, but also state jobs that are open and available. That we're making sure we're increasing our unemployment insurance, and we are doing things like lowering the price of prescription drugs, and we're doing things like increasing housing inventory, which is going to decrease the housing price. We're doing everything in our power to fight for the people, and I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who awful- offered alternatives. They just weren't listened to. Do you think there is just no leader--\n\nGOV. MOORE: I don't see a difference--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in the party?\n\nGOV. MOORE: I don't- I don't see a difference. And frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interest, I think for the American people, they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing, the performative politics. People are done, and they are exhausted by it. They just want to see results, and that's exactly what we're trying to provide here in the state of Maryland.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.\n\nGOV. MOORE: Thank you."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nHundreds of mostly Venezuelan alleged gang members were deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador on Sunday, with the Trump administration invoking wartime powers to speed up removals despite a court ruling halting the move.\n\nIn the latest dramatic showdown between the White House and the judiciary, a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s ability to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act on Saturday evening, and verbally ordered any planes in the air carrying some of those migrants to turn back to the US.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg said the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days \u201cor until further order of the court.\u201d One person familiar with the matter said the planes were already in the air at the time of the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cParticularly given the plaintiffs\u2019 information, unrebutted by the government, that flights are actively departing and planning to depart, I do not believe that I\u2019m able to wait any longer,\u201d said US District Judge James Boasberg during the hearing. \u201cAny plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.\u201d\n\nBut on Sunday night, President Donald Trump defended his use of the Act, telling reporters on board Air Force One: \u201cI can tell you this, these were bad people. That was a bad group of, as I say, hombres.\u201d\n\nPrevious use of the Aliens Enemies Act has taken place during times of war, but Trump argued that \u201cthis was a time of war\u201d and an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants and criminals \u2013 repeating his past claims about the Biden administration\u2019s handling of immigration.\n\nWhen asked whether his government had violated the judge\u2019s order, Trump replied: \u201cYou\u2019d have to speak to the lawyers about that.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said Sunday that the administration did not violate the judge\u2019s order because it was issued after the migrants in question had left the US.\n\n\u201cThe Administration did not \u2018refuse to comply\u2019 with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,\u201d Leavitt said in a statement, insisting there was no conflict between the administration\u2019s actions and the written order.\n\n\u201cA single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,\u201d she added.\n\nLeavitt said earlier Sunday that at the president\u2019s direction, the Department of Homeland Security had arrested nearly 300 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua over the weekend. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that \u201chundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country,\u201d and thanked El Salvador\u2019s President, Nayib Bukele, for offering to imprison the deportees.\n\nHe added that Bukele had requested that two leaders of the MS-13 gang, as well as 21 other Salvadorans being held in the US be returned to \u201cface justice in their homeland.\u201d\n\nBukele announced on X Sunday morning that the alleged Tren de Aragua members have arrived in El Salvador and been transferred to the Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT, \u201cfor a period of one year.\u201d His post included video of men being led off of buses in handcuffs and having their heads shaved.\n\nTrump, on Truth Social, thanked the Salvadorian leader for accepting the deportees hours later.\n\nCooperation between the two leaders has been a possibility for some time. CNN previously reported that Erik Prince, a Trump ally, has been in contact with Bukele since last year about accepting undocumented migrants from the US if Trump was elected.\n\nThe US will pay $6 million to El Salvador to house the deportees. The money, according to Bukele, will help sustain the penitentiary system, which currently costs $200 million annually. He added that the action will help law enforcement gather intelligence and apprehend more members of MS-13.\n\nBukele also appeared to make light of the incident early Sunday morning. Sharing a screenshot of an article about the Saturday ruling, he wrote on X, \u201cOopsie\u2026too late.\u201d Rubio later shared Bukele\u2019s post on his own page.\n\nDeportation flights weren\u2019t in the air long before judges order\n\nBoasberg had initially blocked the administration from deporting five individuals who challenged Trump\u2019s use of the act. Following a hastily scheduled hearing hours later, Boasberg broadened that temporary block, granting a request from the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to cover all noncitizens in US custody who would be subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation.\n\nSenior White House officials convened late Saturday with other administration officials to discuss how to proceed once Boasberg ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act could not proceed, and ultimately determined not to order the deportation planes to turn around, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe planes had not been in the air very long when the judge issued his ruling, the person said.\n\nLeavitt\u2019s assertion that there was no conflict between the administration\u2019s actions and the judge\u2019s \u201cwritten order\u201d appears carefully crafted to exclude the judge\u2019s directive that planes be turned around \u2014 which he issued verbally from the bench.\n\nVerbal orders hold the same legal weight as written directives, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig told CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d Sunday. The big question, Honig explained, was where the planes were when the order was given.\n\n\u201cCould the judge have ordered them to turn around mid-flight while they had already left US territory? There\u2019s at least some gray area there. There\u2019s at least a fig leaf for the administration to use,\u201d he added.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi and other top DOJ officials argued in a Sunday afternoon filing that \u201csome gang members\u201d were deported between Boasberg\u2019s two orders on Saturday after his Alien Enemies Act proclamation. They added that the five plaintiffs from the first order have not been removed.\n\nCarl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said he believes it\u2019s possible the Trump administration defied the court based on Boasberg\u2019s statements on Saturday, though it is still unclear when exactly the planes took off.\n\nIf Boasberg determines that there was, in fact, a \u201cclear violation\u201d of his order, Tobias explained that the judge could issue a stricter order laying out how exactly the administration should be complying with his guidance. If the administration were to defy that order, violators could be held in either civil or criminal contempt, Tobias added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has threatened to defy court orders, Tobias said this case stands out due to its implications for the country\u2019s standing on the world stage.\n\n\u201cThis move, it seems to me, is one of the few orders that that does raise all kinds of questions about national security, as do some of the others, but also about how the United States conducts its business in the world, and so I think it is somewhat more far reaching,\u201d Tobias explained, adding that Boasberg has demonstrated that he is \u201csensitive\u201d to providing due process for the alleged criminals that have been deported.\n\nGOP Sen. Mike Rounds said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he expects the executive branch is following the law, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper \u201cwe don\u2019t know if that happened that way\u201d when pressed on if he\u2019s concerned that the Trump administration potentially violated the court order.\n\n\u201cI think most Americans are going to say, \u2018I don\u2019t care how old the law is, if you can use it to get these guys out and keep my family safe, we\u2019re going to do it,\u2019\u201d the South Dakota Republican added.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday that Democrats \u201cstand strongly in support of the rule of law\u201d in reference to the judge\u2019s order, and warned against the potential impacts of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive deportation strategy.\n\n\u201cAll of us within the Democratic Party, we oppose illegal immigration,\u201d he said MSNBC. \u201cBut we also can\u2019t go down this road that the Trump administration is taking us on and potentially deport American citizens, deport legal and lawful permanent residents and break up law abiding immigrant families who are contributing to this country.\u201d\n\nCecot prison in El Salvador\n\nWith capacity for 40,000 inmates, Cecot is the largest prison in the Americas and a symbol of El Salvador\u2019s brutal crackdown on crime.\n\nIt is also notorious for the ruthless way it has treated prisoners, which human rights organizations say is inhumane and violates human rights. Between 10,000 and 20,000 inmates have been locked up there. There is no privacy, comfort or any indication that the prisoners will ever be released.\n\nCNN visited the prison late last year and saw inmates locked up in crowded cells, with some holding 80 people or so. They slept in metal bunks with no mattresses, sheets or pillows. They had an open toilet, a cement basin and plastic bucket for washing, and a large jug for drinking water. The men were inside these cells for 23\u00bd hours a day. They had a 30-minute daily break to leave the cell for the central hallway for group exercise or Bible readings.\n\nCritics have also pointed out that under the nationwide crackdown on crime in El Salvador, some constitutional rights like due process have been suspended. More than 80,000 people have been arrested throughout the country, accounting for more than 1% of the Salvadoran population. Bukele has admitted that some innocent people have been detained by mistake and that several thousand of them have already been released. He and many of his supporters argue that such collateral damage is part of the difficult process of transforming the country from being the \u201cmurder capital of the world\u201d to one of the safest.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report."

Joe Lieberman\u2019s unexpected death in 2024, a time in Jewish tradition when family members recite the mourners\u2019 kaddish prayer and light candles in memory of their loved one.\n\nThose of us who knew Joe Lieberman continue to mourn his passing and miss his smile and decency. When we have gathered at memorial services and early screenings of \"Centered,\" a new documentary which chronicles his life, we always express the wish that there were more leaders like him in today\u2019s harsh political environment. (\"Centered\" will be in Regal Cinemas nationwide on March 18 and 19.)\n\nThat yearning for comity was accentuated by the partisan atmosphere in the House of Representatives for President Donald Trump\u2019s recent address to a joint session of Congress. We could debate which party or its leaders are more guilty of polluting the public square these days, but that would defeat the purpose of arguing for better behavior from both sides. The political divide (a worrisome \"gulf of America\") leaves us inches away from stalemate, and mere feet from chaos.\n\nWhile Joe Lieberman can no longer speak up on behalf of civility in politics, he left us plenty of examples:\n\nMY FATHER WAS SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN. HIS LAST WORDS ARE WHAT WE NEED TO HEAR RIGHT NOW\n\nWhen he gave the Democratic response to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s last radio address in 1989, Lieberman did not abuse the opportunity to settle political scores. \"Your love of this country and your fervent devotion to freedom inspired us all,\" the new Democratic senator said of the Republican president.\n\nIn 1991, rather than join most Democrats to oppose the use of force after Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, Lieberman became the lead Democratic co-sponsor of the resolution authorizing the first (and successful) Gulf War.\n\nWorking across the aisle with senators like John McCain, Lieberman advocated for the 9/11 Commission to investigate the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, and Arlen Specter for creation of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHe often joined with Republican Sen. Bob Dole in urging both Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton to take a more active role in defending Bosnia from Serbian aggression.\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO REMEMBER ABOUT MY DEAR FRIEND SEN JOE LIEBERMAN\n\nAnd Lieberman collaborated with leaders in both parties to speak out against the plight of inappropriate content in video games, music and television programs, which helped lead to the creation of ratings systems that give parents more power to discern what is best for their children.\n\nThroughout his life, Lieberman\u2019s advocacy of harmony and good will found expression in his fervent support for civil and human rights, from traveling to Mississippi as a student advocating voting rights to his leadership in ending the discriminatory \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\" policy in the military and to his commitment to a cleaner environment (the latter two efforts also involved cross-party cooperation).\n\nThe senator\u2019s many public expressions of cordiality towards people of either or no political party were matched by his behavior in private. As staffers who worked with him beginning more than 45 years ago, through many crises and controversies (rarely of his own making), we can testify to his humor, equanimity and good will. We never heard him raise his voice, even in the most tense and tumultuous of circumstances.\n\nJoe Lieberman\u2019s calm demeanor should not be mistaken for a milquetoast career, however. In the course of the work cited above, and many more, he was friendly, but forthright; decent, but determined.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThanks in good measure to his faith in God and fervent religious beliefs, he had a strong moral compass that almost always pointed him in the right direction for the betterment of society. If he fell short on rare occasions, it was never from base motives or weak principles. He was, in the words of the prophet Isaiah, a \"repairer of the breach,\" not a source of division.\n\nAs nearly lifelong believers in the leadership of Joe Lieberman, we cannot help but feel that America and the world would have been better off if he and Al Gore had succeeded in the 2000 election. But even in the wake of that enormous \u2013 and enormously disappointing \u2013 setback in his life, Lieberman showed the same kind of grace and optimism that characterized his whole life:\n\n\"America is a great country,\" he said on the floor of the Senate the day after Vice President Gore conceded the election to George W. Bush. \"I do think that every one of us should be grateful this morning that here in America we work out our differences not with civil wars, but with spirited elections.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It is time now for all of us to come together in support of these United States and the shared values that have long sustained us,\" he continued. \"Psalm 30 assures us that weeping may linger for the night, but in the morning, there are shouts of joy.\"\n\nOur sorrow over the loss of Joe Lieberman has lingered through the long night of his absence from our lives and politics \u2013 never more than at this yahrzeit of his passing \u2013 but we are encouraged by his stirring words and sterling example to find hope for shouts of joy once again..\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JIM KENNEDY\n\nJim Kennedy is a former spokesman for Joe Lieberman, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, the Clinton Foundation, Sony Pictures, Sony Corporation of America and News Corp.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS military officials believe Russia and China are aggressively testing new offensive space capabilities, pointing to a series of satellite training missions conducted by both countries in recent months as growing evidence of an effort to weaponize outer space.\n\nAs recently as last week, Russian satellites were practicing \u201cattack and defend tactics,\u201d maneuvers intended to increase the proficiency of their space force, according to a US defense official.\n\nUS officials watched multiple Russian satellites work together to surround and isolate another satellite that was positioned in low-Earth orbit, demonstrating how they could potentially target enemy spacecraft in a future conflict, the official added.\n\nRussia\u2019s goal remains to put a nuclear weapon in space, the defense official said. Recent Russian satellite movements also suggest they are actively preparing for a potential armed conflict in space, the official added.\n\n\u201cRussia wants to take away our advantages in space and they don\u2019t care about collateral damage,\u201d the defense official said.\n\nLast year, CNN reported on Russia\u2019s effort to develop a space-based nuclear weapon that would use a massive energy wave, known as an electromagnetic pulse, to potentially knock out a large swath of commercial and government satellites.\n\nIn 2021, Russia also tested an anti-satellite missile that destroyed a Russian satellite, creating a massive debris field in space that forced astronauts on the International Space Station to scramble for safety.\n\nIn this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping attend an official welcoming ceremony in front of the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square in Beijing on May 16, 2024. Sergei Bobylyov/Pool/Sputnik/Getty Images\n\nChina has carried out similar training exercises in space over the last year. In December, Beijing demonstrated advanced capabilities by maneuvering multiple satellites in close formation \u2013 raising concerns about potential military applications.\n\n\u201cThey practiced attack approaches \u2026 those are advanced patrols and advanced tactics,\u201d the official said.\n\nThese co-orbital satellites can directly hit another satellite or disable it, just one of a suite of such technologies that Beijing is developing. China is also developing anti-satellite missiles and directed-energy attacks that use lasers or similar systems to attack other satellites.\n\n\u201cThis is a PLA space force that\u2019s being built, trained and ready to seize the ultimate high ground\u201d from the US, the defense official said.\n\nChina has already shown its rapidly advancing technological prowess in space. The test of a space-launched hypersonic missile in 2021 caught the US by surprise. The top US general at the time called it a \u201cvery significant technological event.\u201d\n\nUS Space Force officials are focused on continuing to develop their own offensive and defensive space capabilities in an effort to ensure neither Russia or China can exploit mobility to gain a military advantage over American assets and conduct a \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d style attack, the official added.\n\n\u201cMobility can lead to breakout,\u201d the official said, pointing to how the Germans took away the mobility of enemy tanks during World War II.\n\nThe US still maintains an advantage over both Russia and China in space, the defense official noted, but both countries are developing new systems to enhance military effectiveness and end any reliance on American technology, according to US Space Force\u2019s intelligence headquarters.\n\nTrump touted the creation of the US Space Force during his first term in office but defense officials stress that increasing competition from Russia and China still poses a national security threat.\n\n\u201cUS needs to be ready to do more than protect and defend in outer space. Stories about playing defense are stories about losing,\u201d the defense official said.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson, right, watches as other nations, including the Soviet Union, signs an international treaty banning weapons in outer space on January 27, 1967, in Washington, DC. Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe US, Russia and China are all signatories to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which bans weapons of mass destruction in space. But with growing concern of an outer space arms race, the treaty appears increasingly like a relic of the past. Last April, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have reaffirmed the opposition to nuclear weapons in outer space.\n\nChina, in particular, has rapidly improved space capabilities that can be used to track and target US military forces, according to US Space Force officials. As of December 2024, China had more than 1,060 satellites in orbit, second only to the United States.\n\nUS Space Force\u2019s intelligence arm has determined that Beijing expects space will play an important role in future conflicts by enabling long-range precision strikes, according to the latest threat assessments.\n\nIn December 2024, China launched a remote sensing satellite that Space Force military officials say could allow it to persistently monitor US and allied forces in the Pacific region.\n\n\u201cIntelligence suggests the PLA likely sees counterspace operations as a means to deter and counter US military intervention in a regional conflict,\u201d according to multiple US Space Force officials.\n\n\u201cMoreover, PLA academics stress the necessity of \u2018destroying, damaging, and interfering with the enemy\u2019s reconnaissance \u2026and communications satellites\u2019 to \u2018blind and deafen the enemy,\u2019\u201d they added.\n\nChina conducted 66 successful space launches in 2024, placing 67 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capable satellites into orbit, according to US Space Force Intelligence Headquarters."

Not under this presidency.\"\n\nTrump appeared to be dressed in golf attire and was wearing his signature red baseball cap with his name emblazoned on the back while watching video of the strikes on a television screen.\n\nAnother photo showed the president from the front with a black headset on.\n\nUS NAVY SHIPS REPEL ATTACK FROM HOUTHIS IN GULF OF ADEN\n\nTrump wrote in a Saturday TRUTHSocial post that he had \"ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen.\"\n\n\"Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists\u2019 bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,\" Trump said. \"No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.\"\n\nU.S. Central Command said Saturday it \"initiated a series of operations consisting of precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen to defend American interests, deter enemies, and restore freedom of navigation.\"\n\nState Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement that Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday.\n\n\"The Secretary informed Russia of U.S. military deterrence operations against the Iran-backed Houthis and emphasized that continued Houthi attacks on U.S. military and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea will not be tolerated,\" Bruce wrote. \"Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov also discussed next steps to follow up on recent meetings in Saudi Arabia and agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia.\"\n\nThe Houthi-run Health Ministry in Yemen said the strikes killed at least 31 people, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly targeted international shipping in the Red Sea and launched missiles and drones at Israel in what the terrorist group said were acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally. The attacks stopped when a fragile Israel-Hamas cease-fire took hold in Gaza in January. The Houthis then threatened to renew them after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month following the Hamas rejection of a U.S. framework for continuing the cease-fire and hostage releases.\n\nThe U.S. and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the Houthis, and the U.S. Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said were bound for the terrorist group, which controls Yemen's capital of Sanaa and the country's north. Gen. Hossein Salami, head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks.\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES 'DECISIVE AND POWERFUL' AIRSTRIKES AGAINST HOUTHI TERRORISTS IN YEMEN\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a post on X, urged the U.S. to halt the strikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.\n\nTrump said, \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.\"\n\nTrump charged that the Houthis \"have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden\u2019s response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going,\" he wrote on TRUTHSocial.\n\nTrump said it has been more than a year since a U.S.-flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden.\n\n\"The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON\u2019T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!\" Trump said.\n\nThe president added, \"To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won\u2019t be nice about it!\"\n\nThe Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023 and January of this year, when the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, according to the AP.\n\nThe U.S., Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Saturday\u2019s operation was conducted solely by the U.S. It was the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt comes two weeks after Trump sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational.\n\nThe Trump administration re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization earlier this month, after the Biden administration had lifted the group's designation in 2021.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nAs President Donald Trump works to dramatically reshape the federal government, he is also in the middle of transforming another historic aspect of the presidency: the Oval Office.\n\nNearly eight weeks since returning to office, Trump has tripled the number of paintings hanging on the office walls. Shelves and surfaces are adorned with flags, statues and ornaments.\n\nAnd in keeping with the style he has adhered to for decades, there is gold everywhere: new gold vermeil figurines on the mantle and medallions on the fireplace, gold eagles on the side tables, gilded Rococo mirrors on the doors, and, nestled in the pediments above the doorways, diminutive gold cherubs shipped in from Mar-a-Lago. Even the remote control for the television down the hall is wrapped in gilt.\n\nHe had even toyed with the idea of hanging a chandelier in the Oval Office, according to two people familiar with his plans, though that seems unlikely now.\n\nTrump meets with Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin in the Oval Office. Behind them are recently added gold medallions on the fireplace and gold vermeil figurines on the mantle. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt all makes for a White House increasingly reminiscent of Trump\u2019s South Florida home. Work is expected to begin within weeks on Trump\u2019s plans to revamp the Rose Garden by paving over the grass and turning it into a patio-style seating area, much like the one where he holds court at Mar-a-Lago. The president personally reviewed the plans for the Rose Garden recently with White House curators.\n\nTrump has discussed his vision for the outdoor space, originally designed by first lady Ellen Wilson, with visiting heads of state as they walk along the South Portico, according to an official in a visiting delegation.\n\nOn the South Lawn, the president hopes to build a new ballroom to host state dinners, modeled after the one at Mar-a-Lago, which in turn was inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. He has reviewed multiple sets of blueprints since taking office, showing them off to visitors and making tweaks to the designs. Trump has long said he\u2019ll pay for the construction himself \u2013 he even offered to build it during the Obama administration \u2013 but it\u2019s still not clear whether the project will proceed on the historic grounds.\n\n\u201cIt keeps my real-estate juices flowing,\u201d Trump told The Spectator recently of the prospective renovations. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be beautiful.\u201d\n\nTrump speaks in the library at Mar-a-Lago on March 4, 2024, in Palm Beach, Florida. Alon Skuy/Getty Images\n\nIt all makes for a most Trump-like workspace, with the president surrounded by far more objects, curiosities and art than the men who preceded him in the office. Never known for a minimalist aesthetic, Trump appears most at home amid all the stuff: trophies, art, papers, memorabilia.\n\nTrump has long seen his office as a showplace as much as a workplace. For decades, his corner suite on the 26th floor of Trump Tower was stuffed with collectibles on the windowsill and tables, with framed photographs and magazine covers donning the walls. The Oval Office, particularly his desk, is far more orderly, yet still reminiscent of the place where he made his fame.\n\nEvery addition to the Oval Office \u2013 no matter how big or small \u2013 comes at his direction, aides say, as he seeks to remake the space as he sees fit.\n\nThe Oval Office is the predominant power center of any administration, but since Trump returned two months ago, the room has become one of the most visible in the White House. He uses it to hold forth with visiting foreign leaders, including the remarkably hostile session with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as a venue to swear-in Cabinet secretaries and as a backdrop for his near-daily question-and-answer sessions with reporters.\n\n\u201cOh, what a great feeling,\u201d Trump said, sitting behind the Resolute Desk on Inauguration Day when asked how it felt to return to the Oval Office. \u201cOne of the better feelings I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nTrump usually arrives mid-morning from the residence, where he is often up and on the phone from 6 a.m. onward, ringing different aides or allies to discuss what he\u2019s just watched on television, read in the paper or various plans for the day. His staff knows to expect him in the West Wing closer to 10 or 11 a.m.\n\nThe space he arrives to these days has taken on the feel of a packed gallery showroom. While he knew immediately some of the portraits he wanted to hang, Trump has also reviewed catalogues upon catalogues of potential portraits from the national collection to hang in the Oval Office, flipping through laminated pages to decide which of his predecessors\u2019 portraits he\u2019d like to adorn the walls of the office they\u2019ve all occupied.\n\nAfter selecting which men he wants on the wall, he moves on to frames. Characteristic of how he prefers the decor at his other properties, Trump usually leans toward darker frames. In all, he has hung close to 20 paintings in the Oval Office, all of predecessors or statesmen he reveres or is inspired by. Joe Biden, by comparison, had six portraits on the walls \u2013 itself well more than Barack Obama, who hung two portraits of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, but gave over the remaining wall space to modern paintings, including two Edward Hoppers on loan from the Whitney Museum.\n\nIn this November 13, 2024 photo, President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office.

Across the room, a new picture of Washington hangs above the fireplace: no longer the small painting that hung there when Trump arrived in January, but an imposing portrait by Charles Willson Peale from 1776, showing the first president with a sword.\n\nAlmost every square inch of wall space has been covered in oil portraits of founding fathers or former presidents; in some places, their frames are almost touching as they compete for space. The gallery wall now includes Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Polk \u2013 on loan from Capitol Hill \u2013 all staring down at the proceedings in the office.\n\nA painting of former President Ronald Reagan hangs behind Trump during a swearing-in ceremony.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nWhile many presidents have found the White House to be a confining bubble, Trump often extols the beauty and grandeur of the executive mansion, particularly the Oval Office. Some presidents have held working meetings in the Roosevelt or Cabinet rooms, but Trump spends most of his day inside the Oval and the small adjoining ante rooms, including a dining room.\n\nSo far, all of the changes in this term have been centered around the d\u00e9cor. But during his first term, Trump presided over an extensive renovation of the Oval Office and other rooms across the West Wing. The $1.75 million renovations were completed while he was on a summer break at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe found gold behind the walls, which I always knew. Renovations are grand,\u201d Trump told TIME magazine then. \u201cRemember how hard they worked? They wanted to make me happy.\u201d\n\nEven as the two-month mark of his return to power approaches, Trump is still adding new pieces of d\u00e9cor or memorabilia to the Oval Office. Some are rotating. Others seem to be on more permanent display.\n\nOn the table behind his desk sits a shiny golden replica of the FIFA World Cup Trophy, known as the Jules Rimet Trophy. Trump talks often about the next World Cup, which will take place in July 2026 across North America, with the majority of matches played in the US.\n\nA photograph of President Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, next to a replica of the FIFA World Cup trophy on a table behind the Resolute Desk.

The plants are descended from cuttings originally gifted to John F. Kennedy by the Irish ambassador to the US. On the mantle now are seven gold artifacts, arranged in a row flanking a tall empire-style centerpiece.\n\nSimple wooden side tables have been replaced by showier, marble-topped consoles, with gilded eagles on the base holding up bronze busts of Martin Luther King Jr. and Winston Churchill.\n\nPhotographs cover a table behind Trump\u2019s desk, including of his mother. The Resolute Desk, gifted by Queen Victoria and crafted from timbers of an Arctic exploration vessel, was sent off for refurbishment last month. A smaller desk has taken its place temporarily.\n\nNext to it, a placard showing the body of water he\u2019s renamed the \u201cGulf of America\u201d sits permanently on an easel.

At times, some guests have used it as a coaster.\n\nAnd there may be more to come. The president spends most weekends at Mar-a-Lago and often returns aboard Air Force One with a new showpiece for the Oval Office or another place of honor in the White House."

            "full_content": "Flushing will be fun this year. Photo: Rich Storry/Getty Images\n\nPeligro Sports employee Randy Rodriguez was smiling sheepishly. Standing in front of an array of caps at a Washington Heights sporting-goods store one day last month, he admitted he was abandoning the Yankees. Never mind that the team has won 27 championships, made it to the World Series last year, and are betting-odds favorites to return this season (despite a raft of injuries), Rodriguez was terminating his fandom. With the aid of a fellow employee translating, he said he was making a switch long unthinkable in New York: to the Mets.\n\nOr at least he was very likely to do so. \u201cOchenta y cinco por ciento, que s\u00ed,\u201d he said \u2014 meaning he was 85 percent sure. Hey, commitment is hard, especially when your co-workers keep insisting you\u2019re going to bring your (alleged) bad luck to your new team. But across Washington Heights and beyond, legions of the area\u2019s more than 1.2 million residents with Dominican roots are making the same choice, dropping pinstripes for orange and blue.\n\nThe singular reason for this fandom exodus: Juan Soto and his record-breaking 15-year, $765 million contract. The greatest of Major League Baseball\u2019s current Dominican stars, Soto spent 2024 in the Bronx before deciding in December to take his talents to Flushing.\n\nAt Peligro, a local baseball institution known for catering to both MLB and Dominican Professional Baseball League diehards, Yankees gear outsold Mets paraphernalia last season at an 80-20 clip, said Freddy Pe\u00f1a, a longtime store manager. Since Soto\u2019s signing, it has flipped to 70-30 Mets. \u201cIt was like a complete stop from, Oh, we were selling Yankees gear, and now it\u2019s Mets, Mets, Mets,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.\n\nAcross the store from Rodriguez, two full racks of Yankees jerseys were hanging alongside a depleted supply of blue Mets Soto jerseys. Previously, Peligro offered more than a dozen varieties of Yankees hats and just a couple of Mets lids. But store owner Jose Mateo said his Mets-cap display will soon match the Yankees one, including a hat with the Dominican flag plus Soto\u2019s name and No. 22 stitched beside the Mets\u2019 curlicued \u201cNY.\u201d\n\nDominican fans in the U.S. tend to follow home-island heroes more than teams, switching clubs when their favorite players do. Mateo, who emigrated from the D.R. when he was 17, explained that while some Dominican fans in New York \u201cdie with the Yankees\u201d and others \u201cdie with the Mets,\u201d most will go with a player. The bigger the star, the stronger the pull. \u201cA guy like Soto brings the fans,\u201d Mateo said.\n\nRodriguez, for example, used to root for the St. Louis Cardinals, back when Santo Domingo native Albert Pujols played for the team. After Pujols decamped for the lowly Angels, Rodriguez drifted from team to team depending on his preferred Dominican player of the moment. When the Yankees traded for Soto, that finally meant the Bombers. \u201cLast year, Soto made it huge for Dominican fans, for Yankee Stadium,\u201d Mateo said.\n\nIt was a major moment. For all their vaunted rings, the club has never locked down control of New York\u2019s most baseball-obsessed population \u2014 one centered, no less, in the Bronx, the home of Yankee Stadium, and uptown Manhattan, just an errant Chuck Knoblauch toss away. Until Soto arrived, the Yankees had simply never had a Dominican megastar capable of drawing fans en masse. (Alex Rodriguez might have qualified had he not been widely disowned by Dominican fans after choosing to represent the U.S. over the Dominican Republic in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.)\n\n\u201cA lot of Dominicans, they\u2019ve never been such good fans of the Yankees,\u201d Mateo said.\n\nWhen City Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa took office in 2022, she became the first Dominican woman to represent Washington Heights and Inwood. She has seen the impact of Soto\u2019s signing around her district \u2014 though she wants it on record that she has always been a staunch Mets devotee, even when her father peeled off several years ago to support Boston and its fleet of Dominican stars led by star pitcher Pedro Mart\u00ednez. (\u201cThat\u2019s where I drew the line,\u201d she said.) De La Rosa believes that, by not holding on to Soto, the Yankees missed an opportunity to finally secure widespread support in New York\u2019s Dominican community.\n\n\u201cWhile maybe it\u2019s not part of the Yankees\u2019 grand scheme in their calculations, it should be,\u201d she said. \u201cDominicans, we bring that energy and that excitement.\u201d\n\nAfter the Red Sox traded for Mart\u00ednez ahead of the 1998 season, Dominican fans flocked to Fenway Park on days he pitched, turning the old bandbox into a raucous fiesta. With Soto onboard, many, like De La Rosa, expect the atmosphere at Citi Field to be turned up, too.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019ll get festive and loud and celebratory,\u201d she said.\n\nIt will be \u201creal, real loud,\u201d echoed Mateo.\n\nLast year, the Mets rode a tide of uncharacteristic good feeling to a surprise appearance in the National League Championship Series, spurred on by Grimace and the vocal and fielding talents of Jose Iglesias, a journeyman shortstop and pop star whose anthem, \u201cOMG,\u201d captured the Mets faithful and the Latin-pop world alike. But the team did not bring back Iglesias for this season, and everyone knows the risks of going back to McDonald\u2019s too quickly. The infusion of fans and excitement caused by Soto\u2019s arrival ought to give the \u201925 squad a chance to forge its own identity \u2014 one no less vibrant, though perhaps less purple.\n\nIt is, of course, common for fans to take a shine to pro athletes with whom they share a background. But given that practically every Major League roster now includes Dominican players \u2014 many of them stars \u2014 the extent to which Dominican fans jump team to team along with their favorite players is unique. When the Mets traded for Mike Piazza, for example, he did not come packaged with Little Italy.\n\nRamona Hern\u00e1ndez, a professor of sociology and the director of the Dominican Studies Institute at the City University of New York, said la pelota has long been a dominant part of Dominican culture and is all the more so today as it is often viewed as a way out of poverty. Some fans see themselves \u2014 or perhaps someone they know \u2014 in the stars who make it; others just feel pride.\n\n\u201cNo matter how large we are, we are still a very small group in the country,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI think that feeling of being a small group makes you click and connect to that which is familiar and that shares this historical legacy.\u201d\n\nSoto\u2019s signing the largest contract in baseball history has been a particular point of pride. \u201cIt is something that I think resonated with Dominicans,\u201d she said. \u201cThis humble young person put the name of the Dominican people way up there in the right way.\u201d\n\nLast season, 142 players born in the D.R. played in MLB, according to the Baseball Almanac, the most by far from any country besides the United States. As recently as 1980, though, the number was just 30. In 1990 it grew to 52, by 2000 it was 104, and by 2010 it was 126. Until then, there was only a single Dominican Hall of Famer, Juan Marichal, who played from 1960 to 1975. Marichal had a loyal following, but it was during the player boom of the late \u201990s and early aughts that the next wave of all-time greats arrived \u2014 and that Dominican fans\u2019 penchant for following players became most pronounced.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez said she recently happened to look at an old picture of herself from 1978, when she was studying at Lehman College in the Bronx, and noticed she was wearing a Yankees cap. But when the Red Sox traded for Mart\u00ednez, that \u201cNY\u201d on her head turned to a red \u201cB.\u201d\n\n\u201cMart\u00ednez was there, are you kidding me? Forget it,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, Led Black, a Washington Heights community activist and the founder of The Uptown Collective blog, recalled that his father was a lifelong Yankees fan until the rival Red Sox became loaded with Dominican superstars: not just Mart\u00ednez but also David Ortiz and Washington Heights\u2019s own Manny Ram\u00edrez.\n\nDuring that period, at the height of the Red Sox\u2013Yankees holy war, Washington Heights became known as a hotbed of Red Sox resistance in the city. \u201cThere was some pushback. You would definitely see it at the barbershop,\u201d Black said. \u201cI think the loyalty to Dominicanness trumped a lot of it.\u201d\n\nOver time, Boston\u2019s stars retired and most Dominican fans in New York moved on, though a lingering corps of Red Sox partisans remains. Mateo said many former Sox fans, who could never quite stomach joining the Yankees\u2019 Evil Empire \u2014 even with Soto \u2014 are now \u201cgoing to feel more free to be with the Mets.\u201d\n\nInside his store, he pointed out one such employee who recently switched from the Red Sox to the Mets after refusing to touch the hated Yankees.\n\nThe Mets are no more guaranteed Dominican fans\u2019 continued allegiance than any other team is. But If Soto performs well and plays out his full 15-year contract in Queens, that\u2019s certainly plenty of time to build up loyalty. And perhaps some fans will stick with the Mets even after the masses move on to a new superstar, as happened with the Red Sox. The Mets may also come to see value in continuing to acquire Dominican stars \u2014 and attract Dominican fans \u2014 based as they are in the Dominican Republic\u2019s unofficial U.S. capital.\n\nEven as Dominicans have become a more established part of both the United States and Major League Baseball, there is little sign that such intense loyalty to individual players will fade. Hern\u00e1ndez said that, as the second and third generations of Dominicans in the U.S. have overtaken the number of immigrants, she has observed a greater emphasis on preserving Dominican culture.\n\n\u201cThere is this understanding, this realization, this developing of consciousness about, If we don\u2019t emphasize who we are, if we don\u2019t pass it on, it can die,\u201d she said. \u201cThat, I think, creates the need for expressing the culture even more than in the past.\u201d\n\nAnd, as she pointed out, Dominican culture is baseball.\n\nAs a sociologist and baseball fan, Hern\u00e1ndez said she will not miss the chance to observe the Juan Soto phenomenon firsthand at Citi Field.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to go simply to see him,\u201d she said. \u201cI am one of those!\u201d"

            "full_content": "Bill Burr talks a whole lot about men in his new comedy special \u201cDrop Dead Years,\u201d which debuted on Hulu on Friday. Why is it, he wonders aloud, that only men \u201cdrop dead,\u201d usually between the ages of 49 and 61, sometimes while manscaping \u201cin the upstairs bathroom while listening to AC/DC\u201d? How come \u201cmen aren\u2019t allowed to be sad\u201d? \u201cWe\u2019re allowed,\u201d he continues, \u201cto be one of two things: mad or \u2018fine.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d If you want to see sad men doing sad things in their natural sad habitat, Burr suggests, visit your local Guitar Center.\n\nBurr is also thinking about men in much more personal terms. \u201cDrop Dead Years\u201d opens up with the comedian, offstage, reflecting candidly:\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a weird thing to be over 50 and realize how f----d up you are. Like, I thought I did stand-up because I loved comedy. And then what I really figured out is that, no, that\u2019s not why I did it. I did stand-up because that was the easiest way to walk into a room full of a bunch of people that I didn\u2019t know and make everybody like me. All of the way I\u2019ve moved through the world has always been like, \u2018Where\u2019s the place I have the least chance of being hurt?\u2019\n\nBill Burr is a therapeutic work in progress. He\u2019s bravely figuring himself out ... in public. The process, however, is not free of contradictions. Nor is it going very smoothly.\n\nIn \u201cDrop Dead Years,\u201d as in previous specials, he copiously mocks women, feminists, gays, liberals, trans people, overweight people, etc. And while the results are often very funny, this sure is an odd way to get \u201ceverybody\u201d in the room to like him.\n\nThe response to his controversial \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d monologue of 2020, in which he lit up \u201ccancel culture,\u201d is a case in point. As is his postelection 2024 \u201cSNL\u201d appearance, when he counseled women not to wear pantsuits like Kamala Harris did. Instead, the ladies who seek elected office should \u201cwhore it up a bit.\u201d\n\nWhat truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to situate a comedian like Burr in the present comedic \u201cmanosphere.\u201d That would be the dank man cave where Joe Rogan, Tony Hinchcliffe, Theo Von and others trash liberal pieties, garner immense crowds and earn success and influence in the process. Like them, Burr\u2019s got the stage rage. He\u2019s got the confrontational \u201cI\u2019m so mad my heart is about to explode!\u201d affect. He too delights in (rhetorically) coldcocking minorities.\n\nBut Burr is different. He\u2019s not only older than these boys, he is infinitely more intelligent. A heady gag in \u201cDrop Dead Years\u201d about KKK members riding in the HOV lane reminds us that Burr is a thinking man\u2019s comic in the style of George Carlin. He\u2019s also an exceptionally skilled physical actor. He uses his body, pasty white face and bald dome (which shines like a diamond under the stage lights) in ways that few can rival: I especially appreciated his imitation of a man dropping dead out of a golf cart.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s what we might call Burr\u2019s balance. He\u2019s not averse to punching up. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Terry Gross this past week, the comic set his sights on Elon Musk. \u201cI just refuse to believe,\u201d Burr declared, reflecting on the billionaire\u2019s Inauguration Day salutes, \u201cthat it was an accidental, two-time \u2018Sieg heil.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet what truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection. As the opening comments in this latest special suggest, Burr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad. He\u2019s boldly marching into the aforementioned room \u2014 a \u201croom,\u201d I might add, that streams to a few million people \u2014 and bleeding out.\n\nBurr\u2019s asking questions. Why can\u2019t men wrap themselves in an afghan, sit in a corner and brood like women can? Why can\u2019t men be sad? The problem is that, like Dave Chappelle, he also demands to know why he can\u2019t use a homophobic slur anymore.\n\nHis public therapeutic turn, with all of its contradictions, is equally evident in the NPR interview with Gross. One second he\u2019s decimating Musk\u2019s \u201claminated face\u201d and the next (like, literally one second later), he\u2019s talking about why he hates liberals. One second he\u2019s confronting his flawed masculinity; moments later, he\u2019s subjecting Gross to the type of off-the-shelf manosphere rebuttals that are guaranteed to drive liberal women, among others, to distraction. (The normally serene Gross, for her part, at some points low-key loses her patience with Burr\u2019s evasions and interruptions.)\n\nBurr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad.\n\nBill Burr is extremely funny. But politically, the man is completely incomprehensible.\n\nIn terms of psychic self-awareness, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite \u201cthere\u201d yet (wherever that may be). Admirably, he\u2019s realized that he performs his comedy to avoid getting hurt. It therefore boggles the mind that he seems to make no effort to interrogate whether and how his jokes, broadcast to multitudes, might hurt other people, whether that\u2019s gay men, or women bemoaning Harris\u2019 election loss (and their personal freedoms).\n\nThe closing sequence of \u201cDrop Dead Years\u201d provides a clue as to how Burr may presently resolve all this psychic tumult. A few moments earlier, he had mentioned that he was touched inappropriately as a child (\u201cI got touched as a kid\u201d). Now the credits have rolled, we\u2019re in the alley behind the theater. Away from the crowd. Everything\u2019s quiet. Burr is sitting on the stoop of the stage door. His buddy is eating a sandwich and drinking a beer. Burr is smoking a cigar. It\u2019s a good cigar. Maybe, the moment suggests, men achieve psychic resolution by being alone with other men."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy St. Patrick\u2019s Day! In today\u2019s edition, Scott Bland dives into the stark dividing lines revealed by our first NBC News poll of the year. Plus, Curtis Bunn reports on how the Tesla is no longer the status symbol on the left that it once was.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe deep divisions defining American politics\n\nBy Scott Bland\n\nElection results change who holds power, and they change the course of history. But they don\u2019t always change minds, at least in the short term.\n\nThat\u2019s a major takeaway from the latest national NBC News poll, which finds, across dozens of questions, that the U.S. remains as closely and knottily divided on President Donald Trump and many key issues as it did before the November\u2019s election.\n\nConsider the questions on one of the centers of the action in the Trump administration: the Department of Government Efficiency. Asked whether \u201cgovernment should do more to solve problems and help meet the needs of people\u201d or whether \u201cgovernment is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals,\u201d 56% choose \u201cshould do more,\u201d while 42% say government \u201cis doing too many things.\u201d\n\nBut at the same time, voters are open to the idea of finding cuts and greater efficiency in government: 46% say establishing DOGE was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea (and the remainder say they have no opinion or aren\u2019t sure).\n\nAnd at the same time as that, 47% say they view DOGE negatively, compared to 41% who view it positively. And there\u2019s a degree of hesitancy about what DOGE has actually done so far \u2014 as well as a degree of willingness to support it even more, depending on what happens. One-third of voters say it should continue operating as is, another 28% say \u201cit is needed but should slow down to assess the impact,\u201d and another third say \u201cit is reckless and should stop now.\u201d\n\nDivisions like these are in evidence throughout the poll \u2014 and, indeed, all throughout the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating is as high as he\u2019s ever had as president, but a majority of registered voters still disapprove. Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied in an early 2026 midterm election ballot test, but views of the Democratic Party are as negative as they\u2019ve ever been, driven in part by fed-up Democrats.\n\nAnd while the nation has come around on Trump\u2019s immigration policies, at least so far, he\u2019s getting negative scores on other issues, including his handling of the economy, which has always been a bring spot in his numbers as president.\n\nCheck out the full poll here.\n\nMore from the NBC News poll: Most Americans are rooting for Ukraine. But nearly half think Trump prefers Russia, by Ben Kamisar\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nThe Tesla is no longer a progressive status symbol\n\nBy Curtis Bunn\n\nIt was not enough for Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., to announce that he had gotten rid of his Tesla. He did it on X, the social media platform headed by Elon Musk, who took over as CEO of the electric vehicle company in 2008.\n\nKelly made his reason for abandoning the car that one time represented progress and automotive and environmental achievement clear: Musk and his politics.\n\n\u201cEvery time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much damage Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country,\u201d Kelly posted.\n\nOther well-known figures outside the political realm have recently dumped their Teslas as well, including actor Jason Bateman and musician Sheryl Crow.\n\nMusk\u2019s connection to President Donald Trump and the emergence of the Department of Government Efficiency and its vast federal government job cuts were the tipping points for many progressives who owned their once-beloved groundbreaking vehicles, as Tesla remains the top-selling electric car in the country.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \ud83c\udfa4 Exclusive interview: Vice President JD Vance acknowledged in an interview with Henry J.

            "full_content": "A federal judge on Monday denied the Trump administration's request to call off a court hearing involving President Donald Trump's use of a wartime law to deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals, and whether the White House knowingly violated the court order \u2013 an extraordinary effort that came just moments before administration officials were due to testify under oath.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s filing came shortly after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered lawyers to court Monday for a \"fact-finding hearing\" involving Trump's use of the 1798 wartime-era Alien Enemies Act, and whether the Trump administration knowingly violated his earlier court order blocking the Trump administration from invoking the law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals and alleged members of violent gang Tren de Aragua, for 14 days.\n\nThe law has only been used three times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II.\n\nDuring Monday's hearing, which lasted about 45 minutes, Judge Boasberg at times appeared frustrated as he pressed government lawyers for more details as to why his Saturday order\u2014which called for the administration to immediately return all planes with expelled migrants, including the Venezuelan nationals and alleged Tren de Aragua gang members\u2014were not brought back to the U.S.\n\n\"My orders don\u2019t seem to carry much weight,\" Jude Boasberg said near the end of the hearing. Both parties are due back in court Friday for a hearing over the Trump administration's request to vacate the case.\n\nWHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?\n\nDuring the hearing, the Trump administration repeatedly declined to provide information to Judge Boasberg about how many flights carrying migrants took off on Saturday, citing national security protections.\n\n\"Those are operational issues, and I am not at liberty to provide information,\" a lawyer for the Trump administration told the court.\n\nJudge Boasberg, in response, ordered the Justice Department to provide the court with more information in writing by Tuesday at noon.\n\nIn granting the emergency order Saturday Boasberg sided with the plaintiffs \u2013 Democracy Forward and the ACLU \u2013 who had argued that the deportations would likely pose imminent and \"irreparable\" harm to the migrants under the time proposed.\n\nTRUMP POLICY ON BORDER JUMPERS EMPOWERS USE OF \u2018MAXIMUM CONSEQUENCES,\u2019 BORDER AGENT TELLS FOX\n\nJudge Boasberg also ordered the Trump administration Saturday to immediately halt any planned deportations, and to notify their clients that \"any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\" he said.\n\nBut the decision apparently came too late to stop a plane filled with more than 200 migrants who were deported to El Salvador.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview that a plane carrying hundreds of migrants, including more than 130 persons removed under the Alien Enemies Act, had already \"left U.S. airspace\" by the time the order was handed down.\n\nShe also suggested the order itself was not \"lawful\" and noted the Trump administration's intent to appeal.\n\nIn response, the ACLU asked the court to order the government to submit declarations, under oath, that the planes had indeed taken off after the court's order.\n\n\"Whether or not the planes had cleared U.S. territory, the U.S. retained custody at least until the planes landed and the individuals were turned over to foreign governments,\" the ACLU said in their filing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJudge Boasberg, an Obama appointee, at times appeared slightly incredulous that the Trump administration chose to move forward with the deportation of hundreds of migrants to El Salvador, pressing lawyers for the Justice Department over whether they believed there were better options than to comply with the decision he handed down Saturday.\n\n\"Isn\u2019t then the better course, to return the planes to the United States and figure out what to do, than to say, \u2018We don\u2019t care, we\u2019ll do what we want?'\" he asked."

            "full_content": "California Republicans, energized by district gains made during the 2024 general election, selected their new party leader, Corrin Rankin, a former surrogate for President Donald Trump, over the weekend at the CAGOP annual convention in Sacramento.\n\nShe is the first-ever Black woman to hold the position, and she's pro-MAGA.\n\n\"It\u2019s time to end the Democrats\u2019 one-party rule and make California great again,\" the new CAGOP chair said to delegates after her win on Sunday.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Rankin said there is \"an outcry for commonsense politicians in California\" and that the party, which has noticeably been given new life by Trump, is strongly aligned with the president's national agenda. It's an uphill battle against the state's deep-blue Democrat trifecta, but it's one that Rankin has her eyes set on as she prepares to lead the party under a second Trump term.\n\nNEWSOM'S 'UNFAIR' REMARK ON GIRLS' SPORTS BELIES RECORD AS GOVERNOR: 'ABSOLUTE BULLS---'\n\n\"I've worked on every single one of his campaigns for the past 10 years, and I have a great relationship with the Trump administration, and I plan to continue that,\" Rankin said. \"I want to welcome President Trump. We want to invite him to California. We would like to see him here as many times as we can.\"\n\nIn the 2024 general election, Trump flipped several California counties red that had supported former President Joe Biden in 2020. Those counties include Butte, Fresno, Imperial, Inyo, Lake, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Stanislaus.\n\n\"A lot of people are favoring his policies show that through the campaign, a lot of counties flipped from blue to red, and a lot of voters voted for the top of the ticket,\" said Rankin, who was the 2016 statewide coalition director for African Americans for Trump. \"They voted for President Trump, and that goes across the aisle, people were voting for him.\"\n\nNEWSOM CALLS BIOLOGICAL MEN IN WOMEN'S SPORTS 'DEEPLY UNFAIR' IN PODCAST WITH CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST\n\nRankin said there's an \"underlying change\" occurring in California, as the party is hopeful it can make the state less blue while more voters move to the center. The new GOP chair pointed to the newly elected mayor of San Francisco, Daniel Lurie, who is \"a lot more moderate than the former mayor, London Breed,\" as an example of that change.\n\n\"I think that California is moving from the far left and more towards the center, and as the California Republicans, it's our job to make sure that we are offering solutions, that we're articulating our policies and our vision and how we want to represent our constituents,\" Rankin said.\n\nThe economy and public safety are going to be two major platform issues for the CAGOP moving forward, Rankin added. California has some of the highest state income and business taxes in the nation, and Republican lawmakers have doubled down in recent years, introducing bills to address affordability and the uptick in crime across the state's major cities.\n\nThe Golden State will hold its gubernatorial election in November 2026, with the next governor replacing termed-limited Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom. Rankin said the CAGOP has not favored any candidates yet and is waiting to see the full landscape of candidates who throw their hat in the race.\n\nNEWSOM SIGNS $50M 'TRUMP-PROOFING' LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRegarding Trump's contentious relationship with Newsom, who signed a $50 million package bolstering the state's legal defense against potential threats from the administration, Rankin said the CAGOP's role will be contributing to the \"ongoing conversation\" between state and national politics.\n\n\"We're going to make sure that our message is heard and that our message resonates with Californians and [Californians] know and understand the position of California Republicans,\" Rankin said. \"And I think, at the end of the day, we take a look at Prop. 36 and how it passed overwhelmingly, and that was a Republican-led initiative to make sure that we are fighting back on these Newsom-led soft-on-crime policies; and Californians overwhelmingly voted with us, so we're going to take that same approach to every single issue.\""

(El Salvador presidential press office via AP)\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela -- Debates over President Donald Trump\u2019s hardline migration policies are focused on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to some a ruthless transnational criminal organization and to others the pretext for an overhyped anti-migrant narrative.\n\nTrump labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on Saturday when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any noncitizen during wartime. Hours later, the Trump administration transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations. Flights were in the air when the ruling came down.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act requires a president to declare the United States at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners to whom immigration or criminal laws otherwise protect. It had been used only three times \u2014 the last time to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.\n\nThe Trump administration has not identified the more than 200 immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States.\n\nFrom the heartland to major cities like New York and Chicago, the gang has been blamed for sex trafficking, drug smuggling and police shootings, as well as the exploitation of the nearly 1 million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into the U.S. in recent years. Trump told Congress this month that a Venezuelan migrant found guilty of murdering 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus was a member of the gang.\n\nThe size of the gang is unclear as is the extent to which its actions are coordinated across state lines and national borders.\n\nThe Venezuelan gang entered U.S. political discourse after footage from a security camera surfaced on social media last summer showing heavily armed men entering an apartment in the Denver suburb of Aurora shortly before a fatal shooting outside. In response, Trump vowed to \u201c liberate Aurora \u201d from Venezuelans he falsely said were \u201ctaking over the whole town.\u201d\n\nThe city initially downplayed concerns. But most of the apartment complex was closed under an emergency order last month after officials said they suspected Tren de Aragua members in the kidnapping and assault of two residents.\n\nMost of the men seen in the video have been arrested, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement accusing them of gang membership.\n\nThe Tren, which means \u201ctrain\u201d in Spanish, traces its origin more than a decade ago to an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in the central state of Aragua. It has expanded in recent years as more than 8 million Venezuelans fled economic turmoil under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S.\n\nCountries such as Peru and Colombia \u2014 all with large populations of Venezuelan migrants \u2014 have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in a region that has long had some of the highest murder rates in the world. Some of its crimes have spread panic in poor neighborhoods, where the gang extorts local businesses and illegally charges residents for \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nThe gang operates as a loose network in the U.S. Tattoos, which are commonly used by Central American gangs, aren't required for those affiliated with the Tren, said Ronna Risquez, a Venezuelan journalist who wrote a 2023 book about the gang\u2019s origins.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump he took steps to designate the gang a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order Saturday accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami, \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country.\n\n\u201cThe result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order alleged.\n\nWes Tabor, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Venezuela when the gang first came onto law enforcement radar, said Trump's decision to give the DEA and other federal agencies authority to carry out immigrant arrests is a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d that will curtail the Tren's activities in the U.S.\n\nTabor said authorities need to build a robust database like it did when combating El Salvador's MS-13 containing biometric data, arrest information and intelligence from foreign law enforcement partners.\n\n\u201cWe have to use a hammer on an ant because if we don\u2019t it will get out of control,\u201d said Tabor. \u201cWe need to smash it now.\u201d\n\nIn Venezuela, officials originally expressed bafflement at the U.S. interest in the Tren, claiming it had dismantled the gang after retaking control of the prison where the group was born.\n\nAs Trump's immigration crackdown has intensified, they've conditioned their cooperation with U.S. deportation flights on progress in other areas in the long-strained bilateral relationship.\n\nLast month, authorities gave a hero's welcome to some 190 Venezuelan migrants deported by Trump, accusing the U.S. of spreading an \"ill-intentioned\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d narrative about the Tren in the U.S. They said most Venezuelan immigrants are decent, hard-working people and that U.S. officials were looking to stigmatize the South American nation.\n\nOver the weekend they protested the use of Trump\u2019s invocation of the wartime rules, likening it to the \u201cdarkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.\u201d"

She filed two Title VI complaints with the Columbia administration, but the university never took any action against him.\n\n\"It would almost be easier if he were some terrifying looking man who threatened to punch people in the face, but he wasn\u2019t,\" she said. \"He was very soft-spoken and careful with his words, which almost made him seem more insidious, because it was so intentional \u2013 he was never being hyperbolic, he was very clear.

Kordia was unlawfully present in the country despite her student visa being canceled in 2022.\n\nColumbia University declined Fox News Digital's request for comment, saying, \"we\u2019re not going to comment on individual students.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is also investigating whether the university intentionally hid students who are in the country illegally. Columbia interim President Katrina Armstrong issued a statement on Saturday saying that the university \"will stand by its values,\" but did not directly respond to the DOJ investigation."

The report also claimed that a Hezbollah ammunition depot in Lebanon was destroyed by Syrian artillery fire.\n\nISRAEL FACES NEW SYRIA CHALLENGE AS IT ADJUSTS TO NEW STRATEGY AMID REGIONAL POWER STRUGGLE FOR INFLUENCE\n\nLebanese President Joseph Aoun addressed the escalating violence, saying, \"What is happening on the eastern and northeastern border cannot continue, and we will not accept its continuation. I have instructed the Lebanese army to respond to the sources of fire.\"\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least five additional Syrian soldiers were killed during the clashes. Civilians, including families with young children, were seen fleeing toward the Syrian village of Hermel as violence spread across the border region.\n\nThe newly established Syrian government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa of the U.S.-sanctioned terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, issued a rare statement vowing retaliation against Hezbollah.\n\n\"They took them to Lebanese territory and killed them. The Ministry of Defense will take all necessary measures in response to this escalation by Hezbollah,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe conflict reflects deeper sectarian and ideological divisions. HTS, a Sunni terrorist group with roots in Syria\u2019s jihadist insurgency and former ties to al Qaeda, and Hezbollah, a Shiite terrorist force backed by Iran, represent opposing factions in the ongoing struggle for regional dominance.\n\n\"Hezbollah is trying to take advantage of the new government\u2019s weakness in Syria, but the group itself is in a precarious position. It has suffered major setbacks from Israeli strikes, the fall of Assad, and now new adversaries in Syria,\" Javed Ali, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy and former senior director at the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe collapse of President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in December marked a major turning point, as Hezbollah had spent 14 years backing him alongside Russia and Iran\u2019s pro-Shiite militias. However, in late November, Syrian rebels launched a surprise offensive against Assad\u2019s forces, just as a ceasefire was announced in northern Gaza, leading to the final collapse of his rule.\n\nEVANGELICAL LEADER SAYS US MUST PROTECT SYRIAN CHRISTIANS FROM ATTACKS BY JIHADI TERRORISTS\n\nNow in power, HTS has pledged to crack down on weapons and drug smuggling along the border, a move that directly threatens Hezbollah\u2019s operations. The new Syrian government has already begun military deployments to secure its borders, further restricting Hezbollah\u2019s ability to maneuver.\n\n\"Hezbollah is facing a confluence of threats unlike any time in its history,\" said Ali. \"With HTS consolidating control in Syria, Hezbollah\u2019s overland weapons supply route from Iran has been severely compromised. This disruption could significantly degrade its operational capabilities.\"\n\nThe rise of HTS as a governing force in Syria has also drawn U.S. attention. While Washington has designated HTS as a terrorist organization, analysts suggest that al-Sharaa's pragmatic approach should be assessed cautiously.\n\n\"The U.S. is navigating a complex landscape in Syria, and while it does not officially recognize HTS, there are strategic interests in seeing Hezbollah and Iranian influence further weakened,\" Ali noted.\n\nHTS has attempted to rebrand itself from its extremist origins, portraying itself as a nationalist Islamist movement opposed to Iranian influence and Hezbollah\u2019s expansion in Syria. While skepticism remains, the group\u2019s control over key Syrian territory disrupts Iran\u2019s ability to maintain a direct supply corridor to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nBeyond Syria, Hezbollah is also facing growing challenges in Lebanon. The group\u2019s losses in recent confrontations with Israel have emboldened its domestic opponents, who now see an opportunity to weaken its grip on Lebanese politics.\n\nFormer Lebanese President Michel Aoun echoed these concerns, highlighting three major threats to Lebanon\u2019s stability: ongoing Israeli attacks, Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in cross-border violence, and the unresolved Syrian refugee crisis.\n\n\"Officials must take immediate action to protect the safety of the nation and its citizens,\" he said.\n\nFurther complicating the situation, Mounir Shehadeh, a former Lebanese government coordinator with the United Nations Interim Force peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, said \"there is no presence of Hezbollah in the northeastern Bekaa Valley, and this is known by the people and tribes in the region.\" His statement contradicts reports of Hezbollah\u2019s activity along the Lebanese-Syrian border, raising questions about the true extent of its control.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnalysts say the long-term implications of these developments remain uncertain, but Hezbollah\u2019s regional position is rapidly deteriorating. While Lebanese and Syrian officials are working to contain the crisis, the risk of further escalation remains high."

            "full_content": "The federal judge who temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals could be at the center of a larger battle after Trump's border czar vowed Monday to continue sending migrants back to Latin America.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg made headlines Saturday for granting an emergency restraining order blocking the Trump administration from invoking a 1798 law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua, for 14 days. Boasberg sided with the plaintiffs, Democracy Forward and the ACLU, in ruling that the deportations would likely pose imminent and \"irreparable\" harm.\n\n\"Given the exigent circumstances that [the court] has been made aware of this morning, it has determined that an immediate Order is warranted to maintain the status quo until a hearing can be set,\" Boasberg said in his order, which blocked Trump from invoking any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act for two weeks.\n\nHis decision drew immediate criticism from Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, who declared in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" that, \"We are not stopping.\"\n\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW BAN ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\n\"I don't care what the judges think. I don't care what the Left thinks. We're coming,\" Homan, said, adding, \"Another fight. Another fight every day.\"\n\nThis was not the first time Boasberg found himself in the crosshairs of Trump's supporters \u2013 he previously oversaw the FISA court that authorized surveillance of certain members of Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nBoasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., was appointed to the bench nearly 15 years ago by President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2014, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appointed him to serve a seven-year term on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA Court \u2013 a court comprised of 11 federal judges hand-selected by the chief justice.\n\nThe judges undergo extensive background checks prior to their confirmation, and are tasked with approving surveillance requests and wiretap warrants sought by federal prosecutors, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Most of their work remains classified.\n\nBoasberg served as the presiding judge of the FISA Court from 2020 to 2021.\n\nRUBIO HEADS TO PANAMA, LATIN AMERICA TO PURSUE TRUMP'S 'GOLDEN AGE' AGENDA\n\nA graduate of Yale, Oxford University and Yale Law, Boasberg clerked for the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before later joining the Justice Department as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter returning full-time to the federal bench, Boasberg oversaw the sentencing of former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty to doctoring a 2017 email asking to extend surveillance permissions for its wiretap of former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page.\n\nBoasberg declined to sentence Clinesmith to prison time and instead ordered him to just 12 months of probation and 400 hours of community service \u2013 a notable decision, given his own background on the FISA court.\n\nHe said in his sentencing decision that he believed Clinesmith's role at the center of a years-long media \"hurricane\" had provided sufficient punishment.\n\n\"Anybody who has watched what Mr. Clinesmith has suffered is not someone who will readily act in that fashion,\" Boasberg said.\n\nHERE'S WHY DOZENS OF LAWSUITS SEEKING TO QUASH TRUMP'S EARLY ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT ARE FAILING\n\n\"Weighing all of these factors together \u2013 both in terms of the damages he caused and what he has suffered and the positives in his own life \u2013 I believe a probationary sentence is appropriate here and will therefore impose it,\" he continued.\n\nUntil recently, Boasberg has largely avoided making headlines, including any public broadsides that may have put him at odds with the Trump administration. That changed quickly when he granted the restraining order this weekend.\n\nThe decision was immediately appealed by lawyers for the Trump administration.\n\nAlthough Boasberg's order said any plane carrying migrants removed by the law in question be \"immediately\" returned to the U.S., the decision apparently came too late to stop an early wave of migrants being deported to El Salvador.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that a plane carrying hundreds of individuals \u2013 including more than 130 persons removed under the Alien Enemies Act \u2013 had already \"left U.S. airspace\" by the time the order was handed down.\n\n\"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,\" Leavitt said.\n\nIt is unclear what, if any, steps the judge could take to reverse that action.\n\nThe standoff is the latest in a wave of legal challenges seeking to block or slow the wave of sweeping executive actions or orders Trump has issued in his second White House term, a fight that has come to define Trump's first few months back in office.\n\nCourts have struggled to slow the dizzying pace of executive orders, which have called for the gutting of government personnel from federal agencies, halted billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, and attempted to ban birthright citizenship, among other things.\n\nAs of this writing, Trump has signed at least 200 executive orders and actions \u2013 most of which have been met with multiple court challenges and lawsuits.\n\nMost are in the earliest stages of legal limbo, as courts seek to clarify the intent of the ruling, the alleged harm caused to plaintiffs, and later, to discern whether it is necessary or appropriate for the courts to intervene.\n\nThe White House asserts that lower court judges like Boasberg should not have the power to prevent the president from executing what it argues is a lawful agenda \u2013 though the judges in question have disagreed that the president's actions all follow the law.\n\n\"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,\" Leavitt told Fox News.\n\nAt issue is Trump's use of the 228-year-old Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport Venezuelan nationals presumed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nPlaintiffs have argued that Congress originally passed the law centuries ago to give the president more power during times of war to deport noncitizens. Since its creation, it has been used just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I, and most recently, during World War II.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey argued in their filing that it would be inappropriate for Trump to use the law now as a means of deporting Venezuelan migrants, as the country \"is not invading the United States\" and has not launched a \"predatory incursion\" into U.S. territory.\n\nBoasberg agreed, noting Saturday that the two-week freeze will give the court more time to consider the merits of the case at hand."

After a lawsuit was filed, a federal judge ordered the administration to stop the deportations, for now. Here\u2019s a timeline of where the deportation flights were as the legal case unfolded:\n\nMarch 15 before noon (all times Eastern)\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg issues a written order temporarily blocking the government from removing five specific individuals who sued the Trump administration over President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:00 p.m.\n\nJudge James Boasberg\u2019s hearing begins, according to a CNN reporter covering the proceedings.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:22 p.m.\n\nThe court hearing adjourns for a break, according to a CNN reporter covering the proceedings.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:26 p.m.\n\nThe first flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6143, departs from Harlingen, Texas, according to FlightRadar24 data. FlightRadar24 is a live air traffic tracker showing flight times.\n\nMarch 15 at 5:45 p.m.\n\nA second flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6145, departs from Harlingen, Texas, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 15 at 6:00 p.m.\n\nThe court hearing resumes, according to a CNN reporter covering the proceedings.\n\nMarch 15 between 6:45 p.m. and 6:48 p.m.\n\nDuring the court hearing, the judge verbally tells Justice Department lawyers that they need to turn around any planes carrying anyone being deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The exact timing for this utterance is based on what the defendants who sued the Trump administration put in a court filing. According to a transcript of the hearing, the judge said: \u201cany plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States\u2026 this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\u201d\n\nMarch 15 at 7:26 p.m.\n\nThe judge\u2019s written order is posted to the online federal docket system known as PACER, according to the lawyers who sued the Trump administration. The written order is a formalized version of what the judge said during the hearing. He wrote: \u201cAs discussed in today\u2019s hearing, the Court ORDERS that\u2026 The Government is ENJOINED from removing\u201d from the country any non-citizens in US custody who are covered by Trump\u2019s proclamation about the Alien Enemies Act. The brief written order did not specifically include language about turning flights around.\n\nMarch 15 at 7:36 p.m.\n\nThe first flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6143, arrives in Comayagua, Honduras, according to FlightRadar24. The lawyers who sued the Trump administration pointed out that this and the other flights landed after the judge \u2013 both verbally and in writing \u2013 ordered the government to turn around any planes.\n\nMarch 15 at 7:37 p.m.\n\nThe third flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6122, departs from Harlingen, Texas, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 15 at 8:08 p.m.\n\nThe second flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6145, lands in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, at 8:08 p.m., according to FlightRadar24. (The lawyers who sued the Trump administration inaccurately said in a court filing that this flight landed in San Salvador at 8:02 p.m., but flight tracking data specified otherwise.)\n\nMarch 15 at 9:52 p.m.\n\nThe third flight carrying non-citizens for deportation, GlobalX Flight 6122, arrives in San Salvador, El Salvador according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 15 at 11:37 p.m.\n\nThe second flight carrying non-citizens for deportations continues its journey, departing from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nMarch 16 at 12:21 a.m.\n\nThe second flight carrying non-citizens for deportations finishes its journey, landing in San Salvador, El Salvador, according to FlightRadar 24.\n\nMarch 16 around 3:46 p.m.\n\nThe Justice Department submits a notice to the judge, acknowledging his rulings, but also saying some people were already deported. The notice said, \u201csome gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory under the Proclamation before the issuance of this Court\u2019s second order,\u201d specifically referring to Boasberg\u2019s written ruling posted to the docket at 7:26pm."

Col. Tyrone Barrion, the commanding officer of Task Force Sapper, told Fox News Digital, noting that the Marines' efforts have created an \"obstacle that disrupts any type of activity that tries to cross over the top or through the barrier.\"\n\n\"That allows more reaction time for border patrol,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple companies of Army engineers and military police officers based out of Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, have been deployed to the San Diego sector to assist with surveillance and detection operations, giving CBP agents more eyes on the border and allowing them to move more quickly to apprehend illegal border crossers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe all-hands-on-deck approach since the start of the Trump administration has contributed to the successful missions, Stalnaker said.\n\n\"It\u2019s a force multiplier, it assists us to accomplish our mission,\" Stalnaker said. \"And it\u2019s not just DOD, there are additional federal partners, state and local partners, we have extremely good partnerships here in the San Diego sector that act as force multipliers.

            "full_content": "Americans once again donned their green beads and shamrocks for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, celebrating the largest Irish diaspora in the world. St. Patrick\u2019s Day has become an opportunity for Ireland and the United States to celebrate their rich cultural and political connections.\n\nNew York City is hosting its 264th St. Patrick's Day Parade today \u2013 marking the oldest and longest standing St. Patrick's Day parade in the world. The first parade was held in 1762, predating America's Declaration of Independence.\n\nMajor cities across the United States hosted their own St. Patrick's Day parades this weekend \u2013 including Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Chicago. Chicago even dyes the Chicago River green each year to mark the celebration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson kicked off the Irish celebrations last week by welcoming \u200bTaoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin to the White House.\n\nIRISH LEADERS BOYCOTT WASHINGTON ST PATRICK'S DAY EVENTS OVER TRUMP'S GAZA COMMENTS\n\n\"America's truly been blessed by the courage and unstoppable spirit of the Irish,\" Trump said at the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon on Wednesday. \"Over the generations, Americans of Irish ancestry have helped build our railroads and raise our cities and man our factories, enrich our culture with art and music and literature \u2013 we see that all over \u2013 and protect our communities by joining the proud tradition of Irish-American police officers and firefighters. And few have done more for the Stars and Stripes than the sons and daughters of the Emerald Isle.\"\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP SLAMS ROSIE O'DONNELL AFTER SHE FLEES US: 'YOU'RE BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING' HER\n\nWhile the first wave of Irish immigrants arrived in the United States in the 1700s, immigration reports reveal the Great Famine in the 1800s nearly doubled the population of Irish in the United States \u2013 as over a million Irish died from starvation while another million immigrated to the United States.\n\nTrump, a native New Yorker, spoke with pride of New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade, watching \"hundreds of citizens decked in Irish green\" marching up Fifth Avenue and past \"the most beautiful cathedral in the world,\" St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nThe Taoiseach's trip to Washington, D.C., began with a breakfast at the vice president's residence, followed by the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon and a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office answering questions from reporters.\n\n\"Irish America has been at the heart of shaping this great nation. The ideals of liberty, democracy and equality of opportunity forged in this country did much to inspire Irish independence. Our histories are interconnected because our people are interconnected. Today, as the president has said, more than 30 million people claim Irish ancestry in the United States,\" Martin said.\n\nThe celebratory events were not without some political tension when Trump said the United States has a \"massive deficit\" with Ireland because they \"took our pharmaceutical companies away from presidents who didn't know what they were doing.\" Trump said the European Union, which includes Ireland, \"treats us very badly.\"\n\nMartin countered Trump's comments, saying, \"It's a two-way street to where we are investing a lot more in America now.\" However, Trump maintained that reciprocal tariffs were only fair.\n\nMartin presented Trump with a crystal bowl filled with shamrocks, a tradition that dates back to 1952 to symbolize the long-standing friendship between Ireland and the United States. Martin said the Shamrock Bowl ceremony is \"an important moment to reflect upon the relationship between our two countries.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill, Sen. Ted Kennedy, and fellow Irish-American lawmakers began the Friends of Ireland Caucus and Luncheon in 1981, during \"The Troubles.\"\n\n\"The Troubles\" were a period of political and sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s and 1998. Irish Republicans, who were predominately Catholic, sought a united Ireland, while Unionists, who were mostly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\nWhen Britain tried to enforce military conscription in Ireland during World War I, Irish nationalists, labor unions and the Catholic Church united in opposition. As support for Irish independence grew, Sinn F\u00e9in, an Irish nationalist party, gained popularity following the 1916 Easter Rising.\n\nAfter winning a majority in the general election in 1918, Sinn F\u00e9in declared Irish independence and established the First D\u00e1il, or the Irish Parliament. But Britain refused to recognize Irish independence, leading the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to launch the Irish War of Independence in 1919.\n\nThe Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 ended the war and created the Irish Free State, which became the Republic of Ireland in 1949 and allowed the six counties of Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. Catholics in Northern Ireland faced discrimination from the unionist government, who favored Protestants. Inspired by the Civil Rights movement, Catholics began peaceful protests demanding equal rights in Northern Ireland in the 1960s.\n\nConflicts between the unionist government and nationalist protesters escalated into \"The Troubles\" \u2013 30 years of violence between British soldiers and the IRA. The United States was instrumental in ending \"The Troubles\" in 1998.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton helped negotiate the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which largely ended the violence in Ireland by establishing a power-sharing agreement between unionists and nationalists \u2013 strengthening the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nMartin on Wednesday said former President Ronald Reagan initiated the United States' role in the peace process, as the first U.S. president to visit Ireland. The Reagan administration helped develop the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, which laid the groundwork for the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n\"Nowhere is the strength of the U.S.-Irish relationship more in evident than in our own peace process. 44 years ago, President Reagan called for a just and peaceful solution to the conflict that has for so long devastated lives on our island. Politicians from both sides of the aisle rose to the occasion, and the lasting peace we enjoyed today on our island is a signature achievement of U.S. foreign policy, and this story of peace is one that we both wrote together,\" Martin said.\n\nMartin commended Trump for leading peace negotiations in Ukraine and the Middle East during his visit to Washington, following Trump's contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office last month.\n\n\"We are ready to play our part in supporting work, to end conflict and to secure peace in the Ukraine, or in the Middle East or wherever. We welcome very much the unrelenting focus and effort that President Trump and his administration has brought to this task from his very first days in office,\" Martin added.\n\nYet, there were Irish officials who disagreed with Martin's sentiment and boycotted the events at the White House last week. Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald and Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O'Neill skipped St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations in the U.S. this year to protest Trump's calling for the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nTrump said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip.\" Trump also suggested relocating Palestinians to rebuild Gaza as the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"\n\nWhen reporters asked Trump about the boycott during the press conference in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said, \"I really haven't heard that.\" However, Trump also seemed to walk back his Gaza comments, telling a reporter: \"Nobody's expelling any Palestinians.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIreland is a long-time supporter of Palestinian independence, as many Irish draw parallels with the British occupation of Ireland. Ireland has advocated for full Palestinian statehood and a two-state solution throughout the war in Gaza. Irish citizens have vocally opposed the war in Gaza and consistently protested in support of Palestinians since the war began."

In a social media post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Rasool a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\" and President Trump.\n\nIn a diplomatic notice, the Department of State said that it would no longer recognize Ambassador Rasool as a \"member of the [South African] mission from today, March 17,\" adding that \"his privileges and immunities will cease\" and that he was \"persona non grata\" in the United States.\n\nThe expulsion came after Rasool, during a webinar hosted by the South African Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection, accused Mr. Trump of pursuing policies and practices that the diplomat characterized as \"a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States.\"\n\nRasool was expelled just two months after he arrived in Washington to serve as his country's envoy.\n\n\"Improving our relationship with the United States of America is a priority for us,\" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told journalists on Monday, calling the U.S. \"our second largest trading partner after China.\"\n\n\"We have noted the displeasure that has been expressed by the United States, particularly about the remarks he made,\" Ramaphosa said, adding that he expected Rasool to return to Pretoria and \"give me a full report.\"\n\nEbrahim Rasool speaks onstage on March 18, 2013, in New York City. Donald Bowers/Getty/Shared Interest\n\nIt's the latest in a string of incidents that have seen a marked deterioration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and South Africa since Mr. Trump took office for his second term in January.\n\nSpeaking on South African television on Saturday, the country's foreign minister said the decision by the U.S. to expel Rasool, who previously campaigned against the country's racist Apartheid regime, was \"unprecedented and regrettable,\" before adding: \"We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the U.S. can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them, because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy.\"\n\nA pro-Hamas, anti-Israel ambassador to the U.S.?\n\nRasool's appointment to head the South African diplomatic mission in the U.S., by the ruling African National Congress party, was a contentious one even before he arrived in Washington, dividing opinions within the country's new Government of National Unity (GNU). The ANC had to build the coalition government to maintain power after failing to win a significant enough majority in the last elections to govern on its own.\n\n\"Rasool's appointment was opposed by all of the other political parties in the GNU, and was the first large point of contention between the parties,\" Wiliam Gumede, a professor of public management at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, explained to CBS News.\n\n\"Eventually, the non-ANC partners caved in,\" Gumede said, which led to Rasool getting the job.\n\n\"He is perceived to be pro-Iran and Hamas, as well as strongly anti-Israel, which is largely why it was felt he was the wrong choice for the ambassador post,\" Gumede told CBS News.\n\nRasool has long been a controversial figure in South African politics, having spoken favorably of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas, and even boasting of his ties with the group's leadership. He is a strong backer of the case South Africa filed with the United Nations' top court, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently rejected that accusation, arguing that its war in the Palestinian enclave has been a legitimate self-defense against Hamas following the group's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.\n\nGumede said he believed the way for Ramaphosa to ease the tension with Washington was for the South African president to publicly label Rasool's comments \"unacceptable,\" while also giving a detailed acknowledgement of how important relations and aid from the U.S. are to South Africa.\n\nThe analyst said if such measures were not taken by Pretoria to smooth the relationship, the impasse could deepen, with significant implications for South Africa.\n\n\"I fear the next step steps could be targeted economic sanctions against South Africa, which would mean we are in danger of losing 300,000 to 400,000 direct jobs in the country, as well as hundreds of thousands more jobs through indirect channels,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not too late,\" Gumede added. \"President Trump has a lot of South Africans in his inner circle. We need to engage them and put together a team of non-ANC partners from the Government of National Unity to travel to the U.S. and engage the Trump team. The relationship is simply too important not to.\""

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIf Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, was who I believed him to be, he was not going to acknowledge it. He probably wouldn\u2019t talk to me. And seeing him was going to mean sitting on a plane for 20 hours and driving another eight. But I needed to try to have a conversation with him, and it had to be face-to-face.\n\nNakamoto had disappeared in the spring of 2011. I learned about him that summer, when I wrote one of the first magazine feature articles about Bitcoin, the internet-based currency that operates beyond the control of a government or bank. Twelve years later, Bitcoin\u2019s creator remained unknown and his enormous, multibillion-dollar fortune untouched. The modern history of science supplied no precedent for someone who brought a revolutionary technology into the world without taking credit, or spending a penny of the billions of dollars it earned him.\n\nDenied a flesh-and-blood human to venerate, acolytes of Bitcoin had conferred on the pseudonym the halo of legend. In 2022, Kanye West stepped from an Escalade in Beverly Hills wearing a Satoshi Nakamoto baseball hat. In Budapest, adherents unveiled the first statue of Nakamoto, a depiction in bronze of a hooded, spectral figure. A trio of libertarians bought a decommissioned cruise ship, christened it the MS Satoshi, and recruited settlers for the world\u2019s first sovereign Bitcoin-powered society. More than one fellow technologist lobbied for Nakamoto to receive a Nobel Prize.\n\nWhen I first wrote about Nakamoto in 2011, I couldn\u2019t have foreseen that more than a decade later his identity would remain a mystery. Since then, numerous attempts to unmask Nakamoto had failed, sometimes spectacularly. In 2014, Newsweek confidently identified the wrong guy, a California systems engineer whose real name was Dorian Nakamoto, unleashing a media siege of his house that lasted for days. Even 60 Minutes, with untold resources and a deep bench of seasoned investigative journalists, threw up its hands and declared the challenge \u201cmission impossible.\u201d Yet now, against all odds, I believed I had cracked it.\n\nI was nervous. This was someone who\u2019d gone to great lengths to be unfindable. And what I\u2019d learned about him was disturbing. He was nothing like how people had imagined Satoshi Nakamoto. He\u2019d repeatedly described himself as dangerous. He had guns.\n\nHe also owned at least four properties on two continents. I\u2019d initially thought he was hiding out in a remote part of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, but now, in the summer of 2023, I\u2019d come to believe that he lived in a small beach community on the east coast of Australia.\n\nI was fretting about all this when I met my sister for dinner.\n\nI told her my anxieties. She\u2019d been a TV-news producer for 20 years and had been onsite in Montana with 48 Hours after the FBI raided the Unabomber\u2019s property and arrested him.\n\nShe suggested I take professional security people with me. And that I wear a bulletproof vest. And give local police a heads-up.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumbled.\n\nLater that night, she texted me: \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep not sure why.\u201d\n\nIt was 4:09 a.m.\n\n\u201cTwo thoughts. Maybe doorstep him in a public place if he ever leaves the house. Also might be worth having someone video the encounter (from a safe distance) for evidence.\u201d\n\nCould It Be Elon Musk?\n\nEighteen months earlier, on New Year\u2019s Eve 2021, an email had arrived in my inbox.\n\n\u201cSubject: New information re Satoshi.\u201d\n\nSince writing that early Bitcoin article, I\u2019d periodically receive emails like this. Someone was always shopping a new Satoshi theory.\n\nUsually, I paid little heed to these, which tended to rekindle a fleeting hope of learning something fresh before proving unconvincing. This email had no text, but a link led to a blog post titled \u201cI\u2019m the SpaceX Intern Who Speculated Satoshi Is Elon Musk. There Is More to the Story.\u201d The author, Sahil Gupta, had produced a ripple on the internet four years earlier with another post making the case that Musk was \u201cprobably\u201d Nakamoto. Now he presented further evidence: an account of an interaction he\u2019d had with Musk\u2019s chief of staff, Sam Teller. It seemed slight and ambiguous, and I didn\u2019t respond.\n\nTwo days later, I received another email from the same address. This one contained a link to Gupta\u2019s detailed case for Musk as Nakamoto. I didn\u2019t know what to make of his arguments, which ranged from vague to highly technical. Still, I wrote back.\n\nSahil told me that in 2015, when he was an undergraduate at Yale, he\u2019d scored a summer internship writing inventory-management software at the SpaceX rocket factory in Hawthorne, California. Musk was in the office maybe three days a week, and Sahil would see him in the hallways. Sahil was majoring in computer science, and for a senior thesis he proposed a central-bank digital currency called fedcoin in which the U.S. improved the dollar by taking the best aspects of Bitcoin. The paper\u2019s acknowledgments thanked \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto for being a straight up legend.\u201d\n\nWhile researching the thesis, Sahil steeped himself in cryptocurrency literature, starting with the nine-page white paper where Nakamoto first described Bitcoin. Reading the Bitcoin creator\u2019s writing, he was struck by similarities to Musk\u2019s language. Both spoke of \u201corder of magnitude\u201d reasoning and used the word bloody. Nakamoto talked about money in a conceptual way, as Musk had done when he was an executive at PayPal in the early aughts. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of programming in the C++ language and was knowledgeable about cryptography. Sahil began to wonder: Might the inventor of Bitcoin have been in front of us all along, hiding in the dazzle of his own celebrity?\n\nWhen Sahil graduated from college, he decided he wanted to work directly for Musk. After emailing Musk several times, he got a phone interview with Teller, his chief of staff.\n\nAs the call with Teller drew to a close, Sahil took a chance:\n\n\u201cIs Elon Satoshi?\u201d\n\n\u201cTeller didn\u2019t say anything for 15 seconds,\u201d Sahil told me.\n\n\u201cThen he said, \u2018Well, what can I say?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was another big clue,\u201d Sahil said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s going on. Like, I surprised him. The answer I got is pretty telling.\u201d Later that year, Sahil wrote his \u201cElon Musk Probably Invented Bitcoin\u201d blog post. He argued that the Bitcoin community, which had been riven by strife over how and whether to mainstream the technology, would benefit from the return of its founder to guide it. A few cryptocurrency blogs picked up Sahil\u2019s theory, and Bloomberg News covered it. For his part, Musk tweeted: \u201cNot true. A friend sent me part of a [bitcoin] a few years [ago], but I don\u2019t know where it is.\u201d\n\nAs the years passed and he connected more dots, Sahil became even more convinced that Musk was Nakamoto. He noted that Luke Nosek, a cofounder of PayPal, had once said that the company\u2019s original goal was to develop a currency free from banks. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of using two spaces after a period in his writing. Musk regularly flew in and out of Van Nuys Airport, which matched up with perhaps the only security lapse Nakamoto had ever made: Early in Bitcoin\u2019s history, an email from Nakamoto to another software developer inadvertently betrayed an IP address in north Los Angeles. Sahil learned that early Bitcoin coders had considered Satoshi \u201cbossy\u201d; Musk was certainly that.\n\nIn late 2021, Musk had recently been named Time\u2019s Person of the Year. SpaceX had successfully docked a capsule at the International Space Station. Musk had even tweeted playfully about dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency (it subsequently went parabolic in price, then crashed). Sahil felt that the media might now finally be ready to accept that Nakamoto, who was now seen almost universally as a benevolent genius, and Musk were the same person.\n\nSahil told me he was \u201c99 percent sure\u201d about his theory. He chalked up others\u2019 doubts to prejudice against Musk.\n\nOkay, but Musk wasn\u2019t humble, so why would he deny being Bitcoin\u2019s creator? To Sahil, this was evidence of Musk\u2019s savvy. \u201cUnlike a company that needs marketing, Bitcoin was stronger and could grow faster, in the early days, when it had the aura of an anonymous founder.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know if Sahil was right, but I could relate to his fixation. Bitcoin had recently hit an all-time high of nearly $70,000 for a single coin, and the market value of all bitcoins in circulation had passed $1 trillion. El Salvador had recognized bitcoin as legal tender. In 2011, it hadn\u2019t seemed like such a big deal that no one knew who Nakamoto was. But how was it possible that even now no one knew?\n\nSix months later, I quit my job to devote myself full time to unraveling the mystery that had first beguiled me a decade earlier.\n\nThe Vanishing\n\nOn Halloween 2008, someone going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto had posted a short write-up outlining \u201ca peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d on an obscure, moderated email list about cryptography informally known as Metzdowd. That none of its subscribers had heard of Satoshi Nakamoto didn\u2019t strike anyone as odd. Metzdowd was frequented by people devoted to secrecy. They were used to aliases.\n\nIn his write-up, Nakamoto described a new kind of money. It would run on a network of volunteers\u2019 computers. It would use a transparent public ledger collectively maintained by the network, rather than relying on a bank\u2019s or government\u2019s database of debits and credits. Nakamoto included a link to a more detailed formal description that would come to be known as \u201cthe Bitcoin white paper.\u201d\n\nA few members of the list gave Nakamoto feedback on the software he was writing, and he gamely welcomed it. \u201cI appreciate your questions,\u201d he told one in an email, adding, \u201cI actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.\u201d In early January of 2009, Nakamoto released an alpha version of Bitcoin on SourceForge, then a popular site for open-source software projects, which welcome any programmers who want to take part. The first day, according to one early Bitcoiner, 127 people downloaded the Bitcoin software.\n\nA lot of the first participants were programmers who thought money was overdue for a product update. Paper bills and coins faded, wrinkled, tore, got dirty, spread germs. They were available only in fixed denominations, could be counterfeited, and were hard to move in any significant quantity. Bitcoin was durable, unforgeable, almost infinitely divisible. It might finally realize the internet commerce dream of microtransactions. You could send any amount of it anywhere instantly.\n\nBitcoin, as a currency based on 0s and 1s in a cloud maintained by far-flung, ordinary individuals, was also immune to meddling by central powers. Unlike bars of gold, bitcoin couldn\u2019t be seized. Unlike a bank account, it couldn\u2019t be frozen. Unlike a national currency, it couldn\u2019t be devalued at the whim of a central bank or subjected to capital controls by a dictator.\n\nAt the heart of Nakamoto\u2019s creation was something called the blockchain, an ever-lengthening record of all transactions (buy, sell, etc.) that had occurred in the system. Approximately every ten minutes, the latest batch of transaction records were bundled into a \u201cblock,\u201d and the block was \u201cchained\u201d onto the block that had preceded it using some clever math that made it impractical for anyone to go back and tamper with the block\u2019s contents. This record, or ledger, which in traditional finance would be maintained by an institution such as a government or bank, was maintained by a network of volunteers\u2019 computers, each of which ran the Bitcoin software and stored constantly updating copies of the ledger.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin was an open-source project \u2014 an it-takes-a-village group effort \u2014 someone needed to be in charge, and for the first 20 months that was Satoshi Nakamoto. He would release code, other developers would suggest patches, and he would integrate the ones he liked.\n\nFour months after Gavin Andresen, a software developer, began contributing programming code to the Bitcoin project, his dedication and computer-science chops seemed to have won Nakamoto\u2019s trust. First, Nakamoto gave Gavin direct access to the source code. Then, around September 2010, Nakamoto told Gavin that he was getting busy with other projects, and over the coming months he would hand over control of both the code repository on SourceForge and the project\u2019s \u201calert key,\u201d which allowed the broadcasting of urgent messages to all machines running the Bitcoin software. For an open-source project, these were the closest things to a leadership badge; at that point Gavin effectively became the project\u2019s head developer, guiding a team of five other volunteer coders.\n\nOver the next few months, Nakamoto continued to chime in occasionally on technical questions, but Gavin\u2019s openness chafed against his reclusive tendencies. After PayPal and Visa froze WikiLeaks\u2019s accounts, a faction of Bitcoiners argued that the cryptocurrency could be helpful to the controversial organization. \u201cBring it on,\u201d someone wrote on a forum called BitcoinTalk. Nakamoto bristled. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2018bring it on.\u2019 The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin \u2026 The heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.\u201d\n\nFor journalists covering Bitcoin, Gavin had become the natural person to call first. His mild, reasonable manner and willingness to use his real name made him the Bitcoin ambassador Nakamoto had never been. But Nakamoto seemed to grow uncomfortable with Gavin\u2019s interactions with media. In late April of 2011, Nakamoto emailed Gavin: \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle.\u201d\n\nThis turned out to be the last time Gavin heard from Nakamoto. When I first spoke with Gavin that July, he said he hadn\u2019t communicated with Nakamoto \u201cin a couple months.\u201d After Gavin told Nakamoto in an email on April 26 that he\u2019d agreed to give a talk on Bitcoin to the crypto-curious CIA at its headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Nakamoto never responded. Around the same date, Nakamoto wrote emails to at least one other programmer who\u2019d worked on the project.\n\nThen he went silent. He\u2019s never been heard from again, with the possible exception of a single forum post years later that may or may not have been Nakamoto\u2019s.\n\nGavin and the other early Bitcoin developers agreed on a few things about Satoshi\u2019s identity. The second place Nakamoto had announced his white paper was the website of the P2P Foundation, an idealistic nonprofit dedicated to peer-to-peer networks of all kinds. In his profile on the site, Nakamoto gave his residence as Japan. But no one believed he was Japanese. His English was flawless. He sounded British. In both the Bitcoin source code and his posts to the BitcoinTalk forum, Nakamoto favored Anglo spellings like colour and optimise.\n\nNakamoto guarded his identity closely. When registering the domain bitcoin.org, he had done so through a masking service called anonymousspeech.com, which itself had been registered from a temporary-housing broker in Tokyo. That service gave him an email address at vistomail.com, which offered the option of manipulating the date and time an email was sent. A third email address Nakamoto used was from gmx.com, another free webmail provider. In communication, Nakamoto expressed himself with a practiced opacity. He\u2019d answer technical questions but would ignore attempts to draw him out on personal matters.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s programming style was a bit dated, suggesting he might be on the older side. He used something called Hungarian notation, a convention of variable naming popular among Windows programmers in the 1990s.\n\nGavin had the impression that the Bitcoin code had been written by a small group or even just one person. When programmers collaborate, they tend to insert regular comments in their code, telling one another what this or that block of instructions is supposed to accomplish. The Bitcoin software contained few of these. Others felt that Bitcoin worked too smoothly from the moment it launched to be the product of a single brain. And the white paper used \u201cwe,\u201d which suggested Satoshi Nakamoto must be the catch-all for a group of people or an institution.\n\nEven before Nakamoto evaporated, he was coming to be revered. On April 16, 2011, a BitcoinTalker named Wobber pointed out how varied Nakamoto\u2019s expertise was, and how unusual his behavior \u2014 to come up with something so innovative, not take credit for it or exploit his stature, and leave without telling anyone. Someone likened Nakamoto to Zorro or a masked David who\u2019d aimed his slingshot at the Goliath of banks and governments.\n\nMight the name itself contain a clue? Satoshi Nakamoto, roughly translated from Japanese, could mean \u201ccentral intelligence.\u201d Perhaps this pointed to the role of spies in Bitcoin\u2019s creation. Maybe the National Security Agency was playing a long game, launching an off-the-books financial network it could use either to pay assets in the field, anywhere in the world, or as a honeypot where adversaries would transact with a false sense of security while the spooks at Fort Meade monitored their every move.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a totally crazy idea. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory had birthed the Onion Router, the anonymizing software known as TOR that enabled the dark web. The FBI would later secretly create its own line of encrypted phones and a messaging service, ANOM, that were unwittingly adopted by organized criminals, resulting in more than 800 arrests. And in the summer of 1996, researchers in the Cryptology Division of the NSA\u2019s Office of Information Security Research and Technology had internally published a paper, later made public, titled \u201cHow to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.\u201d\n\nYou could also read Nakamoto\u2019s name as a portmanteau of big tech-company names \u2014 SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi, MOTOrola \u2014 so maybe a corporate cabal was behind it. Redditors pooled their deciphering skills, also finding Satoshi Nakamoto to be an anagram of, among other phrases, \u201cMa, I took NSA\u2019s oath\u201d and \u201cSo a man took a shit.\u201d\n\nDan Kaminsky, who\u2019d shot to prominence as a young programmer in 2008 when he discovered a technical glitch that could have undermined the entire internet, thought Nakamoto might be a group at a bank. \u201cI suspect Satoshi is a small team at a financial institution,\u201d Dan told me. \u201cI just get that feeling.\u201d\n\nBut Kaminsky added that he didn\u2019t think that Satoshi\u2019s identity \u201cis that critical to what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is larger than Satoshi.\u201d This jibed with a sentiment I\u2019d heard voiced more than once: The whole idea of Nakamoto as an unknown pseudonymous entity who\u2019d dematerialized was an integral part of Bitcoin\u2019s design.\n\n\u201cWe Do Not Know Who Satoshi Is\u201d\n\nAt the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, Satoshi Nakamoto was, in absentia, everywhere. The Nakamoto Stage, where the keynotes and most important panels took place, was flanked by illuminated screens featuring a rotating display of snippets from his writings. They had the Dianetics-like quality of being banal to outsiders and profound to insiders.\n\nImagine if gold turned to lead when stolen.\n\nI\u2019m sure that in twenty years there will either be very large Bitcoin transaction volume \u2026 or no volume.\n\nThe network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.\n\nPeter Thiel, the PayPal founder turned venture capitalist, emerged stage right and threw a wad of hundred-dollar bills into the front rows: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy that this stuff still works, you know?\u201d Bitcoin was a warning, he said, that the fiat system was over.\n\nWhat stood in the way of the crypto revolution, Thiel said, were \u201cthe enemies of this movement,\u201d among whom he enumerated Warren Buffett, JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Thiel told the crowd that the enemies he\u2019d named were \u201cextensions of the state.\u201d Bitcoin, by contrast, wasn\u2019t a company and had no board. \u201cWe do not know who Satoshi is,\u201d Thiel added for emphasis.\n\nWe do not know who Satoshi is. Back in 2011, he\u2019d been the no-name coder of an experimental money that was of interest mainly to a fringe community. Ten years later, he was the mythic founder of a project with a $1 trillion market capitalization, making it the ninth-most-valuable asset in the world, just below Tesla and above Meta. Whoever Nakamoto was, he was fantastically rich. Through some clever analysis of the early blockchain, a computer scientist named Sergio Demian Lerner had estimated that, at the time, Nakamoto held some $40 billion worth of bitcoin (today the figure is much higher). Nakamoto was by far the largest holder of the currency.\n\nWhen the crypto exchange Coinbase went public in the spring of 2021, one of the risk factors listed in the prospectus the company filed with the SEC was the public identification of Nakamoto. It wasn\u2019t hard to think of scenarios where who Nakamoto was \u2014 and what his motives and intentions were \u2014 might be relevant. In the Bitcoin realm, the Nakamoto mystery was coming to be seen as necessary \u2014 a feature rather than a bug. To be truly decentralized required that Bitcoin have a virgin birth. Depriving it of a human figurehead, a flawed individual with a particular identity that might be palatable to one group but not to another, gave it the best shot at being taken up en masse.\n\nAnd so the Nakamoto alias had come to be hallowed. While some people conjectured that the Bitcoin creator had gone to ground mainly for his own protection, lest he be prosecuted for tax evasion or physically attacked for his coin stash, the common view was that he\u2019d acted selflessly. The most zealous Bitcoiners treated inquiries into Nakamoto\u2019s identity as a sort of blasphemy, as if they were Scientologists being asked about Xenu.\n\nBut What If Bitcoin\u2019s Founder Is a Toxic Villain?\n\nIn the summer of 2022, I tacked a spreadsheet of the hundred-plus candidates who\u2019d ever been proposed as Satoshi Nakamoto onto my office wall. Most of the leading candidates were cypherpunks whose names had been floated as possible Satoshis many times over the years. There were more obscure names from adjacent fields like math, cryptography, and economics. Some were programmers involved early on with the Bitcoin software project. Others were creators of newer cryptocurrencies. Many were just Famous Smart People: Bill Gates. Steve Jobs. Musk.\n\nFor a number of years, the consensus leading candidates have generally been considered to be Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney. Szabo, a programmer who had advocated for decentralized money years before Bitcoin appeared, had conceived a kind of Bitcoin precursor called \u201cBit Gold\u201d in the late nineties. He had the necessary technical skills, and there were superficial similarities between his writing style and Nakamoto\u2019s. But he has always denied being Satoshi, and no definitive evidence linking him to Nakamoto or to Bitcoin\u2019s early development has ever been produced. Adam Back\u2019s name was mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper as the creator of another cryptocurrency precursor, Hashcash, and his email address is one of the first to have been contacted by Nakamoto. He, too, denies being Nakamoto, and his writing style matches up less closely than Szabo\u2019s. Hal Finney, a legendary programmer and cryptographer, received the first-ever Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto. But Finney, who also denied being Satoshi, was diagnosed with ALS in 2009, declining rapidly to the point where he was physically incapacitated. If ever Satoshi were to be unmasked, Finney is the most hoped-for candidate among Bitcoiners because of his tragic-heroic story and his general aura of kindly benevolence \u2014 and also because, being conveniently deceased (he died in 2014), he can\u2019t create unsavory press with unsavory behavior or associations.\n\nThere had always been the faction hostile to inquiry about Nakamoto\u2019s identity. Last fall, when an HBO documentary posited that a libertarian Canadian computer programmer and crypto enthusiast named Peter Todd was the most likely candidate, the Bitcoin community reacted not just with strong skepticism about the documentary\u2019s conclusion but with anger that such a project had even been undertaken. He has made a valuable contribution, so his wishes for anonymity should be honored. What matters is not the person but the idea, the code.\n\nBut Nakamoto had plunked his gizmo in the public square, so I felt it was reasonable to inquire who\u2019d put it there and why.\n\nI combed through the 60,000 words Satoshi Nakamoto had left behind. He wrote in a plain style, rarely opining or showing personality. Whenever I found the slightest hint of individual style, I\u2019d add it to a list of Nakamoto-isms, which eventually included more than 200 words and phrases. Wet blanket. Sweet. Clobbering.\n\nI wrote a computer program, the Satoshitizer, which trawled through the archived writings of various suspects, scanning for Nakamoto-isms and generating tables of statistics. I could instantly rank an archive using more than a dozen criteria, including users of Nakamoto-isms, users of e-cash terminology, and discussers of software tools employed by Nakamoto.\n\nOne day in late April 2023, I found myself thinking about a word I\u2019d seen in Nakamoto\u2019s writings: hosed.\n\nGiven Nakamoto\u2019s tendency to write in a style stripped of personality or association with any particular milieu, hosed stood out. I hadn\u2019t recently heard the word, in its sense of screwed or wrecked, and vaguely associated it with turn-of-the-1990s surfing or fraternity lingo.\n\nI went back through my scraped archives and noted each time someone used the word. I looked at Metzdowd. In the three years leading up to October 31, 2008, when Nakamoto first announced Bitcoin there, the word had been used four times. Twice it was by the same person: James A. Donald.\n\nThough Donald hadn\u2019t played much of a role in the public discussion of Bitcoin, he\u2019d had a cameo in its early history as the first person on the discussion list to respond to Nakamoto. Donald\u2019s response had been a technical criticism related to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling potential, and after a few exchanges with Nakamoto he\u2019d dropped out of the conversation. He was just one of many cypherpunks who\u2019d been interested in digital money.\n\nAt that point, Donald was only No. 42 on my Suspects spreadsheet, far below the consensus leading candidates and on the list at all primarily because he was a cypherpunk and libertarian who had coded in C++. But intrigued by the \u201chosed\u201d coincidence, I went back and looked at the lists of rare words the Satoshitizer had compiled. I wanted to see whether Donald had used any other rare Nakamoto-isms.\n\nHe had. Donald showed up as the only person on any of the two decades\u2019 worth of lists I\u2019d scraped who had ever used the word fencible \u2014 in the sense of stolen goods \u201cable to be fenced.\u201d This was a word Nakamoto had used once, in the expression non-fencible. And it appeared in a post by Donald on the cypherpunks list in October of 1998. My brain started pinging. The verb fence was common enough slang, but the adjective fencible was an oddity. A Google search turned up hardly any instances on the internet. When I queried the archives of the daily New York Times, which went back to 1857 and included more than 13 million articles, fencible, in the sense I was interested in, hadn\u2019t appeared once.\n\nUnlike, say, trusted third party or zero-knowledge proofs, which are unexceptional in conversations among digital-cash or crypto experts, fencible and hosed weren\u2019t words unique to cryptography or even to computer science. They were more revealing of someone\u2019s voice.\n\nI began looking more closely at Donald. He had a slippery internet presence. Websites variously declared that he was Canadian, that he had died, and that \u201cJames A. Donald\u201d wasn\u2019t his real name. In his posts, he almost never revealed personal details, but a few were strewn here and there. He was Australian but had lived in Silicon Valley for many years. Like Nakamoto, he sometimes used American spellings and other times used Commonwealth spellings.\n\nIdeologically, Donald had fused a libertarianism so extreme that it was really anarcho-capitalism with a fervent conviction in the world-changing power of cryptography. \u201cSo guys, that is the plan,\u201d he wrote in 1996. \u201cWe destroy the state through higher mathematics. We do this by replacing the current institutional mechanisms of corporations with cryptographic mechanisms. This will give more people the opportunity to evade and resist taxes.\u201d\n\nHe had a particular interest in digital money. \u201cEventually people will bypass the banks, directly transferring funds to each other,\u201d he wrote in 1995. On Metzdowd, between 2006 and 2009, Donald employed more of the e-cash vocabulary Nakamoto used than any other poster.\n\nI examined Donald\u2019s programming style. In the late 1990s, he\u2019d promoted a piece of communications encryption software called Crypto Kong. He\u2019d written it in C++, the language Nakamoto used for Bitcoin. Using the Wayback Machine, I found an archived copy of the source code. Crypto Kong bore other similarities to Bitcoin. Like Nakamoto, Donald had coded the software for Windows and, more esoterically, used the Hungarian notation that Nakamoto did. Like Nakamoto, Donald used sweeping lines of slashes to separate sections of code. Like Bitcoin, Crypto Kong used elliptic curve cryptography to generate private-public key pairs.\n\nI gleaned more information about Donald. He was born in 1952, so was now over 70 \u2014 fitting the profile of an older programmer that various early Bitcoin developers had noted Nakamoto\u2019s coding style suggested. Donald wasn\u2019t on Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn, at least under his own name. His $2.8 million Palo Alto house was blurred on Google Street View, as was his $400,000 Austin house. This was an option you could exercise only by submitting a formal request to Google (or perhaps by working at Google, as one of Donald\u2019s two sons had). There were no easily found photographs of him. Like Nakamoto, Donald used a privacy-focused email provider, Switzerland-based Proton Mail. He had a blog titled Jim\u2019s Blog, untethered from his last name. He had spent, he\u2019d told the blog\u2019s readers, \u201ca lot of time off the grid.\u201d Click-click-click. The tumblers were falling into place.\n\nI now began to think about the significance of Donald\u2019s response to Nakamoto being the first. I pictured Nakamoto in 2008: He\u2019d just launched his work of genius into the world and \u2026 crickets. So he decided to both nudge things along (while also creating a useful misdirection) by lobbing a criticism at himself.\n\nJim\u2019s Blog revealed a few more clues. In the run-up to October 31, 2008, Donald had been focused on the financial crisis. His post on October 11, titled \u201cThe Cause of the Crisis,\u201d began: \u201cThe bailout will fail.\u201d This was notable because the London Times headline embedded in the Bitcoin Genesis block, the first block in the chain produced by Satoshi, had been \u201cChancellor on Brink of Second Bailout.\u201d\n\nI found further coincidences. Donald owned several pieces of property in Hawaii. On June 19, 2008, a few months before Satoshi Nakamoto began communicating with the world about his invention, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser had run an obituary for \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto,\u201d a veteran of World War II who\u2019d died at 84. Could Donald have lifted the name when casting about for a pseudonym?\n\nThough \u201cJim\u201d rarely mentioned any details that betrayed his identity or location, he revealed things about his beliefs in various posts. Before he was a libertarian or crypto-anarchist, he\u2019d been a radical leftist. At age 15, he\u2019d joined the Spartacists, a faction of Trotskyites, but \u201cI became disillusioned with the sparts, and disillusioned by participatory democracy\u2014and none too keen on representative democracy either.\u201d At 17, he joined two other radical groups, the anarcho-socialists and the Maoists, \u201cmostly because these were the two groups most hated by the trots.\u201d Eventually he concluded that freedom lay in property rights, and he became an anarcho-capitalist.\n\nI spoke with people who\u2019d known him when he was a graduate student in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney. Bob Hewitt, who was on the department faculty, interviewed Donald as part of the application process. Donald had come from Melbourne, and Bob recalled him as \u201cbohemian\u201d; asked whether he\u2019d arranged for a place to stay in Sydney, Donald said he\u2019d sleep under a bridge. He was \u201ca friendly kind of guy,\u201d Hewitt said, \u201cjust strange.\u201d\n\nDonald never completed the Ph.D. program. Every student was supposed to give a colloquium, but \u201cno one understood what he was saying,\u201d Hewitt recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t say he was brilliant, but he was certainly incomprehensible when he tried to explain his paper.\u201d Donald ended up dropping out after his dissertation, \u201cAssumptions of the Singularity Theorems and the Rejuvenation of Universes,\u201d was rejected.\n\nHe started writing software for Apple computers, then moved to the U.S. and programmed video games for Epyx. Later, he worked at database companies.\n\nPoring over Jim\u2019s Blog, I saw that Donald had an authoritative understanding of Bitcoin and its vulnerabilities; he clearly took a long, historical view of it as a stepping stone toward a particular future he wanted. Bitcoin, he wrote, \u201cis a prototype that is prematurely being used as the final system.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d never shared the presumption, prevalent in the Bitcoin world, that Nakamoto must be a benign figure. I\u2019d always felt that the Bitcoiners who elevated Nakamoto to semi-divine status were indulging in wishful projection: that he was selfless. That he was humble. That he had come from the future to exalt humanity. Hal Finney had made for a particularly appealing Satoshi Nakamoto because he lived up to that image.\n\nDonald did not. On his blog, Donald espoused a dark ideology called neoreaction that had beguiled certain people in Silicon Valley. Neoreactionaries believed that society had been hijacked by what they called the Cathedral \u2014 academic and media and bureaucratic elites. They disdained efforts to achieve social justice. The best way forward, they argued, was to jettison democracy and restore a monarchy. Donald\u2019s particular flavor of neoreaction also incorporated an overtly Christian element and a generous dose of paranoia; he attributed the COVID pandemic to a Jesuit conspiracy.\n\nAlong with his baroque politics, Donald produced a regular feed of racist, homophobic, and misogynist opinions and offensive language. He was so abrasive that, in 2014, even Slate Star Codex, an influential Silicon Valley blog with a history of tolerating discussion of taboo subjects like IQ science, had banned him. But on his blog, hosted on a relatively uncensorable domain in Laos, he advocated \u201cwhipping a woman on the buttocks or upper back\u201d to keep her in line and argued that \u201cvery few rape accusations are true.\u201d Donald had a substantial following in the red-pilled, alt-right blogosphere.\n\nIf Donald was Nakamoto, wasn\u2019t it obvious why he\u2019d chosen a pseudonym when launching Bitcoin? He wanted his work of genius to be taken on its own terms rather than dismissed because it was his. He had hidden not because Bitcoin could be a risk to him but because he could be a risk to Bitcoin.\n\nI wondered whether there were crypto people who knew or suspected that Donald was Nakamoto. If Nakamoto were a harmless private citizen like Dorian Nakamoto, \u201cSatoshi deserves his privacy\u201d would be at least a reasonable position to take. If Nakamoto were a dissident living under an autocratic regime, I\u2019d want to protect his secret too. But if Nakamoto were Donald? It would undermine the narrative of Bitcoin\u2019s inventor as a crypto Christ who\u2019d passed up fame and treasure for the sake of a higher good. Was it possible that some of the Satoshi-deserves-his-privacy people, recognizing that it would be a PR calamity for Bitcoin to have been invented by a far-right whackjob, were really just safeguarding the reputation of their religion and the value of their investments? In June 2020, the HashCash founder Adam Back, himself long suspected by some of being Satoshi, had tweeted: \u201cMaybe we should get mentally prepared to disown Satoshi. Nuke the nym from orbit, just to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatoshi\u2019s identity doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Ray Dillinger, who along with Hal Finney had done code review for Nakamoto before Bitcoin\u2019s launch, wrote. \u201cThe protocol is what it is. If it\u2019s a third-world dictator, a homeless guy living under a bridge in Belize, a Bedouin working from a cell phone as she traverses Bir Tawil on a camel, or a pushcart vendor in Nairobi, the protocol is exactly the same as it would be if it were a cryptanalyst working for the NSA or someone at a \u2018troll farm\u2019 drawing a salary from the GRU, or a well-known Security researcher or Cypherpunk. \u2018Satoshi\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist outside that protocol. Satoshi is just a hat somebody wore while they were developing it. And it doesn\u2019t matter who was wearing the hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Know Who Nakamoto Was\u201d\n\nI wrote to Jim Donald asking for an interview. Several days later, to my surprise, I heard back from him. \u201cEmail discussion would be convenient,\u201d Donald wrote, but he might be able to talk over phone or video. He\u2019d have to let me know in a few days.\n\nTwo months later, Donald still hadn\u2019t made himself available for a live conversation. Should I travel all the way to Australia to find him in person? One thing that gave me pause about Donald as Nakamoto was that Nakamoto, in his communications, displayed a recognizable range of emotion. He could be appreciative (\u201cMany thanks\u201d), compassionate (\u201cpoor thing\u201d), humble (\u201cmy apologies\u201d), and modest (\u201cI\u2019m better with code than with words\u201d). I scrolled through years of Jim\u2019s writings, squinting for a trace of empathy or gratitude or enthusiasm, hoping to see an exclamation point, or an apology, or a moment of sympathy or fellowship. Instead, I saw only flatness.\n\nBut of all the cypherpunks preoccupied with digital cash, only one had ever said they knew Satoshi\u2019s identity. \u201cI know who Nakamoto was,\u201d James Donald had written in a comment on a comment on a post on Jim\u2019s Blog, \u201cand what his political and social goals were.\u201d If true, this would make him the only person on record who credibly possessed this knowledge. I decided I needed to see him.\n\nThough Donald had spent most of his career in California, he clearly owned or had owned a house in Australia. Looking through real-estate assessment records for his various U.S. properties, I\u2019d found that for a couple of years in the aughts, a house he owned in Austin was registered to him at a street address on the northeastern coast of Australia. In more recent assessments, the U.S. properties were registered to him in the same Australian town, though now only a PO box was given. I knew his wife had died in 2016, and using the Find a Grave site, I found a photograph from the Australian town\u2019s cemetery of a plaque memorializing her. Five years later, he\u2019d posted a small photo on his blog of what appeared to be the view from his deck: In the foreground was a small glass and a jug of what he described as homemade moonshine. In the distance was a gleaming blue sea, the horizon disrupted by a couple of small islands. I compared this view with other ocean-view images taken from the same town, and they seemed to match.\n\nI found a private investigator, Daniel Quinn, who lived within a reasonable drive of the seaside town where I suspected Donald was. I sent Quinn the house address and a 20-year-old photo of Donald I\u2019d found on an abandoned college blog of one of his sons.\n\nA few days later, Daniel sent me a surveillance report. \u201cThe yard is in a very unkempt state with very long grass and overgrown shrubbery and trees, he\u2019s definitely not a plant lover.\u201d He attached a photo of James\u2019s house and the patchy driveway it shared with two other homes. There was a lonely palm tree near the curb, and up the hill was a bungalow on stilts, set amid the overgrowth, with a deck looking out at the Coral Sea.\n\nDaniel didn\u2019t see James that day, but several weeks later, I awoke to a message: Daniel had managed to get a photo of a man standing in the house\u2019s doorway. He was a clear 20-years-older match to the man in the photo I\u2019d sent. Same dense beard, though now it was white. Similar large metal-rim glasses. Same fleshy nose. Three days later, I was on a plane to Australia.\n\n\u2018I Have a Tendency to Talk Too Much\u2019\n\nThere was a screen door and no doorbell, so I knocked on James\u2019s doorframe. My mouth was dry from nerves. While I wasn\u2019t convinced that James himself was necessarily Nakamoto, I thought he might have been part of Nakamoto. In any case, he was the sole remaining person I knew of who claimed to know who Nakamoto was.\n\nI worried about how he\u2019d receive me. James had gone out of his way to be unfindable.\n\nCrossing his porch toward the front door, I could see Donald sitting at a computer in the living room and wearing headphones. His latest blog post, put up just a few hours earlier, was a rambling screed about how Georgians (as in the country of Georgia) don\u2019t want \u201ctheir Churches destroyed or turned into shrines of Gaia and gay sex, their old and beautiful buildings bulldozed and replaced by demonic postmodern eyesores.\u201d\n\nWestern NGOs were working to see \u201cGeorgia faggotized and thrown into the meat grinder against Russia.\u201d\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t respond to my knock on the doorframe, I knocked directly on the front door. A moment later James opened it and stepped outside in black long johns and a red camouflage long-sleeved shirt.\n\nI started talking. I\u2019d sent him an email and \u2014\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m rather sporadic at reading my emails,\u201d James said. I reminded him of our exchange the prior year and of the book I was writing.\n\n\u201cAh, right,\u201d James said.\n\nI said something about how I\u2019d have been remiss if I didn\u2019t make every effort to speak with him.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d James said. \u201cWell, the short of it is that I can\u2019t even tell you what I don\u2019t tell you.\u201d His tone was pleasant, bemused.\n\nI pointed out that he\u2019d publicly insisted he knew who Nakamoto was and what his social and political goals were. Could he elaborate?\n\n\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay \u2026 Do you really know? Or do you sort of think you have a strong idea of who it might be?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a very good idea of who it might be, but I don\u2019t actually, uh, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it was Hal Finney?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that just because you\u2019re respecting his privacy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to tell anyone anything, and I\u2019m not allowed to tell people what I\u2019ve already told \u2019em.\u201d\n\nCould I buy him a beer while I was in town?\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d James said. \u201cIn wine there is truth. And I\u2019m obligated not to tell people the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cLunch?\u201d I offered.\n\nJames laughed. \u201cLook,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a tendency to talk too much, and I have a big tendency to talk too much after a few drinks, so I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nI tried to keep the conversation going \u2014 giving him my contact information along with a previous book I\u2019d written \u2014 but his answers became monosyllabic.\n\n\u201cWell, I can understand why you\u2019d live here,\u201d I said, gesturing at his stunning view.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James said, looking down.\n\nI thanked him and made my way back down the hill.\n\nThere Is No Paternity Test for Bitcoin\n\nI\u2019d spent 15 years trying to identify Satoshi. In pursuit of this quest, I\u2019d learned to code, recruited a machine-learning expert and a stylometry specialist and a private investigator, and made a 37-hour journey for a three-minute encounter. I was pretty sure no one had spent as much time as I had in trying to solve this. I was starting to feel a kinship with Sahil Gupta, who couldn\u2019t be persuaded that Nakamoto was anyone other than Elon Musk. At some point, I needed to stop.\n\nPerhaps someday AI will allow us to definitively identify Satoshi. But I am now convinced that, barring some unpredictable declassification of a government secret, we will likely never know beyond a reasonable doubt who he was. Memories fade. People die. There is no paternity test for Bitcoin, no way to prove who Nakamoto is unless he comes forward and demonstrates that he has the relevant private keys, or at least non-forged contemporaneous documents supporting his story. As years pass, the trail, if there was one, grows fainter.\n\nI felt some relief in accepting this. I remained dazzled by the achievement of Nakamoto\u2019s invention \u2014 but almost equally by the perfection of his vanishing. As a utopian project, Bitcoin had never stood a chance. But as a new asset class, it has proved resilient. Its price continues to rise and fall, and rise again, reaching a new all-time high above $109,000 in January. (As of this writing, it\u2019s at $85,000.) Fidelity now advises retail clients to allocate a small portion of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrency. The spread of blockchain technology feels inevitable.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was something that whoever was behind the pseudonym could never be \u2014 an idea that, without a body or a history to drag it down, would live forever.\n\nExcerpted from The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-Year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius Behind Crypto by Benjamin Wallace (Crown), out March 18."

            "full_content": "Summary President Donald Trump plans to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday about efforts to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nMeetings between American negotiators with representatives from Ukraine and Russia will continue this week, as Trump said negotiators have discussed \"dividing up certain assets.\"\n\nTerritorial concessions remain a particularly sensitive issue. American officials have said Ukraine will likely need to cede territory for the war to end, and Putin has made it a condition of entering into a ceasefire.\n\nConceding territory has long been a nonstarter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and some European leaders have voiced concern about appearing to reward Putin for launching his invasion.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nNegotiators working to end the Russia-Ukraine war have already discussed \u201cdividing up certain assets,\u201d US President Donald Trump said Sunday as he announced he planned to speak to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come after he announced last week that Ukraine had accepted a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire, putting the ball in Russia\u2019s court as to whether it would accept his proposal to swiftly end the war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing pretty well, I think, with Russia. We\u2019ll see if we have something to announce maybe by Tuesday, I\u2019ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday,\u201d he told reporters on board Air Force One during a flight back to the White House after his weekend at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\u201cA lot of work\u2019s been done over the weekend, we want to see if we can bring that war to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we can, maybe we can\u2019t, but I think we have a very good chance.\u201d\n\nTrump said negotiators had already pinpointed certain topics up for discussion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about land. A lot of land is a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We\u2019ll be talking about land, we\u2019ll be talking about power plants, that\u2019s a big question,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much, by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We\u2019re already talking about that \u2013 dividing up certain assets.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin spokesperson confirmed that the two leaders would speak Tuesday but did not disclose any further details.\n\nPutin\u2019s response so far to the Trump-backed ceasefire proposal has been ambiguous. He said that Moscow agreed with the proposal in theory. But he also set out tough conditions and demanded concessions from Kyiv, and repeated his claim that the current Ukrainian government was part of the \u201croot cause\u201d of the war.\n\nMeetings between American negotiators with representatives from Ukraine and Russia will continue this week. The Kremlin also said last week that US negotiators would travel to Russia for further talks, though it did not share details on the participants.\n\nRussia first started seizing parts of Ukraine in 2014 before launching its full invasion in 2022, triggering the largest land conflict in Europe since World War Two. Since the 2022 invasion, Ukraine has lost control of about 11% of its land, according to CNN analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor.\n\nLand concessions are among the most sensitive issues left to hammer out. American officials have said Ukraine will likely need to cede territory for the war to end, and Putin has made it a condition of entering into a ceasefire.\n\nBut conceding territory has long been a nonstarter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and some European leaders have voiced concern about appearing to reward Putin for launching his invasion. Russia has also made clear it has no desire to give up the swathes of Ukrainian territory it has occupied.\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to grant Moscow concessions even before talks began and his embrace of Putin have also rattled NATO allies in Europe who are now openly questioning whether decades of US security guarantees towards the continent can be relied upon.\n\nTrump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN on Sunday that the ongoing talks over Ukraine were productive, but didn\u2019t say how the matter of territorial concessions would be resolved.\n\nPutin \u201caccepts the philosophy of President Trump\u201d in wanting to see the war come to an end, Witkoff said. He described his meeting last week with Putin as a \u201csolution-based discussion,\u201d and voiced confidence that a pause in fighting could arrive within weeks.\n\nPutin also said Friday that his country is working at restoring relations with the US, after they were \u201cpractically reduced to zero, destroyed by the previous American administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, the situation is starting to move,\u201d he said, referring to relations with the Trump administration. \u201cLet\u2019s see what comes out of this.\u201d"

Mark Kelly sparred on social media Monday, with the tech billionaire calling the Arizona Democrat a \u201ctraitor\u201d over a series of posts in support of Ukraine and its people.\n\nKelly said in his initial post Sunday that his trip over the weekend to the war-torn country, where he met with military members, nurses and others, had reaffirmed his commitment to not give up on the Ukrainian people. He added that any peace deal with Russia \u201chas to protect Ukraine\u2019s security and can\u2019t be a giveaway\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nKelly also criticized President Donald Trump, saying he was \u201ctrying to weaken Ukraine\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a traitor,\u201d Musk wrote on X on Monday, the platform he owns, in response to Kelly\u2019s posts.\n\n\u201cTraitor? Elon, if you don\u2019t understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do,\u201d Kelly responded.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe senator's trip came shortly after the Trump administration paused military aid to Ukraine in the wake of an explosive meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over what they called his lack of gratitude for U.S. assistance in the three years since Russia invaded his country.\n\nKelly also shot back at Musk, the head of SpaceX and architect of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, while speaking to reporters Monday on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s slashed and burned the federal government to make room for a giant tax cut for billionaires like himself. I\u2019ve sworn an oath to this country, I\u2019ve flown in combat, I served in the Navy for 25 years. It appears to me the oath that Elon Musk stands by is the oath to billionaires to make their lives easier, not the American people, not veterans,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a serious guy. He should go back to building rockets.\u201d\n\nKelly said that his Ukraine visit was emotional at times, and that he believes Putin needs to come out of any deal feeling like it was a \"bad deal\" for him.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is set to attend talks with Zelenskyy in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Rubio and other U.S. officials previously met with a Russian delegation to discuss peace negotiations.\n\nIn addition to efforts to drastically reduce U.S. government spending, Musk has faced criticism in the past over Ukraine.\n\nIn 2023, Musk thwarted a Ukraine attack on Russia's navy, and suggested in a Twitter poll in 2022 that Ukraine should allow Russia to take control of Crimea, among other concessions, as part of a peace deal.\n\nThe fiery exchange is not the first time Kelly and the tech billionaire turned Trump adviser have engaged in a public spat.\n\nLast month, Musk called Kelly a \u201cDem donor shill\u201d in a post criticizing his twin brother, also a former astronaut, and the Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen.\n\n\u201cHey @ElonMusk, when you finally get the nerve to climb into a rocket ship, come talk to the three of us,\u201d Kelly fired back."

            "full_content": "Love may be blind, but political differences can still be a deal-breaker.\n\nSuch was the case for two contestants on season 8 of Netflix\u2019s popular reality show \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Contestants Sara Carton and Virginia Miller shocked fans during last week\u2019s season finale when both turned down their respective matches, Ben Mezzenga and Devin Buckley.\n\nBoth women cited differences in political views as the key reasons for their reluctance, which has reignited discourse online about whether romantic relationships can thrive without political compatibility. Some viewers called out Carton and Miller for not wanting to be with their partners because they aren\u2019t \u201cwoke.\u201d Others praised them for staying true to their values.\n\nIn recent years, politics and dating has continued to be a hot topic, especially as the country has become more politically and culturally divided. A recent report from the Survey Center on American Life, a nonpartisan research group, found that \u201c73% of college-educated single women would be less likely to date a Trump supporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d which this season centered on Minneapolis residents, explores whether or not people can fall in love before they ever see each other in person. In \u201cpods,\u201d contestants date one other, talking through a wall for hours on end, and then meet face to face only after a proposal. They then spend the next few weeks deciding whether they want to go through with the wedding, which is all documented on camera.\n\nUntil recently, the show\u2019s storylines had largely ignored politics.\n\nLast season, which featured Washington, D.C., couples and was filmed before the presidential election, was the first time would-be couples asked each other explicitly how they voted.\n\nThis time around, political conversations were featured even more prominently as part of Carton\u2019s and Miller\u2019s journeys. Their decisions proved to be flashpoints online, with conservative figures like Tomi Lahren and Laura Ingraham criticizing Carton.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find him a nice, conservative 20-something girl,\u201d Ingraham wrote on X, sharing Lahren\u2019s clip of Carton and Mezzenga at the altar. \u201cHe\u2019ll look back and laugh at this.\u201d\n\nClaire Fallon and Emma Gray, co-hosts of the pop culture podcast \u201cLove To See It,\u201d said the season was a reminder that \u201creality TV is a reflection of our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is interesting how we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening in the dating market nationally right now play out repeatedly on this season,\u201d Fallon said in the most recent episode of the podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s like how are we supposed to settle down and get married if all of our options are people who are so opposed to the politics that matter to us?\u201d\n\nDuring the \u201cpods,\u201d Carton, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, told many of her suitors that her sister is a lesbian. Carton said she looks for a partner who believes in LGBTQ rights. She also asked some about their views on the Black Lives Matter movement, sharing that she got more engaged in social issues after the murder of George Floyd in her home city.\n\nHer match, Ben Mezzenga, a 28-year-old developer, said that he goes to church often but that he has \u201cno discomfort around that community at all,\u201d referring to LGBTQ people. He said he was \u201cignorant\u201d about politics and the BLM movement.\n\nIn real life, after their engagement but before the wedding, Mezzenga is seen meeting Carton\u2019s sister. Her sister appears hesitant that the two are made for each other. Carton also goes to church with Mezzenga to learn more about his beliefs and perspective.\n\nUltimately, at the altar, Carton turned Mezzenga down. \u201cBen, I love you so much,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always wanted a partner to be on the same wavelength. So today, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe tells her mom and sister after she leaves the ceremony that she worried that there was \u201cno curiosity coming from his side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked him about Black Lives Matter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m no expert, but when I asked him about it, he\u2019s like, \u2018I guess I never really thought too much about it.\u2019 That affected me.\u201d\n\nMezzenga is seen praying with his friends after Carton rejects him. During the reunion, he touched on Carton\u2019s reasons for saying no.\n\n\u201cI knew coming into this experience I definitely have had privilege in my life, and it\u2019s something I wasn\u2019t proud of and something I knew I needed to grow. And then coming into this I knew it was important to Sara in the pods. And so I wanted to be vulnerable and be like, \u2018Hey, I haven\u2019t given it much thought.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m embarrassed the way that our conversation had gone at the beginning there, but then we had great conversations about it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s just a definite impact on me, and I have Sara to thank for that. I know it\u2019s kind of sad that it took someone to make me think that way.\u201d\n\nCarton said that the two tried to date after the show wrapped to see whether they could make things work but that Mezzenga stopped talking to her until he eventually \u201csent scripted apologies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Miller, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, and Buckley, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had largely avoided talking politics until the 10th episode of the season, when they shared a candid on-camera conversation.\n\nBuckley said he wasn\u2019t \u201csuper big into politics\u201d and noted that his family typically has conservative views. Miller said that she didn\u2019t mind if the two shared different political opinions but that it would be \u201ckind of alarming\u201d if he was \u201cway on the other side of the spectrum\u201d on political issues that matter to her.\n\nAt the altar, Buckley said, \u201cI do,\u201d but Miller said, \u201cI love you so much, but I\u2019m just not ready.\u201d In her confessional during the finale, she mentioned politics but didn\u2019t elaborate further \u2014 until the reunion episode that aired Sunday.\n\n\u201cDevin told me a lot about his core values, something that he did not want to talk about on camera,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI still to this day don\u2019t feel really comfortable telling you Devin\u2019s views. But I will be very clear about mine. I 100% support the LGBTQ community. I also believe that women should have the decision to choose if they want to have an abortion or not. I also believe different religions should be valued. \u2026 These were really important things to me.\u201d\n\nBuckley, in response, said that in a relationship he can \u201clook past certain things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that you can be together and have a relationship and not completely agree on everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think a big thing for me, as a Christian, is to love everyone, regardless of how I feel about something.\u201d"

It\u2019s another shutdown week in Washington. We have the latest on where things stand ahead of Friday\u2019s government funding deadline. Plus, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy headed to Saudi Arabia, Alexander Smith examines how the country has become an unexpected diplomatic force.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nThe two big questions looming over the shutdown fight\n\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: Congress is racing to avoid a government shutdown days out from the funding deadline.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson released a stopgap bill over the weekend to keep the government\u2019s lights on through the end of September. The measure, which Democrats had no part in crafting, includes an increase in military spending and a reduction in nondefense money, as Sahil Kapur, Scott Wong and Frank Thorp V report.\n\nIt will need to pass the GOP-led House and Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump before midnight Friday to avert a shutdown.\n\nThere are two major questions that will determine whether that becomes a reality.\n\nCan Johnson unite House Republicans? Johnson is eyeing a Tuesday vote in the House on the continuing resolution \u2014 and says he\u2019s relying solely on the support of Republicans to pass it.\n\nThat\u2019s a tall order in the House, where Republicans hold a 218-214 majority. That means Johnson can afford only one defection, assuming all Democrats oppose the bill and all members are present. And he\u2019s already likely lost one vote: Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has made clear he won\u2019t support the stopgap bill.\n\nThe challenge for Johnson will be keeping other conservative fiscal hawks in the fold, as well as Republicans who would prefer to see a bigger boost for defense spending. As he did during his speaker\u2019s race and the budget resolution vote earlier this year, Johnson has a key voice in his corner: Trump, who has publicly urged congressional Republicans to support the continuing resolution.\n\nSome House Democrats could end up supporting the bill and give Johnson more breathing room, but the party\u2019s leaders in the chamber are against the measure.\n\nWill Senate Democrats vote for it? If the bill manages to make its way out of the House, the pressure would then fall on Senate Democrats.\n\nRepublicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they will need support from Democrats to cross the 60-vote threshold. And like in the House, a Kentucky Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, has already said he will vote against it.\n\nDemocrats have demanded guardrails on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s attempts to slash federal spending, and they are under pressure from their base to more forcefully stand up to the administration.\n\nThe stopgap funding bill is one of the few major pieces of legislation they will have some leverage on this year in GOP-controlled Washington. But voting down the measure and allowing a shutdown, even if it occurs under a Republican trifecta, could cause even more pain for the federal workforce and those who rely on government services.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nPoll: Do you think the government will shut down? Vote in our poll:\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nAhead of Rubio-Zelenskyy summit, Saudi Arabia emerges as an unlikely global powerbroker\n\nBy Alexander Smith\n\nSaudi Arabia will host a key summit Tuesday between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is trying to repair relations with Washington following his disastrous Oval Office bust-up with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nIt\u2019s another soft-power coup for a country that has deliberately cultivated a reputation as a diplomatic go-between. Whether it\u2019s hosting American officials for negotiations to end the Ukraine war, orchestrating talks about the future of Gaza or rolling out the red carpet for Trump\u2019s first foreign trip, Saudi Arabia has emerged in recent years as an unlikely global powerbroker.\n\nLess than five years ago, then-presidential hopeful Joe Biden called the kingdom a \u201cpariah\u201d and, even after significant reforms, rights groups say the authoritarian Gulf state still has an \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record.\n\nTuesday\u2019s summit comes as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is attempting to transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s image from a deeply conservative, oil-rich theocracy whose officials murdered the American-based Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, into a regional giant built on diplomacy, business, tourism, entertainment and sports.\n\nTrump revealed last week that the first foreign visit of his second term would be to Saudi Arabia, just as it was during his first administration. As then, he said that, in return, the Saudis had agreed to invest a bonanza sum in American businesses, this time $1 trillion.\n\nThis relationship has raised questions about ties between Riyadh and the Trump family. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the former chair of the Senate Finance Committee, last year raised \u201cobvious conflicts of interest concerns\u201d about Saudi Arabia\u2019s $2 billion investment in a fund run by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has denied any such conflict.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMore on the Russia-Ukraine war: Courtney Kube, Kristen Welker and Carol E. Lee report that Trump has told aides that a minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine won\u2019t be enough to restart aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.\n\nTrump wants assurances that Zelenskyy is willing to make concessions in peace talks with Russia, such as giving up territory. And he wants Zelenskyy to make some movement toward elections in Ukraine and possibly toward stepping down as his country\u2019s leader.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \u2753 Who is Amy Gleason?

            "full_content": "As Democrats attempt to rebound from an underwhelming showing in the 2024 election, California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna is not only taking stock of the stinging defeat last fall, but also taking shots at his own political party.\n\nAfter watching Democrats swap nominees and struggle to deliver a cohesive message to voters in the last campaign cycle, Khanna told ABC News in an exclusive interview that he believes a political reform agenda focused on combating corruption \"is what we should run on in 2026\" and laments the political costs that came as Democrats campaigned on other priorities in 2024.\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Khanna said, adding he \"didn't hear any political reform agenda\" from President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris during their respective presidential campaigns. \"Trump became the outsider. It was a mistake we didn't run on the theme of reform. Getting money and lobbyists out of politics -- that should be our mantle.\"\n\nNow, Khanna is introducing the Drain The Swamp Act, which would permanently prohibit White House officials from accepting gifts from lobbyists -- reinstating a Biden-era mandate that established ethics and lobbying rules for appointees in the administration.\n\n\"Anti-corruption has to be core to rebuilding the Democratic brand,\" Khanna, serving in his fifth term, said. \"Democrats need to be seen as owning the mantle of reform.\"\n\nRep. Ro Khanna at the Capitol, Dec. 4, 2024. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images\n\nKhanna said he finds it striking that one of President Donald Trump's first acts of his second term was to sign an executive order to overturn Biden's order -- creating the impetus to craft an agenda that takes aim at Washington's revolving door between lobbyists and lawmakers.\n\n\"It's part of a broader sense that Democrats have to run on anti-corruption,\" Khanna said, complaining that the Democratic Party enabled Trump to \"co-opt\" the \"drain the swamp\" theme of anti-corruption. Khanna said it has cost his party not only two presidential elections in 2016 and 2024, but also majority control of Congress.\n\n\"We need to be zealous,\" Khanna said -- explaining his vision for a five-point anti-corruption agenda.\n\nKhanna wants to ban former members of Congress from ever lobbying Congress, and he wants to impose 12-year term limits for members and 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices. Khanna says he believes timed-out justices should return to serve on lower courts after they leave a post on the high court. Khanna also advocates for a \"binding code of ethics\" for Supreme Court justices amid ethics pressure on the court.\n\nA view of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, June 29, 2024. Kevin Mohatt/Reuters, FILES\n\n\"If Democrats want to rebuild, start with anti-political corruption,\" Khanna stressed, adding he has received a positive reception from a range of people such as billionaire Mark Cuban and even Republican voters who are supportive of his pledge to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nKhanna also calls for a ban on members of Congress and their families from holding and trading individual stocks during the member's tenure in office, as well as a ban on members of Congress and candidates running for House or Senate seats from accepting contributions from political action committees.\n\nAs for his own future political interest -- whether reelection, the California governor's mansion or even the White House in 2028 -- Khanna is keeping his cards close, but his options open.\n\n\"Ro believes that anti-corruption and economic patriotism need to be the driving themes of the Democratic Party for 2026 and 2028, regardless of who gets into the fray or leads the party,\" Sarah Drory, a Khanna spokeswoman, told ABC when asked about the congressman's political prospects.\n\nNevertheless, Khanna's profile continues to grow as he faces voters and weighs his future options -- sometimes even before Republican audiences on Fox News or in GOP-held districts.\n\nAfter Trump delivered a joint address to Congress last week, Khanna went on \"Fox News Sunday\" and admitted that it \"was not a good look\" as Democrats protested not only the president, but also rejected the invited guests in the First Lady's box.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an address to a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4, 2025. Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"We should have stood for the boy with cancer. You stand for the president of the United States, out of respect for the American people,\" Khanna said on the program. \"I mean, you stand for the widow of the firefighter.\"\n\n\"The story should have been on President Trump,\" Khanna continued. \"We should have been talking about the Medicaid cuts. Instead, we're talking about our own behavior. And that's a distraction from us getting out our economic message.\"\n\nKhanna will also hold three in-person town hall meetings during a \"Benefits Over Billionaires\" tour on March 23 in GOP-held districts, where his anti-corruption agenda will take stage alongside his progressive bona fides.\n\n\"It's smart to have a clear message,\" Khanna told ABC News. \"We're the party that's going to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\""

Most of the 20 were considered \"high threat,\" Fox News reported. Roughly 200 were Venezuelans who have since been deported.\n\n\"The visit to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay was an eye-opening experience that offered tremendous insights into the complexities of immigration policy and the importance of border security,\" Rep.

Millions of people were encountered by CBP crossing into the country illegally during the last administration.\n\nWhile encounters decreased slightly following an executive order from Biden last year, apprehension numbers torpedoed to just over 8,000 \u2014 the least ever noted by CBP.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM TAKES AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK INTO GITMO'S MIGRANT LODGING\n\n\"It is clear that Guantanamo Bay is operational and equipped to conduct these deportations, with multiple agencies cooperating in this effort including the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. With the strong commitment of Republicans in Congress, these deportations should continue and increase without interruption,\" Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe delegation's visit comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth toured Guantanamo Bay at the end of February, as the base holds both the \"Migrant Operations Center\" and the detention center that is most well-known for holding suspected terrorists in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks."

Photo: Saul Loeb/Reuters\n\nLast week there was a now-infamous Trump Cabinet meeting in which (as we know from some intrepid New York Times reporting) Elon Musk clashed with high-ranking administration officials, most notably Secretary of State Marco Rubio:\n\nMr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubio\u2019s control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting on Thursday in front of President Trump and around 20 others \u2014 details of which have not been reported before \u2014 Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest. \u2026\n\nMr. Musk was unimpressed. He told Mr. Rubio he was \u201cgood on TV,\u201d with the clear subtext being that he was not good for much else. Throughout all of this, the president sat back in his chair, arms folded, as if he were watching a tennis match.\n\nAfter the argument dragged on for an uncomfortable time, Mr. Trump finally intervened to defend Mr. Rubio as doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d Mr. Rubio has a lot to deal with, the president said. He is very busy, he is always traveling and on TV, and he has an agency to run. So everyone just needs to work together.\n\nThis nasty incident was followed by Trump suggesting that his agency appointees, rather than DOGE, would be making spending and personnel cuts going forward, which was widely hailed in media outlets as a sign of a long-awaited collision between Musk and Trump. But then Trump proceeded to undermine the \u201cMusk has been put on a leash\u201d narrative by telling reporters (per Politico) that \u201che wanted cuts, and that Musk would remain a power center: \u2018If they can cut, it\u2019s better. And if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd now, just a few days after Musk was supposedly \u201creined in\u201d by Trump, Politico is reporting that Marco Rubio is very formally bending the knee to DOGE and even thanking Musk for the kick in the ass to gut foreign-aid programs:\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the United States is canceling 83 percent of programs at the United States Agency for International Development, thanking Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE team for its work amid reports of friction between the two men.\n\n\u201cThe 5200 contracts that are now canceled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio said in a post to X, the social media platform owned by Musk. \u201cThank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more likely than not that Trump\u2019s alleged brushback pitch aimed at Musk was mostly a ruse to deceive the federal courts and the public about who\u2019s at the wheel of his administration\u2019s effort to demolish the federal government and get rid of much of its workforce. But the other important thing to understand is that in the end it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Elon Musk, Russ Vought, Marco Rubio, congressional Republicans, or Trump himself who is pulling the trigger on any particular act of nihilistic destruction. They\u2019re all aiming in the same direction, which is a radically reduced, decapitated, and demoralized public sector dominated by a gang of corrupt billionaires who will receive their ultimate reward in big tax cuts later this year, paid for by the very budget cuts Republicans are now administering by any means necessary."

Following a contentious Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the US announced a \u201cpause\u201d on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Russia has continued its deadly barrage of attacks against Ukraine in the time since that suspension was put in place.\n\nThe move followed weeks of antagonism by Trump towards Zelensky that has seen the US president repeat Kremlin talking points blaming Kyiv for the war and after Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff sat down in Riyadh with a high-level Russian delegation \u2013 and without Ukrainian participation.\n\nSpeaking Monday, Rubio said the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s meeting \u201cwill be key\u201d to whether the pause in military aid and intelligence sharing is lifted.\n\n\u201cI think if we emerge there with a good meeting that we feel good about and can report back to the president, then I think decisions will be made in regards to the pause,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN has reported that the US is still sharing intelligence with Ukraine that can help its troops defend themselves but has \u201cscaled back\u201d sharing any intelligence that Kyiv could use for offensive targeting of Russian forces, according to two US defense officials.\n\n\u201cMy hope is we\u2019re going to have a really good meeting tomorrow, and we\u2019ll be in a different place very soon,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nRubio and Waltz, who are slated to meet with the Ukrainian national security adviser, foreign minister, and defense minister, will be \u201cin listening mode,\u201d the top US diplomat said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve suffered greatly, and their people have suffered greatly, and it\u2019s hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions, but that\u2019s the only way this is going to end, to prevent more suffering,\u201d Rubio said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cnot going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do.\u201d\n\nThe top US diplomat acknowledged that the moves Ukraine would be willing to make \u201cmay be incompatible with what the Russians are willing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to find out. We\u2019re not going to find out on X. We\u2019re not going to find out, you know, on media, press conferences. We have to find out in rooms that are closed,\u201d Rubio added, just over a week since the meeting between Trump and Zelensky went off the rails in front of cameras.\n\nRubio said the conversation would not be overly detailed \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map\u201d \u2013 but that the US aims to \u201cget a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible for them and what they would need in return and then find out what the Russian position is in that regard. And that\u2019ll give us a pretty good assessment of how far apart we truly are.\u201d\n\nIn a post on X last Thursday, Zelensky said he hoped the meeting would be \u201cmeaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cUkraine has been seeking peace since the very first moment of the war, and we have always stated that the war continues solely because of Russia. Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing those steps,\u201d he said. Zelensky is not expected to attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting, although he is in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a separate post last Tuesday, Zelensky said the way the Oval Office meeting ended was \u201cregrettable.\u201d He proposed, as a first phase to end the war, \u201cthe release of prisoners and truce in the sky \u2014 ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure \u2014 and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal,\u201d he said.\n\nOn a minerals deal between the US and Ukraine \u2013 which had been largely negotiated before the Oval Office meeting \u2013 Zelensky said \u201cUkraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format.\u201d\n\nRubio, however, said Monday he did not necessarily expect the agreement to be finalized on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still more details to work out,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "A view shows MMR vaccine at the City of Lubbock Health Department in Lubbock, Texas, U.S. February 27, 2025. Photo: Annie Rice/Reuters\n\nIn a recent profile at the Bulwark, Shane DiGiovanna described his life with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a rare genetic disease that causes much of his skin to shear off from his body, damages his hearing, and gives him cancer. It\u2019s difficult for him to eat, let alone work. Gene therapy could offer a solution one day, but as DiGiovanna said, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk \u201ccould devastate the next decade of research and development of a cure for RDEB \u2014 my holy grail \u2026 Just keep in mind that the weak and marginalized include infants and children who are missing most of their skin and suffering through extreme and utterly pointless pain.\u201d\n\nWhen powerful men threaten funding for cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s research, they aren\u2019t just eliminating scientific jobs. They\u2019re putting people like DiGiovanna in danger.\n\nAs he confronts the administration\u2019s war on scientific research, DiGiovanna must worry too about Medicaid, which covers much of his care and is poised for significant cuts. Even the medical professionals who provide his care are at risk: A beloved nurse is an immigrant, and although he is an American citizen now, DiGiovanna knows that he is still threatened by Vice-President J.D. Vance\u2019s ultranationalist rhetoric. Aspects of DiGiovanna\u2019s story will be familiar to anyone with a chronic illness or disability in America; it certainly was to me. I also have a rare genetic disease and though my condition is not as painful or life-altering as RDEB, it still means that I am acutely aware that the advancements and supports that make my life easier are in significant danger. As a journalist, I try to understand the roots of this war on science and public health; as a patient, it is difficult for me to grasp why anyone would turn away from the vaccinations, antibiotics, and research that have saved untold lives. People like DiGiovanna and I are exceptional in the sense that our conditions are rare, but we don\u2019t live our lives in isolation. The same forces that threaten us are going to come for everyone else, too.\n\nBehind the war on science and public health lies a total hostility to the simple notion of a social contract. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to harm our children or [risk] the potential to harm our children so that we can save yours,\u201d an anti-vaxx mother in west Texas told the Washington Post last week. That\u2019s selfish, and dangerous too. One unvaccinated child has already died of measles in Texas and the outbreak may have claimed another life in New Mexico. But if we\u2019re going to defend public health, we have to identify its real enemies, and there\u2019s a difference between a Texas mother and someone like Kennedy, who\u2019s made a living and a reputation on the bodies of the dead. His anti-vaccine rhetoric already has a body count. In the years before my diagnosis and after, I learned that I couldn\u2019t bootstrap my way into health. I needed help: care that I could afford, paid sick leave, and stable housing. America guarantees none of the above.\n\nFor decades the pro-business right has said that we don\u2019t need a social contract; that it is even an impediment to true prosperity. Instead we have liberty, which is to say choice, and that is a seductive story even though it\u2019s based on a lie. A figure like Kennedy fits neatly within the Trump administration because he preaches individual responsibility over the public good. To Kennedy, the solution to chronic disease is a vitamin, or a stint on a farm, not sound science or public-health institutions. He and his allies agree that the market must be free \u2014 to profit, coerce, and kill. Science can\u2019t flourish in such an environment, nor can public health. Both are at constant risk from a ruthless system that demands constant human sacrifice from the very people it claims to help. It\u2019s not strange, then, that conspiracy theories can be so attractive, since they often begin with a certain base recognition that something is wrong. Anti-vaxx mothers in Texas are at war with the social contract because they believe their children are in danger. They\u2019re wrong about vaccines, but there are real predators in our midst. Pharmaceuticals are expensive, and so is health care in general. Why trust the system if it doesn\u2019t work for you anyway?\n\nBut cod-liver oil can\u2019t cure measles, and beef tallow isn\u2019t healthier than seed oils. They offer the illusion of control in a hostile world. People who put their trust in conspiracies and lies may discover what Shane DiGiovanna already knows \u2014 that we all need science to be healthy. Disability is not divine punishment but a condition that can befall anyone, especially if they are poor. \u201cEveryone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick,\u201d Susan Sontag famously wrote. \u201cAlthough we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.\u201d Without a safety net that works, science will falter and the kingdom of the sick will only expand. The price is human life."

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nPolice across the United States are investigating a series of attacks on Tesla showrooms, charging stations and Tesla vehicles, as vitriol escalates against CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThere have also been peaceful protests at many Tesla locations, which involve demonstrators carrying signs and chanting \u201cElon Musk has got to go\u201d in response to the slashing of federal jobs and budgets by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThough the protests have been peaceful, there have also been widespread reports of vandalism. While there have been no reports of injuries, the incidents pose a potential financial problem for Tesla. The company faces declining sales for the first time due to increased competition and backlash over Musk\u2019s contentious role in the Trump administration.\n\nOn March 3, seven charging stations in a mall outside of Boston were set on fire just after 1 a.m. local time.\n\nOn Thursday, police outside of Portland, Oregon, responded to gunshots fired at a Tesla showroom at about 1:45 a.m. local time. Investigators say at least seven shots were fired, damaging three cars and shattering windows. One bullet went through an office wall and into a computer monitor.\n\nShattered windows of a Tesla showroom that was shot up by an unknown vandal on March 6. Tigard Police Department/AP\n\n\u201cWhile the motivation for this has not been confirmed, we are aware that other Tesla dealerships have been targeted across Oregon and the nation for political reasons,\u201d police in Tigard, Oregon, said in a statement.\n\nLucy Grace Nelson of Colorado faces a federal charge of malicious destruction of property for allegedly vandalizing a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado, in late January and February. Nelson allegedly spray-painted words including \u201cNazi\u201d on vehicles and the windows of the store, and threw Molotov cocktails during one of the incidents, according to police. She was arrested near the store on February 24 with more Molotov cocktails inside her car. If convicted, Nelson could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThere have also been numerous complaints about damage to Tesla vehicles on social media. Police in Brookline, Massachusetts, posted a video on X of one individual defending his tagging of a Tesla vehicle as \u201cfree speech.\u201d Musk, a self-described free speech absolutist who owns X and is Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder, reposted the police post with the comment: \u201cDamaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!\u201d\n\nAnd when someone recently posted a photo of the word \u201cNazi\u201d spray-painted on a Tesla charging station, the X account for Tesla Charging responded, \u201cWe will press charges for vandalism at superchargers.\u201d\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on the various attacks or the protests.\n\nOn Sunday, Musk posted on X: \u201cHeartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices.\u201d\n\nThe attacks risk scaring away potential Tesla buyers who might not object to Musk\u2019s politics but fear their car could be vandalized, said Gordon Johnson, founder of GLJ Research, who has long held a very bearish view of Tesla stock. He said no one wants to spend money on a Tesla only to have it vandalized.\n\nTesla just reported its first drop in annual sales in its history, and there are indications that sales could be down again this quarter. While overall electric vehicle sales in Europe surged by 34% in January, sales of Teslas plummeted 50%. Tesla\u2019s sales fell 29% in China \u2014 the company\u2019s second largest market after the United States \u2014 in the first two months of the year, according to Reuters.\n\nAnd Tesla\u2019s US sales dropped 16% between December and January, according to an estimate from Cox Automotive.\n\nWeak sales have hurt the value of Tesla shares, which had climbed 91% after Election Day, peaking just before Christmas, as investors anticipated Musk and his electric car company would be big winners in Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nThose gains, and more, have been wiped away since their recent highs. Shares fell about 14% in midday trading Monday and have now lost 10% since their closing price on Election Day."

            "full_content": "Mahmoud Khalil speaking to members of the media at Columbia University, June 1, 2024. Photo: Jeenah Moon/Reuters\n\nOn Saturday, Palestinian activist and former Columbia University grad student Mahmoud Khalil, who played a significant role in the Gaza protests at Columbia last year, was arrested by federal immigration authorities. According to his attorney, Khalil is a legal permanent resident but is currently being detained despite his status and no specific charges have been detailed. A judge has temporarily blocked Khalil\u2019s deportation pending further action on his motion challenging his detention.\n\nThe dramatic action came just days after President Donald Trump signaled his administration\u2019s plan to crack down on student protests \u2014 raising the specter of deportation for those in the country on a visa as well as the revocation of federal funds for the colleges and universities themselves. Khalil\u2019s arrest has been condemned by many local political leaders and championed by members of Trump\u2019s administration and its allies. Here\u2019s what we know so far.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nOn Saturday evening, Khalil was approached at his home by Department of Homeland Security agents. According to Khalil\u2019s attorney, Amy Greer, the agents proceeded to detain Khalil and threatened his wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, with arrest as well. The apartment building in which Khalil lives with his wife is owned by the university.\n\nOn Friday, the ACLU released video footage Khalil\u2019s wife recorded during the arrest:\n\nThis footage of ICE arresting Palestinian activist and Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil was just released by the ACLU.\n\n\n\nICE: \u201cStop resisting\u201d\n\n\n\nKhalil's wife: \u201cHe\u2019s not resisting\u201d pic.twitter.com/Fk5oG5demO \u2014 Zeteo (@zeteo_news) March 14, 2025\n\nGreer told the Associated Press that one of the agents told her over the phone that they were following orders from the State Department to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. When Greer told them that Khalil possessed a green card and was a legal permanent resident, the agent said they were revoking that instead.\n\nAccording to Greer, Khalil\u2019s family was told that he was transported to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, but they were later informed that he wasn\u2019t there after an attempted visit. As of Monday, according to ICE\u2019s online detainee locator, Khalil is being held at a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana.\n\nIn a statement issued late Monday, Greer called Khalil\u2019s transfer to Louisiana from New York a \u201cblatantly improper but familiar tactic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat transfer should be reversed, and the process of challenging the outrageous attempt to revoke legal-permanent-resident status for someone who has never committed a crime, and who has simply expressed his political opinions,\u201d she said.\n\nKhalil\u2019s legal team has since filed a habeas corpus petition and U.S. district judge Jesse Furman, who was assigned the matter, has blocked Khalil\u2019s removal pending action on the filing. During a hearing on the case on Wednesday, the government argued that the New York federal court should not have jurisdiction over Khalil\u2019s case because he was moved to Louisiana when his petition was filed. NBC News reports that the judge ordered both sides to submit arguments on jurisdiction and said Khalil and his attorneys will be allowed two privileged phone calls after his legal team claimed that they\u2019ve lacked access to him since his detention. Khalil will remain detained in the meantime.\n\nWho is Mahmoud Khalil?\n\nReuters reports that Khalil was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and received his green card last year after arriving in the United States on a student visa in 2022. He completed his studies for a master\u2019s of public administration degree at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs in 2024 and was set to receive his degree in May.\n\nKhalil was a lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the student-led coalition advocating for the school\u2019s divestment from Israel. The group had come under fire for its on-campus protests of the ongoing war in Gaza, particularly their Gaza Solidarity Encampment that was subjected to numerous raids by local law enforcement last year. Drop-Site News reports that Khalil participated in a sit-in at the Barnard College\u2019s Milstein Center on Wednesday, protesting the school\u2019s recent expulsion of several students for taking part in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nThe AP also reports that Khalil had been under investigation by the Office of Institutional Equity, a newly created university office intended to address reports of harassment and discrimination, due to his involvement with CUAD. \u201cI have around 13 allegations against me; most of them are social-media posts that I had nothing to do with,\u201d Khalil told the AP. \u201cThey just want to show Congress and right-wing politicians that they\u2019re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.\u201d\n\nZeteo reported Monday that Khalil had emailed Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong last Friday with concerns for his safety after being subjected to a \u201cvicious, coordinated, and dehumanizing doxxing campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir attacks have incited a wave of hate, including calls for my deportation and death threats. I have outlined the wider context below, yet Columbia has not provided any meaningful support or resources in response to this escalating threat,\u201d he wrote, according to emails obtained by the outlet.\n\nReuters spoke to Noor Abdalla, Khalil\u2019s wife who is eight months pregnant with their first child. She said she hopes that her husband will be released by the child\u2019s birth. \u201cI think it would be very devastating for me and for him to meet his first child behind a glass screen,\u201d Abdalla said.\n\nWhat has the Trump administration said?\n\nSo far, the Trump administration hasn\u2019t articulated what charges, if any, that Khalil is being detained on. Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, confirmed Khalil\u2019s arrest in a statement, saying that it was done in coordination with the State Department and alleging that Khalil \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE and the Department of State are committed to enforcing President Trump\u2019s executive orders and to protecting U.S. national security,\u201d she said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio echoed McLaughlin\u2019s words on social media, making it clear that Khalil\u2019s detention was an intentional move from the Trump administration. \u201cWe will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,\u201d he wrote, sharing a link to a news article about Khalil.\n\nTrump denounced Khalil as a \u201cRadical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\u201d in a Truth Social post on Monday and said that there are more arrests to come. \u201cWe know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d he said.\n\nTroy Edgar, the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, defended Khalil\u2019s detention in an interview with NPR. \u201cThis is somebody we\u2019ve invited and allowed the student to come into the country, and he\u2019s put himself in the middle of the process of basically pro-Palestinian activity. And at this point, like I said, the secretary of State can review his visa process at any point and revoke it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union condemned Khalil\u2019s arrest as an affront to his right to free speech. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s detention of Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 a green-card holder studying in this country legally \u2014 is targeted, retaliatory, and an extreme attack on his First Amendment rights,\u201d executive director Donna Lieberman said in a statement.\n\nAssemblymember Zohran Mamdani, who is running in the New York City mayoral race, also called for Khalil\u2019s immediate release, noting his arrest was a \u201cblatant assault on the First Amendment and a sign of advancing authoritarianism under Trump.\u201d Mamdani attempted to confront border czar Tom Homan over Khalil\u2019s arrest at the state capitol on Wednesday, shouting, \u201cHow many New Yorkers will you detain without charge?\u201d\n\nLetitia James, the state attorney general, said Monday that she is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about Khalil\u2019s arrest and detention and that her office is currently monitoring the situation and is also in contact with his legal representation.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez denounced Khalil\u2019s detention and said it raised concerns about how much further the Trump administration could go. \u201cIf the federal government can disappear a legal US permanent resident without reason or warrant, then they can disappear US citizens too. Anyone - left, right, or center - who has highlighted the importance of constitutional rights + free speech should be sounding the alarm now,\u201d she wrote on X.\n\nNBC News reports that protesters plan to hold a demonstration at New York City\u2019s Federal Plaza on Monday, calling for Khalil\u2019s release.\n\nWhat about Khalil\u2019s green card? Is it legal to detain him?\n\nThough Rubio has stated that the United States will begin revoking green cards, his ability to do so appears legally dubious. Typically, an immigration judge is tasked with determining whether a person\u2019s legal-resident status can be revoked, following allegations of criminal activity or fraudulent activities in the application process. \u202aIn a series of tweets on Bluesky, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick\u202c, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, said that the State Department lacks the authority to unilaterally revoke a green card.\n\n\u201cWhile the State Department CAN revoke *visas* with very little legal process involved, stripping someone of a green card is done by DHS (not the State Department) and requires filing formal charges alleging a violation of immigration law and a removal hearing in front of an immigration judge,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHowever, Reichlin-Melnick noted that an aspect of the Immigration and Nationality Act could allow for a non-citizen to be deported if the secretary of State deems them deportable on national-security grounds.\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN reported that Rubio appeared to have invoked a foreign-policy provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to detain Khalil.\n\nHave any other activists been detained by the Trump administration?\n\nKhalil was not the only Columbia student whom authorities sought out over the weekend. The Associated Press reports that federal immigration agents attempted to take an international student into custody but weren\u2019t able to enter her apartment. Student Workers of Columbia, a university union that represents the unidentified woman, told the outlet that the ICE agents attempted to enter her home without a warrant. On Friday, the DHS announced that it had arrested a second Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, who is also Palestinian.\n\nLast week, Trump indicated that going after campus activists is a top priority for his administration and that he intends to penalize the institutions themselves for allowing the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cAll Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests. Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nOn March 7, the Trump administration announced that it had canceled $400 million in federal grants and contracts with Columbia University, citing the school\u2019s \u201ccontinued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Trump promises to bring down groceries prices at an August 15, 2024 press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey. Photo: Adam Gray/Getty Images\n\nThe high cost of living was one of the primary reasons that Donald Trump was elected to the presidency. Trump himself said in a December interview with NBC News, \u201cI won on groceries,\u201d explaining, \u201cWhen you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t just promise to implement policies that would gradually ease economic concerns; throughout 2024, he said that if American voted for him, prices would fall rapidly.\n\n\u201cWhen I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One,\u201d Trump declared in August, underscoring his point by standing between tables filled with unrefrigerated milk, meat, and other groceries.\n\nSeven weeks into the second Trump administration, grocery prices haven\u2019t gone down. So Trump is trying a new strategy: urging Americans to quit complaining and trust that he\u2019ll eventually make them \u201cso rich.\u201d\n\nSaturday on Truth Social, Trump shared a Daily Caller article titled \u201cShut Up About Egg Prices \u2014 Trump Is Saving Consumers Millions.\u201d\n\nIn the piece, Charlie Kirk claimed that Trump bears zero responsibility for the high price of eggs (that is, of course, all Joe Biden\u2019s fault). Then Kirk argued that Trump will be \u201csaving consumers million\u201d \u2014 even if that isn\u2019t happening yet \u2014 listing off various Trump economic proposals. Many of these policies have yet to be implemented, but Kirk said struggling Americans just need to be patient:\n\nReversing four years of economic malpractice will take time to reverse, but the building blocks of America\u2019s next great low-inflation, high-wage growth boom have already been laid \u2014 and soon enough, so too will the eggs.\n\nThe Kirk article is actually three weeks old and egg prices are still high (while the average cost of a dozen eggs dropped about a dollar in the past month, the USDA still predicts egg prices will go up 40 percent this year). But Americans\u2019 economic woes go far beyond eggs. There are concerns that Trump\u2019s trade war will raise the cost of everything from food to cars to gasoline. In recent weeks, Trump rolled out his long-awaited tariffs against Canada and Mexico, partly suspended them, then said they were back on. Markets tumbled in response, raising fears that Trump\u2019s chaotic economic movies could spark a recession.\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday, Maria Bartiromo directly asked Trump if we should expect a recession this year. He declined to rule out that possibility.\n\n\u201cI hate to predict things like that,\u201d Trump said on Fox Sunday Morning Futures. \u201cThere is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America.\u201d\n\nBartiromo: \u201cAre you expecting a recession this year?\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump: \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we are doing is very big.\u201d pic.twitter.com/gwC10SKFX1 \u2014 The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) March 9, 2025\n\nTrump dismissed recession concerns again on Sunday evening. On Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump, \u201cAre you worried about a recession?\u201d noting, \u201cMaria Bartiromo asked you, and you kind of hesitated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, of course you hesitate,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cAll I know is this: We\u2019re gonna take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we\u2019re gonna become so rich you\u2019re not gonna know where to spend all that money. I\u2019m telling you \u2014 you just watch! We\u2019re gonna have jobs, we\u2019re gonna have factories, it\u2019s gonna be great.\u201d\n\nOn Truth Social, Trump shared a video of his response \u2014 which was edited to remove the bit where refused to rule out a recession again \u2014 with the caption, \u201cWe\u2019re going to become so rich, you\u2019re not gonna know where to spend all that money. I\u2019m telling you\u2014just watch!\u201d\n\nStocks tumbled again on Monday after Trump\u2019s talk about a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d that seemingly will involve more economic hardship. But you can\u2019t really blame the president for that. None of this would be happening if Americans would just stop complaining about how they can\u2019t afford groceries or weather a recession and focus on real problems \u2014 like how they\u2019re going to spend all that extra money Trump will put in their pocket at some indefinite point in the future."

            "full_content": "Viewers watched with shock and dismay as cringeworthy political moments blew up multiple couples\u2019 engagements on Season 8 of Netflix\u2019s Love Is Blind reality dating show.\n\nHere are seven jaw-dropping moments in which women ended their engagements to men they claimed to \u201clove\u201d due to them believing the grooms were not woke enough for marriage.\n\nOne bride, Sara Carton left her fianc\u00e9 Ben Mezzenga stranded at the altar over his lack of interest in Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ issues, and the COVID vaccine, as well as for his church being too \u201ctraditional.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI love you so much, but I\u2019ve always wanted a partner to be on the same wavelength, and so, today I can\u2019t [marry you],\u201d Carton told Mezzenga at the altar, before walking away, laughing.\n\nAfter leaving the wedding ceremony and getting into a vehicle, Carton can be heard telling her mother and her lesbian sister, Lisa, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I feel kind of dumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Carton continued. \u201cI was really excited about Ben. He\u2019s such a great person and I just, like\u2026 I just hope I made the right decision.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Carton explained that she had asked Mezzenga about his opinion on \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m no expert, but, like, when I asked him about it, he was like, \u2018I guess I\u2019ve never really thought too much about it.\u2019 That affected me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked him, too, like, what his church\u2019s views are [on LGBTQ issues], and he said he didn\u2019t know,\u201d the bride added. \u201cSo then I watched a sermon online \u2014 about sexual identity, and it was traditional.\u201d\n\nCarton also told Love is Blind producers that she suspected Mezzenga had a difference of opinion on \u201cequality, religion, [and] the vaccine,\u201d which, in part, caused her to her to walk away from her would-be marriage.\n\nIn another clip, Love is Blind dating contestant Virginia Miller can be heard telling her fianc\u00e9, Devin Buckley, that she is \u201cjust not ready\u201d to marry him, leaving him sobbing at the altar.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nBoth Miller and Buckley\u2019s parents can be seen sobbing as the bride exits the wedding ceremony, upon realizing their dreams of their children getting married have been shattered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d a child asks, to which Buckley\u2019s father replies by whispering \u201cShe said \u2018No'\u201d into the young girl\u2019s ear.\n\nMiller\u2019s father then embraces Buckley, telling the abandoned groom, \u201cYou\u2019re a very good man. I\u2019m disappointed also.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about why she chose not to marry Buckley, Miller cited the groom having grown up in a \u201cconservative household,\u201d and noted that she took offense when Buckley asked her if she voted with her \u201cfaith in mind\u201d during an earlier conversation in which she revealed to her fianc\u00e9 that she is pro-abortion.\n\nIn a scene from an earlier episode, Miller is seen talking to Buckley about conservatives with apparent contempt, using air quotes around \u201cconservative\u201d and calling herself Christian, before going on a rant about how \u201cpeople\u201d should have abortion rights.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ARmastrangelo/status/1896326630953427036\n\nWhen Buckley lightly challenges Miller, asking if she tries to align her voting with her faith, the 34-year-old replies, \u201cI do think that I make decisions from my faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people should have abortion rights,\u201d Miller smiled. \u201cI think gay people should have rights \u2014 all those things. And it\u2019s hard, because all of those things are, like, becoming political conversations again. And I just thought we were so far past that, but we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it is an interesting time to live in the United States,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cBecause I thought people were gonna be able to have abortions. I didn\u2019t know we had to go back and debate that one again.\u201d\n\nBuckley is noticeably silent while Miller rants about abortion, prompting her to ask, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d to which he replies by disclosing his belief that a man should be able to state \u201chis opinion\u201d on whether or not his unborn child is killed.\n\nMiller then asks Buckley if he would vote \u201cthe same\u201d when they go to the polls, to which her fianc\u00e9 responds by asking, \u201cIf we voted differently, what would that mean to you? You wouldn\u2019t be okay with that?\u201d\n\nAfter a brief pause, Miller answers that she may find that revelation \u201ckind of alarming.\u201d\n\nBuckley then comments that \u201cIt would depend on the candidates for me,\u201d to which Miller replies by pushing back, claiming, \u201cUsually when they\u2019re a part of certain Party, it\u2019s because of those core things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about your family? How do they vote?\u201d Miller asks, to which her fianc\u00e9 responds by revealing \u201cThey vote conservative, because they are on the side of what they\u2019re teaching are for their religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy family does not vote that way, but they\u2019re black,\u201d Miller replies, to which Buckley responds, \u201cWell, my dad is black.\u201d\n\nIn another scene, before Carton and Mezzenga\u2019s forthcoming failed wedding ceremony, Carton is seen incessantly pressuring her fianc\u00e9 to talk about LGBTQ issues, and questioning his church\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d views on the topic, even suggesting he find another church to attend.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nMezzenga replies by trying to convey to Carton that he would like to mind his own business, stating, \u201cI know what my views are, but who am I to say that I\u2019m right and every else is wrong? It\u2019s not my job to convince someone.\u201d\n\nBut Carton, who appears taken aback by Mezzenga\u2019s statement, asks her fianc\u00e9, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018not your job\u2019 to tell people they\u2019re wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mezzenga replies. \u201cBut all I know is this is a community that I feel connected to.\u201d\n\nCarton then suggests that she never \u201cenvisioned\u201d her significant other being a churchgoer, adding, \u201cI want to bring you to Pride,\u201d and noting that while she knows Mezzenga would meet her halfway by attending LGBTQ-related events, she feels she cannot reciprocate the compromise when it comes to his church.\n\n\u201cI want everyone to be loved for who they are, like, that\u2019s what makes the world so beautiful, is the diversity,\u201d Carton ironically states, to which Mezzenga responds by reminding his fianc\u00e9 that he agrees, and would attend Pride events with her.\n\nMezzenga then tells Carton that the topic of LGBTQ has \u201ccome up so much\u201d in their relationship, and he feels it \u201cminimizes\u201d all the other things that they do have in common with one another.\n\nCarton then bizarrely informs Mezzenga that she wants a husband who thinks exactly the way she does, with no dissenting thoughts in his mind, saying, \u201cI always just assumed I would meet a guy who aligns in every single aspect.\u201d\n\nIn another scene, the couple is seen at a bar with Carton\u2019s sister, Lisa, and Lisa\u2019s girlfriend, Kelsie, where the lesbian couple lectures them about LGBTQ issues and Mezzenga\u2019s alleged \u201cprivilege.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\nIn the clip, Carton can be heard assuring Lisa and Kelsie that if she goes to church with Mezzenga, she will make sure the church \u201caccepts\u201d LGBTQ. But that didn\u2019t appear to be good enough for Kelsie, who then lectured the couple about the word \u201cacceptance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the word \u2018acceptance\u2019 because it\u2019s like there\u2019s something wrong with us that you have to accept,\u201d Kelsie said, to which Carton responded by immediately displaying subservience and giving her sister\u2019s girlfriend the opportunity to police her speech, asking, \u201cWhat word should I use then?\u201d\n\nKelsie then bizarrely states that she \u201chates\u201d it when churches say \u201cWe accept everybody.\u201d\n\nMezzenga is then seen trying to placate the lesbian couple by saying he is \u201cfiscally conservative but socially liberal,\u201d but that, too, is not good enough for Kelsie, who then lectures Carton, saying her \u201cprivileged\u201d fianc\u00e9 is likely still voting in a way that hinders her \u201crights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are things that women experience that men do not in this world and in this country,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHow you vote maters, and there are things that we have to consider [as a lesbian couple] that you guys don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people that are fiscally conservative and socially liberal that probably vote differently than you, and that impacts your rights,\u201d Kelsie lectured Carton, adding, \u201cI think you guys need to have serious conversations about politics, because he\u2019s in a different privilege bucket than you\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAt the Love is Blind \u201creunion\u201d \u2014 which aired on Sunday \u2014 where the cast members reconvene one year later to catch up on what has happened in their lives since being on the show and reflect on their experiences, Miller doubled down on her decision to leave Buckley at the altar due to him having different political views.\n\n\u201cDevin told me a lot about his core values, something that he did not want to talk about on camera,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cI still, to this day, don\u2019t really feel comfortable telling you Devin\u2019s views, but I will be really clear about mine.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI 100 percent support the LGBTQ community,\u201d Miller elaborated. \u201cI also believe that women should have the decision to choose if they want to have an abortion or not.\u201d\n\nBuckley replied by stating, \u201cI can look past certain things, and I think that you can be together and have a relationship and not completely agree on everything, and I think a big thing with me, as a Christian, is to love everyone.\u201d\n\nIn another clip from the reunion episode, Mezzenga can be seen bizarrely apologizing for his so-called \u201cprivilege.\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cI knew coming into this experience, I definitely have had privilege in my life, and it\u2019s something that I wasn\u2019t proud of,\u201d Mezzenga said, adding that he needs to \u201cgrow\u201d and is \u201cembarrassed\u201d by how his and Carton\u2019s conversations unfolded on the show.\n\nAnother outlandish clip from the reunion episode shows Love is Blind host Nick Lachey grilling Mezzenga about his relationship with his church and demanding that the dating show contestant explain himself.\n\n\u201cYou said you couldn\u2019t remember your church\u2019s stance on gay marriage,\u201d Lachey said, before asking Mezzenga, \u201cWas that true? You simply couldn\u2019t remember, or was it maybe that you just didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the reality of your church\u2019s stance on gay marriage?\u201d\n\nWatch Below:\n\n\u201cYeah, it was honestly that I didn\u2019t remember, because I didn\u2019t ever need to know, because there wasn\u2019t really anyone in my life that it really pertained to, and it wasn\u2019t something on my head,\u201d Mezzenga replied, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe cringeworthy moment was noticeably topped off with Mezzenga\u2019s fellow castmates glaring at him in apparent contempt as he delivered his answer.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the clip of Carton leaving Mezzenga at the altar went viral on X, where Love is Blind viewers slammed the bride for ditching her groom over his lack of interest in Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ issues, and the COVID vaccine, as well as for his church being too \u201ctraditional.\u201d\n\nViewers, meanwhile, congratulated the groom for having \u201cdodged a bullet\u201d by not getting married to his \u201cinsufferable\u201d bride.\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

            "full_content": "Behind Mike Johnson lurks Elon Musk. Photo: Anna Moneymaker\n\nLike most observers, I vacillate regularly as to whether House Speaker Mike Johnson is an unexpectedly shrewd legislative tactician or is instead Mr. Magoo, a bumbling backwoods pol who survives strictly by blind luck and subservience to Donald Trump. But as Congress moves this week toward a possible government shutdown, there are fresh signs that Johnson knows what he\u2019s doing \u2014 or at least is listening to advisers or executive-branch paymasters who know what they are doing. He\u2019s devising a trap for congressional Democrats that is leaving them irresolute and possibly more powerless than ever.\n\nA stopgap spending bill enacted after a lot of difficulty last December expires on March 14. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, it looked as though the effort to keep the government operating past that date would be an existential crisis for congressional Republicans, divided as always between the hard-core House Freedom Caucus members (and their Senate counterparts) lusting for deep cuts in domestic spending and swing-district House members (and their own Senate counterparts) fearful of backlash to unpopular cuts. But since then, the executive branch via both Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE and Russ Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget \u2014 sometimes operating through Trump\u2019s agency appointees and sometimes on their own \u2014 has rushed ahead with spending cuts and personnel firings on a vast scale, asserting powers that have triggered equally vast litigation over their constitutionality.\n\nSuddenly, the right-wing pressure for achieving the demolition of the hated federal government (or at least the portions not devoted to deporting immigrants or intimidating Canada, Panama, and Greenland) via cuts in congressional spending bills has been relaxed significantly. And so it\u2019s been easier for Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to line up votes for the continuing resolution (or CR, a measure extending current appropriations until the end of the fiscal year) that Trump himself recently endorsed.\n\nBut in anticipation of another close House vote in which Democrats cannot be counted on to help keep the government open, Johnson added conservative sweeteners to the CR, which isn\u2019t \u201cclean\u201d (i.e., a simple extension of current funding levels for everything) as advertised but instead adds immediate money for defense and mass deportation and cuts domestic spending by $13 billion. House Democrats already inclined to vote \u201cno\u201d on the CR because it contains no language forcing the executive branch to actually spend the money appropriated (which would restrict the power of DOGE or OMB to unilaterally \u201cfreeze\u201d spending, cancel grants or contracts, or fire personnel) now have even less motivation to keep the government open. And over the weekend, Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries officially opposed the not-so-clean CR and Democrats began \u201cwhipping\u201d a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nIf Johnson can\u2019t wrangle his troops into near-unanimous support for his dirty CR (and Trump is leaning on them pretty hard), then it\u2019s possible the government will shut down on March 14 and Republicans will get at least a good share of the blame since they control both congressional chambers. But if they do get the CR through the House and the fight shifts to the Senate, the political situation will be entirely different. To kill the CR, Democrats would have to launch a filibuster, and in that circumstance it would be much easier for Republicans to blame them for shutting down the federal government \u2014 despite the clear intention of the Trump administration to keep gutting the government if it remains open. If just seven Senate Democrats choose to join Republicans (or all but Rand Paul, who is demanding deeper cuts; he has effectively matched with Democrat John Fetterman, who has vowed to vote to avoid a shutdown), the CR will pass.\n\nIf Senate Democrats are put to the challenge and subsequently cave, they will have more than likely forfeited any real Democratic leverage for the remainder of 2025 beyond stirring up public unhappiness with Trump 2.0. Appropriations aside, most of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda will be enacted via a gigantic budget-reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered. So the decision not to deploy a filibuster on the one crucial occasion it is available will represent an admission of powerlessness that won\u2019t make rank-and-file Democrats happy.\n\nOne of the problems Democrats in both chambers face is a misalignment of messaging at this moment. House Democrats appear to have decided the fight against Medicaid cuts being threatened in the upcoming budget-reconciliation bill is the most politically salient argument they can make. But the CR doesn\u2019t have any Medicaid cuts. And even if they find a way to shift the messaging to the threat posed by executive usurpation of congressional spending authority, is that an argument that will offset dismay over the government shutting down? Josh Marshall addressed this problem compellingly:\n\nIf you won\u2019t provide the votes [to keep the government open], what are you demanding exactly? What\u2019s necessary to get the votes to open it back up? I hear vague references to the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to cut it. I think you need to say, Elon\u2019s got to go. He\u2019s unpopular. Everyone understands what that means since they hear about him every day. But they just haven\u2019t been making that case. And without that case, it\u2019s probably not sustainable politically. Of course, you might not lay that groundwork if you weren\u2019t planning to go to the mat over it anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit late in the day for House and Senate Democrats to come together on an \u201cElon\u2019s got to go\u201d message for filibustering a CR that is necessary to keep even a gutted federal government operating. So the trap being sprung by Republicans is to cast Democrats as the bad guys in a government-shutdown saga thoroughly controlled by Trump and his minions and allies on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nPerhaps by admitting their powerlessness to do anything about it will ultimately expose Republicans to danger on the grounds that everything happening in Washington is their show, which means they \u201cown\u201d all the negative consequences down the road. But if \u201cwe can\u2019t do anything\u201d is how congressional Democrats choose to respond to their base\u2019s demand to do something, they should at a minimum say it in one voice instead of flailing around in divided opposition to a spending measure they know will be enacted. More generally, getting outfoxed by Mike Johnson is a really bad look for a party already on the defensive."

            "full_content": "Canadian Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre began his campaign against newly elected Liberal Party leader Mark Carney before he was formally elected by party elites on Sunday, declaring in remarks to supporters that Carney would fail in negotiations with American President Donald Trump because of his purported million-dollar personal entanglements in American business.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump will have a big smile on his face as he exploits all of Carney\u2019s many conflicts to attack Canadian workers and Canadian jobs,\u201d Poilievre proclaimed during a speech on Sunday.\n\nCarney was chosen to replace outgoing radical leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a low-turnout election limited to Liberal Party members on Sunday evening, the first step in organizing general elections for members of Parliament. Carney is not a member of Parliament and has never held public office or won an election for anything before Sunday, but nonetheless crushed his opponents, running away with almost 86 percent of the vote. The results were especially embarrassing for former Deputy Prime Minister Chyrstia Freeland, whose betrayal of Trudeau in a fiery resignation letter in December is largely believed to have led to Trudeau\u2019s announcement a month later that he would step down after a decade in power. Freeland came in second with eight percent support.\n\nFollowing his victory on Sunday, Carney delivered a speech that alternated awkwardly from calling for change in his country to urging Canadians to vote for the party that has controlled the government for the past decade. He extensively praised Trudeau, congratulating him for having \u201ccombined strength and compassion every day as a fighter for Canada.\n\n\u201cYou have led us through some of the hardest challenges that this nation has ever faced,\u201d Carney said to Trudeau. \u201cI pledge to you and to all Canadians that I will follow their example.\u201d\n\nPoilievre spoke before Carney, but anticipated his connections to Trudeau and used them as an argument against voting for him during remarks at an event in London, Ontario.\n\n\u201cAfter they\u2019ve caused all this damage \u2013 a sneaky trick tonight, they\u2019re going to try to get elected for a fourth term,\u201d Poilievre said. \u201cA fourth term by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic adviser Mark Carney. Carney\u2019s advice drove up taxes, housing costs, and food prices while he personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States.\u201d\n\nPoilievre appeared to seek to capitalize on anti-American sentiment in Canada, fueled by the ongoing conflict over tariffs between Trudeau and Trump.\n\n\u201cWorking for Trudeau, Carney made Canada weaker and poorer,\u201d he accused. \u201cWorking for himself, Carney made the United States richer and stronger \u2013 and, for the first time in our history, Canada will have a sneaky prime minister with millions of dollars of financial interests that go directly against our national interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump will have a big smile on his face as he exploits all of Carney\u2019s many conflicts to attack Canadian workers and Canadian jobs,\u201d Poilievre predicted.\n\nTrudeau has yet to formally resign, but that move will result in Carney assuming the prime ministership. Carney\u2019s ascent will mark a rare period in a parliamentary system in which the prime ministership will be held by someone who is not a member of Parliament and has never been elected to the Parliament, or any other office. Following Carney\u2019s installation as prime minister, Parliament has until the end of October to call for a general election to replace sitting members of Parliament and, if the Liberals lose, the prime minister.\n\nParliament has been paralyzed under a procedure known as \u201cprorogation\u201d since January, when Trudeau froze the legislative branch of the Canadian government to allow his increasingly unpopular party to replace him. Prorogation is set to conclude on March 24, but may end sooner if the Liberals request an end to the period.\n\nCarney\u2019s resume includes stints as the head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England and aiding Trudeau in longtime informal advisory roles, including advising Trudeau\u2019s disastrous response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic (Carney later publicly condemned the response that he reportedly advised). He has a longstanding relationship with Harvard university, including graduating from the school and sending his daughter, currently a freshman, to Harvard College. Carney stepped down this weekend from a seat on Harvard\u2019s second-highest governing board to formally enter Canadian politics.\n\nCarney has also developed a voice as one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate change alarmism activists, describing alleged climate change as a \u201cgreat test\u201d of post-pandemic focus on human values.\n\n\u201c[C]limate change is an issue that (i) involves the entire world, from which no one will be able to self-isolate; (ii) is predicted by science to be the central risk tomorrow; and (iii) we can only address if we act in advance and in solidarity,\u201d Carney wrote in a column for The Economist in April 2020.\n\nIn February 2021, Carney predicted that, thanks to alleged climate change, \u201cfrom a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.\u201d\n\nPoilievre has been campaigning against \u201ccarbon tax\u201d Carney for weeks. While the Conservative Party was leading both Liberals and the fellow leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) combined for weeks at the beginning of the year, more recent polls indicate that Conservatives are losing support as the left attempts to associate Conservatives with President Trump\u2019s tariff push. This has left the Conservatives in the uncomfortable position of campaigning against Trump while calling for nationalist conservative policies akin to what Trump has promoted for America.\n\n\u201cCommon Sense Conservatives condemn President Trump\u2019s massive, unjust and unjustified tariffs which will damage both American and Canadian economies,\u201d Poilievre proclaimed in February.\n\n\u201cWe share the longest undefended border and fought alongside Americans in two world wars, Korea and Afghanistan, where 158 of our brave men and women died helping the U.S. avenge the 9/11 attacks,\u201d he continued in remarks at the time. \u201cThere is no justification whatsoever for these tariffs, this treatment.\u201d\n\nPoilievre has proposed deregulating the extremely onerous process governing inter-provincial commerce in Canada to foster more domestic trade and make Canada less dependent on America in response to the tariff threat.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

Buckley, Jr., the founder of the conservative editorial magazine National Review.\n\nBuckley, a leading voice for the modern conservative movement, founded National Review in 1955 to publish conservative commentary and analysis focused on politics, current events and culture. The magazine still exists today and publishes 12 magazines annually, in addition to its daily news site.\n\nThe stamp features a graphite and charcoal portrait of Buckley, drawn by Dale Stephanos, according to the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nHistorian George Nash described Buckley as \"arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century\" in 2008 following Buckley\u2019s death.\n\n\"For an entire generation he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure,\" Nash wrote in National Review.\n\nThe magazine forged together several ideological branches and provided an outlet for views including free-market capitalism, libertarianism, traditionalism and anti-communism, according to the Bill of Rights Institute.\n\nWILLIAM F. BUCKLEY: RIGHT FROM THE START\n\nIn addition to spearheading National Review, Buckley also hosted the Emmy Award\u2013winning television program \"Firing Line\" from 1966 to 1999, which became well-known for its ideological diversity of guests ranging from former President Ronald Reagan, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, economist Friedrich Hayek, scholar Noam Chomsky and liberal author Gore Vidal.\n\n\"The success and long run of Firing Line proved that there was a place on television for civilized debate between conflicting ideologies that could entertain and inform the American public,\" according to Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.\n\nThe public policy think tank, led by former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, houses a massive videotape collection of \"Firing Line\u2019s\" more than 1,500 episodes, in addition to program preparation materials, photographs, transcripts and sound recordings.\n\nBuckley, a devout Catholic, also authored dozens of books, including \"God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of \u2018Academic Freedom,\u2019\" published in 1951, about his experience attending Yale University. The book offered a harsh assessment of Yale\u2019s secular academic climate, and Time magazine cited it in 2011 as one of the top 100 \"best and most influential\" books written in English since 1923.\n\nJAMES ROSEN: BILL BUCKLEY AND THE DEATH OF \u2018TRANS-IDEOLOGICAL\u2019 FRIENDSHIPS\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks, who launched his career as an intern with National Review, wrote after Buckley\u2019s death in 2008 that Buckley\u2019s \"greatest talent was friendship,\" and that the conservative icon was an avid writer of letters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"His second great talent was leadership,\" Brooks wrote in the New York Times. \"As a young man, he had corralled the famously disputatious band of elders who made up the editorial board of National Review. He changed the personality of modern conservatism, created a national movement and expelled the crackpots from it.\"\n\n\"He loved liberty and felt it must be constrained by the invisible bonds of the transcendent order,\" Brooks wrote."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday said it would review a Colorado law that bars mental health professionals from practicing \u201cconversion therapy\u201d for minors, a discredited practice that attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nKaley Chiles, a licensed counselor and practicing Christian, challenged that law under the First Amendment, claiming that her patients voluntarily seek out her services.\n\nChiles, who was represented by the religious group Alliance Defending Freedom, argued that the laws enacted in Colorado and more than 19 other states \u201csilence counselors\u2019 ability to express views their clients seek.\u201d But state officials countered that they may regulate the medical treatment of patients.\n\n\u201cA professional\u2019s treatment of her patients and clients is fundamentally different, for First Amendment purposes, from laypersons\u2019 interactions with each other,\u201d Colorado officials said.\n\nThe case, similar to one the Supreme Court rejected in late 2023 from a licensed marriage and family counselor in Washington state, echoes another high profile case pending on the docket. In US v. Skrmetti, Tennessee is defending a ban on puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender youth on the grounds that the state had broad power to regulate medicine.\n\nIn that case, the court\u2019s conservatives signaled during oral arguments in December that they were prepared to defer to state lawmakers on such bans. A decision is expected by July.\n\nCritics say conversion therapy \u2013 which attempts to convert people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning \u2013 into straight or cisgender people, causes serious emotional harm and can have deadly results.\n\nChiles sued over the Colorado law in 2022. A federal district court denied her request to temporarily suspend its enforcement and the Denver-based 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision. Chiles appealed to the Supreme Court in November.\n\nIn a similar appeal rejected by the high court in 2023, three conservative justices \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas \u2013 said they would have considered the case.\n\nUnder the state law, Thomas wrote in five-page opinion, \u201clicensed counselors cannot voice anything other than the state-approved opinion on minors with gender dysphoria without facing punishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the court declines to take this particular case, I have no doubt that the issue it presents will come before the court again,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cWhen it does, the court should do what it should have done here: grant certiorari to consider what the First Amendment requires.\u201d\n\nAlito said in a brief dissent in 2023 that the court should have taken up the case to address an issue that lower courts have been divided on.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, 20 States and the District of Columbia have adopted laws prohibiting or restricting the practice of conversion therapy,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cIt is beyond dispute that these laws restrict speech, and all restrictions on speech merit careful scrutiny.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump correctly noted Friday, as he has before, that Canada has tariffs above 200% on dairy products imported from the US. But Trump again failed to mention a critical fact.\n\nThose high tariffs kick in only after the US has hit a certain Trump-negotiated quantity of tariff-free dairy sales to Canada each year \u2013 and as the US dairy industry acknowledges, the US is not hitting its allowed zero-tariff maximum in any category of dairy product.\n\nIn many categories, notably including milk, the US is not even at half of the zero-tariff maximum.\n\n\u201cIn practice, these tariffs are not actually paid by anyone,\u201d Al Mussell, an expert on Canadian agricultural trade, said in an email Friday.\n\nTrump also made a claim that is simply false. He told reporters Friday that the situation with Canadian dairy tariffs was \u201cwell taken care of\u201d at the time his first presidency ended, \u201cbut under Biden, they just kept raising it.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Canada did not raise its dairy tariffs under then-President Joe Biden, as official Canadian documents show and industry groups on both sides of the border confirmed to CNN. The tariffs Trump was denouncing Friday were left in place by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which Trump negotiated, signed in 2018 and has since touted as \u201cthe best trade deal ever made.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to CNN\u2019s Friday request for comment.\n\nTrump vowed Friday to retaliate against Canada with new US dairy tariffs in the coming days, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday on NBC that the president\u2019s response to Canada on dairy will actually come on April 2, the day Trump has said he will impose reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world.\n\nTrump\u2019s USMCA left Canada\u2019s high dairy tariffs in place\n\nTrump did achieve dairy concessions from Canada.\n\nCanada has for decades irked US lawmakers with \u201csupply management\u201d policies that support Canadian farmers and protect its dairy, egg and poultry industries from foreign competition.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s USMCA, Canada guaranteed it wouldn\u2019t apply any tariffs to specific amounts of US imports per year in 14 dairy categories, such as milk, cream, cheese, ice cream, butter and cream powder, and yogurt and buttermilk. These new US-specific quotas, which Canada agreed to increase over time, gave American farmers and companies more access to the Canadian market.\n\nBut the USMCA didn\u2019t get Canada to lower the tariffs that apply to imports above the quota thresholds. And contrary to Trump\u2019s Friday claim, those tariffs didn\u2019t spike under Biden.\n\nMussell, senior research fellow at the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute and research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems, pointed CNN to Canada\u2019s published tariff lists for 2025, 2020 (the last calendar year of Trump\u2019s first term) and 2017 (the first calendar year of Trump\u2019s first term, before the USMCA was in place). They show the dairy tariff levels were the same each year for imports above the zero-tariff maximums \u2013 for example, 298.5% for above-maximum butter and 245.5% for above-maximum cheddar cheese.\n\nThose tariff levels are eye-popping, and they certainly function as major trade barriers above the zero-tariff quota maximums. (Mussell noted: \u201cThe US has precisely this same system for its dairy market. It has tariff-rate quotas, and beyond that volume, very stiff tariffs and almost no imports.\u201d) But the International Dairy Foods Association, which represents the American dairy manufacturing and marketing industry, pointed out Friday that the US is not at Canada\u2019s zero-tariff maximum in any category.\n\nBecky Rasdall Vargas, the organization\u2019s senior vice president of trade and workforce policy, argued in an interview that Canada is to blame for the inability of the US to get to the maximums, saying Canada is unfairly deploying obstacles that make it \u201charder and harder\u201d for the US to sell into the Canadian market. She said that while \u201cwe don\u2019t love the tariffs,\u201d the primary issue is that \u201cwe can never even fill the quota to begin with\u201d because Canada is using administrative tactics to deny the US the market access it is supposed to have under the USMCA.\n\nWe won\u2019t try to adjudicate this complex debate, which the Biden administration and the Canadian government battled out at a USMCA dispute resolution panel. Regardless, Trump\u2019s assertion that Canada kept hiking its dairy tariffs when Biden was in charge is just not true.\n\n\u2018Almost all\u2019 US agricultural exports to Canada face no tariffs\n\nCanada\u2019s protectionism over its dairy, egg and poultry industries is an exception, not the norm.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture notes on its website that under the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which preceded Trump\u2019s USMCA, \u201calmost all\u201d US agricultural exports to Canada, and vice versa, faced no tariffs or quotas. The USMCA kept in place that zero-tariff, zero-quota trade while securing greater US access to the smattering of Canadian markets that are governed by supply management.\n\nAnd while Trump claimed in February that \u201cthey don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part,\u201d Canada is actually the world\u2019s second-largest export market for US agricultural products as a whole, according to the US Department of Agriculture, purchasing about $28.4 billion worth in 2024.\n\nCanada is also the second-largest US export market for dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024. That figure has grown steadily over the past decade, from about $625.5 million in 2015."

Hired in 2011, when the company\u2019s public policy team was small, she managed a growing staff and oversaw government relations for entire continents, including Asia and South America. She reported to corporate vice presidents and had direct contact with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer.\n\nWynn-Williams also alleges that Sandberg crossed professional lines with her and another employee in a way that made her uncomfortable.\n\nThe memoir covers the six-plus years when Wynn-Williams, a former New Zealand diplomat, met foreign officials and accompanied Zuckerberg and other top executives as they met in person with presidents and prime ministers.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, then Facebook's chief operating officer, and Elliot Schrage, its vice president of global communications and public policy, on Capitol Hill in 2017.

NBC News has reviewed the complaint. An SEC spokesperson said Friday that the commission does not comment on potential investigations into whistleblower submissions or actions taken in response to them.\n\nMeta criticized the memoir and rejected her accusations.\n\n\u201cThis is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nSarah Wynn-Williams in New York on Thursday.

We thoroughly vetted the book. We have no obligation to give Meta or anyone else the opportunity to shut down her story.\u201d It also accused Meta of trying to \u201cinstitute a gag order to silence our author.\u201d\n\nA person who appears in the book, former Meta spokesperson Debbie Frost, broadly criticized its contents Sunday on the Meta-owned social media app Threads, saying that \u201ca bunch of the stories are exaggerated or just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d A second Meta employee who worked with Wynn-Williams, Tessa Lyons, now an Instagram vice president, said on Threads that the book was \u201cdishonest and distorted.\u201d\n\nThe book chronicles what Wynn-Williams describes as Zuckerberg\u2019s halting evolution from a software-focused engineer and political novice into an executive who micromanaged content moderation decisions about far-flung countries and considered his own run for president.

Courtesy Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nThe book is being published two months after Zuckerberg promoted Kaplan to be Meta\u2019s chief liaison to the Trump administration and other governments. Kaplan was White House deputy chief of staff for former President George W. Bush.\n\nIn 2016, as part of an email chain about Wynn-Williams\u2019 U.S. citizenship test, Kaplan asked her whether the test included the phrase \u201cdirty sanchez,\u201d a sexual slang phrase and racial slur, according to the book and a copy of the email seen by NBC News.\n\nWynn-Williams also described Kaplan\u2019s asking her after childbirth \u201cwhere are you bleeding from?\u201d and telling her at a company event that she looked \u201csultry.\u201d She writes that she considered Kaplan\u2019s behavior to be inappropriate and that she believed the investigation in 2017 was unfairly turned back on her.\n\nThen-President George W.

This person said Wynn-Williams was uncomfortable at the time with Kaplan\u2019s behavior.\n\nMeta said in its statement Sunday that the investigation \u201cdetermined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.\u201d Meta said the investigation involved 17 witness interviews over 42 days and that the company reviewed every document she provided.\n\nKaplan did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Joel Kaplan, then its vice president for global public policy, in Paris in 2018. Aurelien Morissard / IP3 / Getty Images file\n\nWynn-Williams writes that she was also uncomfortable with how Sandberg crossed what Wynn-Williams considered professional boundaries. Sandberg, the company\u2019s No. 2 executive, has been heralded as a champion of women, especially women in business, because of her success and her 2013 book, \u201cLean In,\u201d and she has advocated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. Sandberg wrote a second book, \u201cOption B,\u201d after her husband, Dave Goldberg, died suddenly in 2015.\n\nAccording to Wynn-Williams and the SEC whistleblower complaint, Sandberg repeatedly insisted that she join Sandberg in sharing a bed on a private jet as they traveled from Davos, Switzerland, to California in January 2016. Wynn-Williams, who was pregnant at the time, writes that she considered the demand to be inappropriate and mortifying and that she refused. She writes that Sandberg resented her refusal and told her at the end of the flight, \u201cYou should have got into bed.\u201d She writes that, later, she felt marginalized by Sandberg at work.\n\nA person who was on the plane said in an interview Sunday that they recall everyone on the plane, including Sandberg and other staff members, encouraging Wynn-Williams to get some sleep. This person said they did so because Wynn-Williams was visibly pregnant and they were concerned about her health, not for any other reason. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said they recall the plane as having multiple beds.\n\nAnother person who knew Wynn-Williams at the time, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Wynn-Williams told them about what happened on the plane not long afterward.\n\nIn the book and in the SEC complaint, Wynn-Williams writes that Sandberg further created an uncomfortable working environment when she instructed a different employee to purchase $13,000 worth of lingerie for Sandberg and the employee. NBC News has reviewed copies of those emails. The employee declined to comment.\n\nSandberg, through her family foundation, declined to comment on the memoir. She stepped down as Meta\u2019s chief operating officer in 2022 and left the company\u2019s board of directors last year.\n\nKumiko Hidaka, Vivian Tokai, Debbie Frost, Atsushi Iwashita, Sarah Wynn-Williams and Sheryl Sandberg. Courtesy Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nWynn-Williams is the latest whistleblower to emerge from a decade of scandals at Meta involving the company\u2019s impact on elections, violent polarization, teenage mental health and privacy. Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, testified before Congress in 2021 after she released documents showing internal dissent over company policies.\n\nThe memoir lands at a sensitive time for Meta as it stares down regulators around the globe. The company is locked in antitrust fights in the United States, with the European Union and in India, while Zuckerberg has pivoted Meta\u2019s politics to the right to align more closely with President Donald Trump.\n\nMeta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, is pouring vast sums of money into the international race to develop artificial intelligence \u2014 a contest that also involves China.\n\nWynn-Williams arrived at the company in 2011 as it was making its debut on the world stage. The Arab Spring protests fueled in part by social media had just begun, and Facebook did not have established relationships with most governments or international organizations. The scrutiny Facebook would receive for inflaming tensions that contributed to massacres in places such as Myanmar and Sri Lanka was still years away.\n\nHer background fit what Facebook lacked: A native of New Zealand and a lawyer and a diplomat by training, she had worked for the New Zealand government at its embassy in Washington and at United Nations headquarters in New York.\n\nFormer Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Mark Zuckerberg and Sarah Wynn-Williams. Courtesy Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nBut while she joined the company with optimism about its mission, she said, the choices made by executives, including Zuckerberg and Sandberg, eventually soured her.\n\n\u201cThey really could have chosen to do it all differently and fix so much of what\u2019s been destructive about Facebook,\u201d she writes. Instead, she calls the app \u201can incredibly valuable tool for the most autocratic, oppressive regimes.\u201d\n\nWynn-Williams writes that persuading Zuckerberg to meet international leaders was a challenge. A night owl who preferred wearing T-shirts, he would rarely take meetings before noon and did not want to wear clothing appropriate for the occasions, she writes. Asked at one point whether he wanted to meet the prime minister of New Zealand, Wynn-Williams says, Zuckerberg brusquely dismissed the idea \u2014 not realizing the politician was standing next to him.\n\nIn the memoir, Wynn-Williams describes Zuckerberg as fumbling his way through various encounters: getting snubbed by the prime minister of Canada, refusing to prepare before he met the president-elect of Indonesia, arriving late for an event with the president of Colombia, ad-libbing part of a speech to the U.N. General Assembly and getting turned down when he asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to name his unborn child.\n\n\u201cInitially, he would not want a briefing longer than a text message,\u201d Wynn-Williams said in the interview. But by the end of her tenure, she said, \u201che couldn\u2019t get enough information about politics and how it worked.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Zuckerberg has rarely appeared in public with world leaders. Though he attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in January and hosted a party to celebrate the event, he is more likely to be seen with mixed martial arts fighters or famous musicians.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol rotunda on Jan. 20. Kenny Holston / Pool via Getty Images\n\nThe book includes anecdotes that Wynn-Williams says show snippets of Zuckerberg\u2019s personality, gathered while she traveled with him: his belief that Andrew Jackson was the greatest American president, his interest in collecting wine from the Jackson era in the 1830s, his desire to have a \u201ctribe\u201d of children and his professed ignorance that Facebook employees were letting him win at the board game Settlers of Catan.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to win that way?\u201d she quotes herself asking Zuckerberg during one game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not winning that way,\u201d she says he responded.\n\nWynn-Williams writes that she believes many of Meta\u2019s mistakes in recent years could have been avoided. She writes that Facebook failed to act on warnings before 2016 about how politicians were using it to sway voters with half-truths.\n\nWynn-Williams says Facebook is defined by \u201clethal carelessness,\u201d claiming executives failed to respond appropriately to knowledge that Facebook inflamed global tensions and instability. She cites Facebook\u2019s role in fueling ethnic hatred and massacres, including in Myanmar, where Facebook has acknowledged that it failed to take down posts inciting violence even though the posts violated its terms of service. Wynn-Williams said the company had dragged its feet for years on hiring staff members to help moderate content from Myanmar, the site of what the U.N. calls a genocide.\n\nThe memoir goes into depth about a major question that hung over Facebook at the time: whether it would do business in China, where the government had banned its apps as part of its vast system of censorship. Facebook called its multiyear effort, starting in 2014, to persuade the Chinese government to allow the use of their apps \u201cProject Aldrin,\u201d after astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Various parts of the effort \u2014 including the building of China-specific censorship tools \u2014 have leaked over time.\n\nWynn-Williams cites or quotes from dozens of internal records about the project, some of which were reported Sunday by The Washington Post.\n\nShe writes that Zuckerberg committed to the idea of re-entering China in 2014 because he wanted to grow Facebook\u2019s user base, and she writes that Facebook had little regard for the concessions it would need to make to the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no acknowledgment at all of the moral complexity of working in an authoritarian country that surveils its own citizens and doesn\u2019t allow free speech,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cChina is, in Mark\u2019s eyes, just the end of a to-do list, the last major project to tackle,\u201d she adds.\n\n\"Careless People\" by Sarah Wynn-Williams. Elise Wrabetz / NBC News\n\nIn a series of Slack screenshots seen by NBC News, Facebook employees in 2017 discuss building specific tools to present to China\u2019s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China. The employees discuss tests they could perform for the regulators to build trust in Facebook\u2019s ability to run content-blocking tools.\n\nTheir work is echoed in several other internal documents, seen by NBC News, that include Facebook employees discussing the specifics of what they are building to show the Cyberspace Administration. Facebook employees spoke with Chinese regulators about how a censorship system could work and about what Facebook needed to do to win approval to release its apps there, according to the book and documents seen by NBC News.\n\nWynn-Williams says that the next year, when U.S. lawmakers asked Facebook about its China plans, the company shared less than it knew. Facebook submitted unsigned written testimony in 2018 to three Senate committees saying it was \u201cnot in a position to know\u201d how China would seek to apply its laws to a theoretical Facebook China service \u2014 without mentioning its years of research and negotiations.\n\nZuckerberg said in 2019 that he had largely given up the idea of operating apps in China, saying in an address about free expression that Facebook and China \u201ccould never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there.\u201d\n\nBut Meta does make huge amounts of money from China. Meta said last year that, in 2023, 10% of its revenue came from China-based advertisers trying to reach people who use Meta\u2019s apps \u2014 a figure that equals about $1 billion a month."

            "full_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe lack of a defined, public and overarching plan for President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency effort to drastically shrink the federal workforce has meant that information has seeped out here and there.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if there is a set of goals the administration is trying to reach other than simply to cut government.\n\nTo connect the dots of what\u2019s happening, I reached out to Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan and nonprofit group that advocates for good government.\n\nIt would be one thing, he told me, if workers were being cut intentionally, but it seems indiscriminate and arbitrary.\n\nInstead of \u201cReady, aim, fire,\u201d he said, it\u2019s \u201cfire, fire fire.\u201d\n\nThat should concern Americans, he argued, since the government belongs to everyone.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re watching right now is arson of a public asset, which is our federal government,\u201d Stier said.\n\nExcerpts of our full conversation, conducted by phone, are below.\n\nMissing the forest for the trees\n\nWOLF: First, please just help Americans see the see the forest on DOGE and all of these changes we\u2019re reading about.\n\nSTIER: I think the most important way of thinking about this is really fundamentally about the purpose of our government. Is it there to look out for the public good or the private interests of the office holder of the day.\n\nThat, to me, is what should be the overall narrative for people.\n\nWe had a system 140 years plus ago called the spoils system. It was the system of to the victor goes the spoils. Whoever was president got to put in place loyalists and partisans in federal jobs, and it resulted in corruption and incompetence, and ultimately in the assassination of President (James) Garfield in 1881 by a disgruntled job seeker.\n\nThat led to the system we have today of non-political, merit-based civil service, and the basic proposition that presidents were there to serve the public\u2019s will and to follow the rule of law.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is the deconstruction of that system that has served us well for 140 years \u2013 not perfectly, but well.\n\nThere are certainly lots of things that we can do better in government. Our government needs to be modernized. But what we\u2019re seeing now, in terms of the return to the spoils system, is going in the exactly wrong direction.\n\nBut Trump is also talking about a return to a merit system\n\nWOLF: There\u2019s an irony here since Trump, in his address to a joint session of Congress, was talking about how he is returning to a merit system by doing away with diversity programs, some of which have been in place since the 1960s. How do you refute his argument that this purging of the workforce is actually a return to the to the merit system?\n\nSTIER: It\u2019s important not to confuse different elements of what\u2019s going on here. There is this variety of excuses being offered as to the changes that are taking place, and one of those is this notion of getting rid of DEI. Whatever the merits are of that \u2013 and I don\u2019t even think we need to get into that \u2013 things that are happening to our government now are, at best, infinitesimally, tangentially related to DEI.\n\nThe firings of what are called probationary workers, who are basically the new workers in the federal government, are arbitrary with no cohesive plan, with no focus on poor performers, no focus on job occupations, that has nothing to do with DEI. The firing of Inspectors General, the people who are tasked with getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse in our government, across the government, that has nothing to do with DEI. The firing of the head of the Office of Special Counsel, that has nothing to do with DEI. That\u2019s somebody who\u2019s supposed to make sure that whistleblowers who are finding waste, fraud and abuse have a place to go.\n\nThe things that he has done in all these areas are about making the government more pliant to his wishes.\n\nThe public will pay a price for what\u2019s already happened\n\nWOLF: You talked about the Office of Special Counsel. The head of that office is fighting for his job in court. He\u2019s also brought to the Merit Systems Protection Board the firing of 5,000 USDA workers. Is there an opportunity for the system, essentially, to work despite Trump\u2019s efforts, or have we already seen irreparable harm to the bureaucracy?\n\nSTIER: It\u2019s not over yet. There\u2019s certainly opportunities to redress the problems that have been created. Honestly, the plans that have been described so far would take us even further down this road. The plans we\u2019re seeing are the firing of 90,000 VA workers and other parts of the government. The courts have stepped in to stop some of the things that are clearly illegal, and they can make things better, but they don\u2019t fix them. When people are fired illegally and they\u2019re given their job back, at least temporarily, they\u2019ve still been fired.\n\n(CNN has reported on a plan to cut more than 70,000 workers at VA.)\n\n\u2018Worse than amateur hour\u2019\n\nWOLF: These larger plans are coming out to us in drips and drabs. Why is it a problem that we don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s ultimate plan for the government is?\n\nSTIER: There does not appear to be a strategy. What we\u2019re seeing right now is not ready, aim, fire; but fire, fire, fire.\n\nThere does not appear to be justification for the cuts that have been made. There\u2019s no appropriate preparation, and it\u2019s being done in a way that is most hurtful to the people involved.\n\nIt is worse than amateur hour.\n\nWe\u2019re hearing drips and drabs of plans to fire people or to make cuts but no justification for why those cuts, why those people being fired, and no evidence that it\u2019s been either thoughtfully constructed or thoughtfully done. In fact, it\u2019s the reverse.\n\n\u201cArson of a public asset\u201d\n\nWOLF: This is not being done with transparency, so what should Americans assume is the end game of the White House here?\n\nSTIER: When you\u2019re dealing with public assets, there\u2019s a responsibility, there\u2019s an obligation for those in power to be transparent. And this, in itself, is a major violation of their responsibility as public leaders.\n\nCongress has been absent. Congress should be demanding the exact information that we\u2019re talking about right now. It should be asking for the strategy, the plans, the justification, and they deserve it as much as the larger public does.\n\nThis is important, because these are public assets. What we\u2019re watching right now is arson of a public asset, which is our federal government. There should be a pretty high bar to justify that.\n\nThere\u2019s some rationalization that this is about saving money, when in fact, the costs are clearly going to be far larger than anything that\u2019s actually saved, and even their statement of savings is demonstrably proven wrong.\n\nThere\u2019s a cost to cutting\n\nWOLF: Why is the cost of this effort going to be more than the savings?\n\nSTIER: Fundamentally look at the firings themselves. They\u2019re firing people illegally, who are now having to be rehired. The human cost is enormous. You\u2019ve got thousands of people who are fired that have to protect their rights and get rehired, at least temporarily. The people who are defending the illegal actions of President Trump\u2019s personnel are our civil servants, and where there\u2019s liability, back pay, etc. it\u2019s going to be the American taxpayer that pays them.\n\nThe probationary folks, the new employees that are getting fired are the newest in to the federal government. They cost north of $5,000 a person to recruit, to hire and to train these new employees. That\u2019s all wasted money for no strategic reason, no analysis. What we\u2019re seeing is a little bit similar to someone saying, I saved money because I stopped paying my electric bill. Are you going to sit in the dark, or are you actually doing something that makes the whole system better?\n\nNo precedent for Elon Musk in government\n\nWOLF: What is your view of Elon Musk and DOGE\u2019s involvement in this?\n\nSTIER: It comes back to transparency point. We\u2019ve never had anything remotely like this before, where you have a private individual with enormous financial interest in the decision making of the government, making large across-the-board decisions in the government with no protections against ensuring that the use of public authorities is for the public good rather than his private input.\n\nOur government is a public asset and the use of government authority should only be for public interest. Understanding that he\u2019s pulling the strings when he has no business doing so, given his business, given the fact that he himself has not been confirmed by the Senate, or even really a full time federal employee.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on this. There is historical precedent going back to the 1930s that justifies the existence of these independent agencies, that is the law today. Can this Supreme Court overturn it? They could, but it\u2019s the law of the day today.\n\nThe normal way we would proceed in these circumstances would be to assume these things are constitutional until the Supreme Court changed the law. But that is not where we are right now.\n\nThe Framers wouldn\u2019t have imagined many of the complexities we have in this world that that justified the creation of these entities. You look at something like the Federal Reserve, which is one of the independent entities. Pretty much all economists would say that the independence that exists for the Federal Reserve is really very good for our well-being as a country and for our economy.\n\nThis is another example where this president is trying to become the king and is trying to seize power across the board. His motivations have to be questioned when it\u2019s not just those independent agencies he\u2019s going after, but he\u2019s going after folks like the inspector generals and the head of the Office of Special Counsel. There is no there\u2019s no justification for doing that that is aligned with the well-being of the American people. It is just bad for them, because what you\u2019re losing are the people who are actually there responsible for getting at waste, fraud and abuse."

            "full_content": "Photo: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nNew York City\u2019s mayoral race received a significant jolt earlier this month with the news that former governor Andrew Cuomo was officially challenging Mayor Eric Adams for his seat in an attempted comeback following his abrupt resignation years prior. He joins an already crowded field of state legislators \u2014 Jessica Ramos, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani as well as current and former comptrollers Brad Lander and Scott Stringer, among others. That number grew even more as City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams announced her bid for mayor, adding another moderate voice to the race.\n\nI recently spoke with Dr. Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, about Cuomo\u2019s entry into the race, whether he could pull from Mayor Adams\u2019s moderate base, and if his bid could present a new opportunity for the other challengers in the race.\n\nThere\u2019s been this impression that Andrew Cuomo is inevitable, with him leading in the polls even before he jumped into the mayoral race. Is this just a result of coming into this with a high name ID as the former governor, or is this a true signal that this is Cuomo\u2019s race to lose?\n\nI think it might be his race to lose. I mean, obviously, New Yorkers appear to be very frustrated with Eric Adams and the current administration. It doesn\u2019t appear that New Yorkers have coalesced around an opposition candidate who has been running thus far. So it\u2019s left space for them to find him attractive because, let\u2019s be clear, on a lot of measures, many of Eric Adams\u2019s policies have been a success. It\u2019s just the perception of corruption and incompetence that is plaguing his administration. So people are looking for an alternative \u2014 in a personality, in a person \u2014 but not necessarily in the policies. And that\u2019s why people are clamoring toward an Andrew Cuomo, because it\u2019s, in many ways, much of Eric Adams\u2019s policies, just in different packaging.\n\nAnd Cuomo is entering this race as a more moderate candidate, putting him in direct competition with Eric Adams.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not great for Eric Adams. But don\u2019t forget, we still have, most likely, a very low turnout race and a low-information race as to how ranked-choice voting works. I think the name recognition is huge for Andrew Cuomo. I think there\u2019ll be a lot of money spent on his behalf. I think there\u2019ll be a lot of money spent to make sure that Andrew Cuomo does not succeed. There are many people who want him to explain himself about COVID, about nursing homes, about sexual harassment. I mean, he does have some negatives in his column. But, by and large, New York isn\u2019t a progressive city, so a moderate candidate is appealing. And, again, it\u2019s not as though Andrew Cuomo was deviating from many of Eric Adams\u2019s policies. He\u2019s just presenting a different moderate alternative to Eric Adams.\n\nThroughout his career, Cuomo has cultivated relationships in the Black community and leaned on those through his reelections as well as during this attempted comeback. Many of those same voters and leaders helped to propel Mayor Adams to victory during his first campaign. Is there a sense that Cuomo could pull Black voters from Adams, or has his appeal in this regard been overstated?\n\nI think it\u2019s both. Yes, in some sectors, there are people who are frustrated with Eric Adams, and they think he is squandering a real opportunity and real potential, and so that\u2019s where Cuomo can pick up. But don\u2019t forget, now that Adrienne Adams is in the race, and also the fact that Zellnor Myrie has been making inroads with Black communities in his various races, it\u2019s not as binary as it may appear between Mayor Adams and Cuomo. There are other alternatives, significant ones at that.\n\nI also think the passing of NAACP New York State Conference president Hazel Dukes is huge, because Andrew Cuomo has gone to the Black community, yes, for campaigns, but he\u2019s also run to the Black community when he\u2019s been in trouble. And, by and large, Hazel Dukes and many Black leaders in Harlem, in particular, have been very forgiving, and they have contextualized the complexity that is Andrew Cuomo. I think that he was possibly hoping that he would have the tacit support of Hazel Dukes or, if nothing else, if she couldn\u2019t give it explicitly, she could help direct certain resources and support in his direction. That is no longer an option. And so, how he renegotiates some of his relationships with Black leaders, many of whom are older Black leaders who had a lot of love and admiration and respect for his father, which kind of translated to Andrew Cuomo \u2014 I think he\u2019ll have to figure that out.\n\nThough Adrienne Adams will likely have more of an uphill battle with her late entry, what do you think she brings to the race?\n\nI mean, if her policies are more moderate, essentially she\u2019s saying we have two highly flawed candidates in Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, and if you like some of their policies, I\u2019m presenting similar policy prescriptions, just without the baggage. Without the harassment, without the bullying, the list goes on and on. In her sort of campaign speech, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m a mother and a wife and just a girl from Queens, and, essentially, I like to do my job, build coalitions, and have no drama. And there are a lot of New Yorkers who just want that. They just want people to go to work. I don\u2019t want to hear about you at the club. I don\u2019t want to hear about you touching women. I don\u2019t want to hear about you bullying people. I don\u2019t want to hear about corruption and a few million dollars missing here from a book deal or you\u2019re surrounding yourself with friends that are taking bribes, allegedly. Like, I just want someone to do their job. We already have enough chaos at the federal level, and I think that will be appealing to a lot of New Yorkers since there is so much instability at the federal level. They want as much stability in the city as possible.\n\nBut if she, Cuomo, and Mayor Adams are all pulling from the same base of moderate voters, can she outrank those bigger names?\n\nWe still have four months, right? And it\u2019s New York politics, so a lot can change in four months. This is depending on if she can raise money, if she can get signatures to actually be on the stage. As of now, Jessica Ramos does not have the money to be on the stage. So we don\u2019t have any women who would be on the stage, presumably. And we also have three men who would be on the stage in Stringer, Adams, and Cuomo, who have all had sexual-misconduct allegations lobbied against them.\n\nFor the few people who are paying attention in the voting-eligible population that does decide to participate on June 24, if they\u2019re tuning into debates and Adrienne Adams is the only woman on the stage, there are ways that she can frame policy issues from a gendered perspective, which we\u2019ve seen effectively done. There are ways that she could frame their accusations in a way that sort of signals not just, you know, the Me Too movement, but just the level of distraction that some of these gentlemen could bring to the office. And, again, the shadow of Donald Trump is hanging over this election. So it\u2019s not just who could get resources from an erratic president. It\u2019s who could stay focused in a time where New York needs a mayor to be as focused as possible.\n\nThe field for this race was already crowded before Cuomo and Speaker Adams joined, largely featuring less-well-known state legislators and city officials. How do these new challengers potentially change the calculations for them, especially considering how unpredictable ranked-choice elections can be?\n\nIf anything, I think it just inspires them to stay in the race and double down. I mean, if you\u2019ve got eight-to-one matching funds, you never know what can happen in a New York City election. We had the looming court cases of Eric Adams that, thus far, have gone away, but not permanently. We do know that Andrew Cuomo had a bit of a bump, obviously, coming in, but we don\u2019t know what groups are going to organize against him, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s nursing homes, whether it\u2019s money, whether it\u2019s Me Too, right? There are a lot of moving parts. Even though I think of the Venn diagram of, say, Scott Stringer and Brad Lander overlapping quite a bit in a low-turnout, low-information election, why not stay in? If not for this year, who knows what it could do four years from now?\n\nYou\u2019re seeing different candidates trying to make their mark, especially with Cuomo jumping in. Myrie has a website calling out the governor over Trump. Mamdani has had a really strong social-media presence. Could Cuomo\u2019s entry actually be an opportunity for some of these other candidates?\n\nI mean, you have sort of two different villains now to talk about, right? We\u2019ve been talking about Eric Adams. We\u2019ve been talking about the questions of: Is he able to lead? Is he focused? All of those issues we\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time. This can galvanize some of the lesser-known candidates to actually have a new foil to talk about some of their own policy issues.\n\nNow that Andrew Cuomo is in, he\u2019s also going to have to answer some hard questions. It\u2019s one thing when it\u2019s speculation. But they\u2019re already questions of: Does he really live in New York? Does he know New York? He\u2019s going to get questions about the minutiae of New York. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who knows Albany better than Andrew Cuomo, but I\u2019m not sold that he knows New York City. And so, with the shadow of Donald Trump behind this election, it\u2019s who can get the most for New York City. Is it going to be a brash, bullying tactic? Is it going to be, you know, you get more with honey as opposed to vinegar? But we don\u2019t know. I mean, obviously, Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo, and Donald Trump have all known each other for a very, very long time and have worked together in various capacities. So there are a lot of moving parts, active moving parts, that are still unknown, and we\u2019ll sort of see how they play out in the next four months.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this push from some groups advocating for voters to not rank both Cuomo and Mayor Adams on their ballots and focus on more progressive challengers like Lander, Stringer, or Mamdani. Last time, we saw Kathryn Garcia and Andrew Yang form an alliance in the race. Could we see a similar move this time around, especially considering Speaker Adams and Cuomo joining the race?\n\nI\u2019m curious. I\u2019m not sold that that\u2019s a winning strategy. I mean, obviously, it wasn\u2019t a winning strategy. Neither one became mayor. But I do wonder if maybe we won\u2019t see a tag team like we saw with Garcia and Yang, but more of \u201canyone but Adams and Cuomo.\u201d So I\u2019m curious if that will sort of catch hold. It doesn\u2019t matter how you rank Brad or Zellnor or Zohran or Adrienne or Scott, it\u2019s just whatever you do, don\u2019t put the sort of two Queens boys on their ballot. And again, as I keep saying, it\u2019s the shadow of Donald Trump hovering over this election. And it will be interesting to see if Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo sort of get linked to this kind of, the three Queens boys. You know, Trump, Cuomo, Adams \u201ccan\u2019t play in the sandbox well with others,\u201d \u201ca lot of potential to do good, but they choose not to.\u201d There are a lot of conversations that could link the three in their quasi-similar personality styles at times. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if that\u2019s a strategy that some candidates go for or if it\u2019s something else."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nFederal judges hearing Trump administration litigation have increasingly gone beyond the case at hand to reflect on potential threats to democracy or offer dramatic assertions about the state of America.\n\nDemocratic and Republican appointees alike, these judges are giving voice to a simmering concern in judicial circles about the erosion of constitutional norms during the first weeks of the second Trump administration.\n\nBut in doing so, they are breaking with a culture of judicial restraint and defying the current reluctance in many quarters to cross President Donald Trump.\n\nThese judicial voices are rare, to be sure, but they are growing in number.\n\n\u201cAn American President is not a king,\u201d a federal judge in Washington, DC, slipped into an opinion on late Thursday.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge in Rhode Island hearing a dispute over a government-wide freeze on funding invoked America\u2019s founding \u201cafter enduring an eight-year war against a monarch\u2019s cruel reign\u201d and added a cautionary footnote: \u201cThis is what it all comes down to: we may choose to survive as a country by respecting our Constitution, the laws and norms of political and civil behavior. \u2026 Or, we may ignore these things at our peril.\u201d\n\nA judge in Seattle declared in a separate case, \u201cIt has become ever-more apparent that to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals.\u201d\n\nCurrent and retired federal judges told CNN they are watching the emerging pattern with trepidation. Some are heartened by jurists raising their voices, but others believe judges should be particularly restrained in today\u2019s polarized atmosphere.\n\nSupreme Court justices, for their part, have avoided broader statements about Trump\u2019s initiatives or the way he is wielding power.\n\nAnd Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative who has consistently sided with the Trump administration over the years, fired a warning of sorts to federal district court judges last week.\n\nAlito, joined by three other justices on the right wing, declared in a dissenting opinion that US District Judge Amir Ali, who\u2019d temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s freeze on billions in foreign aid, had engaged in \u201can act of judicial hubris.\u201d Alito said he was \u201cstunned\u201d that the majority had let the judge\u2019s order stand.\n\nThe US Supreme Court is seen in Washington, DC, on March 2, 2025. Tierney L Cross/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMore than 100 cases have been filed against Trump\u2019s executive orders and policies since he took office on January 20, and in many cases, judges are moving slowly and hewing to the discrete issues at hand.\n\nIt is still difficult to know how much of a check the third branch will be on the executive; the Republican-led Congress has demonstrated the legislative branch\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThese judicial voices of distress \u2014 at the first level of the three-tier federal bench \u2014 may indicate increased scrutiny for Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nOr they might, more truly, reveal developing friction within the federal bench over how to respond to Trump\u2019s unparalleled effort to expand executive power in modern times.\n\nFederal judges, appointed for life, follow canons of impartiality. A real dilemma exists among those who wear the robe over how freely to speak their mind.\n\nAnother factor is how much fire they might provoke. Trump\u2019s allies already have been publicly calling out individual judges who have ruled against the administration\u2019s moves to overhaul the government.\n\n\u201cHigh-ranking government officials (appointed and elected) have made repeated calls for the impeachment of judges who issue opinions with which the government does not agree,\u201d American Bar Association President William Bay said in a statement last week. \u201cThere have been calls to impeach \u2018corrupt judges\u2019 with no effort to produce evidence of the so called \u2018corruption.\u2019\u201d\n\nBay added that such acts of intimidation \u201care designed to cow our country\u2019s judges,\u201d and he called on fellow lawyers to be more vocal. \u201cWho will speak for the judiciary? Who will protect our system of justice? If we don\u2019t speak now, when will we speak?\u201d\n\nUS District Judge John Coughenour, of Seattle, hearing a challenge to Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship, was one of the first judges to level a broader admonition.\n\nWhen he indefinitely blocked the executive order, Coughenour, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, maintained Trump was playing \u201cpolicy games.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or simply ignore, whether that be for political or personal gain,\u201d Coughenour said in early February as he announced his order from the bench. \u201cIn this courtroom and under my watch, the rule of law is a bright beacon which I intend to follow.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, a district court judge in Maryland similarly blocked Trump\u2019s attempt to undermine birthright citizenship, but without the scalding criticism of Trump.\n\nJudge Deborah Boardman, an appointee of President Joe Biden, wrote that Trump\u2019s directive \u201cflouts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, conflicts with binding Supreme Court precedent, and runs counter to our 250-year history of citizenship by birth.\u201d\n\nJudge William Alsup in San Francisco, reviewing a challenge to the Office of Personal Management and mass firings of probationary employees, drew national notice for his alarm at the administration\u2019s approach: \u201cHow could so much of the workforce be amputated suddenly overnight?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so irregular and so widespread and so aberrant in the history of our country,\u201d he added.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of Bill Clinton, referred to an employee who\u2019d received a \u201cglowing\u201d report five days before termination for poor performance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not right in our country, is it, that we run our agencies with lies like that and stain somebody\u2019s record for the rest of their life? Who is going to want to work in a government that would do that to them?\u201d\n\nIn one of the most expansive reflections on the Trump litigation, US District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, looked to founding history as he said a Trump freeze on congressionally appropriated funds to states for social services \u201cfundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe begin by restating the American government principles learned during critical civics education lessons in our youth,\u201d McConnell, an appointee of Barack Obama, wrote in the case brought by nearly two dozen states seeking to ensure disbursement of appropriated grants, loans and other federal assistance.\n\n\u201cOur founders, after enduring an eight-year war against a monarch\u2019s cruel reign from an ocean away, understood too well the importance of a more balanced approach to governance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey constructed three co-equal branches of government, each tasked with their own unique duties, but with responsibilities over the other branches as a check in order to ensure that no branch overstepped their powers, upsetting the balance of the fledgling constitutional republic.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said the Trump administration had \u201cput itself above Congress\u201d as it blocked the appropriated funds, adding that the move would significantly disrupt critical health, education and other public assistance programs.\n\nIn another remarkable gesture, McConnell lifted a caution from an earlier case in his district: \u201cThis is what it all comes down to: we may choose to survive as a country by respecting our Constitution, the laws and norms of political and civic behavior, and by educating our children on civics, the rule of law, and what it really means to be an American, and what America means. Or, we may ignore these things at our \u2026 peril.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s Thursday rejection of the administration\u2019s attempt to halt appropriated funds followed a similar order, on February 25, by US District Judge Loren AliKhan, a Biden appointee, in Washington, DC.\n\nIn her order blocking the administration\u2019s pause on the disbursement of financial assistance, she referred to the \u201cnationwide chaos and paralysis\u201d the administration had generated, but she declined to offer a larger assessment of this moment in history.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell, also in Washington, DC, did not hold back Thursday night as she declared Trump\u2019s firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board, an \u201cillegal act.\u201d\n\nTrump has tried to remove several officials at independent agencies.\n\n\u201cThe President seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme,\u201d Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote.\n\nAnd she insisted, in one of the more attention-getting lines of recent litigation, \u201cAn American President is not a king \u2014 not even an \u2018elected\u2019 one \u2014 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP\n\nA few weeks into Donald Trump\u2019s second term, a MAGA-supporting acquaintance asked me why the left seemed \u201cso unbelievably demoralized.\u201d He was not (merely) gloating; he was curious. \u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t last,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut for now it\u2019s just sort of a bewildering sensation to feel like you\u2019re doing politics with no opposition.\u201d There was a note of pity in his voice.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. The first signs of life from the dazed Democrats following the inauguration were not exactly encouraging: Joining a protest outside the Treasury on February 4, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer held hands with California representative Maxine Waters \u2014 an icon of the resistance to Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and chanted \u201cWe will win!\u201d several times before seeming to realize the implausibility of his boast. Interrupting himself, he leaned into the mic and rephrased: \u201cWe won\u2019t rest! We won\u2019t rest!\u201d\n\nShortly after, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waved the white flag. Smug, offended, and baffled all at once, he asked reporters, \u201cWhat leverage do we have? Republicans have repeatedly lectured America: They control the House, the Senate, and the presidency. It\u2019s their government.\u201d As if we hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\nRarely inspiring, party leaders are selected for their capacity to find consensus, manipulate parliamentary machinery, and fundraise. Ask anyone why Jeffries is minority leader: He brings home the bacon. Schumer once had a salty, outer-borough pique that did some work to counter Trump, but his mien today is weary and distracted. In the middle of a January presser charging the president with having \u201cplunged the country into chaos,\u201d Schumer turned his attention to his ringing cell phone, then told the crowd that his grandson had lost a tooth. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big occasion,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the lethargy has deeper roots. Chastened by Trump\u2019s victory, Democrats seem to lack the courage of their convictions, if they even know what those convictions are. Politically and literally geriatric, they keep doddering into rooms and forgetting why they were heading there in the first place. The fierce cultural politics that defined the party in Trump\u2019s first term are out of favor. Biden\u2019s pro-labor populism didn\u2019t work. The liberals are sidelined; the ascendant moderates offer warmed-over Clintonism and Cold War nostalgia. The base wants more spirited dissent, but cautious electeds fear being associated with disruption. (The various spectacles during Trump\u2019s speech to Congress \u2014 Al Green\u2019s sincerity notwithstanding \u2014 felt both anachronistic and vaguely embarrassing.) All that marching around is a flavor of \u201cwoke.\u201d And wokeness, they say, cost them the election.\n\nLike many political losers before him, Jeffries is indulging in the blithe comfort of not being responsible. If the Democrats are powerless to stop Trump, he reasons, they can\u2019t be blamed for the consequences. And maybe, when the real pain starts, the public will pine once again for the party of order, the adults in the room. On February 25, James Carville made this logic explicit in a New York Times op-ed: \u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead. Allow the Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us.\u201d Sounding very much like a divorced parent desperate to win back our affection from \u201cfun dad,\u201d Carville wrote, \u201cJust when they\u2019ve pushed themselves to the brink and it appears they could collapse the global economy, come in and save the day.\u201d\n\nIt is a particularly liberal delusion that a party should be rewarded for its powerlessness. If it were ever plausible, Trump has put that notion to rest. Power must be met with power. As political currency, responsibility and competence have lost their value. (Blame inflation.) Dad gave the kids too much candy, but the sugar high may never wear off.\n\nAt least two Democratic senators seem to understand this new reality: Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Both are contesting Trump\u2019s status as the sole protagonist in D.C. and articulating a more urgent vision for the opposition. Sanders landed the first blow against Carville\u2019s rope-a-dope scheme. \u201cThe problem is the Democrats have been playing dead for too many years,\u201d he said on Meet the Press, citing bleak markers of inequality and poverty. \u201cI don\u2019t think you play dead. I think you stand up for the working class of this country.\u201d\n\nSanders has taken this message \u2014 the same one he\u2019s been peddling for 50 years \u2014 on the road with his Fighting Oligarchy tour, holding rallies in swing districts with Republican incumbents in the hopes of pressuring them to vote against cuts to Medicaid and other services. The energy of these events, his staff said, significantly exceeds what they saw in the fall when Sanders was campaigning for Kamala Harris. As the senator told me via email, \u201cTrumpism will not be defeated inside the D.C. beltway.\u201d\n\nMurphy, in a phone call, was more generous toward leadership\u2019s perspective, describing its theory of power, in which it is reserved and opportunistically released, as \u201ctraditional.\u201d But ultimately, he said, the past ten years were a victory for a different model, one in which \u201cpower is a muscle, and if you use it every day, your message is not hurt by repetition and by constant volume. It is helped.\u201d If Democrats don\u2019t exercise that muscle, Trump is left to do what he does best: monopolize our every waking moment. What\u2019s more, Murphy suggested, Democrats imperil their credibility if they don\u2019t treat Trump\u2019s threats with alarm. \u201cYou lack sincerity if you said during the campaign that if voters elected him, he was going to destroy democracy, and then once he gets sworn in, you\u2019re not acting as if it\u2019s a moment of existential crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy\u2019s sense of crisis, like my own, has been cultivated by exposure to the ideas of the \u201cnew right.\u201d During the Biden years, he undertook a study of MAGA\u2019s more florid intellectual currents. The movement he saw \u201cwas tapped into the spiritual emotional crisis that the country was going through in a way the left wasn\u2019t and was planning for 2025,\u201d he said. It was \u201cdeeply radicalized\u201d and motivated by an overwhelming enmity. If Murphy was quicker than most Democrats to recognize the \u201cexistential\u201d danger of Trump 2.0, it\u2019s because he knew it would be this movement running the show. \u201cThey don\u2019t really think that democracy has much use any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy\u2019s actual message, however, is similar to Sanders\u2019s. Murphy may be concerned about what new-right intellectuals like Michael Anton or Darren Beattie are doing in the White House (both are State Department advisers), but most Americans don\u2019t care. \u201cRight now, we have to be laser focused on telling people the story of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kleptocratic billionaire takeover of our government that can only occur by the destruction of our democracy.\u201d\n\nDefending democracy, as such, didn\u2019t much profit Biden or Harris. Democracy can feel like an abstraction \u2014 or worse, when it fails to provide. But if Democrats don\u2019t take the threat seriously, they risk not only their credibility but the means to contest for power in the future. Their trouble is that they\u2019re undergoing an identity crisis \u2014 reimagining how to build an electoral majority \u2014 while needing to protect our constitutional order and vital services from psychopathic billionaire arsonists and con men. They\u2019re driving the ambulance and repainting it at the same time. It\u2019s not an easy task. But a populist message that names the enemies, and links them to the public\u2019s deprivation, is a good start.\n\nI sometimes think the reason Democrats are so despised is that everyone across the political spectrum, whether they know it or not, has high expectations for the party. (Some weird, unconscious hangover from New Deal hegemony, perhaps.) Republicans expect them to be good-faith opponents, moderates expect them to be pragmatic, liberals expect them to be ardent champions of rights, and the left and labor expect them to be sincere egalitarians. The Democrats are barely any of these things now. They could be again, but they\u2019ll have to learn: In American politics, you win or you lose. Righteous defeat gets you nowhere. There is no dignity dividend."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA top acting State Department official deleted at least half a dozen tweets that ridiculed his now boss, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, including ones calling him \u201clow IQ\u201d and repeating a false rumor about Rubio\u2019s sexuality.\n\nThe deleted tweets from Darren Beattie, the acting under secretary of state for public diplomacy, were uncovered as part of a CNN review of his social media and include a mixture of insults and harsh attacks against Rubio.\n\nBeattie, who was fired from his role as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration after CNN\u2019s KFile revealed he attended a conference featuring White nationalists, made a series of attacks over the years against other Republicans, including a number of offensive, homophobic and racist comments.\n\nThough Beattie left up several of his most inflammatory posts, he does appear to have purged criticism of Rubio from his feed. Beattie deleted tweets suggesting a deep hostility toward Rubio \u2014 particularly after the then-senator voted to certify the 2020 election results and condemned the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. One deleted tweet also attacked Rubio for criticizing possible Russian actions in Ukraine.\n\nAfter being ousted from the Trump White House in 2018, Beattie launched Revolver News, a far-right media outlet that has spread conspiracies regarding the January 6 attack. The website has boosted false claims that federal agencies orchestrated aspects of the attack and that extremist groups involved were under government control.\n\nIn a tweet that was removed for violating Twitter\u2019s terms of service, on the day Roe v. Wade was overturned, Revolver News posted about shooting women who get abortions.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: It\u2019s now legal to shoot women having abortions in New York City with your Supreme Court-issued concealed handgun,\u201d read the post.\n\nBeattie\u2019s appointment fueled outrage, with Democrats calling for his removal over his history of racist and misogynistic tweets and posts that denied the Uyghur genocide in China \u2014 most of which are still on his public X account.\n\nIn response to a series of questions from CNN, Beattie responded, \u201cSecretary Rubio is 100 percent America First and it\u2019s a tremendous honor to work for him in advancing President Trump\u2019s world historical agenda.\u201d\n\nRubio has declined to comment on Beattie\u2019s past offensive statements and said that Beattie\u2019s role would focus on perceived online censorship. He has also said Beattie will not be nominated for the full-time position, which requires Senate confirmation. Acting officials can serve for 300 days.\n\nBeattie\u2019s position ranks as one of the most important at the State Department, serving as the secretary of state\u2019s top adviser on public affairs and public diplomacy. Beattie also oversees the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which implements educational, professional and cultural exchanges to advance US interests, such as foreign exchange programs and Fulbright scholarships.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio arrives before President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nBeattie\u2019s position at the State Department highlights Rubio\u2019s unique role in the administration. Once a fierce Trump critic and a hawkish internationalist, Rubio now finds himself working with people who have openly ridiculed him.\n\nIn a now-deleted tweet on January 7, 2021, Beattie invoked far-right conspiracy theories about Rubio\u2019s past, referencing \u201cWainwright Park\u201d \u2014 a curfew violation from Rubio\u2019s teenage years that was later twisted into baseless speculation that Rubio is gay \u2014 and \u201cfoam,\u201d a reference to similarly unfounded claims about Rubio attending foam parties at gay nightclubs.\n\n\u201cForget Wainwright park, forget the foam, forget the war promotion and the neocon sugar daddies, forget the low IQ, forget the 2016 primary, Rubio is TOUGH ON CHINA (and good for military industrial complex) So be a good DOG and vote for him!!!\u201d Beattie wrote.\n\nA follow-up tweet about Rubio said, \u201cWhat happens in the Cabana stays in the Cabana #Rubio.\u201d\n\nBeattie followed up his tweet with one that mocked what he perceived as Rubio\u2019s attempt to rebrand himself as a nationalist, while sarcastically saying he supported tax credits for Black Lives Matter and criticizing his hawkish rhetoric on China.\n\n\u201cIf a bunch of DC wonks try to reinvent Marco Rubio as a nationalist, but a \u2018respectable\u2019 one who promises tax credits to BLM supporters and is \u201cTOUGH ON CHINA\u201d will you be a good dog and vote for him?\u201d the tweet said.\n\n\u201cDoes Marco Rubio have a future in politics?\u201d Beattie asked in another deleted tweet.\n\nBeattie deleted three other tweets from July 23, 2020, that called efforts to rebrand Rubio a nationalist a \u201cscam,\u201d \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cfake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea behind the Hawley/Rubio scam is this. They are smart enough to know the rebranded neoconservatism of Nikki Haley and Crenshaw has no legs. Also smart enough to know free-market libertarianism has no legs,\u201d Beattie wrote.\n\nIn a deleted March 7, 2022, tweet, Beattie cast doubt that then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons during the country\u2019s civil war in a tweet attacking Rubio\u2019s warning that any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks in Ukraine would be attributable to Russia.\n\n\u201cI bet Rubio still thinks Assad gassed his own people,\u201d Beattie wrote, responding to Rubio."

            "full_content": "Illustration: David Macaulay\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIn February 2024, dairy farmers in the northwest corner of the Texas Panhandle noticed that their herds were getting sick. A cow\u2019s temperature would spike, and she would stop eating. Soon, her milk would dry up or turn thick \u2014 tests would reveal the milk had twice the normal number of white blood cells. The feverish cows would barely drink any water. As they grew dehydrated, their eyes sank into their heads. Nearly all of them had mastitis: a swollen, painful udder and teats, which made milking difficult.\n\nThe disease seemed to be spreading; veterinarians in the region heard from colleagues in Kansas and New Mexico who reported the same constellation of symptoms. On March 14, a group of them got on a conference call with animal-health specialists from around the country, trading information on what they had begun calling \u201cmystery cow disease.\u201d \u201cWe made a master list of causes and just started checking it twice,\u201d said Barb Petersen, a veterinarian who cares for 40,000 cows on several dairies near Amarillo. Was it heavy metals in the feed? That could explain why so many herds had gotten sick so quickly. But no, the feed was okay. A bacterial infection? A coronavirus? Every test they ran came back negative. Whatever this was, it wasn\u2019t something any of them had seen in cows before.\n\nIn This Issue Five Years Older, None the Wiser See All\n\nAround the same time, some of the farmworkers Petersen saw on her rounds started to fall ill. Most had conjunctivitis, or pink eye, but some developed fevers bad enough to keep them home from work. \u201cWe felt like, Gosh, we don\u2019t think this is a coincidence,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nPetersen, 41, has the calm forthrightness you might expect in someone used to working with large animals. She spends most of her days on the road, traveling from dairy to dairy. During the early part of the outbreak, she was as busy as she\u2019s ever been: fielding calls from farmers, coordinating lab tests, and tending to sick cows. She came home each day exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m taking off all my farm clothes in the garage,\u201d she said. \u201cI have animals at home, so I\u2019m making sure I\u2019m not trying to bring something home to them.\u201d\n\nA breakthrough came from Kay Russo, a veterinarian who had studied both dairy cows and poultry. Russo told Petersen that she\u2019d been monitoring an outbreak of avian influenza that had spread from Europe to South America, where it had crossed over from birds into the sea-lion population, killing more than 20,000. Had Petersen noticed any dead birds at the dairies? She had. (\u201cA shit ton of dead birds,\u201d in Russo\u2019s words.) Petersen gathered a few and sent them to a lab. The results came back positive for influenza-A subtype H5N1. Bird flu. With that diagnosis in mind, one of Russo\u2019s colleagues tried to get some bovine samples tested for H5N1, but the lab refused. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t run it,\u201d Russo said, \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t on their list.\u201d No cow had ever been infected with H5N1 before.\n\nA few days later, Petersen got a call from one of the dairies. The cats on the farm had become seriously ill after drinking milk from the sick cows: Some had gone blind and lost control of their muscles, mucus streaming from their noses and eyes. Many of them died. When Petersen mentioned the cats to Drew Magstadt, her former classmate at Iowa State\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, he remembered that neurologic disease was a well-documented symptom of influenza A in cats. He offered to test for the virus if Petersen would send samples to his lab at Iowa State. \u201cThose cats were really the key to finding this out as quickly as we did,\u201d Magstadt said.\n\nAt Magstadt\u2019s request, Petersen gathered milk from eight infected cows into plastic tubes and collected the bodies of two dead cats, wrapping them in plastic bags. She shipped it all in a cooler to Magstadt\u2019s lab, more than 600 miles away in Ames. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything leaking,\u201d she said, \u201cso everything was triple bagged. I don\u2019t want anybody at FedEx or UPS getting a surprise.\u201d The samples arrived the morning of March 21, a Thursday, and by that night they had their results: The cats were positive for influenza A, as was the milk. The next day, Magstadt determined via PCR that it was H5N1, and there was a lot of it, especially in the milk. \u201cI was very, very surprised,\u201d he said, \u201cparticularly at the amount of virus.\u201d\n\nMagstadt sent Petersen\u2019s samples across town to a lab run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which formally confirmed the presence of H5N1, and the massive apparatus of the federal government began to whir into motion. Petersen was suddenly receiving calls from multiple federal agencies. \u201cNormally, I\u2019m not going to talk to people who are in Washington, D.C., on the weekend,\u201d she said. The response to the outbreak had transformed into a political problem.\n\nOn the following Monday, March 25, the USDA announced that highly pathogenic avian influenza had been found on farms in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. The agency urged farmers to report illnesses, revealed plans for widespread testing and new biosecurity measures, and soon put restrictions on interstate transfers of dairy cows. There was hope, in those days, that the outbreak could be contained.\n\nNow, a year later, the country is, in Russo\u2019s words, \u201ca pot of swirling virus with every species thrown in the middle.\u201d Multiple strains of H5N1 are burning uncontrolled through cattle herds and poultry flocks in almost every region. Farmers have been forced to euthanize millions of chickens, turkeys, and ducks. Pet food made from infected meat has been linked to the deaths of multiple house cats, and the list of species testing positive for bird flu grows longer every day: squirrels and raccoons, dolphins and deer mice, polar bears and rats, skunks and alpacas. In November and December, at an animal sanctuary in Washington, 20 big cats died of the virus, including four cougars, four bobcats, and a tiger.\n\nMost of the 70 human cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been mild. A bad case of pink eye, maybe a fever, then a full recovery. But in January, when authorities in Louisiana announced that a man had died after being exposed to sick and dead birds in his backyard flock, it seemed to signal an ominous turn. Of the 964 human cases of H5N1 reported to the World Health Organization since 2003, nearly 50 percent were fatal.\n\nThis was, and is, a crisis that seems to demand an overwhelming response. The longer we allow the virus to run rampant through animal populations, the greater our chances of disaster. Instead, we\u2019ve had a replay of the first year of the COVID pandemic, overseen this time, until recently, by a Democratic president: Early detection gave way to months of confusion and inaction. Good guidance was circumvented or ignored. Each state had its own rules about how to handle an outbreak or whether to test for one in the first place. We are now approaching a moment when our final line of defense for both people and animals may be an effective vaccine \u2014 just as the most anti-vaccine administration in history has taken power.\n\nOnce again, we are running an experiment to see whether half-measures will be enough to defeat a virus that has proved shockingly successful at spreading around the world. For now, H5N1 remains primarily a threat to birds and cows and the people who raise them. But if that changes, one thing is undeniable: We aren\u2019t prepared.\n\nThe drumbeat of frightening news coverage of the bird-flu outbreak over the past year has seemed to carry a contradiction. Each troubling development \u2014 each new animal death, each perplexing human case, such as a child in British Columbia who developed severe disease \u2014 has been reported alongside the same refrain: The CDC says that H5N1 poses a low risk to the public. How could the virus be everywhere but still, somehow, in the CDC\u2019s estimation, not likely to cause a pandemic?\n\nH5N1 is already a panzootic. It spreads easily among birds via their digestive tracts; everywhere an infected bird poops, a new host can be born. Although highly pathogenic H5N1 has been around since at least 1996, sometime in 2020 a newer, more transmissible version emerged in Europe or Central Asia. This strain, known by the unwieldy name H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, infected species H5N1 had never touched before, causing mass die-offs of seabirds and spreading rapidly beyond the virus\u2019s original geographic range.\n\n\u201cIt became quite clear early on that this was a completely different beast and that this was going to be potentially long term and not controllable,\u201d said Martha Nelson, a computational biologist and the co-author of a recent paper about H5N1 in Nature. There were frequent crossovers into mammals but limited onward transmission until the first cows were infected \u2014 most likely when migrating birds left behind droppings on a dairy that got onto a cow\u2019s udder. After that, spread was all but inevitable: Each cow stepping into the milking parlor could deposit virus on the automatic milker for the one that followed.\n\nAs transmissible as this virus was, it still didn\u2019t have an easy way to infect humans. Smallpox, the 1918 flu virus, and SARS-CoV-2 could all bind to cells in our mouths, noses, and throats, which enabled rapid person-to-person transmission: Every breath, cough, and sneeze sent millions of virions into the air to be picked up by a neighbor. H5N1 can easily infect our eyes and the deep recesses of our lungs but, crucially, not our upper airways. Until that changes, the H5N1 pandemic will be held at bay.\n\nThe fact that the virus can infect a cow\u2019s teat but not our nasal passages is a quirk of biology. Every virion has proteins on its surface \u2014 hemagglutinin, the H in H5N1 \u2014 that it uses to gain entry to a host\u2019s cell. The hemagglutinin in H5N1 is excellent at binding to a particular cell-surface receptor that\u2019s common in the digestive tract in birds, a cow\u2019s mammary glands, and human eyes. We are lucky it\u2019s not more widely distributed in our bodies. Cats, for example, have these receptors in places we don\u2019t, which may explain why they have gotten sick from drinking raw milk from infected cows but humans haven\u2019t. (Pasteurized milk is fine.)\n\nHaving won the influenza lottery with the placement of these receptors, we now seem determined to allow the virus to accumulate enough mutations to infect our upper airways after all. The virus has already made some progress in this direction. The strain found in Nevada\u2019s dairy cows is better able to replicate in infected cells than the one that arrived from Europe. But for human-to-human transmission to take off, the hemagglutinin protein itself will have to change. First, it will have to switch its preferential binding from the kind of receptors in our eyes to their cousins in our upper airways. And then it will need to remain stable in low-pH environments; right now the protein degrades in our respiratory system because it\u2019s too acidic.\n\nTo evolve, influenza is able to use a shortcut called reassortment, the same process that created H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in the first place. Rather than changing its genome nucleotide by nucleotide, it can swap whole segments of RNA with another virus. H5N1 could, for example, exchange its hemagglutinin for a version that binds easily to receptors in our noses by swapping an RNA segment with one of the two strains of flu already circulating in humans. But by its nature \u2014 borrowing material from viruses familiar to human immune systems \u2014 reassortment creates hybrids that our bodies are at least somewhat primed to fend off. A pandemic prefers na\u00efve hosts, and reassortment robs it of that.\n\nThere is another path for mutations that is slower but could be more consequential. As the virus replicates within a host (a bird, a cow, a human), it\u2019s constantly generating new versions of itself with slight tweaks to its genome \u2014 each, in the words of the German geneticist Richard Goldschmidt, a \u201chopeful monster,\u201d an opportunistic mutant that voyages out in search of friendly tissue to infect. \u201cThe mutations are constantly occurring in cases of conjunctivitis,\u201d said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist who worked with Nelson on the paper in Nature. \u201cBut those mutants are in a desert, relatively speaking.\u201d There\u2019s no easy way for them to find new parts of the body to infect.\n\nThe virus won\u2019t replicate into a desert indefinitely. In Worobey and Nelson\u2019s paper, they write, somewhat cryptically, \u201cThe continued absence of H5N1 in U.S. swine is highly fortunate.\u201d I asked Worobey to explain what that meant. Pigs, he said, \u201chave both receptor types throughout their respiratory tract and therefore could conceivably be a much, much better place for the evolution of something that could become successful.\u201d\n\nAnother place such mutations could take hold is in humans themselves. The H5N1-friendly receptors in our lungs are normally safe from infection unless someone deeply inhales large amounts of virus. (The few severe cases of H5N1 in the past year and the multiple deaths in the first outbreak among humans, in Hong Kong in 1997, may have been the result of people doing just that.) If a hopeful monster with the right kind of hemagglutinin was able to travel up the lungs and infect the upper airways \u2014 well, that\u2019s the pandemic-ready virus we\u2019re all worried about. The mutations may make it less deadly or more; we probably won\u2019t know unless and until it happens.\n\n\u201cWith this new reality we live in where cattle are infected and therefore dairy farmworkers are constantly being exposed,\u201d Worobey said, \u201cyou have a situation with an H5 virus that is taking many more shots on goal to get into humans and get past whatever that last barrier is.\u201d At this point, the most reassuring thing you can say is that the virus has been around for 30 years and hasn\u2019t found a way to transmit effectively in humans yet. But Nelson warned against complacency: \u201cMy history of studying flu is that whenever you say influenza can\u2019t do something, it does.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, Worobey said he rejects the idea that H5N1 can be called low risk. \u201cIt seems a bit of a thumb on the scale to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the proper thing to appreciate is that we don\u2019t really know the risk.\u201d In the meantime, we\u2019ve created a giant reservoir of novel virus in our dairy cows, 9 million little Wuhan wet markets (or, if you prefer, Wuhan Institutes of Virology) spread around the country, just waiting for the right occasion to spill over into the human population.\n\nThe Way Bird Flu Works How H5N1 Gets From a Wild Bird to a Farmerworker\u2019s Eye\n\nA goose flies over a dairy and leaves behind droppings. Cows gather in a field, exposing their undersides to waste and mud. H5N1 virus from the bird droppings infect a cow\u2019s teats and udder. An infected cow steps into the milking parlor. The virus spreads from cow to cow via the milking machines. A worker rubs contaminated milk in his eye, completing the chain of infection. Illustrations by David Macaulay\n\nWhen H5N1 began spreading in American cows, experts who have studied avian influenza all their lives looked on, horrified, as the country failed to get the outbreak under control. Worobey told me he talked to a veterinarian about transmission routes; he was accustomed to learning as much as he could about the animals that serve as the flu\u2019s vectors. (Once, researching the origins of the 1918 pandemic, he investigated the Great Epizootic of 1872, which disabled millions of horses in North America; some blame the Great Boston Fire from that year on the lack of horses available to pull firefighting equipment.) \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a dairy farm,\u201d he explained to me, \u201ceveryone carries a rag in their back pocket. You have to every few minutes wipe off piss, shit, milk, who knows. Getting into the eyes that way is easy and then the receptors there are ready and waiting.\u201d\n\nThe official policy of the USDA is still elimination of H5N1, but making an environment like that biosecure is a formidable challenge: The central commodity of a dairy is teeming with virus \u2014 never mind the vulnerability of an open-sided barn or an unprotected field. In California, dairy farmers are required to report any positive tests, and infected herds are placed under quarantine for at least 60 days, at which point they have to test negative three weeks in a row. \u201cI have quarantine authority,\u201d Annette Jones, the state veterinarian, told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m actually required by law to act. I can\u2019t choose not to act.\u201d The state has also required dairies to put strict limits on visitors and to institute various measures to control the spread of the virus from farm to farm, like disinfecting vehicles, clothes, and boots.\n\nIn Texas, the origin of the outbreak, many of these precautions are voluntary. Sid Miller, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, took quick action after learning about the first cases. \u201cWe alerted everybody and quit transporting cattle out of state from that area,\u201d he told me, \u201cand we started changing some of our practices and put in better biohazard policies.\u201d But he rejected the suggestion that the state should make some measures, like wearing goggles and disinfecting the milkers, mandatory for the dairies as well: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s in their best interest. They\u2019re going to do it anyway. They don\u2019t need a rule.\u201d\n\nThe USDA has a national program for testing milk, but not every state is enrolled, and it didn\u2019t begin until ten months into the outbreak. \u201cProbably close to half of the known cases are in California,\u201d William Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not because California is bad. That\u2019s because California is looking.\u201d The result is an information ecosystem that\u2019s familiar from the COVID pandemic, with the states reprising the roles they played in 2020.\n\nThe mildness of the disease in cows skews the incentives for individual farmers to take action. Most cows recover from the illness, albeit sometimes with diminished milk production. (Many of the early deaths in California, where \u201cdown cows\u201d and stillbirths were relatively common, have been ascribed to high heat in the Central Valley just as the outbreak began.) \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a threat,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like they had a cold for a week or the flu for a week, basically. It\u2019s a devastating disease in poultry, but it\u2019s a minor setback in the dairy business.\u201d\n\nThe dairy industry, meanwhile, is broadly suspicious of government efforts to intervene. This is especially true of the CDC\u2019s attempts to test and trace infected workers. The many thousands of undocumented immigrants working on farms, Hanage said, \u201care not going to be excited when the federal government is sending someone there to collect samples.\u201d Trust in public-health officials in rural areas, already low, has eroded even more since 2020. Mark McAfee, the founder of Raw Farm outside Fresno, said the official number of infected farmworkers to date is probably an undercount: \u201cI imagine a lot of farmers just don\u2019t want to hassle with the paperwork and have the CDC go test them. It becomes a hassle factor. Most farmers don\u2019t like hassle.\u201d He pointed out that during COVID, the states doing a lot of testing and the states doing very little fared about the same. (This was basically true, at least until vaccines were widely available.)\n\nThe USDA provides emergency assistance for farmers with cows in quarantine, but some may prefer not to test in the first place. Beef and dairy exports are worth $19 billion a year, poultry exports another $5 billion. A positive test could jeopardize a farmer\u2019s ability to ship products abroad. It\u2019s notable that after a year of H5N1 spreading among cows, no beef herds have officially tested positive. But Russo told me that\u2019s not the full story. \u201cThere is testing to show that there is seroconversion in these cattle, which would suggest they are getting infected with the virus,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not been publicly released or seen the light of day. And I don\u2019t know if it will.\u201d\n\nThe USDA is asked to wear two hats, Petersen said: \u201cThey\u2019re tasked with protecting animal health, but they\u2019re also tasked with protecting the industry \u2014 and protecting the industry means defending trade.\u201d According to the USDA, those two missions are not in conflict. \u201cUSDA\u2019s priority is to protect American farmers and ranchers and their animals,\u201d a spokesperson said, \u201cwhich closely aligns with its mission to protect safe trade.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether to vaccinate cows and poultry is even more fraught. H5N1 vaccines for cows are still in development, but the push to inoculate them will probably remain weak unless herds start developing more severe symptoms. (There were early reports of \u201clong bird flu\u201d in cows but no definitive evidence that it\u2019s a widespread problem.)\n\nVaccines for poultry are already available, but trade complicates that decision as well. In 2023, France decided to start vaccinating its ducks \u2014 an effort, in part, to protect the national supply of foie gras. Within days, the U.S. banned all poultry imports from the country, and the embargo lasted for more than a year. The stated reason was to keep avian influenza out; vaccinated ducks, the reasoning went, could be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. If the U.S. began vaccinating its poultry, it could expect similar bans from other countries. Brooke Rollins, the secretary of the USDA, recently announced the department would devote $1 billion to fighting avian influenza, including up to $100 million for vaccine research, but declined to authorize the use of existing H5N1 vaccines for poultry. Until our trade agreements are renegotiated, that authorization likely won\u2019t arrive.\n\nThe poultry and dairy industries seem to be on a collision course. Once a herd recovers, it has some immunity against future infections. The same isn\u2019t true for chickens, ducks, and turkeys. The virus can kill nearly all of those infected, but it rarely has a chance to get that far. As soon as the disease is detected, farmers are usually required to destroy the entire flock \u2014 commercial operations lost more than 50 million birds last year. And with no vaccine and no acquired immunity, the next generation of hatchlings will be just as susceptible to the virus as the birds they replaced.\n\nDairies and chicken farms are often neighbors, and they can share personnel, a steady source of potential new infections. With the amount of virus circulating, even stringent biosecurity \u2014 workers in protective suits, barns sealed off, active disease surveillance \u2014 hasn\u2019t always been enough. Egg producers have been the hardest hit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do something for these poultry operations so that we can have eggs in this country, to put it bluntly,\u201d Russo said. \u201cPolitics and trade and economics have been put before the health of animals, of humans, of science. And now we\u2019ve got a real fucking mess on our hands.\u201d\n\nIf H5N1 were to adapt to transmit readily among humans, our welfare would be, ultimately, in the hands of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy is skeptical of the epidemiological tools used to control viruses: testing, distancing, masking, and, especially, vaccines. His stance on the childhood vaccination schedule and the COVID vaccines developed under Operation Warp Speed \u2014 which he called \u201cthe deadliest vaccine ever made\u201d \u2014 is well known.\n\nHe speaks less often about flu inoculations, which are administered annually to around 150 million Americans. But during a podcast in 2021, he revealed that he blamed the flu shot for the problems he\u2019s had with his voice. \u201cIn 1996, when I was 42 years old, I got this disease called spasmodic dysphonia,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a very, very strong voice prior to 1996. Unusually strong.\u201d He didn\u2019t connect his disease with the vaccine until he found his condition on a list of possible side effects. The shot, he said, was \u201cdefinitely a potential cause of what I\u2019ve got, and I haven\u2019t been able to figure out any other cause.\u201d\n\nSince Kennedy took over at HHS, the CDC has ended an ad campaign urging Americans to get the flu shot (its doomed slogan was \u201cWild to Mild\u201d) and postponed the February meeting of the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory group. At the end of February, members of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee learned that their March meeting, during which they were meant to determine the strains to be targeted by next year\u2019s flu shot, had been canceled as well.\n\n\u201cI think that the administration, and most specifically Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is not interested in external expertise,\u201d said Paul Offit, an infectious-diseases specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who has been a member of the FDA committee since 2017. \u201cThe man does not believe in the germ theory of infectious diseases.\u201d Offit laughed despondently. \u201cI dunno. I would have thought that was a minimum criteria for being the head of HHS, but what do I know?\u201d (Kennedy did not reply to requests for comment.)\n\nThe Way Bird Flu Works The Evolution of a Pandemic-Ready Virus 1. Someone inhales H5N1 deep into his lungs. At this point, the virus can\u2019t infect the upper airways. 2. The virus attaches to receptors in the lungs and begins replicating. 3. As the virus divides, it occasionally creates mutant versions of itself. Most of these go nowhere. 4. One mutant has the ability to infect cells in the upper airways. It multiplies quickly. 5. The mutated virus, now easily transmissible, is coughed out, ready to infect the next person.\n\nThe federal government has spent years preparing for an avian-influenza pandemic. Dawn O\u2019Connell, the former head of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, who left her job at the end of the Biden administration, told me that even before the virus began spreading in cows, ASPR and the CDC had been working with vaccine manufacturers to create a library of possible H5N1 vaccines that could be directed to different variants. \u201cBecause we had some of that library in place already,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to find a fairly well-matched vaccine\u201d \u2014 one targeted to the strains in circulation \u2014 \u201cthat we\u2019ve increased manufacturing for.\u201d The Biden administration also invested $766 million in the development of mRNA vaccines for pandemic flu. \u201cIf the strain changes,\u201d O\u2019Connell said, \u201cwe would want to stay ahead of what\u2019s currently circulating, and mRNA lets you do that a little easier.\u201d\n\nWhen O\u2019Connell and I spoke in early January, there were 8 million doses of the H5N1 vaccine in the federal government\u2019s stockpiles, with plans to add 2 million more by March. Several public-health experts I spoke to were frustrated that the Biden administration never released those doses to vaccinate farmworkers. Now it\u2019s unclear if the federal government will ever release them. Last summer, Kennedy said that \u201cthere is no evidence these vaccines will work, and they appear to be dangerous.\u201d\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, when Alex Azar had Kennedy\u2019s job, he said, \u201cThe secretary of HHS has a shocking amount of power by the stroke of a pen.\u201d We may be about to find out how true that statement is. Offit thinks it\u2019s likely that Kennedy will either eliminate committees like his \u2014 cutting off one path for dissent \u2014 or fill them with like-minded people. He could hold up the approval of new vaccines and refer existing ones for additional study. There may be few checks on his ability to do so. \u201cIn a normal world, you would have people at the FDA and CDC who would say, \u2018No, sorry, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019\u201d Offit said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t live in that world. We live in a world full of sycophants who are just there to rubber stamp whatever it is they\u2019re told to do.\u201d It turns out that not interfering with the vaccine-approval process is another one of those norms that, like not renaming the Gulf of Mexico, we have scant ability to enforce.\n\nWe can predict the cascade of effects if the FDA withheld approval from an H5N1 vaccine. Without an FDA license, insurance companies won\u2019t cover it. Without the market promised by insurance coverage, drug companies won\u2019t manufacture the doses. It\u2019s not a system that works without the support of the federal government.\n\nIn recent weeks, more than 5,000 employees at HHS have been laid off by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE also fired 400 employees of the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which has been running the response to the H5N1 outbreak, including 55 associated with the lab in Ames that helped diagnose the first cases of H5N1 in the Texas Panhandle. Some of these employees were rehired, and the USDA wrote in a statement that \u201cseveral job categories, including veterinarians, animal health technicians, and other emergency response personnel\u201d at APHIS \u201chave been exempted from the recent personnel actions.\u201d But the turmoil in the executive branch continues. When I first wrote to Martha Nelson, the co-author of the paper in Nature about H5N1, she said she wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with me because, as a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health, she was subject to a blanket HHS communications pause.\n\nO\u2019Connell reminded me that, at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, federal officials had planned to use the strategic national stockpile, which is maintained by ASPR, to provide N95 masks to frontline workers. But the stockpile, they discovered, was empty. \u201cThey had not purchased PPE since H1N1,\u201d she said, \u201cten years before.\u201d Whatever missteps the Biden administration made regarding bird flu before its departure, we are undoubtedly on a better logistical footing than in 2020. As of January, the government had distributed 2.3 million pieces of PPE to farmworkers across the country, and it had accumulated 68 million doses of the antiviral medication Tamiflu.\n\nIf there ends up being scarcity this time around, it will have been by choice, a decision made by a weary public and the leaders they elected. Many Americans need time to rebuild their willingness to support pandemic-mitigating measures like lockdowns and masking. Some people need time to rebuild their trust in vaccines. \u201cWe may not even be able to have a serious conversation about it for a few years,\u201d Hanage, the Harvard epidemiologist, said. \u201cBut viruses don\u2019t look at our Google calendars to decide what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nKennedy got his job in part because a significant portion of the country thought that the government overstepped its authority during COVID, and that agencies like the FDA rushed the approval of vaccines for political reasons. Now that he is in charge of the public-health infrastructure of the U.S., we may get to see what the opposite approach would look like. Rather than a vaccine mandate, there may be a trade in gray-market vaccines acquired from abroad. Mitigation measures may be actively discouraged or penalized. As before, the rich may be able to protect themselves, but the poor will not. Kennedy and his critics rarely see eye to eye, but both sides would likely agree that, under his watch, we\u2019re not going to see another Operation Warp Speed.\n\nIn February, one year after the initial outbreak, I went to visit a dairy to see how biosecurity had changed since H5N1 became a bovine disease. A second spillover from wild birds had recently hit cattle in Nevada. The general public, at least those of us prone to worrying, had begun keeping track of esoteric variant names again. This one was D1.1, a different genotype from the B3.13 variant already circulating widely. Nothing changed except the hope we\u2019d have to eliminate H5N1 from the cow population only once.\n\nI tried to find a suitable farm in California but was advised by Michael Payne, a researcher at UC Davis\u2019s School of Veterinary Medicine, that all dairies he was aware of were now closed to nonessential visitors. In Pennsylvania, I found a farm with chickens and dairy cows offering tours, but a few days before the trip I got a call. All tours had been suspended until May. A few days later, the farm euthanized 2 million hens.\n\nThere were more options in Texas. After confirming a visit with one dairy, I asked Miller, the agriculture commissioner, what I should do to ensure I wasn\u2019t helping spread the disease. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going from farm to farm,\u201d he said, \u201cdisinfect your boots and your hands. Just use cowboy logic, basically.\u201d I had neglected to get a flu shot this year, so I made an appointment at my local pharmacy. I wasn\u2019t interested in being the Petri dish for any reassortment events.\n\nThe dairy was small by Texas standards. In a paddock near the entrance, a dozen or so calves, almost seven months old according to their ear tags, crowded near the steel fence as I approached. They were heartbreakingly cute. A few chickens walked around. A trio of ducks sat by a waste-covered pool. In the distance, the dry herd (cows given a break from lactation in the final months of their pregnancies) gathered under a tree. On other farms, it was 2020, but here it was still 2019.\n\nIn the milking parlor, one of the employees, a cheerful woman who had worked there for four years, demonstrated how the machines worked. The cows were led in through one door, workers attached four teat cups, and the milk was piped to a bulk tank before the cows were ushered out a second door. The room was about as clean as a cow conveyor belt could be. I asked whether they had made any changes to the operation over the past year, and the employee said they hadn\u2019t. She told me the farm didn\u2019t get that many wild birds passing through.\n\nEarlier, a calf had licked my arms while I petted it, and I\u2019d reminded myself the virus was concentrated in the cow\u2019s mammary glands, not its mouth. Now the employee asked me if I wanted to try milking by hand. I declined, but another visitor stepped forward and followed instructions for coaxing the fluid down the udder and into the teat. A stream of milk hit the ground and splashed up into the air.\n\nAfter spending weeks talking to veterinarians and infectious-disease experts about mastitis and quarantines and depopulation orders, it was jarring, and kind of wonderful, to be on a farm where the animals seemed healthy and the farmworkers happy. I did worry about their chickens and ducks. In an email, Martha Nelson drew a distinction between small farms like this one and the ones run by large conglomerates. \u201cOn a small farm, if you had an influenza virus spillover from birds to cows, it might have caused a small outbreak and then probably died out,\u201d she wrote. Big operations were different, shipping animals, and potentially virus, all over the country.\n\nLarge farms with animals packed tightly together are excellent sites for rapid disease spread. That\u2019s the story of the country\u2019s egg producers. And one of the earliest examples of mammal-to-mammal transmission during the 2.3.4.4b outbreak in Europe occurred on a farm where nearly 52,000 minks were being raised for their fur. \u201cIntensive farming is more likely to promote viral amplification,\u201d Nelson and her co-authors wrote in Nature. This disease, like COVID before it, has a knack for exposing the flaws in our society: the brutality of factory farming, the vulnerability of undocumented workers, our mistrust of science and of one another.\n\nAfter Barb Petersen helped solve the mystery of the outbreak in the panhandle, she spoke to the Associated Press and Bovine Veterinarian about what had happened. \u201cMy goal is that, hey, folks need to understand what\u2019s happening. And the only way to do that is to tell your story,\u201d she said. When the articles appeared, several clients cut ties with her. She said some of her colleagues lost business for taking farmworkers to get tested. \u201cPeople are going through stages of grief,\u201d she told me, \u201cand some reactions that I got were anger and denial. Some of them were more severe than others.\u201d\n\nThe future of this outbreak is still unknown. Rollins, the head of the USDA, has proved that she\u2019s taking the problem seriously. And Trump recently named Gerald Parker, a veterinarian with experience bringing together public-health and agriculture interests, to run the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, a remarkably sane choice. The country\u2019s animals will likely have access to a vaccine before its people do.\n\n\u201cWhen people ask me what worries me most,\u201d said Hanage, \u201cit\u2019s very bluntly the fact that we don\u2019t talk about what we will do when we actually see something really serious.\u201d We may get lucky and H5N1 may never mutate to become pandemic-ready. But there are countless other viruses waiting to cross over, chasing us like Philip Larkin\u2019s ship of death in \u201cNext, Please\u201d: \u201ca black-sailed unfamiliar, towing at her back a huge and birdless silence.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no comfort in where we are. Our government has spent the past year allowing H5N1 to spread throughout the country and the past two months dismantling some of the best defenses we have against pathogens of all sorts. We\u2019re beleaguered and suspicious and seemingly incapable of collective action for the common good. The only thing keeping us safe, for now, is the virus itself."

They are now trying again to navigate a new, uncertain Syria since the fall of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad.\n\nMembers of the small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: the new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Syria\u2019s hostile neighbor, Israel, which has used the plight of the Druze as a pretext to intervene in the country.\n\nSyria\u2019s many religious and ethnic communities are worried over their place in the new system. The transitional government has promised to include them, but has so far kept authority in the hands of the Islamist former insurgents who toppled Assad in December -- Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. That and HTS\u2019s past affiliation with Sunni Muslim extremist al-Qaida, has minorities suspicious.\n\nThe most explosive hostilities have been with the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad\u2019s family belongs. Heavy clashes erupted this week between armed Assad loyalists and government forces, killing at least 70, in the coastal regions that are the Alawites\u2019 heartland.\n\nIn contrast, the Druze -- largely centered in southern Syria -- have kept up quiet contacts with the government. Still, tensions have broken out.\n\nLast week in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus with a large Druze population, unknown gunmen killed a member of the government\u2019s security forces, which responded with a wave of arrests in the district.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military officials weighed in by threatening to send forces to Jaramana to protect the Druze. Druze leaders quickly disavowed the offer. But soon after, someone hung an Israeli flag in Sweida, an overwhelmingly Druze region in southern Syria, prompting residents to quickly tear it down and burn it.\n\nMany fear another flare-up is only a matter of time.\n\nMultiple Druze armed militias have existed for years, originally set up to protect their communities against Islamic State group fighters and drug smugglers coming in from the eastern desert. They have been reluctant to set down their arms. Recently a new faction, the Sweida Military Council, proclaimed itself, grouping several smaller Druze militias.\n\nThe result is a cycle of mistrust, where government supporters paint Druze factions as potential separatists or tools of Israel, while government hostility only deepens Druze worries.\n\nOn the outskirts of Sweida, a commander in Liwa al-Jabal, a Druze militia, stood on a rooftop and scanned the hills with binoculars. He spoke by walkie-talkie with a militiaman with an assault rifle below. They were watching for any movement by militants or gangs.\n\n\u201cOur arms are not for expansionist purposes. They're for self-defense and protection,\u201d said the commander, who asked to be identified only by his nickname Abu Ali for security reasons. \u201cWe have no enemies except those who attack us.\u201d\n\nAbu Ali, who is a metal worker as his day job, said most Druze militiamen would merge with a new Syrian army if it\u2019s one that \u201cprotects all Syrians rather than crushes them like the previous regime.\u201d\n\nThe Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.\n\nIn Syria, the Druze take pride in their fierce independence. They were heavily involved in revolts against Ottoman and French colonial rule to establish the modern Syrian state.\n\nDuring Syria\u2019s civil war that began in 2011, the Druze were split between supporters of Assad and the opposition. The Sweida region stayed quiet for much of the war, though it erupted with anti-government protests in 2023.\n\nAssad reluctantly gave Druze a degree of autonomy, as they wanted to avoid being involved on the frontlines. The Druze were exempted from conscription into the Syrian army and instead set up local armed factions made of workers and farmers to patrol their areas.\n\nDruze say they want Syria\u2019s new authorities to include them in a political process to create a secular and democratic state.\n\n\u201cReligion is for God and the state is for all\u201d proclaimed a slogan written on the hood of a vehicle belonging to the Men of Dignity, another Druze militia patrolling the outskirts of Sweida.\n\nMany Druze quickly rejected Israel\u2019s claims to protect the minority. Hundreds took to the streets in Sweida to protest Netanyahu\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cWe are Arabs, whether he or whether the Lord that created him likes it or not. Syria is free,\u201d said Nabih al-Halabi, a 60-year-old resident of Jaramana.\n\nHe and others reject accusations that the Druze want partition from Syria.\n\nBut patience is wearing thin over what many see as arbitrary layoffs of public sector workers, shortage of economic opportunities, and the new authorities\u2019 lack of more than token inclusion of Syrians from minority communities. For the first time, a protest took place in Sweida on Thursday against Damascus' new authorities.\n\nInterim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive system, but the government is made up mostly of his confidantes. The authorities convened a national dialogue conference last week, inviting Syrians from different communities, but many criticized it as rushed and not really inclusive.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing from the state today, in our opinion, does not achieve the interests of all Syrians,\u201d said retired nurse Nasser Abou-Halam, discussing local politics with other residents in Sweida's public square where near-daily protests took place. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-color government, with leadership appointed through factions rather than through elections.\u201d\n\nAl-Sharaa \u201chas a big opportunity to be accepted just to be Syrian first and not Islamist first. Being inclusive will not hurt him,\u201d said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat currently based in Washington. \u201cOn the contrary, it will give him more power.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s new leaders have struggled to convince the United States and its allies to lift Assad-era sanctions. Without the lifting of sanctions, it will be impossible for the government to rebuild Syria\u2019s battered infrastructure or win over minority communities, analysts say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared sanctions won\u2019t be lifted and Syria won\u2019t be given the chance,\u201d said Rayyan Maarouf, who heads the activist media collective Suwayda 24. He has just returned to Sweida after fleeing to Europe over a year ago because of his activism.\n\n\u201cSyria could go back to a civil war, and it would be worse than before,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside Sweida, Abu Ali was helping train new volunteers for the militia. Still, he said he hopes to be able to lay down his weapons.\n\n\u201cThere is no difference between the son of Sweida or Jaramana and those of Homs and Lattakia,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are tired of war and bloodshed \u2026 weapons don\u2019t bring modernism.\u201d\n\n___\n\nChehayeb reported from Beirut."

While he has never run for elected office before, rumors have swirled for years about if \u2014 and when \u2014 he might foray into politics.\n\nSpeaking Monday to reporters, he added that the transition between Trudeau\u2019s premiership and his would be \u201cseamless\u201d and \u201cquick,\u201d but did not give an exact date for when he will take office.\n\nThe Liberals have been courting Carney for more than a decade, and he advised Trudeau on Canada\u2019s economic recovery from Covid-19. But the banker-turned-politician did not make his official entrance until Trudeau announced his resignation in January. All of his competitors were sitting politicians: Carney is in the unusual situation of becoming Canada\u2019s prime minister without holding a seat in parliament.\n\nBut before all that, he was born in Fort Smith, the Northwest Territories, and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. His parents were both teachers, and, true to his Canadian roots, he played ice hockey as a goalie growing up, according to his campaign website.\n\nGrowing up, Mark Carney played hockey as a goalie for Laurier Heights, according to his campaign website. Mark Carney campaign website\n\nHe then headed to the United States for a degree in economics at Harvard University, before pursuing a master\u2019s degree and doctorate in economics from Oxford University.\n\nHis career was similarly globe-trotting. He spent 13 years working for Goldman Sachs, traveling between the firm\u2019s offices in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, according to a profile from the Bank of Canada, which he joined in 2003.\n\nBy 2008, he was serving as governor of Canada\u2019s central bank, stepping into the job as the world plunged into the Great Recession. During his campaign to lead the Liberal Party, Carney pointed to this time as evidence of his experience navigating crises, saying on his website he had helped protect jobs and stabilize the Canadian economy.\n\nHe did well enough that by the time he finished his five-year term, he was scooped up by the Bank of England to be its governor \u2014 the first non-British person to hold the position. (Canada is a member of the British Commonwealth.)\n\nClimate change advocate\n\nThe following years were just as crisis-ridden, with the British public voting to depart the European Union. In speeches before the 2016 referendum, Carney had warned of the economic impact Brexit would have on the country. He left the Bank of England in 2020 after almost seven years in the job.\n\nAfter becoming the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance in 2019, he advocated for the financial sector to invest in net-zero emissions.\n\n\u201cWhen I became governor of the Bank of England, which oversees the insurance industry, I saw that the number of extreme weather events had tripled and the cost of those events had gone up five times in a quarter century,\u201d he said in an interview on the UN website. \u201cThese things really concentrated my mind on climate.\u201d\n\nMark Carney makes a \"W\" gesture to signify his win in the race to become leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party. Blair Gable/Reuters\n\nSince then, he has made clean energy, climate policies and economic prosperity for Canada some of the central facets of his campaign, stressing that being low-carbon will help Canada be more competitive.\n\nHe has proposed shifting the financial burden of the carbon tax from consumers to big corporations and has said that under his leadership, the tax Canadian consumers and small businesses pay on fuel would be replaced with incentives to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nSome experts believe Carney\u2019s background could make him uniquely suited for the job as Canada grapples with a souring relationship with the US and an escalating trade war.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very competent in economics, so with these tariffs, this economic war, a lot of people are supporting him,\u201d said Charles-Etienne Beaudy, political science professor at the University of Ottawa and author of \u201cRadio Trump: How he won the first time.\u201d\n\nSince the 25% US tariffs on Canada were announced last month, Carney has been an outspoken proponent of dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs.\n\nHe addressed the issue on Sunday in his first remarks after the vote, slamming the Trump administration\u2019s plans. Trump is \u201cattacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed and we won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIn trade as in hockey, Canada will win.\u201d"

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO -- Canada\u2019s next prime minister has helped run two Group of Seven economies in crisis before and now will try to steer Canada through a looming trade war brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, a threat of annexation and an expected federal election.\n\nFormer central banker Mark Carney will become prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday in a landside vote with 85.9% support.\n\nCarney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney is widely expected to trigger an election the coming days or weeks amid Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff threats.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\u201d\n\nCarney said Canada will keep its initial retaliatory tariffs in place until \u201cthe Americans show us respect.\u201d\n\nCarney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. He helped managed the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.\n\nThe surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving in opinion polls.\n\n\u201cThe Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. Think about it. If they succeed they would destroy our way of life,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIn America health care is big business. In Canada it is a right.\u201d\n\nCarney said America is \u201ca melting pot. Canada is mosaic,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is not Canada. And Canada will never, ever will be a part of America in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nAfter decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.\n\n\u201cThese are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\u201d\n\nTrump has postponed 25% tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico for a month, amid widespread fears of a broader trade war. But he has threatened other tariffs on steel, aluminum, dairy and other products.\n\nCarney picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.\n\nTrudeau previously offered to make him finance minister. Carney has said former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper also offered to make him finance minister.\n\nCarney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.\n\nIn 2020, he began serving as the United Nations\u2019 special envoy for climate action and finance.\n\nThe other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who received just 8% of the vote. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.\n\nEither Carney will call an election in the coming days or weeks, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\n\nTrudeau urged Liberals supporters to get involved.\n\n\u201cThis is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,\u201d Trudeau said."

            "full_content": "The Europeans got the message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican presidents since Kennedy have wanted Europe to shoulder more of the burden of its own security. But not until President Donald Trump has a U.S. leader succeeded in getting Europeans to want the same. Of course, the eruptions of a revanchist Russia have helped.\n\nThe latest example of Europe\u2019s new groove: The prime minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, announced on Friday plans for all Polish men to undergo military training. Tusk said he wants to increase the size of the army from 200,000 soldiers to half a million, and that Ukraine\u2019s army has 800,000 while Russia\u2019s has 1.3 million. It\u2019s no coincidence that the target set by Tusk would make up the difference.\n\nOne far-sighted philosopher prophesied long ago that Russia\u2019s rise would lead to Europe\u2019s revitalization. In 1886, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that Europe might only shake its feebleness, divisions, and liberal illusions in the face of a growing Russian threat:\n\nI mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening\u2014namely, to acquire one will, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-stateism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world\u2014the compulsion to great politics.\n\nThe 20th century did indeed bring great power politics to Europe, as Nietzsche foretold\u2014but not European unity against Russia. That wouldn\u2019t come until the third decade of the 21st century. Still, the Trump White House has needed to prod the Europeans to translate their moral solidarity into military action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, during a meeting in Brussels, told NATO allies that the U.S. would retrench from Europe\u2014meaning Europeans would need to step up on their continent. \u201cSafeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of NATO,\u201d Hegseth said.\n\nSubsequent White House moves reinforced the message. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vice President J.D. Vance scolded European elites for sacrificing their own people on the altar of globalism, and he questioned whether shared values still held together the transatlantic partnership. A few days later, Trump dispatched top diplomats to meet Russian envoys in Saudi Arabia\u2014and didn\u2019t invite Europeans to join. Two weeks after that, during a tense Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump made clear that he wouldn\u2019t aid Ukraine\u2019s war effort against Russia indefinitely.\n\nEuropeans, in reaction, have grown concerned that they can no longer rely on America to defend them from Russian aggression\u2014or worse, that Washington is aligning with Moscow against Europe. To meet the moment, leaders like Tusk and Friedrich Merz, Germany\u2019s chancellor-in-waiting, have promoted European self-sufficiency. \u201cMy absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\u201d Merz said last month.\n\nFrance\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron\u2014Mr. Europe himself\u2014must sense a golden opportunity to construct what he calls a \u201cPower Europe.\u201d In recent weeks, Macron has found a more receptive audience for his controversial idea to extend France\u2019s nuclear umbrella across the continent. Tusk has said Poland\u2019s government is \u201ccarefully examining\u201d France\u2019s offer\u2014and might itself develop nuclear weapons one day. Merz said Sunday that he\u2019s open to France and Britain \u201csharing\u201d their nuclear weapons with Germany.\n\nThe Europeans would be wise to fold up America\u2019s nuclear umbrella and open one of their own\u2014and America would be wise to let them. U.S. nuclear deterrence has always been questionable in Eastern Europe, where America lacks vital interests. In such a situation, America\u2019s clients can become over-confident, while its adversaries may doubt that Washington would fight for faraway vassals.\n\nHegseth had proposed in Brussels that Europe take the lead only in conventional security while Washington continues providing nuclear deterrence. But if the Europeans believe that Washington has become \u201clargely indifferent to the fate of Europe,\u201d as Merz recently claimed, why would they count on America to risk nuclear war to defend Warsaw and Vilnius? The truth is, they no longer do.\n\nOddly, many American commentators who have mocked Europe\u2019s weakness are now dismissing its plans for rearmament as moronic and the leaders who promote those plans as warmongers. Some of these commentators are plainly motivated by anti-European sentiments, plus a smattering of braggadocio about American power.\n\nBen Shapiro, a pro-Israel podcaster, is one of many conservative voices calling on Europe to pay more for defense, or as he put it, to \u201cpony up, show us the money.\u201d Shapiro is also one of many conservatives who have evinced personal disdain for Europe, as he did in a tirade a few years ago on his show. On the same day, Shapiro left no doubt about the kind of notions that fed his antipathy, promoting David Harsanyi\u2019s book Eurotrash: Why America Must Reject the Failed Ideas of a Dying Continent.\n\nAmerica-First patriots have taken a different view of the old continent, seeing it as the ancestral homeland of most U.S. citizens and the wellspring of America\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nFollowing the Cold War, Pat Buchanan, a cofounder of The American Conservative, was fiercely critical of America\u2019s deepening entanglement in Eastern Europe, predicting that it would provoke a backlash from Russia. He also lambasted the EU as a \u201csocialist superstate\u201d and spoke of Europe\u2019s civilizational decline. Yet Buchanan always harbored deep affection for Europe, and he drew harsh criticism for his view that America was founded on European stock and might not survive the influx of African, Asian, and Hispanic immigrants.\n\nBuchanan would agree, I think, that the best reason to support Europeans\u2019 rearmament is not that they have been insolent freeloaders, but that it would be good for both Europe and America.\n\nIn truth, American militarism has lately endangered Europe, not protected it, often over the objections of European capitals. Belligerent U.S. policies made a Russian invasion of Ukraine more likely. U.S. wars in the Middle East sparked migration crises that have destabilized European politics. And U.S. support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has inflamed the hatred that many of Europe\u2019s newcomers feel for the West. American retrenchment and European rearmament would be a boon to Europe\u2019s security.\n\nA military restructuring may also bring about a spiritual revival among Europeans, arousing the warrior ethos that historically they have been known for. Safeguarding one\u2019s own existence tends to focus the mind, dispelling universalist illusions and sharpening distinctions between friend and foe, brother and stranger. For Europeans, whose national identities are being deconstructed to make way for multiculturalism, such a change in consciousness can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nEuropean self-sufficiency would also be good for the United States, as Buchanan argued in books like A Republic, Not an Empire. Our efforts to serve as the world\u2019s policeman have drained U.S. resources and enmeshed us in foreign conflicts that do not implicate the interests of Americans. In the dawning era of multipolarity, America should prioritize the homeland; Europe should become a strong pillar in the NATO alliance; and the collective West needs to chart a new course\u2014even as it continues marching toward a common destiny.\n\nTo that end, the Trump administration should modulate its criticisms of Europe, highlighting the mutual benefits of European independence and the common interests of Western nations. J.D. Vance struck the right note in Munich: \u201cWe ought to ask whether we\u2019re holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard,\u201d Vance insisted. \u201cAnd I say \u2018ourselves,\u2019 because I fundamentally believe we are on the same team.\u201d\n\nIf Trump can pass the ball to Europe without breaking up the team, he could go down not only as a successful America-First president\u2014but as a transformative figure in the history of Western civilization."

Lee and Sahil Kapur\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s full-speed-ahead approach to making radical change has forced his allies to fight from a defensive posture \u2014 explaining his plans after they have been executed \u2014 and has raised alarms in his Republican Party that it could all end in a wreck.\n\nThe concerns are particularly acute when it comes to the economy, with the stock market slumping and many economists projecting either slower growth or a coming recession. Those fears haven\u2019t deterred Trump from continuing to impose tariffs on foes and friends \u2014 which figure to raise prices on U.S. consumers \u2014 and slash federal government jobs, grants and contracts.\n\n\u201cThere are worries,\u201d said a person who has been involved in discussions about the economy with White House officials. Those effects on the markets and the economy are felt immediately, while policies aimed at spurring growth \u2014 including cutting taxes and regulations \u2014 will take much longer to implement, this person said.\n\nThe dark economic clouds are forcing Trump administration officials to explain why the president\u2019s lofty economic promises on the campaign trail to \u201cend inflation\u201d and \u201cMake America Affordable Again\u201d on Day 1 haven\u2019t come to fruition.\n\n\u201cThis was always part of the plan,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said recently on Fox News. \u201cThe president is so focused on \u2014 not the short term. ... He truly wants to fix America.\u201d\n\nWhat Hill Republicans are saying: Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he thinks Trump has some latitude to pursue trade wars but not at a long-term cost.\n\n\u201cLook, this isn\u2019t the way I would do it,\u201d Rounds said of the White House\u2019s tack. \u201cI think they want to try something different than from the previous administration. But they\u2019ve got to show some success fairly quickly.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Trump\u2019s \u201cdramatic tariffs\u201d on Canada and Mexico \u201ccould be devastating to the economy,\u201d including in his home state.\n\n\u201cThere are stories coming out talking about cars costing $10,000 more. And, of course, we\u2019re worried about bourbon. We want to sell our bourbon. The Canadians are going to block our bourbon,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNow that you add lumber costs to that and steel with tariffs, nobody at home is coming up to me and saying please put tariffs on.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nStock market latest: The S&P 500 fell 1.4% Thursday, making its decline since its February all-time high greater than 10%. It has now fully erased all its post-November election gains and is back to levels last seen in September.\n\nTrade war latest: After the European Union imposed a 50% tariff on American whiskey, Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on alcohol from the E.U.\n\nWhat else to know from the Trump presidency today\n\n'No daylight, kid': How Joe Biden handcuffed Kamala Harris\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nThe following is adapted from the forthcoming book \u201cFIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House\u201d by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, to be published April 1 by William Morrow. Copyright \u00a9 2025 by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. Reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins Publishers. It is available for pre-order here.\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris both understood the importance of being seen as the bigger change agent.\n\nFor Trump, that meant continuing to promise an antidote to the Joe Biden-Harris years. For Harris, there was more flexibility to define her brand of change. She could risk looking hypocritical by making clean breaks with Biden on policies she had supported as vice president, rejecting parts of their record to forge her own agenda. She could identify new issues to run on that avoided the pitfalls of turning her back on the Biden era. Or she could rely on voters to see her gender, her genes, and her \u201clived experience\u201d \u2014 a middle-class upbringing, schools outside the Ivy League, and a career as a prosecutor \u2014 as symbols of change.\n\nBiden and his loyalists took the first option off the table. He would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win. But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: let there be no daylight between us. \u201cNo daylight\u201d was the phrase he had used as a vice presidential candidate in 2008 to bind Republican nominee John McCain to an unpopular president, George W. Bush.\n\nAlmost everywhere she went, Harris walked among former Biden aides who sought to defend his presidency. Her campaign was run by a former White House deputy chief of staff \u2014 whom she had just empowered to box out her own confidants \u2014 and a phalanx of department heads who had served Biden until the previous month.\n\nThe day before Harris\u2019 first interview, a joint appearance with Tim Walz, she dived into the recurring question of whether and when she would let daylight shine between herself and Biden. Veteran Democratic communications strategist Stephanie Cutter launched into a proposed preamble \u2014 a list of all the items that made Harris proud of her work with Biden.\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d said Sean Clegg, a longtime Harris adviser who was regarded with suspicion by the Biden holdovers running the campaign. \u201cLet\u2019s not do this. Let\u2019s not go down memory lane.\u201d That was the last time he was invited to media prep. Cutter, another Harris confidant later joked, cut him out.\n\nCutter did not have the authority to make out the lineup card for media prep sessions, two senior campaign officials told NBC News on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhen Harris sat down with Walz and CNN\u2019s Dana Bash the last week of August, the segment produced a little bit of news: Harris said she would name a Republican to serve in her Cabinet. She also said that she no longer supported a ban on fracking.\n\nHer 2019 call to end the practice threatened to hurt her in Pennsylvania, even though she had adopted Biden\u2019s no-ban policy as his vice presidential candidate in 2020. But the first portion of the one-on-two interview \u2014 the part more viewers were likely to watch \u2014 featured Harris reciting a laundry list of Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nSitting next to Walz in a chair that seemed to place her below him and heaping praise on Biden\u2019s record, Harris did not look like a candidate seeking the highest office in the land. The whole scene reinforced the criticism that the vice president was either incapable, or afraid, of answering tough questions on her own.\n\nFor the rest of the campaign, her team required that she be provided a chair that met certain specifications: \u201cLeg height no less than 15 inches; floor to top of seat height no less than 18.9 inches; arms on chairs may not be very high, arms must fall at a natural height; chairs must be firm.\u201d\n\nNo matter how firm her chair, the question facing Harris was whether she could build a sturdy platform.\n\nHer rallies and convention speech had not answered the question of why she was running for president \u2014 or how her vision for the country would deliver for voters \u2014 other than having been next in line. She was running out of major moments to explain a vision to a broad audience. Her Sept. 10 debate with Trump would offer another opportunity \u2014 perhaps a last chance before voters cast early ballots \u2014 to establish that key part of her narrative.\n\nBut the day of the debate Biden called to give Harris an unusual kind of pep talk \u2014 and another reminder about the loyalty he demanded. No longer able to defend his own record, he expected Harris to protect his legacy. Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him \u2014 especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans. To the extent that she wanted to forge her own path, Biden had no interest in giving her room to do so. He needed just three words to convey how much all of that mattered to him.\n\n\u201cNo daylight, kid,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83c\udfc3 High, high hopes for higher office?

            "full_content": "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., his staff and family have been the target of harassment and death threats, according to a memo released by his office on Thursday afternoon.\n\nVoicemails shared by Tillis' team, which were filled with profanity and fueled by discontent with President Donald Trump, reveal a frightening new reality. The senator's senior advisor, Daniel Keylin, said \"the volume of threats and harassment directed at members of Congress and their staff is the new normal.\"\n\n\"Yeah, Thom Tillis, afraid of death threats? Then get the f--- out of office,\" one caller said in a voicemail.\n\nKeylin said Tillis' office in Greenville, North Carolina, received a handwritten and unsigned letter postmarked in Greensboro last month calling his staff members \"sacrificial lambs\" and insisting they \"signed up to be his shield.\" The anonymous writer, while reiterating \"in no way is this a threat,\" said people are going to start \"coming in filled with rage.\"\n\nMEET THE FAR-LEFT GROUPS FUNDING ANTI-DOGE PROTESTS AT GOP OFFICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY\n\nThe voicemails released by Tillis' office express outrage over Trump's policies and include violent threats to Tillis and his staff.\n\n\"You are not going to destroy my country,\" one woman said.

Resign, please resign, or find a Groupon for self defense class because America\u2019s transition to oligarchy is going to be a wild ride for us peons,\" reads the anonymous letter sent to Tillis.\n\nThe anonymous writer references \"America's transition to oligarchy,\" a term that has been used by the left to describe the alleged rising power of the billionaire class.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has drawn thousands of supporters to his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" rallies across the country, with stops in Michigan and Wisconsin this past weekend. The events are billed as an opportunity to \"discuss how we take on the greed of the billionaire class and create a government that works for all and not just the few.\"\n\nDemocrats were outraged by Trump inviting billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to sit behind him at his inauguration inside the U.S. Capitol. Former President Joe Biden also used the term \"oligarchy\" in his farewell address to the nation.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden told Americans on Jan. 13.\n\nTwo weeks after Tillis' office received the letter, Indivisible Guilford County, a local arm of a progressive political action group, organized a protest at Tillis\u2019 Greensboro office. While the protest's press release encouraged peaceful signs and \"solidarity,\" Keylin said the protesters attempted to break into Tillis' office.\n\n\"They angrily yanked and attempted to open the office\u2019s locked door, yelling at Tillis\u2019 staff to open it: \u2018Come back, we see you! Open the door!\u2019 and reminding the staff they had no way to exit their office,\" Keylin said in the memo.\n\nKeylin said Tillis' office received several media inquiries questioning if Tillis would attend the protests or town halls planned in Republican-held districts. Outlining years of targeted threats that have only escalated since Trump returned to office, Keylin said, \"I imagine anyone with a modicum of sanity would understand what a silly question that is.\"\n\nThe memo says that \"out of an abundance of caution,\" law enforcement has directed the senator's office to work from home on the days protests are planned.\n\n\"We will not make any apologies for prioritizing the safety and security of our staff,\" Keylin said.\n\nThe memo outlines two more instances in which the North Carolina senator was subject to death threats.\n\n\"Senator Tillis, his staff, and even his family have long been subject to threats, harassment, attempted intimidation, and verbal abuse from unstable individuals who don\u2019t agree with his political view,\" Keylin said.\n\nA U.S. citizen living abroad was arrested for threatening to kill Tillis and cut off the hands of his staffers in 2023, and a Minnesota man was indicted in 2022 for threatening to kill Tillis, the memo confirmed.\n\nProtests have shut down town halls and disrupted local legislative offices in the past two months, and Republicans have opted for tele-town halls instead of in-person town halls as a result. Democrats have accused Republicans of ignoring their constituents' concerns by avoiding in-person town halls.\n\nGov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., will host town halls on Friday in Republican-held congressional districts in Iowa and Nebraska \"to lend a megaphone to the people.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has reportedly started planning her own rallies in Republican-held congressional districts as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMoveOn.org, which has accepted millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Policy Center, announced in a press release last month that it was mobilizing resources as part of a \"Congress Works for Us, Not Musk\" initiative \"aimed at pressuring lawmakers to fight back against the Trump-Musk agenda.\" The group planned protests at congressional-led town halls and congressional offices.\n\nFox News Digital's Julia Johnson and Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report."

Instead, the shock announcement last week has reignited fears in Taiwan about losing its crown jewel, its world-beating semiconductor industry, to the US due to political pressure.\n\nThe island democracy\u2019s former President Ma Ying-jeou wasted no time in accusing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of \u201cselling TSMC\u201d to Trump as a \u201cprotection fee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a major national security crisis,\u201d Ma, a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), wrote on his Facebook page on March 4, shortly after the White House signing ceremony. It will \u201c\u2019have a significant negative impact on people\u2019s confidence, cross-strait relations and Taiwan\u2019s future geopolitical position.\u201d\n\nTo reassure the public, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te appeared alongside TSMC CEO CC Wei last week at Taipei\u2019s presidential office, saying the company\u2019s US investment would not undermine its commitment to and planned expansion in its home base.\n\nTSMC produces more than 90% of the world\u2019s advanced microchips, which power everything from smartphones and artificial intelligence to weapons. That\u2019s why many in Taiwan believe that global dependence on its semiconductors serves as a \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a deterrent against a potential Chinese invasion.\n\nChina\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory despite having never controlled it and has vowed to take control of the self-governing island, by force if necessary. Beijing has in recent years escalated its military activities around Taiwan, regularly flying fighter jets and conducting exercises in waters near the island.\n\nA screen in Beijing shows news footage of military drills conducted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army around Taiwan on October 14, 2024. Tingshu Wang/Reuters\n\n\u2018Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow\u2019\n\nTaiwan relies on US military and political support. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the US is legally obligated to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against a possible attack by China.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric has cast uncertainty over the future of US-Taiwan relations. He has repeatedly accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the US semiconductor industry, a claim that is widely disputed, while saying outright that Taiwan should pay the US for \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nFor many on the self-governing island, the phrase \u201cUkraine today, Taiwan tomorrow\u201d has increasingly resonated in recent weeks as they watch Trump upend longstanding US policy by playing up Kremlin rhetoric and warming to Moscow, while alienating traditional European allies and Kyiv. Taiwanese see parallels between their democracy and Ukraine, with both facing existential threats from aggressive, expansionist neighbors.\n\nWashington earlier this month abruptly suspended military aid to Ukraine following a heated exchange between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, just hours after the cheerful TSMC ceremony. It reinstated aid this week after Ukraine accepted a 30-day US-proposed ceasefire. The White House has also pressed Zelensky to sign a deal giving the US access to Kyiv\u2019s untapped mineral riches.\n\nTammy Chao, a retiree, expressed deep concern to CNN about Taiwan\u2019s security after TSMC\u2019s announcement, likening Trump\u2019s approach to his handling of Ukraine. She described him as a \u201cdealer\u201d who might eventually treat Taiwan as a bargaining chip.\n\n\u201cTaiwan, pretty soon just like [what] he said to Zelensky, \u2018you have no cards to play,\u2019 and Taiwan is not gonna have cards to play,\u201d she said. \u201cTSMC was the best card.\u201d\n\nBut others appear less concerned. Fred Lin, a finance industry professional, said he believed TSMC came to this decision prudently.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t pay protection fees to the US? No doubt It is a form of protection fee, that we can understand, but that\u2019s the reality of international politics,\u201d he said.\n\nTSMC headquarters in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2024 I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump administration officials, however, have also said they need to dial down involvement in European security to focus on Asia \u2013 and the threat from China. Prior to his election, Vance was explicit in his concerns that US support for Ukraine could hinder its ability to aid Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nResearchers say there are limits to comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan\u2019s security circumstances and believe the island\u2019s security is influenced by multiple factors beyond its semiconductor industry, including China\u2019s broader geopolitical ambition and Taiwan\u2019s strategic location.\n\nWhether China takes military action against Taiwan is ultimately driven by its core interests, which are not solely dependent on the island\u2019s role in global chip production, said Min-yen Chiang, a nonresident fellow at the Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology, a government-funded think tank in Taipei.\n\nHe referenced the time in 1950 when the US sent its Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait early on during the Korean War to deter China from invading Taiwan. The strategic move by then-President Harry Truman neutralized the Taiwan Strait and ensured the Korean War did not trigger a wider conflict, maintaining stability in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\u201cTaiwan then had no semiconductor industry at all,\u201d he said.\n\nStill committed\n\nLast week, President Lai said Taipei did not \u201cface any pressure from Washington\u201d in doing the TSMC deal, which the company said was the biggest such investment in the US ever made by a non-American firm.\n\nStanding next to him, Wei attributed the increased investment to \u201cstrong demand\u201d from American customers such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and Broadcom that wanted to reduce potential supply chain risks by having chips made locally.\n\nHe also added that TSMC was \u201cnot afraid\u201d of Trump potentially scrapping the subsidies from the Chips Act, stressing that the company\u2019s decision to invest in the US was driven by customer needs.\n\nTSMC was awarded $6.5 billion in grants for its first three plants in Arizona under the bipartisan Chips Act, spearheaded by the Biden administration, which allocated $39 billion in federal funding to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe are the best wherever we build our fabs,\u201d Wei added, referring to semiconductor fabrication plants.\n\nAlong with the additional three manufacturing facilities, the new investment also promised two chip packaging plants and a research and development center to improve the production process technology.\n\nWei clarified that the development of the cutting-edge next generation chipmaking technology would remain in Taiwan and would still be 10 times bigger than the US facilities.\n\nSemiconductor analysts applauded the company for making an \u201cagile\u201d decision.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo praised TSMC in an online analysis, calling it the \u201cmost successful non-US company in negotiations with the Trump administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the $100 billion investment seems massive, the lack of details provides the flexibility for spending based on future conditions, softening the impact on profitability,\u201d Kuo wrote.\n\nTSMC\u2019s investment has mostly alleviated Trump\u2019s concerns, according to Eric Chen, an analyst at Digitimes Research, a market research firm. \u201cBut of course, we have no way of knowing when Trump might change his stance \u2014 he\u2019s notorious for making sudden U-turns,\u201d he said.\n\nAn electronic wafer is displayed at the TSMC Museum of Innovation in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2024. I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWeaponizing tariffs\n\nTSMC\u2019s $100 billion investment marks the latest in a wave of businesses committing massive sums to the US. But it stands out as one of the first major foreign firms to do so, and Trump claims more such investments are on the way.\n\nIn contrast to his predecessor Biden\u2019s approach of incentivizing domestic investment through subsidies, Trump prefers to weaponize tariffs. So far, it has proven effective.\n\nTrump has previously threatened to impose 25% tariffs on semiconductors, along with automobiles and pharmaceuticals as early as next month. At the announcement of TSMC\u2019s investment, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the company chose to expand in the US due to the threat of tariffs, and were not given additional grants.\n\nIn late February, Apple pledged $500 billion to expand facilities, manufacturing and projects across the US over the next four years. Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank announced in January that they would invest $500 billion to create a new company that would build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.\n\nWith TSMC\u2019s new investment in the US, Trump is expected to turn up the heat on other major companies, said Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business.\n\nHe said it puts added pressure on Samsung and Intel, the two other major producers of computing and AI chips in the world.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s SK Hynix, another key player in memory chips along with Samsung, are also expected to feel the squeeze. Samsung has previously pledged to invest $37 billion in Texas, while SK Hynix announced plans to build a $3.87 billion chip packaging plant in Indiana last year. Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment.\n\nHsieh said it is obvious that companies like TSMC and others will have to \u201cdo whatever they can to make Trump happy.\u201d But he also warned of the risks associated with such concessions.\n\n\u201cOnce you agree to blackmail, then there\u2019s no end of it,\u201d he said."

Thursday is a big deadline for federal agencies, which will determine how bad the next wave of cuts will bite, as USA Today reports:\n\nThursday is the deadline for federal agencies and departments to give the Trump administration their plans for large-scale layoffs, and the details about how many people will be fired are expected to come out throughout and coming weeks \u2026\n\nIt remains unclear how many of the roughly 2 million federal employees spread across the country could lose their jobs under the new layoff plans, called a \u201creduction in force\u201d or RIF. The memo ordering agencies to produce the reduction in force plans called for \u201ca significant reduction.\u201d Agencies can whittle personnel through layoffs, attrition, removal of underperforming employees, or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements.\n\nAn early estimate when Trump initiated the RIF process last month was that up to 700,000 federal employees could lose their jobs. It\u2019s no accident that this is the number of employees that would likely be furloughed if there was a government shutdown; determining who is not an \u201cessential employee\u201d (a very technical term that has nothing to do with the quality of work someone does) is one of the key criteria agencies are being told to use in identifying RIF victims. So in a way, the RIF is operates like a government shutdown in terms of the services lost, though worse in one way: In the past, furloughed employees received back pay once a shutdown ended.\n\nOne significant aspect of the RIF process is that it\u2019s a joint project of Russell Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (which earlier sought to impose a funding freeze on much of the federal government) and the Office of Personal Management. OPM has served as Elon Musk\u2019s beachhead in the federal government and has been the staging area for most DOGE cuts. While DOGE\u2019s formal involvement in the RIF process is unclear, some of the deep cuts it has already imposed on agencies appear to be a sort of doubling down on RIF. As Politico explains, the RIFs will roll out in two stages:\n\nThe strategies due Thursday will identify agency offices that provide \u201cdirect service to citizens,\u201d explain which parts of agencies are required by law and explain whether \u201cthe agency or any of its subcomponents should be eliminated or consolidated,\u201d according to guidance provided to agency bosses.\n\nAgency leaders were also directed to describe the tools they intend to use to \u201cachieve efficiencies,\u201d including through expected staff reductions in coming years.\n\nIn the \u201cPhase 2\u201d plans due by April 14, agency bosses were directed to expand on their plans for overhauling their operations. That plan is set to include any proposals to relocate agency offices from Washington to other parts of the country, targets for \u201csubsequent large-scale RIFs,\u201d and agencies\u2019 plans to renegotiate provisions of collective bargaining agreements deemed to \u201cinhibit government efficiency and cost-savings.\u201d\n\nIs this legal? That\u2019s debatable. In the past, much smaller RIFs have occasionally been deployed to bring agency staffing into line with congressionally determined policy changes or specific efficiency measures. In the most famous recent RIF, during the Clinton administration, the process was approved by Congress and coordinated with public employee unions; it was rolled out over years, not weeks, and only after a sustained analysis flowing from a National Performance Review. Its size and speed was nothing like what Team Trump is undertaking. There will be litigation, for sure, when the RIF really get rolling and people lose jobs. But it\u2019s part of what now looks to be a multipronged effort to hammer the federal government: If one avenue is blocked, another is opened.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, on the same day as the RIF deadline, Fox News reported that Vought\u2019s long-cherished dream of simply impounding (i.e., refusing to spend) congressional appropriated spending is close to being realized:\n\nThe White House has already started mapping out how to make good on its promise to slash federal spending in preparation for a six-month government funding bill to pass through Congress.\n\nTwo people familiar with the conversations told Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought are working on a strategy for impounding federal funds that Congress is expected to allocate this week, before the partial government shutdown deadline on March 14.\n\nTrump and his allies have made no secret of their belief that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is unconstitutionally constraining the powers of the president. But the new development is a significant step toward a likely legal showdown as Democrats warn they will respond if Trump tries to bypass Congress on federal spending.\n\nThis power grab will definitely be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has upheld congressional limits on impoundment in the past.\n\nBut in any event, think about this: Team Trump isn\u2019t even waiting for the funds to be appropriated by Congress before plotting to cancel them. It certainly makes congressional Republicans look like disingenuous stooges in voting for a spending bill written in disappearing ink, and it reinforces the impression that no matter what Congress does or doesn\u2019t do, the government is in a state of perpetual shutdown."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nOne of the trends that Donald Trump and his supporters wanted to reverse with his big speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 was a steady erosion of his job-approval ratings in the polls from the mildly positive \u201choneymoon\u201d levels he registered just after returning to the White House.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. And there\u2019s increasing evidence concerns about the economy and reaction to Elon Musk\u2019s assault on federal services and employees are beginning to take a toll on the new administration\u2019s base of support. On Thursday, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, having lost more than 10 percent of its value in three weeks.\n\nSilver Bulletin\u2019s comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of the polls show Trump\u2019s approval-rating averages now clearly underwater at 47.3 percent positive and 49.0 percent negative. RealClearPolitics, which produces simple arithmetical averages from a database that includes several dubious pro-Trump pollsters, shows his net job-approval averages dropping from 1.2 percent on March 4 to minus-0.7 percent on March 13.\n\nBeyond the overall numbers, the most recent polls show that worries about the economy continue to hound the 47th president. Here\u2019s how Emerson College explained the trends:\n\nAs President Trump reaches his first 50 days in office, his approval rating has declined from 49%-41% to 47%-45%, reflecting a nation deeply divided \u2026 Voters are most supportive of Trump\u2019s immigration policy, but they disapprove of his handling of the economy, believe tariffs will hurt economic growth, and are skeptical of his cryptocurrency policy.\n\nA number of polls before the speech suggested that even Trump supporters thought he was inadequately focused on inflation and prices, which could mean deeper trouble for him if his current wave of tariffs and trade-war threats produce higher retail prices, as most economists expect. The most recent plunge in stock prices may produce additional jitters as predictions of a possible recession return to news reports.\n\nA March 13 Quinnipiac survey shows that concerns over the economy are actually more intense than they were at the end of the Biden administration. The percentage of voters describing the economy as either \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d has increased from 64 percent in December to 76 percent now.\n\nWhere is Trump losing ground among the electorate? Polls differ, but the latest, the above-mentioned Emerson poll, showed Latinos disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance by a 51.6 to 35.2 percent margin. Another post-speech poll from TIPP Insights shows self-identified moderates disapproving of the job Trump\u2019s doing by a 54 to 33 percent margin. It appears that the less MAGA-oriented elements of the electorate where Trump made important gains last November may be proving soft spots in his coalition, which isn\u2019t surprising since he\u2019s now responsible for a status quo with which a lot of Americans are chronically unhappy. The chaos in his administration probably isn\u2019t helping. As Axios reports, the occasional pollsters who ask about Elon Musk and DOGE are sensing some negative vibes:\n\nIn a Feb. 13-18 Washington Post-Ipsos poll, a net 34% of respondents said they approved of how Musk was handling his job, compared to 49% disapproving and 14% not sure.\n\nThe poll displayed a stark divide based on party ID, with just 6% of Democrats approving of how Musk has handled his job compared to 70% of Republicans. But when asked if they approved of Musk shutting down federal government programs he deemed unnecessary, a smaller slice of Republicans (56%) gave their blessing, while 25% said they weren\u2019t sure and 18% disapproved \u2026\n\nOver half of respondents (55%) in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted Feb. 13 to 17 said Musk has too much power in making decisions affecting the U.S., while 36% think he has about the right amount of power.\n\nA Pew survey of U.S. adults taken Jan. 27 to Feb. 2 showed that Americans had more negative (54%) than positive (42%) views of Musk (DOGE\u2019s dissection of the federal government has dramatically escalated since the poll was conducted).\n\nThe more recent Quinnipiac poll shows self-identified independents disapproving of Musk and DOGE by a 68 to 28 percent margin.\n\nIf alarm over arbitrary federal budget cuts and employee layoffs coincides with troublesome economic news, Trump may soon find himself back in the more decisively negative public-opinion territory he has inhabited for much of his political career."

            "full_content": "When Republicans are looking for a political bogeyman, they point to liberal megadonor George Soros\n\nTwo billionaires that are villains of the left and right take the spotlight in a key Wisconsin race\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- When Republicans are looking for a political bogeyman, they point to liberal megadonor George Soros. Democrats recently have been answering with a villain of their own: the world's wealthiest man and close adviser to President Donald Trump, Elon Musk.\n\nNow, the billionaires' influence on politics is colliding in a spring election that will decide whether conservatives or liberals control the supreme court in an important presidential battleground state. Both Musk and Soros have spent large sums on the race for an open seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, making them easy targets in a debate between the two candidates Wednesday.\n\nWhile the race is officially nonpartisan, Democrats and Republicans have lined up behind each candidate. Former state Attorney General Brad Schimel, who is backed by Republicans, called Soros a \u201cdangerous person to have an endorsement from.\u201d The philanthropist has spent $1 million to benefit his opponent, Democratic-supported Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford.\n\nShe fired back by saying Musk \u201chas basically taken over Brad Schimel\u2019s campaign.\u201d The Tesla and SpaceX CEO who is running Trump's massive federal cost-cutting initiative has funded two groups that have together spent more than $10 million to promote Schimel.\n\nThe exchange highlighted how the April 1 election, which will affect looming cases on abortion, voting rules, congressional district boundaries and more, has drawn national scrutiny in a year when there are just a handful of consequential elections. It also showed how the two polarizing billionaires are playing an outsized role in the race, as each side seeks to weigh down the other with political baggage.\n\nThose tactics make sense in an off-year, spring election when voters may not know the candidates or be paying much attention, said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to tie it to national themes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall strategy is, how can you scare your base into making sure they show up at the polls?\u201d\n\nSoros has been reviled by conservatives for years for his donations to liberal prosecutors and other left-wing and anti-authoritarian causes. Musk, a newer power player in political giving, has angered liberals because of his role in Trump\u2019s campaign last year \u2014 his super PAC spent about $200 million to help get Trump elected \u2014 and his efforts to slash federal government services and staff through the new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe 94-year-old Hungarian American and Jewish billionaire has been a conservative target for decades.\n\nCore to their ire is the spending he and affiliated groups have done to elect liberal prosecutors \u2014 officials that Republicans argue are too soft on crime. GOP lawmakers have called attention to Soros\u2019 donations in efforts to recall those prosecutors, saying the people he supports have put communities at risk.\n\nTrump also has used Soros to tarnish the credibility of people and groups he doesn\u2019t like. In a recent executive order aiming to punish the law firm Perkins Coie, he said the firm \u201chas worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws.\u201d\n\nAttacks on Soros often veer into antisemitic and conspiratorial territory, with some falsely casting him as backing violent protesters or having secretive family ties.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2014 an ally of Trump \u2014 has boosted that trope by promoting the belief that Soros is engaged in covert plots to destabilize Hungary. Pressure from the autocratic leader prompted a university Soros founded to move its programs from Budapest to Vienna in 2018.\n\nAhead of the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Soros gave $1 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party. He made a donation in the same amount ahead of this year\u2019s race, prompting Schimel and his supporters to invoke Soros in campaign messaging and ads.\n\n\u201cSusan Crawford takes her marching orders from George Soros, (Illinois Gov.) JB Pritzker, anti-ICE sheriffs, and Defund the Police radicals,\u201d Schimel's campaign wrote on X earlier this month. \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d\n\nMusk hurtled onto the political scene in the last couple of years, spending big money to secure Republican control of the federal government and in states where he has businesses.\n\nLast year, he spent nearly $300 million on Republican campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The bulk of that was to boost Trump, but a super PAC he founded also spent millions on U.S. House races.\n\nMusk also has dabbled in state politics in Texas, where he has moved several of his businesses. He became involved in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race shortly after Tesla sued the state in a dispute over a law barring automakers from operating or controlling vehicle dealerships. The case ultimately could end up before the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe curious timing, his unabashed support for Trump and his chaotic moves in the federal government, make Musk a dream target for the left, said Wisconsin Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki, who is not involved in the race.\n\n\u201cHaving a villain makes everything easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cue to the partisans \u2013 it\u2019s a clarion call. Crawford is with us, and Schimel is in the pocket of Elon Musk, the most unpopular person in America right now who can\u2019t get off the front page.\u201d\n\nCrawford has leaned into the attacks, referring to Musk as \u201cElon Schimel\u201d in the debate. She also reminded voters of Musk\u2019s actions at DOGE, such as recommending the firing of government workers helping to fight the avian flu outbreak.\n\nThe race, which is seen as a litmus test of how a battleground state\u2019s voters are responding to the first months of the Trump presidency, also might offer clues into how they view Musk\u2019s role in the administration.\n\nA challenge both candidates face is that as they attack each other for being supported by notorious high-dollar donors, they must rationalize having their own wealthy benefactors.\n\nCrawford needs to associate Schimel with Trump as much as possible to win, said Brandon Scholz, a former Republican strategist in Wisconsin who now identifies as an independent. The Musk donations help with that \u2013 as do flyers distributed to voters by Musk\u2019s America PAC that say Schimel will \u201c support President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nThere could soon be more opportunities to show those ties: A Monday town hall billed as a get-out-the-vote effort for Schimel will be co-hosted by one of Trump\u2019s sons, Donald Trump Jr., and political activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nSchimel, meanwhile, needs diehard Trump voters to come out to the polls, said Scholz. It's a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\" he said, because it means the candidate will have to gamble with turning off some voters.\n\nSoros also has less name recognition than Musk right now, Scholz said. That could be one reason why Schimel has relied more in recent weeks on traditional conservative messaging, such as accusing his opponent of letting criminals off with lenient sentences.\n\nDuring the debate, he said he has no control over outside donations or the messages they spread. He also said he wouldn\u2019t give Trump or Musk special treatment if he\u2019s elected to the court. Instead, Schimel said, he treats the courtroom like a baseball umpire would \u2014 \u201cnot rooting for any team.\u201d\n\nCrawford also distanced herself from Soros\u2019 donation by noting it was made to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, which has endorsed her. She said while Schimel has revealed how he\u2019ll vote on some pending cases, she has \u201cnever promised anything, and that is the difference.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 School was out on Thursday, so D.C. parents decided it was time for a field trip to Capitol Hill.\n\nThere, they lobbied against Congress' temporary government funding bill that could slash the city's budget by more than $1 billion and leave public schools vulnerable to cuts.\n\nParents mobilized one another to call members of Congress, show up at senators' offices and lobby Senate staffers who have children in D.C. public schools. They coordinated their actions through PTAs, group chats and email listservs, while also urging family members outside of the district to contact their members of Congress.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nOne text in a group chat of D.C. parents noted that a Senate Republican staffer had children at their school, adding that there was a movement to corner her. Another parent told NBC News that parents have been working to figure out which Capitol Hill staffers with children in public schools could be reached.\n\nSome parents have been leveraging relationships with people who may hold sway on the Hill.\n\n\"Parents have described staffers who they are either personal friends with or former colleagues that they have reached out to personally,\" Emma Kelly, a D.C. public schools parent, said.\n\nThe city\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget was approved last year, increasing the budget by more than $1 billion. But the funding bill being considered by Congress would force the city to revert back to fiscal 2024 budget levels, reducing the city\u2019s spending by $1.1 billion in six months, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said this week.\n\nPrevious temporary government funding bills, known as continuing resolutions, have had provisions allowing D.C. to continue spending funds in line with the city\u2019s current fiscal year budget, rather than the previous one. Such a provision was excluded from this week\u2019s bill.\n\nAs parents protested at her colleagues' offices, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters that she would speak with Bowser on Thursday.\n\n\"I do not support this restriction on the District of Columbia's ability to use its own funding,\" said Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. She added, however, that she still plans to vote for the bill.\n\nParents have been focusing on outreach to Republicans and moderate Democrats, emphasizing to members of Congress that their staffers are often D.C. residents whose kids may attend the city's public schools.\n\nMultiple parents told NBC News that their lobbying of other parents took place privately through text messages and interactions in schools and neighborhoods, nervous that their employers would look negatively on activism during a new presidential administration.\n\nOne woman who has a child in D.C. public schools told NBC News that she had spoken with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Wednesday about the bill's impact on D.C.'s budget. Murkowski seemed receptive and said that her staffers remind her frequently that they are all D.C. residents, the woman said.\n\nD.C. does not have voting members of Congress, so parents and children roamed the floors of the Hart Senate office building on Thursday, urging Senate staffers to protect the city's funding.\n\n\u201cIt was important for me to go to Senate Hart, largely because I\u2019ve been watching the educators around me continue to give their all to raising future generations,\" said 16-year-old Erica Floyd, who attends a D.C. public high school and visited a Senate office building to try to talk to senators. \"Their perseverance, dedication and support for students and their education inspired me to do my part and advocate for my peers\u2019 education and my own.\"\n\nSixth graders Leo Benevelli, Jake Kaplan and Jake Zelin visited Sen. Jon Ossoff's office with their moms after he said he was assessing the bill. Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is up for re-election in 2026.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think this is what the Founding Fathers of our country would have wanted, and our country is built by teachers and schools,\u201d Benevelli said.\n\nSeveral of the advocates who visited Capitol Hill on Thursday invoked their upbringing as they brought their cases to Senate staffers.\n\nDouglas McRae was born and raised in Mississippi and now lives in D.C. with his 4-year-old son, Luca, who is in the city's pre-K program. The two visited Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith's office on Thursday with other advocates, urging the staff for the Mississippi Republican to ensure that the city's budget remained in tact.\n\nMcRae has asked his parents and Luca's aunt and uncles in Mississippi to contact their members of Congress.\n\n\"I've told them to reach out and call as well to make sure that people in Mississippi are not OK with this,\" he said.\n\nIt's a tactic used by other D.C. families, too, who worry that their voices won't be heard without a voting member of Congress. The city has a delegate and two shadow senators, but they cannot vote on legislation.\n\n\"I've asked my family and my friends who live in states with voting senators to please advocate on our behalf,\" said Caitlin Rogger, whose 8- and 10-year-old children are in D.C. elementary schools. \"The Senate can turn this around, but D.C. doesn't have a senator who can vote, so there's no one beholden to my neighbors and me for this decision.\"\n\nMarina Zhavoronkova and her 4-year-old son participated in protests Thursday in Washington. Megan Lebowitz / NBC News\n\nAshley Smith Thomson visited senators\u2019 offices Thursday, one day after her latest chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. She is on medical leave, which is putting a strain on her finances and has her worried about what potential spending cuts could mean for child care in D.C.\n\n\"If it goes away, I don't know what I'm going to do with my daughter while I'm recovering from a double mastectomy,\" said Smith Thomson, whose child is in first grade.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what programs would face funding cuts if the bill goes through, but the mayor has laid out that some of the top areas that the city spends money on are public education, public safety and Health and Human Services.\n\nSteph Tatham with her daughters, who are in second grade and kindergarten, attended the Recess at the Capitol protests. Megan Lebowitz / NBC News\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to cut that kind of money in the time that we would have in this fiscal year not to affect police or not to affect teachers and not to affect some of the basic government services that allow us to keep our city clean, safe and beautiful,\u201d Bowser told reporters Monday.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for the mayor said that her office is \"hopeful that our partners in Congress will get it fixed this week.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who chairs the Appropriations Committee and introduced the bill this month, did not respond to a request for comment about the bill's impact on D.C.'s funding.\n\nThe House voted on Tuesday to pass a six-month funding bill that mostly maintains similar funding levels from 2024. The Senate has not yet voted on the bill, but Democrats have said they will reject it. The government faces a Friday night deadline to avoid a shutdown."

            "full_content": "Former first lady Michelle Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson, speak at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago on October 29, 2019. Photo: Terrence Antonio James/TNS/Getty Images\n\nDivorce is the one thing people really want to hear Michelle Obama talk about right now. And on her new podcast, IMO (short for \u201cin my opinion\u201d), the former First Lady obliges, repeatedly discussing the topic. The bad news for gossip hounds is that Mobama opines only on her brother and co-host Craig Robinson\u2019s divorce from his first wife. In fact, IMO\u2019s first two episodes are almost totally devoid of any juicy content \u2014 let alone juicy content about the state of Michelle and Barack Obama\u2019s marriage.\n\nGranted, there probably isn\u2019t much to say about the Obamas\u2019 marriage, as they are not separating. The rumor that they might be took off in August when In Touch published a cover story suggesting that Michelle Obama had been \u201cbetrayed,\u201d and that Barack Obama and Jennifer Aniston were \u201cobsessed with each other.\u201d Aniston joked about the idea that she\u2019s having an affair with the former president months later on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, calling it \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201d And the Obamas have tacitly signaled that their marriage is fine via affectionate social media posts.\n\nIMO, which is produced by the Obamas\u2019 media company Higher Ground, never promised inside information on the former First Couple\u2019s marriage, though listeners may have assumed they\u2019d get some interesting tidbits. According to the show description, a \u201crelaxed and honest\u201d Mobama will be delving into topics like \u201cdating and relationships\u201d:\n\nMichelle Obama and her big brother Craig Robinson bring their unique experiences and candid perspectives to a range of listeners\u2019 personal dilemmas, from the everyday to the existential. Each week, they\u2019re joined by special guests to tackle audience questions with practical advice, relatable anecdotes, and plenty of laughs. From dating and relationships to parenting and financial planning, IMO sees the iconic First Lady at her most relaxed and honest. This podcast will leave you laughing, reflecting, and feeling more prepared to tackle life\u2019s challenges.\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? In episode one, Obama and Robinson talk about their close bond as siblings. In episode two they have a meandering conversation about friendship with Issa Rae. In both episodes they discuss Robinson\u2019s divorce, which is old news (he divorced his first wife in 2000 and married his current wife in 2006, and he has discussed the split elsewhere). Each time, all they reveal is that Obama was upset her brother didn\u2019t initially confide in her about his marital troubles.\n\nBarack Obama is mentioned several times in passing, and his cameos, if anything, provide more evidence that the Obamas\u2019 marriage is fine. Michelle says she was initially annoyed by Barack\u2019s failure to get ready on time. Robinson tells a familiar anecdote about persuading his sister to support Barack\u2019s first presidential run. Michelle alludes to Barack being in the house when her friends come to visit \u2014 contradicting claims that they\u2019re living separate lives \u2014 and teasingly notes that he never comes home with good gossip after hanging out with his buddies.\n\nThe same can be said of IMO. These are the most interesting revelations from the first two episodes:\n\nTeenage Sasha and Malia didn\u2019t like doing the turkey pardon with their dad. \u201cIt was cute when they were little, but as they got older, you could see on their faces in the shots them thinking, \u2018Just poke my eyes out. Just right now. Just get me out of here. I\u2019m standing with my father telling these stupid jokes next to a turkey,\u2019\u201d Michelle says.\n\nMichelle Obama really likes the smell of Pine-Sol. It reminds her of her freshly mopped childhood apartment \u2014 or at least, that\u2019s what she claims during an ad read for the cleaning product.\n\nMichelle Obama is into astrology. In episode one she makes a fleeting reference to being a Capricorn. In episode two, she suggests she knows herself better than most because of where her birthday falls on the zodiac. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to set boundaries, but I think it starts with knowing, well, who do I want to be?\u201d she says. \u201cThe honesty first has to be within yourself. I think both of us probably as Capricorns, we\u2019re probably a little more honest about who we are, what we want.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the IMO podcast feels like it\u2019s coming to us from another time, or an alternate, less-grim reality (and that may literally be the case; presumably it was planned out well before Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration). Marital gossip aside, what people probably need from Michelle Obama at the moment is an anti-Trump pep talk, like the spectacular speech she delivered at the last Democratic National Convention. But despite her natural talent and huge popularity, Obama has repeatedly made it clear that she does not want a career in politics. And it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like \u201chope is making a comeback\u201d right now. So instead, all we\u2019re getting from Michelle Obama is bland chatter with her brother and and Pine-Sol ad copy."

The group was recently designated a foreign terrorist organization by the Department of State.\n\nThrough these networks, Goudreau said, Maduro can \"flood the United States with fentanyl.\"\n\nTRUMP ADMIN PROMISES TO BE \u2018RUTHLESSLY AGGRESSIVE\u2019 IN RESPONSE TO SUSPECTED CARTEL KILLING OF US CITIZEN\n\n\"Because he has individuals who have access and placement [in the United States], whether it's Tren de Aragua or whoever, he obviously has agents in the United States who are moving product, moving fentanyl and things of that nature, killing Americans. So, this is the obvious threat we\u2019ve seen this over the last four years,\" Goudreau explained.\n\nHe acknowledged recent efforts to shut the border and crack down on illegal immigration have helped, but he said the threat still exists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite this, Goudreau cautioned against any sudden moves by the Trump administration to help the Venezuelan resistance movement against Maduro.\n\n\"Everybody wants to create a kind of clarity, but this is an incredibly complex situation. It's not going to get fixed overnight,\" he said."

He should not be accountable. He should be able to have free rein and do whatever he wants. We will willingly follow him and do whatever he says because he's the wealthiest man in the world, and, surely, he must know how to save us from ourselves,'\" Larson said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLarson said Social Security \"just happens to be the No. 1 anti-poverty program for the elderly and for the children of this country,\" adding that Musk and Trump \"aren't going to lose a moment's sleep thinking about the privatization.\"\n\nThe congressman and all committee Democrats introduced a resolution to compel the Trump administration to provide answers on DOGE's intentions with Social Security, but Larson claimed Republicans are trying to stop it from coming to a vote."

For example, the U.S. Navy released a \"Blue Arctic\" strategy in 2021 cautioning that Russia was reopening old bases in the region, and urged the sea service to operate more aggressively there as a result.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nTrump has discussed the possibility of expanding American territory for months and said in a post in December 2024 on Truth Social that \"the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, leaders from Greenland, which is a territory of Denmark, pushed back on Trump\u2019s remarks to members of Congress.\n\n\"We do not want to be Americans, nor Danes, we are Kalaallit (Greenlanders),\" Greenland Prime Minister M\u00fate Egede said in a March 5 post translated by Reuters. \"The Americans and their leader must understand that.\""

Photo: Andrew Cabellero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cMove fast and break things\u201d is the unofficial slogan of Silicon Valley, and certainly the world\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful tech bro, Elon Musk, has taken it to heart in attacking and destabilizing the federal government. Even his own operatives at DOGE can\u2019t really keep up with the damage they are joyfully inflicting on the public sector, or what it might look like when they\u2019re done.\n\nBut in the meantime, the government entity that really does have the lawful authority to do the things that DOGE has arrogated to itself as a reflection of Donald Trump\u2019s imperial ideas of executive power, the U.S. Congress, is moving like molasses on the president\u2019s legislative agenda. It\u2019s not because Democrats are getting in the way: The minority party has been completely shut out of the decision-making process in Congress, and it may be giving up its last bit of leverage by accepting (not voting for, but also not filibustering) a Republican appropriations measure for the rest of this fiscal year as a lesser evil than a government shutdown.\n\nThe slo-mo pace in Congress is the product of three factors. First, Republicans decided ages ago that they would cram every bit of eligible legislation into a budget reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered and that would pass both Houses on a party-line vote. That\u2019s not surprising; Republicans did the same thing last time they had a \u201ctrifecta\u201d in 2017, and so did Democrats when they had one in 2021. But the reconciliation process has its own set of arcane rules that make quick action very difficult.\n\nSecond, after weeks and weeks of vacillation, Trump told congressional Republicans he preferred a \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d strategy for reconciliation. This means that everything he wants, from increased spending on defense and border security, to an array of tax cuts, to offsetting domestic-spending reductions, will have to be loaded into one piece of legislation that somehow hangs together and complies with all the budget rules. Working that out between House and Senate Republicans, and ensuring the final product is something nearly all of them can support, is incredibly complicated and takes a lot of time.\n\nThird, House and Senate Republicans are not working together well at all. After Trump endorsed the House budget resolution setting out a blueprint for a single reconciliation bill, the Senate became obligated to go along. But weeks after the House acted, the Senate hasn\u2019t followed suit, apparently because it wants some changes that then the House will have to accept or reject. The whole process is becoming more complex and fraught with pitfalls precisely at the time when Republicans should be acting smoothly as a team. And as Politico reports, the deadlines for action keep getting pushed back:\n\nBut behind the scenes, House GOP leaders are stewing over what they see as the Senate\u2019s failure to act expeditiously, despite House Republicans approving their budget plan two weeks ago.\n\nIn an effort to spur them along, Majority Leader Steve Scalise this week quietly encouraged GOP committee chairs to increase their public criticism of what he described as the Senate\u2019s unacceptable timeline. Those House GOP leaders were also deeply alarmed when Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Finance Committee member, emerged from a meeting of panel Republicans Monday night and said the reconciliation bill might not be completed until August.\n\nThere are some rather big problems with letting Trump\u2019s entire legislative agenda slide until later in the year. For one thing, it\u2019s entirely likely Trump\u2019s popularity will fade as the inevitable backlash to what the executive branch is doing to federal agencies and programs builds. For another, one of Trump\u2019s more popular ideas \u2014 one that\u2019s absolutely Job One to major elements of his MAGA base \u2014 is the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. But that really can\u2019t happen on the level he\u2019s promised without a significant shift of resources. That\u2019s one major reason Republican senators wanted to do two reconciliation bills with the first devoted to beefing up the defense and border-security programs needed to get the deportation locomotive moving. But Trump said no to that, so now the deportation drive has stalled.\n\nPerhaps the most alarming byproduct of endless delays in enacting a reconciliation bill is the possibility that it won\u2019t happen in time to deal with a debt-default crisis, which is expected to arrive as early as June, when the Treasury runs out of ways to pay for U.S. obligations. Trump has demanded a $4 trillion debt-limit increase, and the idea was to include that in reconciliation so as to (a) deny Democrats leverage over it and (b) sugar-coat the measure for fiscal hawks who hate debt-limit increases. If the debt-limit measure slips out of reconciliation because that \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d is stuck at some point in the legislative process when the bills come due, Republicans will have a real disaster on their hands.\n\nSo perhaps congressional Republicans can continue to vicariously enjoy the reckless pace at which Trump and Musk are moving to disrupt the \u201cdeep state,\u201d even if that means abdicating centuries-long legislative-branch prerogatives over spending and federal-program authorizations. But Team Trump will need Congress to act decisively on the budget at some point down the road, and the institution is not off to a great start."

            "full_content": "San Francisco CNN \u2014\n\nA federal judge has ordered half a dozen federal agencies to \u201cimmediately\u201d reinstate probationary employees fired last month as part of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rapidly shrink the federal workforce, calling the effort a \u201csham.\u201d\n\nThe preliminary injunction issued from the bench Thursday by US District Judge William Alsup requires the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury to rehire the employees. The judge said that he might extend the order to cover other federal agencies at a later time.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said he was making the ruling because he believes the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.\n\n\u201cThe court finds that Office of Personnel Management did direct all agencies to terminate probationary employees with the exception of mission critical employees,\u201d he said, rejecting arguments from the Justice Department that OPM merely issued \u201cguidance\u201d to the agencies that then led to the firings.\n\nThe judge said the order is effective immediately: \u201cThis is the order and it counts.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department indicated Thursday that it will appeal the ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by labor unions and others challenging OPM\u2019s role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.\n\nAlsup was highly critical of the administration\u2019s justification for firing the employees. OPM had provided agencies with a template termination letter that cited the employee\u2019s \u201cperformance\u201d as the reason they were being let go. But the judge said that rationale was the government\u2019s attempt to end-run federal law setting up specific rules for reducing the federal workforce.\n\n\u201cThe reason that OPM wanted to put this based on performance was at least in part in my judgment a gimmick to avoid the Reductions in Force Act,\u201d the judge said. \u201cBecause the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that\u2019s a lie,\u201d he added. \u201cThat should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\u201d\n\nFederal probationary employees have typically been in their positions for one year, but some jobs have two-year probationary periods. The employees may be new to the federal workforce, but they also could have been recently promoted or shifted to a different agency.\n\nAlsup\u2019s ruling is one of the most significant yet in cases testing the administration\u2019s authority to quickly reduce the number of federal employees \u2013 a key priority that has been central to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe White House called the ruling \u201cabsurd and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cA single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch. The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2013 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President\u2019s agenda,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement posted on X by another White House aide.\n\n\u201cIf a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nA second federal judge ruled later Thursday, in a similar case brought in Maryland by Democratic state attorneys general, that probationary employees laid off en masse by the Trump administration must be temporarily reinstated. That judge\u2019s temporary restraining order, which will last two weeks, applies to 18 agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Agency for International Development.\n\n\u2018I tend to doubt that you\u2019re telling me the truth\u2019\n\nThe preliminary injunction came after Alsup unloaded on the Justice Department for not making the acting head of the Office of Personnel Management available to testify about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to fire scores of probationary employees.\n\nHe had ordered acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to testify during Thursday\u2019s hearing, where he would likely face tough questions from attorneys representing the labor unions that are challenging his agency\u2019s role in the firings.\n\nBut the Justice Department refused to make him available and instead withdrew a declaration Ezell submitted last month that had served as the government\u2019s only evidence in the case.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to do so because you know cross-examination will reveal the truth,\u201d Alsup told DOJ attorney Kelsey Helland. \u201cI tend to doubt that you\u2019re telling me the truth.\u201d\n\nAlsup told the DOJ attorney Thursday: \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018here\u2019s a declaration, you have to accept it without question\u2019 when there is a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not helping me get at the truth. You\u2019re giving me press releases \u2013 sham documents,\u201d the judge said, referring to documents submitted by the DOJ to the court that they say shows how the agencies were making the termination decisions themselves.\n\nThe declaration from Ezell said that OPM did not \u201cdirect\u201d other agencies to terminate probationary employees \u2014 the central issue in the case brought by labor unions and others.\n\nHelland pushed back strongly on the judge\u2019s assertion, and argued during the hearing that the agency heads had sought to cull their workforce on their own, not at the direction of OPM.\n\n\u201cI respectfully disagree that we have submitted false evidence,\u201d he said at one point, adding later: \u201cDecisions on these employment actions were made by these agencies and were fully endorsed by their political leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has been targeting probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While they generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can if the action stemmed from \u201cpartisan political reasons\u201d or \u201cmarriage status.\u201d Also, they are protected from prohibited personnel practices.\n\nPart of Thursday\u2019s hearing concerned whether the employees at issue in the case have the option of appealing their firing to the MSPB, something Alsup had initially understood was possible. But the judge said he wanted the parties to submit more written legal arguments on the issue before he decides how to factor it into his ruling.\n\nOne former probationary employee who was fired last month from the IRS, an agency within the Treasury Department, told CNN that he and his colleagues were thrilled with the ruling.\n\n\u201cEveryone on the group chat is celebrating,\u201d the former IRS employee said, referring to a text chat where his former colleagues have been consoling each other in recent weeks.\n\nCNN\u2019s Tami Luhby, Tierney Sneed, Samantha Waldenberg and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the title of acting OPM Director Charles Ezell.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda has once again called on the U.S. to place nuclear weapons within its borders in a show of deterrence to Russia\u2019s continued aggression just over the border in Ukraine.\n\nA similar request was apparently made to the Biden administration in 2022, which was never agreed to, but Duda has not given up on the idea. This time he addressed his appeal to the Trump administration during an interview with the Financial Times that was published Thursday.\n\n\"Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,\" Duda told the Financial Times in reference to actions Russia took beginning in 2023, a year after it invaded Ukraine. \"They didn't ask anyone's permission.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about where President Donald Trump stands when it comes to this form of deterrence.\n\nPOLISH GOVERNMENT PLANS MANDATORY MILITARY TRAINING FOR ADULT MEN\n\nThe Trump administration this week took steps to try and bring about an end to the war in Ukraine, which has been raging for more than three years following Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion.\n\nWhile Ukraine has agreed to the U.S.\u2019s initial 30-day ceasefire contingent on Russia\u2019s acceptance of the terms, Moscow has not, and it is unlikely that the Trump administration would take steps to jeopardize those negotiations by agreeing to put U.S. nukes in Poland \u2013 which shares a border with Russia and could be viewed as a threat by the Kremlin.\n\nBut Duda\u2019s advisor on international affairs, Wojciech Kolarski, echoed the Polish president\u2019s plea and, in a Thursday interview with Poland\u2019s RMF FM radio, argued that as a NATO member who shares a border with Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region, as well as Ukraine and Belarus, the steps were important for Warsaw\u2019s security.\n\nNATO NATION POLAND SCRAMBLES AIR DEFENSES AS RUSSIA STRIKES WESTERN UKRAINE\n\nBut should the U.S. again refuse Poland\u2019s request, there is another nuclear-armed nation in the NATO alliance that may be willing to assist in \"nuclear sharing.\"\n\nAmid mounting concern in the European Union that the U.S. could withdraw forces from the bloc or become an unreliable defense partner in countering Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron opened discussions on a strategy that could help extend its nuclear deterrence to other EU nations.\n\nWhile the specifics of that strategy remain unclear, including whether France has proposed actually dispersing nuclear arms to other nations, Poland has reportedly been in talks with France about the issue.\n\nRussia has already called France\u2019s strategy to re-evaluate its extension of nuclear deterrence \"extremely confrontational.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite Moscow's objections, France\u2019s defense concept is far from new as the U.S. deterrence umbrella during the Cold War was intended to ensure NATO allies would be protected under America's nuclear power in case of a direct threat by another nuclear-armed nation, like Russia, China or North Korea.\n\nWhile France is the EU\u2019s only nuclear power, it has the third-largest nuclear stockpile when it comes to nuclear-armed nations in NATO, which also includes the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPete Buttigieg announced Thursday he will not run for Michigan\u2019s governorship or the state\u2019s open US Senate seat in 2026, setting up a potential presidential bid in 2028.\n\n\u201cI care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race. I remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values - and who understand that in this moment, leadership means not only opposing today\u2019s cruel chaos, but also presenting a vision of a better alternative,\u201d Buttigieg said in an X post.\n\nButtigieg called fellow Michigan Democrats on Thursday morning to tell them of his decision, which was first reported by Politico.\n\nA source familiar with Buttigieg\u2019s thinking said his decision sets him up in the strongest possible position to run for president in 2028. The source said running for governor or Senate in 2026 would have taken that option off the table.\n\nFollowing the retirement announcement by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters in late January, an adviser to Buttigieg told CNN he was taking a \u201cserious look\u201d at a Senate campaign.\n\nButtigieg said he \u201cthought seriously\u201d about running for the governorship \u2013 Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is also seen as a potential 2028 contender, is term-limited \u2013 as well as the Senate seat after being encouraged by leaders in Michigan and having conversations with family, friends and officials.\n\n\u201cI considered what I could bring to the race compared to other likely candidates, and what running and serving would mean compared to other ways I could make a difference in the years ahead,\u201d he wrote in a Substack post on his decision.\n\nThe former Biden transportation secretary described America as \u201cless free, less secure, less democratic \u2013 and less prosperous\u201d under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and that he will spend time in the coming months \u201cengaging both legacy and digital media in the service of a politics of everyday life, rooted in the values of freedom, security, and democracy. \u201c\n\n\u201cI will be engaging partners, allies, friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of American prosperity than either side has so far offered,\u201d Buttigieg wrote.\n\nThe decision has rattled some Michigan Democrats, who are increasingly anxious about holding onto a Senate seat in a state President Donald Trump won last November.\n\nSenate Democratic leaders and officials involved with their campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have been privately lobbying Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to run for the seat, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversations.\n\nIf Whitmer runs, top Democrats believe, she would be their strongest contender to hold the seat for the party. But Whitmer \u2014 who is considering a 2028 run for president \u2014 is uninterested, according to one of those people.\n\nOther Michigan Democrats, including former Sen. Debbie Stabenow, are now encouraging freshman Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet to run behind the scenes, according to two people familiar with those discussions. McDonald Rivet is \u201cactively considering\u201d a run, according to a person familiar with her thinking.\n\nThe first-term Democrat won a tough battleground seat Trump also carried. And they believe her mid-Michigan district, which is home to the birthplace of General Motors, represents the kinds of working-class voters that their Senate candidate would need to win in 2026.\n\nShe would not be the only House Democrat to consider a run. Behind the scenes, Rep. Haley Stevens is also preparing a possible bid if the party doesn\u2019t rally behind another candidate, according to the two people familiar.\n\nButtigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, mounted a presidential campaign in 2019 positioning himself as a moderate. He entered race as a relative unknown among nearly two-dozen Democrats running for the chance to take on Trump at the time.\n\nButtigieg broke barriers as the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president and raised more than $80 million during his 2020 run.\n\nWhile he had initial success in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign struggled to win over voters of color, a key base of the Democratic Party, which hurt his performance in Nevada and South Carolina, leading him to end his campaign shortly before Super Tuesday.\n\nFollowing his failed bid, Buttigieg vaulted into Cabinet work as transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden in a move that many Democrats saw as needed experience for another presidential run.\n\nDuring his tenure as mayor, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 as an intelligence officer.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report."

Rand Paul of Kentucky said he\u2019s worried about the effect of tariffs on his home state, saying \u201cNobody at home is coming up to me and saying please put tariffs on.\u201d\n\nAt some point, a Republican strategist warned, some lawmakers will \u201cstart going into full freakout mode.\u201d\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reject a government funding bill that the Republican-led House passed this week, leaving it uncertain whether Congress can avert a shutdown before tomorrow night\u2019s deadline.\n\nthat the Republican-led House passed this week, leaving it uncertain whether Congress can avert a shutdown before tomorrow night\u2019s deadline.

Zeldin announced the change yesterday in both a Wall Street Journal opinion piece and an EPA news release.\n\nThe rollback would apply to rules and regulations on emission standards for vehicles and pollution from power plants. The agency will also revisit rules such as water pollution limits for coal plants, air quality standards for small particles and the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by large emitters like oil and gas companies.\n\nZeldin also signaled the EPA would consider upending its own endangerment finding, which says greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the Earth and that presents a threat to public health and welfare.

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPolls often present a false choice: you either believe in God, or you don\u2019t. But belief is more complex.\n\nThe Jewish holiday of Purim, celebrated March 13-14, embodies this tension. It is considered holier than Yom Kippur, yet it\u2019s a story of survival where God is never mentioned, and no overt miracles occur.\n\nIt is based on the Book of Esther, found in the Jewish and Christian Bibles. Scholars say that Jesus celebrated it in the unnamed feast in John 5:1.\n\nAs a kid I didn\u2019t celebrate Halloween so Purim was the replacement. It\u2019s a holiday of reckless joy. You dress up, drink and party. It was a religious excuse for a Jewish version of Mardi Gras.\n\nJEWISH HOLIDAY OF PURIM MAY HAVE ECHOES IN AMERICAN HISTORY, SAYS NEW YORK RABBI\n\nBut beneath the revelry are layers of meaning. We read the Esther scroll, exchange food baskets and give charity. Many consider it holier than the fasting and prayer of Yom Kippur because it elevates the mundane \u2013 transforming eating and drinking into spiritual purpose. It also takes more effort to find meaning in the chaos of life than in the structure of ritual.\n\nBut if it\u2019s so holy, why is it based on a book in the Bible where God and the supernatural are left out? Imagine Easter without Jesus' resurrection, Passover without sea splitting, or erasing the miracle of Hanukkah\u2019s one day of oil lasting eight. What would be left? Isn\u2019t divine intervention \u2013 and God \u2013 the whole point of a religious holiday?\n\nSome suggest God\u2019s absence was to avoid Persian censorship of the book. Others see it as a deliberate shift from open divine intervention to showing how God\u2019s hidden presence shapes history. Or perhaps it\u2019s testing faith in uncertainty.\n\nThe Talmud teaches that the Torah\u2019s acceptance at Sinai was influenced by divine coercion. But on Purim, the Israelites reaffirmed their acceptance of the Torah willingly, without miracles or external pressure \u2013 choosing faith in the face of uncertainty. Purim shows a path where omitting an explicit God reference creates space for both believers and skeptics to find their own meaning.\n\nEsther, a Jewish orphan, conceals her identity and becomes queen (Esther 2:10, 2:17). Haman, the king\u2019s advisor, plots to annihilate the Jewish people (Esther 3:5-6). Mordecai, Esther\u2019s cousin, urges her to reveal her heritage (Esther 7:3-6). A single night of the king\u2019s insomnia sets off a chain reaction that flips the script (Esther 6:1). The king issues a new decree allowing the Jews to defend themselves, thereby thwarting Haman\u2019s plan (Esther 8:5-11).\n\nJEWISH PRO-ISRAEL ACTIVIST SAYS WARNINGS IN LEVITICUS A REMINDER THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL\n\nThe story unfolds like an improbable political thriller. Esther is in the right place at the right time. A forgotten orphan rises to power. What are the odds that one accident after another leads to a nation\u2019s survival?\n\nIf I believe in chance, it is a masterclass in luck, timing and human action. If I believe in God, it is proof that miracles don\u2019t need to break the laws of nature. They happen through people, politics, and the randomness of life that, in hindsight, is destiny.\n\nThere is a tradition of drinking to the point of not knowing the difference between \"cursed is Haman\" and \"blessed is Mordecai.\" This intoxication is to break down our perception of good and evil. The same people who play villains in one moment are instruments of salvation in another. The belief is that we are all just playing roles in a cosmic plan.\n\nYet, life often seems to defy a benevolent plan. As a child, I experienced the profound tragedy of my father\u2019s death. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades terror group murdered my Israeli cousin, Meir Tamari. Recently, my sister-in-law and niece died in a devastating water accident. A few months ago my dear friend from college took his life. These losses challenge the belief in a guided destiny and seem to highlight the randomness of suffering.\n\nMany scholars, of course, say the Purim story is folklore evolved from a Persian festival or an ancient Jewish tradition of reenacting survival stories. Its literary style feels too perfect, almost theatrical.\n\nTEN COMMANDMENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN FROM, NOT JUST SEE\n\nYet, whether it\u2019s history, allegory, or both, its message of seeking meaning in apparent randomness remains unchanged.\n\nAnd whether or not Purim \"happened,\" the story of Jewish survival in the face of relentless persecution itself seems miraculous. Mark Twain famously pondered the mystery of how empires have risen and fallen while the Jews have endured. When the 18th-century monarch, King Frederick the Great of Prussia, asked for proof of God, his doctor pointed to the continued existence of the Jews.\n\nI\u2019ve spent my life caught between two worlds: one of faith, where God controls history, and the world of reason, where things just happen and we make sense of them later. Most of the time, I feel like I have to choose. Purim won\u2019t let me.\n\nUltimately, faith and doubt aren\u2019t enemies. They are the same search for meaning. As Rabbi Jonathan Sachs said, faith is \"the courage to live with uncertainty.\"\n\nAnd Purim meets me exactly where I am \u2013 caught between belief and questioning, certainty and wonder.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe world today feels like Purim. I wonder if history is just chaos, if the bad guys win and the rest of us are just trying to survive. But then I think about Mordecai, who refused to bow when everyone else did. I think about Esther, who spoke up when she had every reason to stay silent.\n\nThey didn\u2019t know if God was with them. They acted anyway. That\u2019s what Purim teaches me.\n\nYou don\u2019t wait for miracles. You don\u2019t wait for certainty. You act.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPurim reminds you that you don\u2019t have to have all the answers. It\u2019s enough to just ask questions. Because whether or not we believe in miracles, we still have to decide how we\u2019re going to act.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s the only miracle we ever really need. And maybe that\u2019s also why Purim is holier than Yom Kippur."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn late January, Erik Prince, a long-time ally of President Donald Trump and a notorious private security contractor, gathered a meeting of executives in Washington, DC, to discuss ways their own private security firms might help the new administration deport millions of undocumented migrants.\n\nOne proposal in particular caught Prince\u2019s attention: the idea of sending migrants with criminal records for detention in another country as they awaited transit to their countries of origin.\n\nIn the months leading up to Trump\u2019s victory in November, Prince had struck up a working relationship with El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, which not everyone at the meeting knew. Trump officials had also been having separate conversations with Bukele about accepting undocumented migrants from the US.\n\nPrince eventually excused himself from the group, telling those gathered that he planned to pitch the detention idea directly to Bukele.\n\nThe next week, Bukele stood beside Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the presidential residence in San Salvador for a major announcement:\n\nNot only would El Salvador accept and jail potentially hundreds of thousands of violent undocumented immigrants currently in the US, it would also take in \u201cdangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those of US citizenship and legal residents.\u201d\n\nThe offer was as remarkable as it was legally tenuous \u2013 with a world leader publicly discussing detaining US citizens on foreign soil.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, right, meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele at his residence at Lake Coatepeque in El Congo municipality, El Salvador, on February 3. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe State Department has said little since about what elements of the deal \u2013 if any \u2013 might be utilized. But the episode, including Prince\u2019s direct line to Bukele, reported here for the first time, demonstrates how a former pariah of Washington has newly established himself back inside Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen current and former administration officials and people close to Prince suggest that he has gained traction within the second Trump administration and is moving quickly to leverage his influence in pursuit of long-held policy beliefs, some of which could turn into big business for him.\n\nPrince was effectively expelled at the end of the first Trump administration, banned from inside the Pentagon and CIA by officials who felt his ideas for using mercenary forces around the world brought unwanted scrutiny and pushed the boundaries of legality in his bid to win government contracts, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe United Nations went on to investigate Prince over his foreign dealings, including alleged arms trafficking violations as part of a failed mercenary operation in Libya. (Prince has denied he\u2019s ever been involved in operations in Libya at any time.)\n\nBut with Trump back in office that scrutiny appears to have abated as Prince has maneuvered his way back to a position of influence.\n\nPrince has been seen repeatedly at the Pentagon for the first time since his unofficial excommunication from the building in 2020, and is angling to join two key Defense advisory boards , according to two sources familiar with the matter. That could potentially put him in regular contact with senior Pentagon officials.\n\nPrince also participates in group text chats that include senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security, State Department and the White House National Security Council, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe State Department did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nMilitary contractors as a catch-all solution\n\nPrince first gained notoriety during the Iraq War when his private contracting firm Blackwater provoked international outrage after a deadly 2007 shooting that killed Iraqi civilians.\n\nIn this October 2007 photo, Erik Prince holds up a picture showing the affect of a car bomb while testifying during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nBlackwater lost a $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company\u2019s operating license.\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s 2024 election win, Prince was quietly pitching controversial, yet familiar, ideas for executing what are now some of Trump\u2019s most challenging foreign policy directives, according to two people familiar with his thinking.\n\nPrince\u2019s latest proposals center around using his network of private contractors, including former US special forces operators, as a catch-all solution for a variety of potential Trump initiatives \u2013 from deportations to conducting operations against designated terror groups abroad, to helping secure valuable mineral deposits buried beneath foreign soil.\n\nOne 26-page proposal reviewed by CNN calls for deputizing private security contractors to swiftly deport undocumented immigrants. The proposal suggests hiring retired ICE and CBP officers, as well as retired state and local law enforcement and properly trained veterans to arrest people.\n\n\u201cEvery crisis, he finds a way to poke his nose in,\u201d said one person familiar with Prince\u2019s recent lobbying.\n\n\u201cHe is constantly presenting plans to fix national security issues with his company,\u201d another source familiar with Prince\u2019s efforts told CNN.\n\nDeported migrants queue to receive an essential items bag during the arrival of a group of deported Salvadorans at Gerencia de Atenci\u00f3n al Migrante (GAMI) on February 12, in San Salvador, El Salvador. Alex Pe\u00f1a/Getty Images\n\nPrince has recently floated a proposal to senior Trump officials to use private military contractors to help carry out operations against Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to three sources familiar with the matter. While the details of the Yemen proposal remain unclear, sources described it as an adaptation of his previous plans for using private contractors in hotspots like Afghanistan and Somalia.\n\n\u201cHe has presented the plan numerous times but it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere,\u201d one of the sources said, adding that Prince has repeatedly pitched the plan to several senior officials at the National Security Council and others in Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nAsked by CNN if he wanted to discuss his recent proposals, Prince responded: \u201cNo thank you.\u201d\n\nPrince also appears to be getting involved in Ecuador\u2019s security crackdown. President Daniel Noboa revealed in a March 11 post on Instagram that he met with the Blackwater founder to form a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d against narcoterrorism and illegal fishing. A day earlier, Noboa had announced the imminent arrival of \u201cspecial forces from abroad\u201d to tackle crime in Ecuador\u2019s most violent areas, though he did not specify their origins.\n\nThe move signals a growing role for Prince\u2019s private security firm in the country\u2019s fight against organized crime. CNN has reached out to Noboa\u2019s office for more details.\n\nBack in the US, some former officials wince at the potential of Prince being newly empowered and pitching private security contractors as a way to achieve Trump\u2019s goal of mass deportations.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just bad policy \u2013 it\u2019s a dangerous, un-American escalation,\u201d said Jason P. Houser, former ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. \u201cMass deportation plans handed to for-profit mercenaries with a record of failure and abuse abroad will devastate our communities.\u201d\n\nBackchannels to allies\n\nPrince\u2019s contact with top US officials remains largely limited to private channels and he has not yet secured a formal meeting at the White House to discuss his immigration and Yemen plans, the source added.\n\nThe Trump White House appears to be keeping Prince at arms-length, at least for now. But his activity has started to bubble into view. After Politico in February reported on Prince\u2019s proposal to use private security contractors to arrest undocumented immigrants, Trump was asked specifically about it. While he told reporters he hadn\u2019t seen the proposal, he said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be opposed.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with NewsNation last month, Prince rejected that the proposal was for a \u201cprivate army,\u201d saying: \u201cIt was a memo generated to describe how to achieve the logistics necessary to move the millions of people that they intend to deport.\u201d\n\nPrince\u2019s efforts have been encouraged by a network of close Trump allies who were, in many cases, pushed to the periphery by more establishment Republican figures in the first term \u2013 but have become critical insiders in the opening weeks of the second.\n\nSome current and former officials have quietly provided Prince their input on some of his recent proposals before he formally presents it to the White House, according to two sources briefed on the matter.\n\nAmong Prince\u2019s closest allies, sources said, are Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Prince served as a character witness for Gabbard, who spent weeks as one of the administration\u2019s more controversial cabinet nominees based on concerns from some Republican senators about her qualifications.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House on February 26, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nGabbard was confirmed last month \u2013 and is now running the same intelligence agencies that tend to consider Prince to be \u201cradioactive,\u201d in the words of one senior official, who pointed to \u201cbaggage from his time running Blackwater and conflicts of interest later.\u201d\n\n\u2018The surfing is fantastic\u2019\n\nPrince\u2019s lobbying effort intensified after Trump\u2019s win in November. In the lead-up to the January 20 inauguration, Prince sought to reestablish himself in the president\u2019s orbit, reaching out to allies helping with the transition process to float various plans for using private contractors, sources said.\n\nPrince also made multiple trips to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort during this period \u2013 joining the MAGA faithful and others seeking influence in the new administration as they paid homage to the incoming president.\n\nSources say that Prince has set his sights on becoming a sort of shadow adviser for the new administration, particularly when it comes to overhauling the US immigration system.\n\nPrince has told associates that his interest in Bukele was first sparked almost exactly one year ago at the conservative CPAC annual conference held just outside of Washington, DC, two of those associates told CNN.\n\nPrince, a member of CPAC\u2019s board, was backstage when Bukele\u2019s motorcade arrived for his scheduled speaking slot. Prince recounted how he was struck by the response of the kitchen workers and convention staff who greeted Bukele\u2019s arrival with cheers and homemade signs.\n\nThe 23-minute speech Bukele proceeded to deliver when he took the stage deftly wove together the story of his own political rise and declaration of war on his country\u2019s gangs.\n\nPresident of El Salvador Nayib Bukel greets attendees after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at Gaylord National Resort Hotel And Convention Center on February 22, 2024 in National Harbor, Maryland. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nThe crowd of conservative activists and headliners responded with a standing ovation.\n\nSix months later, Prince was in El Salvador, touring the country\u2019s notorious mega prison CECOT, which has served as the well-publicized linchpin of Bukele\u2019s frontal assault on the violent gang culture that had ravaged the country in the years preceding his first election victory.\n\nPrince told associates that he was struck by an inmate population that he viewed as \u201cdocile\u201d and totally under control of the guards despite their violent histories.\n\nThe next day, Prince met for the first time with Bukele.\n\nHe told Bukele he\u2019d seen his speech at CPAC, which he said, \u201cwas fantastic,\u201d according to a video of their meeting shared with CNN.\n\nPrince went on to say he was \u201cvery impressed\u201d by what he saw at CECOT and promised to \u201cproudly go back and tell the good news story\u201d he believed the prison represented when he returned to the US.\n\nThe idea that El Salvador could utilize an expanded version of its prison model to take on criminal undocumented immigrants from the US at a fraction of the cost of housing them at US facilities \u201cmade a lot of sense,\u201d Prince would later share with associates, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAsked about his relationship with Prince, a person familiar with Bukele\u2019s international dealings told CNN, \u201cPresident Bukele is incredibly strategic in his business and diplomatic dealings. He wouldn\u2019t enter a deal with someone like Prince if he believed it\u2019d lead to a divide between El Salvador and the United States. This is something he\u2019d thoroughly vet before moving forward with any private contracting agreements.\u201d\n\nPrince also shared his appreciation for another part of El Salvador\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe surfing is fantastic,\u201d Prince would later say during an episode of his podcast, \u201cOff Leash.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a fantastic surfing culture on the pacific coast \u2013 very cheap, good food and some really cool surfing resorts.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s David Culver contributed to this report."

We're not having electricity outages. We're not having lines of gas stations.\"\n\nThe U.S. was breaking records for the most fossil fuels ever drilled under Trump's predecessor. In 2023, the Biden administration produced 12.9 million barrels per day, breaking the record set in 2019 at 12.3 million barrels, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For the last several years, the U.S. has been the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\n\n\"There's no crisis or emergency by any conventional standard or use of the word,\" Noah Kaufman, a senior researcher at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told ABC News.\n\nThe Par Montana refinery along the Yellowstone River that processes crude oil from western Canada is seen, Feb. 26, 2025, just outside Billings, Mont.

The U.S. may be the largest exporter of natural gas in the world, but global demand is falling -- with countries in Europe and Asia decreasing their use of fossil fuels as renewables such as wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles, eat away at the demand for fossil fuels, Nemet said.\n\n\"It's cheaper and more energy secure for them to use renewable power,\" Howarth said.\n\nTrump's attempts to bring oil and gas back to the forefront will set the U.S. behind compared to other G2 countries and their climate goals. the experts said.

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s most important moves among the many important moves that he has made in his first two months in office are those that restored the hard line he had taken towards China in his first term, a very firm line that has quickly been put back in its place of defining priority for our foreign policy and national security. Trump began with his support at the Pentagon and in Congress for defense spending re-focused for the Indo-Pacific region and with tariffs on imports from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n\n\nThe tariff arguments with Mexico, Canada and the European Union can be resolved over the negotiating table. But not so the competition between the superpowers. That competition will hopefully never become an armed conflict, but it would almost certainly have become one if American indifference to the ambitions of the PRC continued.\n\n\n\nThe United States finally began to develop a strategy for containing China\u2019s global ambitions in the first Trump term. All of that effort was wasted by a disastrous four years of a leaderless country during the regency years of Joe Biden\u2019s infirmity.\n\nCHINA, REACTING TO TRUMP TARIFFS, PROMISES TO \u2018FIGHT TILL THE END\u2019 IN TRADE WAR \u2018OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF WAR\u2019\n\n\n\nNow the second part of the first American counter-China strategy is rolling out and it begins with our massive investment in our sea services and our on-shoring of the critical production lines abandoned to our adversary over four decades. President Trump speaks very softly and respectfully about General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping. That is the correct tone for superpower diplomacy. But Trump\u2019s respect for the Chinese dictator\u2019s power is as certain as is his resolve to counter it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all fell for the open secret that Deng Xiaoping proclaimed as China\u2019s key principle during his long run as the PRC\u2019s leader: \"Hide your strength, bide your time.\" Quietly, consistently, China built its economic strength and then its military strength. America\u2019s China lobby helped the process of China\u2019s astonishing growth until Trump arrived on the scene.\n\n\n\nNo documentary source has ever been found for the saying, often attributed to Vladimir Lenin, that \"the Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them,\" but it served nicely as an explanation for the early decades of the Soviet Union\u2019s growth and it most certainly applies to America\u2019s China policy after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R.\n\n\n\nNot now. Never again for the foreseeable future in all likelihood. In early February Trump put a 10% tariff in place against goods from China and China quickly issued retaliatory tariffs. In early March, Trump upped the U.S.\u2019s tariff on China by 25%. More retaliation from China followed.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t expect this confrontation to be toned down or delayed. America has one peer competitor on the world stage across all domains and it is China, and China\u2019s hostility to us and our allies is open and ongoing. The espionage effort against us is vast and has gone mostly unchecked during the Biden years of fog and mumbling. The FBI under Trump raided and shut down the PRC\u2019s Houston consulate. The FBI under Biden raided Mar-a-Lago. Trump is back and new FBI Director Kash Patel will hopefully not disappoint when it comes to CCP espionage.\n\n\n\nThere is talk of summits between Trump and Xi. Fine. Richard Nixon met with both Leonid Brezhnev and Mao. Summits can keep the crises away, conflict below the kinetic level. Both China and Russia have vast nuclear arsenals and emerging new technologies, though not as large or as lethal as ours. It\u2019s good to keep everyone focused on that basic fact set and to not lose sight of our need to keep our guard up there.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nAnd Trump is not a chump of course. He\u2019d rather the competition with China be contained and controlled but he won\u2019t be rolled and he won\u2019t be sold word salad at a summit or three. Trump leaves the table when there is no deal to be had and there is no significant deal to be had with the Chinese Communist Party, which has gone hard-line for the dozen years of Xi\u2019s increasingly iron-fisted rule. Trump has never not seen Xi clearly for who he is or how tough an adversary he has become.\n\n\n\nAdmiral Mark Montgomery (USN, Ret.) talked at some length with me this week about the outline of the long-term strategy for dealing with China. Watch that discussion here.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhat the admiral pointed out to me is that I had seen, but not understood the significance of the visit of the president of Taiwan Semiconductor to the White House. When President Trump shook hands with C.C. Wei, chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington on March 3, that was the signal through all the noise. Along with the China tariffs, along with Trump\u2019s emphasis on the Navy, Marine Corps and shipbuilding, here was a deft delivery of some diplomacy.\n\nThe number one bestseller on the New York Times non-fiction list a week back was Senator Tom Cotton\u2019s new \"Seven Things You Can\u2019t Say About China.\" The senator from Arkansas is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the third ranking member of the GOP conference. He doesn\u2019t speak for the president, of course, but Cotton does speak with Trump. They get along. That\u2019s a very good thing, for if even half of Trump\u2019s and Cotton\u2019s shared, clear-eyed understanding of China spreads throughout Team Trump, the country will be prepared for Trump\u2019s most important fight among many important fights, one that will have to be carried consistently forward for decades.\n\nHugh Hewitt is host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

            "full_content": "Jen Psaki speaks with senior producer Will Rabbe at MSNBC. Photo: Alyssa Schukar/Redux\n\nIf you were to start a media organization in 2025, probably the last thing it would be is a cable-news network. Younger audiences are fleeing television, making cable news a decidedly geriatric business. Earlier this year, CNN said it would eliminate about 200 jobs in its traditional TV operations while adding around the same number for digital positions. And yet building a cable-news channel from the ground up is basically what MSNBC is about to do.\n\nWhen it was announced this past November that Comcast would be spinning off MSNBC \u2014 along with CNBC, E!, and other cable channels \u2014 from NBCUniversal, questions abounded about what the decision would mean for the progressive network. While MSNBC is best known for brainy talking heads like Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes, for nearly three decades it has relied on NBC News for the newsgathering and verification that undergird a lot of its programming. Under SpinCo, the unfortunate provisional name for the new company, would MSNBC just become a pure opinion play? Was MSNBC being set free or cut loose?\n\nMSNBC\u2019s new president, Rebecca Kutler, seemed to answer that question last week when she announced that MSNBC would be building out an independent reporting operation, led by veteran executive Scott Matthews. The network will be hiring more than 100 journalists \u2014 from field producers to correspondents to photographers \u2014 to work across the operation, which will include a bureau in Washington (for which it\u2019s looking for a bureau chief) and a newsroom in New York.\n\nWhat MSNBC is doing is a bright spot for the news industry right now. It\u2019s also an unprecedented experiment in real time in making a cable-news operation that works. \u201cIf you stripped all of these institutions from the systems that created them and remade them in contemporary times, you would do a lot of shit differently. And that\u2019s sort of what SpinCo gets to do,\u201d one senior news executive said. \u201cYes, the economics look different. But they\u2019re not assigned the same rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually think building a news organization from scratch is a really fun idea in this day and age, because, first of all, there\u2019re a lot of good people available, and you can craft a pretty good news organization for a pretty reasonable amount of money,\u201d said former CNN president and NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Zucker. MSNBC is \u201cgoing to actually be building and growing and unencumbered by having to worry about what NBC News thinks about it.\u201d\n\nOthers are more skeptical. \u201cIf it has 100 journalists, that\u2019ll be more than it\u2019s ever had there,\u201d said one longtime news executive. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different animal, and that\u2019s not what it\u2019s built to do.\u201d\n\nThe end product won\u2019t actually look a whole lot different from how it looks today: MSNBC will still be doing a lot of resistance bait, in the mornings, at night, and on weekends. Still, the enterprise journalism it commissions will drive shows throughout the day, offering plenty of opportunities for an openly progressive network to blanket stories that Fox News won\u2019t touch or CNN may be wary of owning, such as the ongoing detention of activist Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nThis is the first time that MSNBC, backed by a $7 billion corporate parent, gets to build something bespoke to its audience. As a prominent talent agent put it: \u201cWithout the pressures of shareholders, stock prices, or external investments, the challenge now is about threading the needle: How does it balance investment in television, where it still makes the majority of its money, while knowing it\u2019s a declining asset, against strategic investments in other growth opportunities?\u201d\n\nLaunching the news operation is the biggest development for MSNBC so far under Kutler, who after more than two decades at CNN joined the network as senior vice-president of content strategy in 2022 and became head of MSNBC in February. \u201cRebecca was tied into most talent decisions at CNN,\u201d another talent executive noted. \u201cShe worked closely with Jeff and cultivated a ton of relationships \u2014 with talent, with contributors, with producers. And a lot of people want to work for her.\u201d\n\nNot least because of her no-bullshit approach to the job \u2014 in her first major change as president, Kutler last month announced an overhaul to MSNBC\u2019s lineup that included canceling Joy Reid\u2019s 7 p.m. show. While Reid has complained that her show \u201chad value\u201d and implied that it was canceled for her outspoken positions on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement, it has often been MSNBC\u2019s lowest-rated show in prime time. Reid will be replaced by a panel hosted by Symone D. Sanders Townsend, Michael Steele, and Alicia Menendez, while Jen Psaki, one of MSNBC\u2019s biggest stars, will take Alex Wagner\u2019s place as host of the 9 p.m. slot. (Wagner will remain with the network as a contributor.) Kutler has also brought on Eugene Daniels (currently a White House correspondent for Politico) and Jacqueline Alemany (currently a White House reporter at the Washington Post), who will co-host a weekend show alongside Jonathan Capehart, and Catherine Rampell (also from the Post), who will join Ayman Mohyeldin in the evenings on the weekend. In addition to the 100-plus journalists the network is hiring for the new newsgathering operation, MSNBC internally posted 100 jobs related to programming when it made the lineup changes a few weeks ago.\n\nFor all the talk of TV\u2019s long-term decline, there\u2019s still money to be made. \u201cWe live in a much more digital era when individual brands and people are enjoying all kinds of success on both sides of the aisle,\u201d one longtime TV executive acknowledged. \u201cHaving said that, Fox News has enjoyed a complete renaissance since the election, and frankly MSNBC still has huge audiences even if they are principally over the age of 65,\u201d they said. \u201cThese are still, even in their diminished state, very profitable businesses.\u201d\n\nAnd MSNBC could grow more profitable still, at least in the short to medium term, thanks to a bottomless desire for anti-Trump content that has lifted up podcasts and Substacks alike. Following a dip after the election, MSNBC has seen growth since Trump\u2019s inauguration. From January 20 to March 7, the channel averaged 1.4 million viewers in weekday prime time, compared to 739,000 viewers for the immediate post-election period, a 95 percent increase. Across the whole day, there was a 44 percent increase in viewership. Even Morning Joe has bounced back after a calamitous overture to Trump shortly after the election, with Joe and Mika hammering the president daily. As a senior news executive put it, \u201cThe audience wants to hear every day that this is not normal; this is not acceptable. And if you lose the thread, you lose credibility. And that\u2019s the whole fuckin\u2019 game.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also plenty of room to diversify. MSNBC is looking closely at starting a streaming service (you can find it on Peacock at the moment) as well as growing its audio and live-events businesses. Digital is also, obviously, a priority, and MSNBC has a strong presence on YouTube, seeing 325 million viewers in February and finishing 2024 as the No. 1 news brand on all of YouTube, per an MSNBC spokesperson.\n\nMSNBC is also looking at partnering with political brands and voices who have built-in audiences, I\u2019m told. There\u2019s no shortage of left-leaning content creators who might fit the bill, such as The Bulwark\u2019s Tim Miller (an MSNBC contributor) and the folks at MeidasTouch. Whether such creators have incentive to cater to TV is a different matter. \u201cWhy would any YouTuber want to go to MSNBC?\u201d one longtime news executive noted. \u201cIt\u2019s a smaller audience for them.\u201d"

They\u2019re in charge. They\u2019re running the whole thing. This is on them. And there\u2019s going to be a lot of finger-pointing back and forth.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nTim Walz is headed back out on the road \u2013 this time, for a tour of House districts represented by Republicans who have stopped holding in-person town halls amid the raucous receptions some of their colleagues have gotten across the country.\n\nThe Minnesota governor and 2024 vice presidential candidate will start on Friday in Iowa, in the district represented by Rep. Zach Nunn, then head across the border to Nebraska, for the district represented by Rep. Don Bacon \u2013 both of whom won tight races for re-election last year. Walz\u2019s team is already planning stops in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ohio for the coming weeks, with more stops expected to be added.\n\nGiven his national profile after his time on the Democratic ticket last year, Walz said he felt obligated to step up.\n\n\u201cThere was just a primal scream of folks recognizing what\u2019s going on with the Trump administration, their authoritarian tendencies, and what they viewed was a lack of a proper response from their representatives,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cIt was about these Republican representatives recognizing this stuff\u2019s really unpopular, so they\u2019re going to quit the town halls. These folks need to be heard. They need to be heard, and to be candid with you, Democratic leadership needs to hear them.\u201d\n\nWalz\u2019s plans started with a post last week on X, responding to House Republican leaders who advised their colleagues to stop holding town halls. Republicans have accused those town halls of being packed with paid activists \u2013 though those making such accusations haven\u2019t provided any evidence or explanations of why Democratic members\u2019 town halls have also been packed.\n\nWalz said he\u2019d been overwhelmed by the response to that tweet, and his staff has been sifting through what an aide told CNN was hundreds of invitations from local party leaders and candidates asking him to come. He said he found that response reassuring after he and Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\n\u201cI always feared that they would become apathetic after this last election and just check out, but they are not doing that,\u201d Walz said.\n\nOther than independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has taken two swings of his own through the Midwest in the past month, no major Democratic leaders have been stepping forward with similar kinds of public events. Walz chalked that up in part to his party \u201ctrying to find our feet,\u201d but the situation clearly frustrates him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d he said, referencing the Trump administration\u2019s moves to dismantle the Department of Education as a prime example. \u201cI\u2019m going to say ways that they can mobilize to fight back, ways that I think are the most effective ways. And I fully expect them to tell me ways that they\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nAs the Tea Party rose through a different set of town hall protests in the 2010 election cycle, Walz was a congressman in a tight district running for a third term. He won, but that experience was a rough one, he said, and he warned Republicans now to ignore what\u2019s happening at their own peril.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a catalyst to provide them a megaphone to lift up their voice. And I think that\u2019s what people are looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand now my responsibility. I have a little more of a national voice, so I should bring it to them, and I\u2019m going to basically be handing the megaphone to them.\u201d\n\nBut he said when Democrats are \u201cjust being a foil to Trump, we are not crossing into that space we need to, to have them believe us, to know what we stand for.\u201d\n\nAfter going deliberately quiet in the months after the campaign \u2013 following a largely low-profile role as running mate that sources say was designed by the Harris campaign leadership \u2013 Walz has been stepping out more in recent weeks.\n\nMany expect Walz to run for a third term as governor next year, and he downplayed the suggestion that this effort was laying the groundwork for a future national run.\n\n\u201cI will do anything possible to make sure that we win in \u201828. I do not need to be on that ticket,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s not my pursuit here. My pursuit is that I am still in a position where I have a platform and I have some power to make a difference, and if 20 people show up that\u2019s good by me because those 20 people are making a difference. This isn\u2019t about drawing a crowd. I\u2019ll go to states where it wouldn\u2019t matter, but it matters to those people. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d"

We have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA.\"\n\nTrump has criticized South Africa over a land expropriation law that allows the government to make land seizures without compensation. In February, Trump issued an executive order penalizing South Africa.\n\n\"In shocking disregard of its citizens' rights, the Republic of South Africa recently enacted Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, to enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation,\" the order states.\n\nTRUMP FREEZES AID TO SOUTH AFRICA, PROMOTES RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES FACING RACE DISCRIMINATION\n\n\"It is the policy of the United States that, as long as South Africa continues these unjust and immoral practices that harm our Nation: (a) the United States shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa; and (b) the United States shall promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.\"\n\nThe order also took aim at South Africa's position against Israel, which it has accused in the International Court of Justice of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, as well as reinvigorating its relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.\n\n\"The United States cannot support the government of South Africa's commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy, which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests,\" the order said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe South African government has claimed Whites of all backgrounds, not just Afrikaners, still own approximately 70% of South Africa\u2019s land. The government is on record saying the Expropriation Act will only be used to take land needed for public purposes \u2014 such as for a new school \u2014 from people of any color when the owner refuses to sell, and even then there would be \"fair and equitable compensation.\""

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President JD Vance acknowledged Friday that Elon Musk has made \u201cmistakes\u201d while executing mass firings of federal employees and emphasized that he believes there are \u201ca lot of good people who work in the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cElon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I\u2019m accepting of mistakes,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News.\n\n\u201cI also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes. But I\u2019m also very aware of the fact that there are a lot of good people who work in the government \u2014 a lot of people who are doing a very good job. And we want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible, while eliminating what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s gentler tone represented a contrast from the chainsaw approach that Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has taken as he leads President Donald Trump\u2019s initiative to slash federal spending and reorient the federal bureaucracy. The firings of thousands of government employees has been the centerpiece of Musk\u2019s work over the first seven weeks of Trump\u2019s second White House administration, with the cuts yielding lawsuits and pushback from judges. Musk has broadly characterized federal workers as \"fraudsters\" who can\u2019t be trusted to do their jobs.\n\n\u201cI think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job,\u201d Vance said when asked about such comments from Musk. \u201cNow, how many people is that? I don\u2019t know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it\u2019s a few thousand or much larger than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people\u2019s business,\" he added. \"That doesn\u2019t distract or detract from the fact that you do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work. But I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don\u2019t want the person who doesn\u2019t show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s comments came during an exclusive and wide-ranging interview aboard Air Force Two, as the vice president and second lady Usha Vance returned from a visit to a plastics factory in Bay City, Michigan. His motorcade\u2019s ride into town illustrated how different life is now for him and his young family.\n\nDozens of protesters had lined the street leading to the factory, greeting Vance and his traveling party with middle fingers and vulgar signs, one of which featured a crossed-out swastika and read \u201cGo home, scumbag.\u201d The previous night, Vance was booed while arriving for a performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington. And while walking with his 3-year-old daughter near their home in Ohio last weekend, Vance found himself in a civil but, in his description, upsetting conversation with pro-Ukraine demonstrators.\n\n\u201cThe thing at the Kennedy Center I thought was funny,\u201d Vance said aboard his plane Friday afternoon. \u201cThe thing by my house I thought was kind of annoying. I think you just kind of take the good with the bad. \u2026 I kind of just see it as, depending on your perspective, a feature or a bug of this new life.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks at the factory, where he was welcomed by a friendlier, pro-Trump audience filled with local Republicans, Vance touted the administration\u2019s commitment to manufacturing and economic recovery while tempering expectations for the rapid turnaround that Trump promised on the campaign trail.\n\nA majority of respondents in two polls released this week \u2014 56% of adults surveyed by CNN, 54% of registered voters surveyed by Quinnipiac University \u2014 said they disapproved of how Trump is handling the economy. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s push for tariffs on foreign products has ignited fears of a trade war that could raise consumer prices.\n\n\u201cNow I have to be honest with you,\u201d Vance said in Bay City. \u201cThe road ahead of us is long, but we are already, in just seven short weeks, starting to see early indications of the president\u2019s vision becoming our shared American reality.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Vance frequently spoke of a woman he had met who said that she and her husband could no longer afford their weekly tradition of grilling steaks on Friday nights. Reminded of that story aboard his plane Friday, Vance described recent lower gas prices as a positive sign.\n\nVance also acknowledged that \u201cyou already see things leveling off to, not an ideal situation, but a much better and more significant improvement\u201d while casting blame on former President Joe Biden, whose policies he said had left Trump in a hole.\n\n\u201cMy ambition is that we see some pretty quick results, that you start to see at least a pathway towards financial stability,\u201d said Vance, specifically noting 10,000 manufacturing jobs added last month. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see progress. I think it\u2019s going to be incremental progress. But I also think it\u2019s important to be honest with people that you don\u2019t get to $2 trillion deficits overnight. You\u2019re not going to get out of $2 trillion deficits overnight.\u201d\n\nVance also discussed his early role in shaping and articulating Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda, from a provocative speech at last month\u2019s Munich Security Conference to an extraordinary Oval Office clash two weeks ago with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Vance had accused of being insufficiently thankful for U.S. aid.\n\n\u201cI just try not to be overly scripted,\u201d Vance said before recalling his speech in Munich, which upbraided European leaders over issues such as free speech and mass migration. \u201cThe classic thing to do in Munich would have been to show up and give a speech about NATO or give a speech about where the Ukraine-Russia thing was at that moment in time, and just sort of thought to myself, like, 'What is it that I think is really important to say?' And the president was OK with me saying it, so I said it.\u201d\n\nVance added that he doesn\u2019t \u201cgo into these things trying to be like a spokesman for the administration. Some of that happens naturally, but fundamentally, the president is the spokesman for the administration, and everything flows from there. I try to do a good job. I try to say things both that I think are true but also are in accordance with the president\u2019s preferences. And let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is constitutionally barred from serving another term, raised eyebrows in a Fox News interview last month by saying it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to anoint Vance as his successor in 2028. Vance and others close to Trump have since brushed off the question and Trump\u2019s answer to it, agreeing that such talk was premature.\n\nAsked a variation of the question Friday \u2014 does he view himself as Trump\u2019s successor? \u2014 Vance replied that he\u2019s not thinking about a presidential campaign at the moment. He related the story of how he felt on Election Night, when, surrounded by his closest friends and family, it became clear he had won the vice presidency.\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m the vice president-elect of the United States,\u201d Vance recalled thinking. \u201cAnd, you know, if I never go further in politics, I\u2019m totally fine with that, but we get a really good opportunity to do a lot of really good s--- the next four years.\"\n\n\u201cIf I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself. \u2026 Now, like, yeah, in two and a half years, will that become harder? Will people be more focused on politics than on what the White House is maybe doing that particular day? Maybe,\" he added.\n\n\u201cI mean, man, if I was like a central figure to getting the Russia-Ukraine crisis solved, who gives a s--- what I do after this?\" Vance said. \"That\u2019s kind of the attitude I take. So I\u2019m very focused on doing a good job.\u201d"

All of them combined.\"\n\nHe blamed President Joe Biden\u2019s open border policies, the cartels and countries such as Mexico, Canada and China for allowing the fentanyl problem to become so widespread.\n\nTRUMP PLEDGES TO MAKE US CAPITAL 'CRIME-FREE' AND THE \u2018TALK OF THE WORLD\u2019\n\nStepping aside for a few moments, the president called to the stage Anne Fundner, an anti-drug activist and mother who lost her son \u2013 Weston \u2013 to fentanyl poisoning, to speak about how the deadly drug is hurting Americans.\n\nWhile onstage, Fundner thanked Trump and his administration for shutting down the border, targeting the cartels and migrant crime groups as \"foreign terrorist organizations\" and for instituting tariffs to target countries where fentanyl is flowing from.\n\n\"The cartels were allowed to operate on American soil and took hundreds of thousands of American lives. And so, we knew there was only one person that could save us from the devastation on our American soil. And that was President Trump,\" said Fundner. \"I feel like I can speak for the entire fentanyl fighting community when I say thank you to President Trump and thank you to Pam Bondi and everyone out here who is fighting this fight. God bless you. God bless you, President Trump.\"\n\nVENEZUELA AGREES TO RESUME DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN RESPONSE TO PRESSURE FROM TRUMP\n\nIn a heartfelt moment caught on the microphone, Trump leaned in to hug Fundner and said, \"He's up there watching you.

            "full_content": "Demcession Rising: Democrat Panic Could Hurt the Economy\n\nConsumer sentiment is collapsing, and the cause isn\u2019t economic fundamentals\u2014it\u2019s politics.\n\nThe latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey shows confidence plunging to 57.9 in March, its lowest level since November 2022. While sentiment declined across all demographics, the drop is overwhelmingly driven by Democrats, whose economic expectations have fallen to an all-time low. At 28.2, their outlook is now worse than during the financial crisis, the depths of the pandemic, or Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nBy contrast, Republican expectations remain high at 95.7, maintaining a 67.5-point gap between the two parties\u2014the largest ever recorded. Independent voters, usually a middle ground, now sit closer to Democrats than Republicans, indicating a broad shift in sentiment among those outside the GOP base.\n\nThis kind of partisan divide isn\u2019t new, but it has reached unprecedented levels. For years, political affiliation has been the most important factor in shaping how Americans perceive the economy, often outweighing actual economic conditions. But what\u2019s happening now goes beyond perception. When consumer sentiment is shaped by politics rather than reality, it can have real economic consequences.\n\nJust Because It\u2019s Partisan, Doesn\u2019t Mean It Isn\u2019t Real\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss the latest survey as a reflection of Democrats irrationally reacting to Trump\u2019s policies. They see a second Trump term and assume disaster, despite stable job growth and resilient consumer spending. But politics can trump economics, and when people believe the economy is in freefall, they act accordingly.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Curtin\u2014the now retired guru of consumer sentiment surveys\u2014warned as far back as 2017 that partisan-driven expectations can shape consumer behavior, and that\u2019s exactly the risk today. If millions of Democratic consumers expect an economic collapse, they may cut back on spending, delay major purchases, or pull back on investments.\n\nConsumer sentiment matters because it drives consumer behavior, and consumer behavior drives the economy. This dynamic played out under Biden, when Republicans, convinced his policies would lead to a deep recession, became more cautious with spending and investing. Now, the roles have reversed\u2014Democrats are bracing for catastrophe, and their collective retreat could slow down growth.\n\nCan Inflated Fears Inflate Prices?\n\nThat panic is also showing up in inflation expectations. During Biden\u2019s presidency, Republicans were far more concerned about inflation, correctly anticipating its persistence while many economists and Fed officials downplayed the risks. (As it turned out, Republicans got that one right.) Now, that trend has completely reversed. Democrats now expect inflation to surge to 6.5 percent, while Republicans expect virtually no inflation at all\u2014just 0.1 percent. Independents, at 4.4 percent, are once again positioned between the two extremes.\n\nThis shift in expectations is remarkable. From 2021 to 2023, Republicans were convinced inflation would remain a problem, and Democrats insisted it would fade quickly. Now, the gap has flipped completely, and the difference between the two parties is the largest ever recorded. This highlights how inflation fears are no longer just about economic indicators; they have become political. But just as before, expectations shape reality.\n\nHere at Breitbart Business Digest, we\u2019re skeptical of the theory that inflation expectations do all that much to shape inflation. It doesn\u2019t seem plausible\u2014and there is little evidence\u2014that worker wage demands drive inflation or are much influenced by inflation expectations. Rather than setting wage requirements based on expectations, workers typically react to recent past inflationary patterns. That is, they demand higher wages not because they see inflation coming but because the inflation that has already happened has eaten away their standard of living.\n\nWhatever role expectations may play, the rate of inflation appears to us to be dominated by fiscal and monetary policy. But that doesn\u2019t mean inflation expectations can be safely ignored.\n\nIt pays to watch what is happening with expectations because the Federal Reserve is convinced that they matter a lot. And this means that record high inflation expectations are likely to influence the path of monetary policy\u2014even if they don\u2019t do much to influence inflation itself. That raises the risk that the Fed could make the mistake of keeping monetary policy too tight, which in turn would put the economy at risk of slipping into a recession.\n\nThere\u2019s another way inflation expectations affect the economy\u2014and it is almost the opposite of what the Fed thinks. When consumers expect prices to rise rapidly in the future, they scale back purchases in order to pre-emptively save so that they can afford higher-prices later. They take on less consumer debt, most of which is at adjustable rates that tend to go up when inflation rises, which holds them back from making major purchases. So, rising inflation expectations are actually a drag on the economy rather than an inflationary accelerant.\n\nThe Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself\n\nThe biggest risk to the economy right now isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s tariffs or Federal Reserve policy\u2014it\u2019s the fact that one-half of the country believes the economy is both collapsing and on the precipice of a surge of inflation. Add to that the fact that the Fed sees rising inflation expectations as a reason to tighten monetary policy. If Democratic consumers stop spending, economic growth could slow. If businesses see declining demand, hiring could weaken. If markets react to consumer pessimism, investment could pull back. And the Fed is likely to refuse to loosen monetary policy because it reads inflation expectations backward.\n\nNone of this means Trump\u2019s economy is actually in trouble yet; but if enough people believe it is, their behavior can create real economic drag.\n\nPartisan consumer sentiment gaps have been growing for years, but we\u2019ve now entered uncharted territory. The key takeaway isn\u2019t just that Democrats are panicking\u2014it\u2019s that their panic could have real economic consequences. If enough Democratic consumers start behaving as though we\u2019re in a recession, they could slow down the economy\u2014even if the fundamentals remain strong. Sentiment is political, but spending is real. And that\u2019s what conservatives should be watching in the months ahead."

A government shutdown will be avoided, but the Democratic infighting has only just begun. Kristen Welker examines how tensions boiled over this week within the party.

Gomez asks Vice President JD Vance about the future of TikTok in the U.S.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nShutdown showdown underscores deep divide in Democratic Party\n\nBy Kristen Welker\n\nWith just hours to spare before a midnight deadline, the Senate passed a Republican stopgap funding bill to keep the government open after days of indications from Democrats that a shutdown may be looming.\n\nThe vote was 54-46, with two members of the Democratic caucus joining all but one Republican in support, sending the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk for a signature. But prior to final passage, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and nine other Democrats helped the measure clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle in the GOP-controlled chamber.\n\nIt was that decision that has stoked deep divisions with the Democratic Party, which is facing a reckoning over how to respond to Trump.\n\nTensions boiled over after Schumer first announced on Thursday he would vote in favor of advancing the GOP spending bill, despite Democratic fears that the measure passed by the House would enable Trump and Elon Musk to further lay off government workers and seek to eliminate programs without congressional input.\n\nBut Schumer took to the Senate floor again this morning and argued that shutting down the government would only embolden Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cMusk has told everybody he wants a shutdown because he knows it will help him achieve his horrible goal of just decimating the federal government from one end to the other,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIn other words, if government were to shut down, DOGE has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction.\u201d\n\nTrump praised Schumer on Truth Social, calling his announcement a \u201creally good and smart move\u201d that took \u201cguts and courage.\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California responded to the president\u2019s post: \u201cWhen Donald Trump wakes up in the morning and says, \u2018You\u2019re doing the right things Senate Democrats,\u2019 we don\u2019t feel that is the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe reaction from Democrats has been furious. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leading progressive opposed to the bill, called Schumer\u2019s move \u201cdevastating\u201d and a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d\n\nIn a stunning move, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling on Democratic senators to reject the bill, defying Schumer. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., declined in a press conference to answer whether it\u2019s time for new leadership in the Senate.\n\nI\u2019ve been speaking to a number of Democratic sources, and while some were relieved by Schumer\u2019s move, one congressional aide told me to expect \u201csevere\u201d blowback from the base. The aide also noted the divide seems to be falling largely along generational lines, with some of the newest voices in the Senate being some of the staunchest opponents to Schumer\u2019s strategy.\n\nWhy the backlash? Well, one, a number of vulnerable House Democrats in Trump districts opposed the bill earlier this week, and now feel like they took a tough vote for no reason. Second, some Democrats feel as though keeping the government open is basically giving Trump and Musk a green light to move forward with their deep cuts. And third, perhaps most importantly, many in the party saw this fight as the best opportunity to register their opposition to Trump. The question is: If not now, when?\n\nThe episode has been a real test of Schumer\u2019s leadership at a critical moment when Democrats are still trying to find their footing. And it all underscores that there is a deep divide in the party about the best way to take on Trump in the opening months of his second administration.\n\nWe\u2019ll get our first real sense of how voters are reacting to all of the moves out of Washington in our new NBC News poll, which Steve Kornacki will debut on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday. Plus, I\u2019ll talk to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nExclusive interview: Vice President JD Vance told NBC News\u2019 Henry J. Gomez that \u201cthere will almost certainly be a high-level agreement\u201d to sell TikTok and keep the social media app running in the U.S. by the April 5 deadline.\n\nVice President JD Vance told NBC News\u2019 Henry J. Gomez that \u201cthere will almost certainly be a high-level agreement\u201d to sell TikTok and keep the social media app running in the U.S. by the April 5 deadline. Vance was booed upon arriving at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Thursday night.\n\nA federal judge ordered that thousands of federal workers fired by the Trump administration be temporarily reinstated.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security agents executed search warrants on two Columbia University residences days after graduate student and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was arrested by immigration authorities.\n\nTrump touted his \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as he once again called the U.N.-sanctioned state a \u201cnuclear power.\u201d\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nPam Bondi reshapes the DOJ around Trump\u2019s priorities\n\nBy Ken Dilanian\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Pam Bondi to be attorney general initially prompted sighs of relief in some Democratic and legal circles.\n\nTrump\u2019s first pick, then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who had been investigated by the Justice Department in connection with allegations of sex trafficking \u2014 he denied the allegations and the DOJ decided not to bring charges \u2014 was seen as someone chosen because he would do whatever Trump asked, regardless of the ethics or law.\n\nBondi was seen as a professional with deep legal experience: She had served as Florida\u2019s attorney general for 10 years. It was true that she had served as one of Trump\u2019s lawyers during his first impeachment trial and supported his conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Still, Democrats and Republicans who knew her believed she was someone who\u2019d stand up to Trump in a way Gaetz wouldn\u2019t and refuse if the president asked her to do anything illegal or improper.\n\nBut since Bondi took the reins, the Justice Department has been operating in a manner dramatically at odds with how it has been run in the 50 years since Attorney General John Mitchell was sent to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.\n\nVowing to end the politicization she says occurred during the Biden administration, Bondi has implemented her own regime of politicization, critics say. The Trump administration, with Bondi\u2019s help, appears to be seeking to transform the Justice Department into a political instrument of the president \u2014 something that no Republican or Democratic administration has done since Richard Nixon.\n\nRead more from Ken \u2192\n\nRelated: Trump calls for jailing his perceived opponents in Justice Department speech, by Nnamdi Egwuonwu and Ryan J.

Declaring someone persona non grata (PNG) is a severe diplomatic rebuke and usually forces them to leave the host country.\n\nRasool must leave the US by March 21, a State Department spokesperson told CNN Saturday.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa called the decision \u201cregrettable\u201d and expressed his commitment to building a \u201cmutually beneficial relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Presidency urges all relevant and impacted stakeholders to maintain the established diplomatic decorum in their engagement with the matter,\u201d Ramaphosa\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nRubio\u2019s post linked to an article from the right-wing news outlet Breitbart about Rasool\u2019s comments to a think tank Friday about Trump\u2019s election and presidency.\n\nThe PNG declaration against Rasool is the latest chapter in the plummeting relationship between the US and South Africa. There had been tensions between the two countries under the Biden administration. However, since Trump began his second term the US has taken a series of punitive measures against South Africa, whose government has been met with ire not only from Trump, but also his ally tech billionaire Elon Musk, who was born and raised in the country.\n\nBoth Trump and Musk have alleged that White farmers in the country are being discriminated against under land reform policies that South Africa\u2019s government says are necessary to remedy the legacy of apartheid.\n\nIn the comments that seem to have triggered Rubio\u2019s PNG declaration, Rasool was discussing the \u201ccontinuities\u201d from the Biden administration as well as the \u201cdiscontinuities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Donald Trump is launching is an assault on incumbency, those who are in power, by mobilizing a supremacism against the incumbency at home and \u2026 abroad as well,\u201d said Rasool, who was on his second tour as ambassador to the US. He presented his credentials in mid-January to then President Joe Biden and previously served in Washington, DC, under the Obama administration.\n\nHe said that the Make America Great Again movement was a response \u201cnot simply to a supremacist instinct,\u201d but to shifts in US demographics \u201cin which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that needs to be factored in, so that we understand some of the things that we think are instinctive, nativist, racist things, I think that there\u2019s data that, for example, would support that, that would go to this wall being built, the deportation movement, etc. etc.,\u201d he said as part of his nearly 20-minute-long remarks to the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA).\n\nRasool said \u201cit\u2019s no accident\u201d that Musk has involved himself in far-right British politics and that Vice President JD Vance met with the leader of a far-right German political party before the elections there.\n\n\u201cThat then begins to say what was the role then of Afrikaners in that whole project,\u201d he continued. \u201cVery clearly it\u2019s to project white victimhood as a dog whistle.\u201d\n\nIn January, South Africa enacted the Expropriation Act, seeking to undo the legacy of apartheid, which created huge disparities in land ownership among its majority Black and minority White population.\n\nUnder apartheid, non-White South Africans were forcibly dispossessed from their lands for the benefit of Whites. Today, some three decades after racial segregation officially ended in the country, Black South Africans, who comprise over 80% of the population of 63 million, own only around 4% of private land.\n\nThe expropriation law empowers South Africa\u2019s government to take land and redistribute it \u2013 with no obligation to pay compensation in some instances \u2013 if the seizure is found to be \u201cjust and equitable and in the public interest.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa said the legislation would \u201censure public access to land in an equitable and just manner.\u201d But the White House disagrees and Trump and Musk believe the land reform policy discriminates against White South Africans.\n\nThe policy has prompted a strong reaction from the Trump administration.\n\nIn early February, Rubio announced he would not attend the meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Johannesburg, saying at the time that \u201cSouth Africa is doing very bad things.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpropriating private property. Using G20 to promote \u2018solidarity, equality, & sustainability.\u2019 In other words: DEI and climate change,\u201d the top US diplomat alleged. \u201cMy job is to advance America\u2019s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism.\u201d\n\nJust days later, Trump suspended aid to South Africa, alleging discrimination against White farmers. In that same executive order, the president said the US would \u201cpromote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump said in a post on social media that \u201cany Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship.\u201d\n\nThe State Department spokesperson told CNN Saturday that the agency \u201cis coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security and has begun implementing refugee resettlement\u201d for Afrikaners, adding that \u201cinitial interviews are underway.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Nimi Princewill and Lucas Lilieholm contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump made multiple false claims in a Friday speech at the Department of Justice in which he discussed the legal system and crime but also a wide range of other topics, including immigration, the war in Ukraine and former President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump also made numerous allegations for which he provided no evidence, alleging unspecified \u201cegregious crimes\u201d in the government during the Biden administration, corruption among unspecified judges, illegality by media outlets that he claimed cover him too negatively and \u201ccrooked\u201d behavior by law firms connected to cases involving Trump.\n\nHere is a fact check of some of his assertions.\n\nTrump\u2019s prosecutions and Biden: Trump repeated his regular unsubstantiated claim that former President Joe Biden used his office to wield the legal system against Trump.\n\n\u201cEtched onto the walls of this building are the words English philosopher John Locke said: \u2018Where law ends, tyranny begins.\u2019 And I see that, and I saw it over the last four years when somebody was allowed to attack, viciously, with this department and the FBI, his political opponent. How did that work out? It didn\u2019t work out too well, but it wasn\u2019t pleasant. I was attacked by a political opponent,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThere has never been any evidence that Biden personally used the Department of Justice or FBI to attack Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s two federal prosecutions, one over Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and one over his retention of classified documents after his first presidency, were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed in November 2022 by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is not proof that Biden was involved in the prosecution effort, much less that Biden personally attacked Trump using the department; Garland said in 2023 that he would resign if Biden ever asked him to act against Trump, and added that he was sure that would never happen.\n\nTrump\u2019s two other prosecutions were brought by local district attorneys, one in Manhattan, New York, and one in Fulton County, Georgia. Both are Democrats, but there is, again, no evidence that Biden or his White House directed their decisions. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in the Manhattan case; the Georgia case was put on hold in June 2024 while an appeals court considered whether the district attorney, Fani Willis, should be disqualified from the case.\n\nThe two federal cases were dropped by Smith because of Trump\u2019s 2024 election victory. The documents case had previously been dismissed by a Trump-appointed federal judge, but Smith had appealed her ruling that his appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional.\n\nBiden documents investigation: Trump falsely claimed in his remarks that former President Joe Biden was \u201cessentially found guilty, but they said he was incompetent and therefore let\u2019s not find him guilty, I guess.\u201d He added, \u201cNobody knows what the ruling was.\u201d He continued, \u201cI think I would have rather been found guilty than what they found with him. They said he didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing and therefore \u2026 let him go.\u201d\n\nBiden was not found guilty, \u201cessentially\u201d or not, and there was no judicial \u201cruling\u201d at all; Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel who was appointed to look into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents, Robert Hur, wrote in his public report that \u201cthe evidence does not establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.\u201d\n\nTrump appeared to be referring Friday to the fact that Hur wrote in the report, \u201cWe have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d But Hur did not say he would have brought charges against Biden if not for this. Hur wrote at length about various facts of the case and possible Biden defenses that meant that he thought would make it too difficult for the government to win a unanimous guilty verdict.\n\nImmigration under Trump: Trump repeated two false claims about immigration statistics during his presidencies.\n\nFirst, he said, \u201cIn our first full month in office, we achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings ever recorded.\u201d He could have accurately said the number of migrant apprehensions by the Border Patrol in February 2025 \u2013 8,347 \u2013 was the lowest in many decades, but it\u2019s not the lowest number on record. Official federal statistics show there were fewer Border Patrol encounters with migrants at the southwest border in some of the months of the early 1960s and in years prior.\n\nSecond, he said that \u201cby the time I got out\u201d of office the first time, \u201cwe had the lowest numbers ever. My favorite chart of all time was brought down that day and, on that chart, it said we had the lowest numbers ever.\u201d But the chart doesn\u2019t actually show that illegal immigration was at its lowest level at the time Trump left office, though text beside a red arrow on the chart claims that\u2019s what it shows. In fact, the arrow actually points to April 2020, when Trump still had more than eight months left in his first term and when global migration had slowed to a trickle because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter hitting a roughly three-year low (not an all-time low) in April 2020, migration numbers at the southern border increased each month through the end of Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nUS and European aid to Ukraine: Trump repeated his debunked claim that the US has spent \u201cmaybe $350 billion\u201d aiding Ukraine compared to $100 billion from Europe.\n\nNeither figure is correct. The $350 billion figure Trump has repeatedly cited is particularly inaccurate.\n\nAccording to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, Europe \u2013 the European Union plus individual European countries \u2013 had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December 2024 (about $269 billion at current exchange rates) than the US committed (about $129 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $144 billion) than the US allocated (about $124 billion).\n\nIt\u2019s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s \u201c$350 billion\u201d figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response says on its website that the US had appropriated about $183 billion for the Ukraine response through December 2024, including about $83 billion actually disbursed \u2013 and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.\n\nUS elections: Trump, vowing to restore \u201cfairness\u201d in the country, baselessly impugned the integrity of US elections, saying, \u201cThe elections, which were totally rigged, are a big factor.\u201d He didn\u2019t invoke the 2020 election in particular, as he usually does, but there is nonetheless no basis for a broader claim that recent \u201celections\u201d in this country, plural, have been \u201ctotally rigged.\u201d\n\nIran and terror groups: Trump repeated his false claim that when he was president, Iran was \u201ctotally broke\u201d and therefore \u201cthey weren\u2019t giving any money to Hamas or Hezbollah.\u201d Iran\u2019s funding for terror groups did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions on Iran had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN in 2024. In fact, Trump\u2019s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah. You can read a longer fact check here."

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump defended his allies Friday while calling for his perceived political opponents to be jailed during a speech at the headquarters of the Justice Department \u2014 an agency that was prosecuting him just months ago.\n\nTrump called U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who helped dismiss his classified documents case, a \u201cbrilliant\u201d judge, while condemning \u201chorrible human beings\u201d whom he accused of disparaging Cannon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally illegal what they do. I just hope you can all watch for it, but it\u2019s totally illegal, and it was so unfair what they were doing to her,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAfter deeming the United States\u2019 withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 as \u201cthe most humiliating time in this history of our country,\u201d Trump repeated his false claims of a rigged election in 2020.\n\n\"What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail,\" he said, without specifying anyone by name. Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that Democrats interfered in the 2020 contest.\n\nOn Friday he also said, \"Our predecessors turned this department of justice into the department of injustice,\" adding that he would \u201cinsist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\u201d\n\nFollow live politics coverage here.\n\nCalling former special counsel Jack Smith \u201cderanged,\u201d Trump referred to the hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants he pardoned on his first day in office as \u201chostages\u201d and said the Justice Department would not return to what he declared as an era of weaponization.\n\n\u201cThose days are over, and they are never going to come back,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump was indicted in two separate federal cases: one involving his handling of classified documents, and another involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The cases were dismissed after the 2024 election, and career prosecutors who had worked on Smith\u2019s team were fired when Trump took office, as were numerous federal prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks are not the first time he has called to imprison his political opponents. But the venue of his speech \u2014 delivering the remarks at the Justice Department to a room full of its top officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \u2014 demonstrates how his previous campaign threats of vengeance and retribution have taken on significantly higher stakes now that he wields the enormous power of the presidency.\n\nTrump noted the significance of his remarks at the Justice Department, on Friday becoming the third president this century to deliver a speech at the agency\u2019s headquarters.\n\n\u201cI was asked to do it, and I said, \u2018Is it appropriate that I do it?\u2019 And then I realized it\u2019s not only appropriate, I think it\u2019s really important, and I may never do it again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI may never have another chance to do it again, because this is something that I\u2019m leaving to the greatest people I know, the best people, the smartest people, the toughest people I know, and they\u2019re going to do an incredible job.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump finished his speech, a mainstay of his campaign rallies, the song \u201cY.M.C.A.,\u201d played over the speakers inside the Justice Department\u2019s Great Hall."

Miller on Friday about the Denver event had many wondering why masks would be advised for an outdoor event in 2025.\n\nSanders did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's inquiry about the mask guidance.\n\nDEM LEADER SWINGS THROUGH GOP-HELD DISTRICTS AFTER 'CLOWN SHOW PROTESTS' HALTED TOWN HALLS\n\n\"Sent from a friend.

Masks are a common practice to protect protesters' identities at large demonstrations, like the pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University this past year.\n\nHowever, Sanders' \"Fighting Oligarchy\" events are not protests. Events in the Blue Wall states of Michigan and Wisconsin last weekend operated like a traditional campaign rally, with thousands of supporters lining up to earn a spot inside to hear the headline speaker.\n\nSanders announced the West Coast leg of his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour with Ocasio-Cortez in a social media video on Friday.

If they won\u2019t talk to their own voters, then Democrats will. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll be hosting People\u2019s Town Halls in all 50 states across the country, starting now with vulnerable GOP-held target districts.

Masks are advised for all attendees of this event. Anyone experiencing a fever or other symptoms of COVID-19 is asked to stay home and not attend,\" it says on the RSVP.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ended their travel mask mandate on April 18, 2022.\n\nAccording to the CDC's website, masks are still \"recommended in indoor public transportation settings\" and \"people may choose to mask at any time.\"\n\nThe website advises people who are at medium to high risk of getting very sick to wear a mask or \"consider avoiding non-essential indoor activities in public where you could be exposed.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the CDC has maintained that masking can reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, other studies since the pandemic have brought into question the efficacy of wearing a mask."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nCongress averted a government shutdown Friday just hours before the funding deadline, after the Senate approved a House-passed spending bill that exposed deep rifts within the Democratic Party.\n\nThe stopgap measure to fund the government into the fall now heads to the desk of President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.\n\nSenate Democrats came under intense pressure to oppose the Trump-backed bill, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and others are now facing backlash after they helped to clear a path for its passage.\n\nThe rising tensions within the party spilled into public view as lawmakers raced toward a shutdown that would have had far-reaching consequences across the federal government \u2013 highlighting the struggle Democrats face in attempting to counter Trump and the Republican monopoly on power in Washington.\n\nSome 90 minutes before Senate Republicans staved off a shutdown on a nearly party-line vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others crossed the aisle to advance it in a key procedural vote \u2013 despite intensifying pressure from their caucus to sink it outright. The legislation, however, only required a simple majority in the chamber for final passage, and all but two in the group ultimately opposed it.\n\nSchumer argued his party had only bad options when it came to shutting down the government \u2013 possibly for months \u2013 to challenge Trump, or accepting a GOP bill that Democrats have warned would cut spending to programs like veterans\u2019 health care or Washington, DC, firefighters and police.\n\n\u201cI believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,\u201d Schumer argued in defense of his decision to clear a pathway for the bill\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cClearly, this is a Hobson\u2019s choice. The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\u201d he continued.\n\nLawmakers who crossed party lines to advance the spending bill, from left to right, first row, Sens. Chuck Schumer, John Fetterman, Catherine Cortez Masto, Dick Durbin and Brian Schatz. From left to right, second row, Sens. Maggie Hassan, Kristen Gillibrand, Gary Peters, Jeanne Shaheen and Angus King. Getty Images\n\nTrump praised Schumer for announcing he would support the measure, telling reporters after the vote Friday: \u201cI appreciate Senator Schumer, and I think he did the right thing, really. I\u2019m very impressed by that.\u201d\n\nOutside of Schumer\u2019s leadership team, many Senate Democrats as well as House Democrats seethed at the Democrat\u2019s move, which they saw as a capitulation in the party\u2019s first real leverage point in Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nThe initial vote, while procedural, had been closely watched by Democrats across the country, who saw it as a test of their party leaders\u2019 willingness to fight Trump.\n\nUltimately, the Senate voted 54-46 to approve the stopgap bill to fund the government through September 30. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the party, voted in favor of the bill and just one Republican \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2013 opposed it.\n\n\u201cOnce I had voted for cloture, it was an opportunity to pass the bill, and I thought it was more honest to vote for it,\u201d Shaheen told CNN, adding: \u201cI thought, much as I didn\u2019t like the CR, I thought a government shutdown would be worse and would give Trump and Elon Musk and the DOGE operation more of an opportunity to fire people, to shut down agencies and to close the work of the government.\u201d\n\nAfter voting to pass the stopgap bill, the Senate approved a separate measure to allow Washington, DC, to maintain control over its funds after Democrats warned the Republican funding package would cut $1.1 billion of the city\u2019s funding. The measure would next need to be passed by the House, where its fate is unclear.\n\nAt the urging of prominent Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, voters had been flooding senators\u2019 offices with calls urging them to block the bill and take on Trump for his dismantling of the federal government. Ultimately, many Democrats believe, Schumer failed that test.\n\nThe New York Democrat\u2019s strategy has faced fierce blowback from all corners of the Democratic Party, including in his own chamber, though no senators have publicly said they would challenge his leadership over the move.\n\nEarlier in the week, top House Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, led a fierce whip operation against the bill, ultimately losing just one of their members on the vote. But it was not enough to sink the bill, which passed the House Tuesday.\n\nJeffries would not answer Friday when asked whether he had lost confidence in Schumer, with whom he diverged on the funding issue.\n\n\u201cNext question,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nDemocrats contemplate path forward\n\nSenate Democrats are now grappling with how to move forward as a caucus after the government funding bill split their party.\n\nSchumer told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Friday evening that he \u201calways knew there would be disagreements,\u201d but maintained that a \u201cgovernment shutdown would be far worse\u201d than voting for the GOP-led measure.\n\n\u201cMy job as leader is to lead the party and if there\u2019s going to be danger in the near future, to protect the party. And I\u2019m proud I did it, I knew I did the right thing, and I knew there would be some disagreements. That\u2019s how it always is,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer also defended his leadership position, saying, \u201cMy caucus and I are in sync.\u201d\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would not say whether he thought the party needed a new leader, telling reporters: \u201cThat\u2019s a conversation for inside the caucus. I\u2019m not going to debate that out here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Leader Schumer has been very effective in a lot of battles, but we also need to \u2014 these are new times, and we need to all come together. And so, you know, second guessing Leader Schumer out here isn\u2019t going to accomplish the kind of community that we\u2019re going to need to be able to stand up to the president. So, we\u2019ll have that conversation inside caucus,\u201d the New Mexico Democrat added.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he has \u201cfaith in Chuck Schumer,\u201d but acknowledged that the caucus had a \u201cchoppy week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI voted no on the CR. I heard that overwhelmingly from folks, and again, recognizing I got tons of federal workers. But I have total respect for the folks who reached another conclusion, and the idea that they would have had a shutdown that would have put us into the abyss with, unfortunately, parts of this administration, doesn\u2019t follow the law,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cI think the Democrats need to have a pro-growth agenda that recognizes fairness, and that is, frankly, not the debate though, that we just took place. That we just took place, it was two awful choices.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Lauren Fox and Annie Grayer contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAs it pushes to implement a plan to end birthright citizenship, the Trump administration is counting on an argument about out-of-control federal judges to prove irresistible to some Supreme Court conservatives.\n\nRather than waiting to ask the court to rule directly on the merits of birthright citizenship, which President Donald Trump is seeking to unwind, the administration used a series of emergency appeals Thursday to argue that lower courts are vastly exceeding their authority to block the White House\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn effect, it\u2019s a strategy that could bring the same result \u2013 letting Trump at least temporarily upend more than a century of settled law that\u2019s part of the fabric of American society.\n\nThe use of sweeping, if temporary nationwide orders has \u201creached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\u201d acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris told the Supreme Court in the appeals. \u201cThis court should declare that enough is enough.\u201d\n\nFor now, the court doesn\u2019t appear to be in any rush to resolve the cases. The three justices handling Trump\u2019s appeals on Friday asked for a response from the groups challenging Trump by April 4, a far longer timeline than is usual on the court\u2019s emergency docket.\n\nThe birthright citizenship appeals made their way to the high court at a moment when judges are wrestling with a slew of controversial executive actions that seem designed to push the boundaries of the law. The Supreme Court has already twice declined to overturn lower courts that blocked Trump initiatives since January 20.\n\nThose cases have drawn fiery dissents from some conservative justices questioning the power of lower courts to force the administration to slow down. Trump\u2019s latest appeal \u2013 which repeatedly cites conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2013 appears designed to build further support for that position.\n\nBut experts say the birthright citizenship case may be a particularly improbable vehicle for changing how lower courts do business.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because of the controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s position on birthright citizenship. For more than 150 years, courts have understood the 14th Amendment\u2019s text to guarantee citizenship to anyone \u201cborn or naturalized in the United States,\u201d regardless of the immigration status of their parents.\n\n\u201cThere are strong arguments about the scope of injunctions,\u201d said Amanda Frost, a professor at University of Virginia School of Law. \u201cThis is a pretty weak case to bring that kind of argument.\u201d\n\nCourts have issued sweeping injunctions requiring Trump to halt implementation of his birthright citizenship plans \u2013 among a wave of early legal defeats the new president has faced. A federal judge in January described Trump\u2019s effort as \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d Three federal appeals courts declined to lift those orders.\n\nThe administration framed its request of the Supreme Court as \u201cmodest,\u201d noting it\u2019s not seeking to lift the injunctions entirely \u2013 only to narrow their scope to the parties who sued. But if a majority of justices grant the request, it would have the practical effect of allowing the administration to move forward with an executive order against all but a handful of people.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s argument is anything but \u2018modest,\u2019\u201d said Rupa Bhattacharyya, legal director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, which is representing two of the groups challenging Trump. \u201cIt would destroy the very concept of the United States as a nation if children born in Tennessee were denied citizenship while children born in Washington state were granted it.\u201d\n\nTransgender care to immigration\n\nIn one sense, Trump is pressing a decades-old legal argument and taking a position that has, at times, drawn bipartisan support. In the final weeks of the Biden administration, for instance, the Justice Department also urged the Supreme Court to consider limiting the use of so-called universal injunctions \u2013 an invitation the court declined.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court waded into the issue just last year in an emergency appeal dealing with Idaho\u2019s strict statewide ban on gender-affirming care for minors. A majority allowed Idaho to enforce its ban, shutting down a lower court\u2019s sweeping injunction that had blocked its implementation.\n\nGorsuch, in a lengthy concurrence, lamented lower courts\u2019 injunctions that extended beyond the people who challenge the policy in the first place.\n\n\u201cLower courts would be wise to take heed,\u201d Gorsuch warned in an opinion joined by Thomas and Alito. \u201cRetiring the universal injunction may not be the answer to everything that ails us. But it will lead federal courts to become a little truer to the historic limits of their office.\u201d\n\nGorsuch\u2019s concurrence is the very first Supreme Court opinion the Justice Department cited in its appeals Thursday.\n\nHarris argued that courts have not taken heed but have instead doubled down. She did not address the counterargument: That courts are simply reacting to a president who openly ran on shaking up the status quo in ways everyone knew would invite legal challenges.\n\n\u201cDistrict courts have issued more universal injunctions and TROs during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPresidents of both parties tend to complain about nationwide injunctions, even as their allies often pursue them when the other party is in power. The Biden administration was forced to pause policies dealing with immigration, Covid-19 and student loan forgiveness.\n\nThe emergency orders don\u2019t decide the merits of a case, but they often have significant practical implications. In 2021, the Supreme Court declined to block a Texas law that banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy \u2013 even though the law conflicted with the court\u2019s landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. Months later, the court overturned Roe.\n\nEven with that history, there have been signs that some justices are restive about the recent flood of lower court orders.\n\nWhen a majority of the court this month let stand a ruling requiring the Trump administration to quickly spend nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, Alito wrote a scathing dissent accusing the lower court of \u201cjudicial hubris.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cThe answer to that question should be an emphatic \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlito was joined by Thomas, Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 one vote shy of a majority.\n\n\u2018Micromanaging\u2019 Trump\n\nThe Trump administration is also making a backup argument at the Supreme Court \u2013 one that could find some purchase.\n\nIf the justices are unwilling to allow officials to implement the order, the administration argues, then the court should at least let the executive branch make plans to do so.\n\nThe lower court orders block such internal planning in rulings the administration said, \u201cmicromanage the internal operations of the executive branch.\u201d\n\nThe orders \u201chave prevented executive agencies from developing and issuing public guidance explaining how the executive branch would carry out the citizenship order,\u201d Harris told the Supreme Court. Those orders, she said, \u201cexceed the courts\u2019 authority\u201d under the Constitution.\n\nIf a majority of the court wants to give the administration a win on part of its request without addressing the more substantial questions involved, the issue of internal planning would have the most limited impact.\n\nUS District Judge Deborah Boardman, nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, questioned why officials would want to move forward with planning an order widely understood to be illegal.\n\n\u201cSurely, the government has no valid interest in taking internal, preparatory steps to formulate policies and guidance on an unconstitutional executive order,\u201d Boardman wrote last month.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court precedent from 1898 affirmed the idea that people born in the United States are citizens, and the modern court hasn\u2019t signaled a desire to revisit that holding. Some conservatives have argued that those long-held views are wrong because the 14th Amendment includes a phrase that citizenship applies only to people who are \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States."

Photo: Dana Edwards/Reuters\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it has arrested a second Columbia University student as part of the Trump administration\u2019s long-promised crackdown on college protests against the war in Gaza. The move comes just days after federal agents arrested and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at the university and a green-card holder who led protests there last year.\n\nIn a press release, the DHS said Leqaa Kordia was arrested for overstaying her student visa. The agency said her visa had been terminated in January 2022 for \u201clack of attendance.\u201d The DHS said Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, had previously been arrested last April for taking part in Gaza protests on Columbia\u2019s campus.\n\nThe agency also said another Columbia student, Ranjani Srinivasan, self-deported. According to the DHS, Srinivasan, an Indian national, entered the U.S. on a student visa to attend Columbia as a doctoral student studying urban planning but had her visa revoked this month. The agency also released a video it claims shows Srinivasan using the Customs and Border Protection Home app to self-deport.\n\nEchoing the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, the DHS claims without evidence that the two students arrested were supporters of Hamas, at one point misspelling the organization\u2019s name as \u201cHammas\u201d in the press release. \u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self-deport,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.\n\nOn Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio made it clear that this round of student-visa revocations will not be the last. \u201cIn the days to come, you should expect more visas will be revoked as we identify people that we should have never allowed in,\u201d he said, according to Reuters.\n\nAs Trump has moved to quell college protests since taking office, his administration has continued to escalate its actions against Columbia. On Thursday, Katrina Armstrong, the university\u2019s interim president, said DHS agents with judicially approved warrants had searched two student residences on campus. \u201cNo one was arrested or detained. No items were removed, and no further action was taken,\u201d she said.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche indicated Friday that the searches were part of an investigation into whether Columbia was hiding students who were in the country unlawfully. \u201cJust last night, we worked with the Department of Homeland Security to execute search warrants from an investigation into Columbia University for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus,\u201d Blanche said, per the Associated Press. \u201cThat investigation is ongoing, and we are also looking at whether Columbia\u2019s handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes.\u201d\n\nLast week, the federal government announced it would be revoking $400 million in grants and contracts from Columbia, alleging the university has failed to address antisemitism on its campus. The administration then laid out additional steps for Columbia to potentially get those funds back, calling for enforcement of its disciplinary policies, a mask ban, and immediately placing its Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

In reality, the water was directed to a dry lake basin elsewhere in the Central Valley \u2013 more than 100 miles north of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cNot one drop of the water released into the Tulare Basin by the Army Corps of Engineers at the direction of the White House made it to Southern California,\u201d said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow in the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California think tank.\n\n\u201cThe only way that water got to LA is if an Angeleno driving by got mud on their tires,\u201d said Brent Haddad, an environmental studies professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nThat\u2019s because the dams Trump had opened by the US Army Corps of Engineers have no automatic link to the California-run State Water Project that serves Southern California. The federally run Central Valley Project \u201cdoesn\u2019t reach Los Angeles\u201d and \u201cends around Bakersfield,\u201d Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, noted on Thursday.\n\nWater policy experts and local water authorities widely described Trump\u2019s order to release the water from the dams as wasteful, harmful to farmers and poorly planned \u2013 and said it could have been catastrophic if the Army Corps of Engineers had released the 5 billion-plus gallons Trump initially made clear he wanted to flow, which experts said could have caused deadly flooding.\n\nCNN asked the White House for comment about why the president keeps telling the false story about the water releases flowing to Los Angeles and why he also falsely claimed Thursday, as he has before, that some of California\u2019s water comes from Canada. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly responded by denouncing CNN, criticizing Newsom\u2019s fire preparedness efforts, and asserting that Trump released the water to save people from more tragedy.\n\nGallegos said, \u201cThe federal administration appears to have some issues with basic geography.\u201d\n\n\u2018I invaded Los Angeles\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday while sitting beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte: \u201cI broke into Los Angeles, can you believe it? I had to break in. I invaded Los Angeles, and we opened up the water, and the water is now flowing down; they have so much water they don\u2019t know what to do. They were sending it out to the Pacific for environmental reasons.\u201d\n\nThat story doesn\u2019t make sense even using \u201cinvaded\u201d as a figure of speech. Nothing about the water releases actually involved Los Angeles.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers branch that manages the dams from which the water was released was shocked by the White House release order, two sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen. A memo obtained by The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times showed that the Army Corps knew the water \u201ccould not be delivered to Southern California directly\u201d and \u201cwould remain in the Tulare Lake Basin\u201d without special coordination with California\u2019s water department to employ a rarely used connection to the state\u2019s water system. California\u2019s water department made clear it could not get involved on such short notice, the memo said.\n\nThe White House noted to CNN that the connection exists and was used in 2023; California\u2019s water department said then that this was the first time it was used since 2006. Regardless, it wasn\u2019t used this time, so Trump\u2019s repeated claims that the water flowed to Los Angeles remain untrue.\n\nTrump had the water released from the dams after complaining, baselessly, that Los Angeles had not been sent enough water for wildfire prevention or firefighting efforts because California\u2019s Democratic leadership wanted water kept in the northern part of the state to help an obscure fish species. The Los Angeles area had more than enough water to fight the January wildfires, though there were some localized water shortages in particular neighborhoods amid the extreme demand of the battle, and experts emphasized the fires and the fish had nothing to do with each other.\n\nWhen the Army Corps of Engineers began releasing the water on January 30, firefighters happened to be reaching 100% containment on the January wildfires in Los Angeles. Fire officials said that 100% containment was reached on January 31; the unrelated federal water releases continued until February 2."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Pam Bondi to be attorney general last fall prompted sighs of relief in some Democratic and legal circles.\n\nTrump\u2019s first pick, then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who had been investigated by the Justice Department in connection with allegations of sex trafficking \u2014 he denied the allegations and the DOJ decided not to bring charges \u2014 was seen as someone chosen because he would do whatever Trump asked, regardless of the ethics or law.\n\nBondi was seen as a professional with deep legal experience: she had served as Florida\u2019s attorney general for 10 years. It was true that she had served as one of Trump\u2019s lawyers during his first impeachment trial, and supported his conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Still, Democrats and Republicans who knew her believed she was someone who\u2019d stand up to Trump in a way Gaetz wouldn\u2019t and refuse if the president asked her to do anything illegal or improper.\n\nBut since Bondi took the reins, the Justice Department has been operating in a manner dramatically at odds with how it has been run in the 50 years since Attorney General John Mitchell was sent to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.\n\nVowing to end the politicization she says occurred during the Biden administration, Bondi has implemented her own regime of politicization, critics say. The Trump administration, with Bondi\u2019s help, appears to be seeking to transform the Justice Department into a political instrument of the president \u2014 something that no Republican or Democratic administration has done since then-President Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is not independent of the President of the United States,\u201d said Mike Davis, a lawyer and Republican activist who has advised Trump on DOJ issues and who said Bondi was doing exactly what Trump had promised. \u201cEvery federal prosecutor and agent reports to the deputy attorney general, who reports to the attorney general, who reports to the president, who is elected by all Americans. Anyone who thinks otherwise proves that the Deep State is not a conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is doing the unthinkable in Washington \u2014 he\u2019s doing what he promised voters he would do and Pam Bondi is helping,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s done more in a month than the last several attorneys general did in years.\u201d\n\nIn her first month in office, Bondi has presided over a purge of career Justice Department lawyers who are supposed to be protected under civil service rules but who were fired or reassigned without explanation, current and former officials told NBC News. She also backed her department\u2019s push to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams so he could help with immigration enforcement, which prompted the largest wave of resignations by career prosecutors since Watergate. And she has remained silent as Ed Martin, acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., has threatened Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Georgetown University and others over politics. She has also openly promised to fire DOJ civil servants herself if they \"despise\" Trump. Experts say that is prohibited under federal law.\n\n\u201cThese firings seem designed to make room for someone who is a political loyalist, someone who will do the White House\u2019s bidding, in an effort to reshape the department into something that it has never been before,\u201d a senior career Justice Department official said on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nBondi has also spoken in nakedly partisan terms in six appearances on Fox News, her only news media interviews.\n\nIn an interview with Sean Hannity, she said she was appalled when she discovered on her first day as attorney general the portraits of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and her own predecessor, Merrick Garland, still hanging in the secure areas of the National Security Division\u2019s 7th floor offices in the Justice Department's headquarters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how bad it was,\u201d she told Hannity. \u201cSo I personally took those off the wall. But that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nBondi told Hannity she planned to \u201croot out\u201d Justice Department employees \u201cwho despise Donald Trump,\u201d and \u201cthey will no longer be employed.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Harrison Fields disputed that Trump was trying to seize control of the Justice Department, saying in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump cannot be more clear in stating that his Department of Justice will act independently of the White House and any assertion otherwise is a lie.\u201d\n\nBut that is at odds with how Trump has viewed and related to the Justice Department in the past. It\u2019s also at odds with how many of his allies and supporters in the legal sphere see things.\n\nBondi declined a request for an interview but said in a statement to NBC News: \u201cThis Department of Justice is focused on making America safe again, which includes prosecuting violent criminals, illegal aliens, and dangerous cartel and gang members which the previous administration ignored. The Department and its resources are being used to uphold the rule of law and ensure there is one tier of justice for all Americans.\u201d\n\nOutside of television studios, Bondi has rarely been seen in public as attorney general. She appeared in photos alongside other senior national security officials \u2014 posted on X by FBI Director Kash Patel \u2014 wearing a camouflage FBI ballcap and windbreaker at Dulles Airport when an accused terrorist extradited from Pakistan landed in the United States.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, three Justice Department officials who work in different parts of the agency said Bondi has not been a visible presence in DOJ offices.\n\n\u201cGarland sent a positive note to DOJ upon arriving,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cBy contrast, she went on talk shows about all the corruption she claims to have found in DOJ and FBI.\u201d\n\nThe official said typically people at the Justice Department headquarters would see some public presence from a new attorney general, like appearances in the building\u2019s Great Hall. Instead, he said, the headquarters feels \u201clike a ghost town.\u201d\n\nThat is slated to change Friday, when Trump is expected to give a speech in the building \u2014 a building where, just months ago, prosecutors were working to try to put him in prison.\n\nA shaky start and a dramatic shift\n\nJust days after her swearing in, Bondi stepped up to the podium in the Justice Department\u2019s seventh floor conference room for her first news conference as attorney general. Behind her stood federal agents in black jackets emblazed with \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cATF Police\u201d and \u201cDEA.\u201d Next to her was a woman whose daughter had been murdered by an illegal immigrant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today because we have filed charges against the state of New York. We have filed charges against Kathy Hochul,\u201d she opened. \u201cThis is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans.\u201d\n\nReporters arrayed in chairs in front of her looked up in surprise. Did Bondi mean criminal charges? Was the governor of New York about to be arrested?\n\nIt quickly became clear she was talking about a civil lawsuit, not a criminal complaint. The Justice Department was suing New York over policies it says impede immigration enforcement. No one was going to jail.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 12. Daniel Heuer / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nIt was a small verbal misstep, but one that some observers saw as indicative of an attorney general not in command of her material.\n\nBondi\u2019s larger message that day, however, came through loud and clear. The Justice Department would take action against state and local governments that follow so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d policies restricting how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nIt was no accident that Bondi\u2019s first news conference was about immigration. On her first day in office, she issued a series of orders that amounted to a sea change in the Justice Department\u2019s priorities. She disbanded a task force focusing on seizing money from Russian oligarchs and an FBI effort to counter foreign influence operations on social media.\n\nShe pared back the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and other laws governing whether U.S. corporations can pay bribes overseas.\n\nThe orders largely underscored a theme. Many of the programs being eliminated or downgraded were ones that Trump and his allies said had been improperly used to investigate them. Instead, the Justice Department would now prioritize the enforcement of immigration law and the war against Mexican drug cartels that import fentanyl.\n\nIn recent weeks, more memos from the Justice Department's senior leaders, obtained by NBC News, have instructed federal prosecutors to charge immigration offenses whenever they can, and elements of the FBI and the DOJ, including those devoted to fighting terrorism and organized crime, have been repurposed to target illegal immigrants and drug cartels.\n\nBondi aides have been pointing multiple media outlets, including NBC News, to a series of what they view as significant accomplishments achieved by the Justice Department since Trump took office.\n\nTheir list includes the arrest and transfer from Pakistan of a man alleged to have helped kill 13 service members in the Abbey Gate terrorist attack; the move by Mexico to hand over 29 drug cartel figures, including a kingpin accused of orchestrating the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent; threats of federal lawsuits against states over the issue of transgender women playing women\u2019s sports; ending lawsuits begun under Biden that Bondi viewed as supporting racially discriminatory policies; and launching a federal task force advertised as combatting antisemitism at universities.\n\nBut a major change in law enforcement priorities and emphasis when a new president takes office in itself is neither unusual nor unexpected. Administrations have long set policy priorities for the Justice Department that change from president to president, and Trump got elected after promising to crack down on immigration and the drug cartels.\n\nWhat is dramatic and unprecedented about Trump\u2019s second crack at overseeing the Justice Department is the extent of the effort to shape the career workforce into one seen as more willing to do the president\u2019s bidding.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the roughly 100,000 people who work at the Justice Department, the FBI and other agencies the DOJ oversees are not appointed by the president. They are career civil servants hired under federal rules that are supposed to offer them a measure of protection from politically motivated actions against them.\n\nDays after Trump took office, at least a dozen of the most senior public servants at the department were removed from their jobs in the national security and criminal divisions, actions not taken by other post-Watergate administrations. They were offered jobs in a working group tasked with taking action against sanctuary cities. Some took them, some left.\n\nThe Justice Department also quickly fired several prosecutors who had worked on the criminal investigations of Trump, while making no allegation that they did anything improper. Many experts say the firings were illegal, but many of the lawyers have opted to move on with their lives rather than challenge them. This past Friday, several other career leaders in the department were reassigned, including top lawyers in the national security division, the head of the office that investigates lawyer misconduct, and the pardon attorney, current and former officials said.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBC News broke the news that the Justice Department was sharply downsizing the Public Integrity Section, which for decades has focused on prosecuting political corruption and was involved in the cases against Trump. Prosecutors in the unit, which had employed dozens of people, were being told to take details to other positions within the department.\n\nBondi has yet to fill some of the key roles opened up in this purge. Officials say the national security division in particular is bereft of senior leaders. But several Justice Department officials said the widespread understanding within the agency is that people sympathetic to Trump\u2019s politics are being elevated to senior jobs.\n\nOne official said he had seen an example of that happening. This official noticed a rank-and-file lawyer in the department who is a Trump supporter suddenly stopped coming to work, saying he was on special assignment in the deputy attorney general\u2019s office. A few weeks later, that lawyer was leading the criminal division at a major U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nNot the president's lawyer\n\nThis has not happened before. Over the last five decades, the Justice Department adopted policies and norms designed to keep the institution protected from political pressure from the president.\n\nAmong those policies was one limiting who from the White House could speak to people in the Justice Department. Garland was so concerned about distancing himself from the White House that he tried to avoid even being in the same room with Biden, who by some accounts grew angry about how Garland handled the investigation of his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nAttorneys general of both parties have sought to emphasize that they are not the president\u2019s lawyer \u2014 they represent the people of the United States.\n\nBondi, by contrast, has boasted in her Fox News appearances about her close relationship with Trump and her pride in being a member of a team that carries out his wishes.\n\n\u201cWe all have known each other, the majority of us, for so long, and we\u2019re friends, and that\u2019s what makes a difference,\u201d she told Fox News host Jesse Watters. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re getting things done so fast for Donald Trump and to make America great again.\u201d\n\nBondi also boasted to Hannity about the firing of prosecutors who worked on criminal prosecutions of Trump for special counsel Jack Smith, many of whom had long and distinguished Justice Department careers.\n\n\u201cThe Jack Smith team, gone,\u201d she told Hannity. \u201cThat was low hanging fruit. Get rid of them, get rid of the people that raided Mar a Lago.\u201d\n\nTrump allies who have spoken publicly \u2014 including Davis \u2014 say the purges are justified and necessary because the Justice Department and the FBI were hijacked by closet Democrats, who worked closely with the Biden White House to target Trump for prosecution when the evidence didn\u2019t merit it.\n\nA Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that leaders did not believe lawyers who spent years trying to put the president in prison could be trusted to carry out his agenda.\n\nBondi has articulated that view herself, repeatedly decrying what she called the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Justice Department in the last administration.\n\n\u201cThey targeted Donald Trump,\u201d she said during her confirmation hearing. \u201cThey went after him. Actually, starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him. That will not be the case if I am attorney general..\u201d\n\nBut Bondi and other Trump supporters have not offered any evidence to support the claim that career FBI and Justice Department officials investigated and prosecuted alleged crimes by Trump involving classified documents and January 6th in order to damage him politically. They have dismissed statements by Smith and other prosecutors that they honestly believed Trump broke the law by refusing to return classified documents and spreading a false narrative about 2020 election fraud that helped spark the storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nShortly after taking office, Bondi announced a \u201cweaponization working group,\u201d designed to review the Trump prosecutions. That group likely now has access to every text, email and memo Smith and his team wrote on government computers and phones. If they have found any evidence of wrongdoing or bias, critics say, they should make it public.\n\nDave Aronsberg, a Democrat who until January was district attorney of Palm Beach County and worked closely with Bondi over the years, was among those who expressed relief when Trump named her attorney general. Aronsberg told NBC News this week that he still believes Bondi will stand up to the president if he asked her to do something illegal.\n\n\u201cShe is loyal to Trump,\u201d he said, but \u201cI still don\u2019t believe that she will prosecute Trump\u2019s enemies for political reasons. That\u2019s where she differs from Matt Gaetz others who might have taken the job.\u201d"

            "full_content": "What does Hakeem Jeffries think of Chuck Schumer now? Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nFor the record, I\u2019m usually disinclined to promote the hoary \u201cDemocrats in Disarray\u201d narrative whereby the Democratic Party is to blame for whatever nightmarish actions Republicans generally, or Donald Trump specifically, choose to pursue. That\u2019s particularly true right now when Democrats have so little actual power and Republicans have so little interest in following laws and the Constitution, much less precedents for fair play and bipartisanship. So it really makes no sense to accuse the powerless minority party of \u201callowing\u201d the assault on the federal government and the separation of powers being undertaken by the president, his OMB director, and his tech-bro sidekick. If congressional Republicans had even a shred of integrity or courage, Senate Democrats would not have been placed in the position this week of deciding whether it\u2019s better to let the government shut down than to let it be gutted by Trump, Vought, and Musk.\n\nHaving said all that, Senate Democrats did have a strategic choice to make this week, and based on Chuck Schumer\u2019s op-ed in the New York Times explaining his decision to get out of the way and let the House-passed spending bill come to the floor, he made it some time ago. Nothing in his series of rationalizations was new. If, indeed, \u201ca shutdown would be the best distraction Donald Trump could ask for from his awful agenda,\u201d while enabling the administration to exert even more unbridled power over federal programs and personnel, that was true a week ago or a month ago as well. So Schumer\u2019s big mistake was leading Senate Democrats right up to the brink of a collision with the administration and the GOP, and then surrendering after drawing enormous attention to his party\u2019s fecklessness.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just look bad and feel bad for Democrats demanding that their leaders do something to stop the Trump locomotive: It also gives the supreme bully in the White House incentive to keep bullying them, as Josh Marshall points out in his postmortem on the debacle:\n\n[P]eople who get hit and abused and take it tend to get hit and abused again and again. That\u2019s all the more true with Donald Trump, a man who can only see the world through the prism of the dominating and the dominated. It is a great folly to imagine that such an abject acquiescence won\u2019t drive him to up the ante.\n\nThe reality is that this spending measure was the only leverage point congressional Democrats had this year (unless Republicans are stupid enough not to wrap the debt-limit increase the government must soon have in a budget reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered). Everyone has known that since the new administration and the new Congress took office in January. If a government shutdown was intolerable, then Democrats should have taken it off the table long before the House voted on a CR. Punchbowl News got it right:\n\nLet\u2019s be blunt here: Democrats picked a fight they couldn\u2019t win and caved without getting anything in return. \u2026\n\nHere\u2019s the lesson from this episode: When you have no cards, fold them early.\n\nInstead, Democrats have taken a defeat and turned it into a debacle. House and Senate Democrats are divided from each other, and a majority of Senate Democrats are all but shaking their fists at their own leader, who did in fact lead them down a blind alley. While perhaps the federal courts will rein in the reign of terror presently underway in Washington (or perhaps they won\u2019t), congressional Democrats must now become resigned to laying the groundwork for a midterm election that seems a long time away and hoping something is left of the edifice of a beneficent federal government built by their predecessors from the New Deal to the Great Society to Obamacare. There\u2019s a good chance a decisive majority of the general public will eventually recoil from the misrule of the Trump administration and its supine allies in Congress and across the country. But at this point, elected Democrats are going to have to prove they should be trusted to lead the opposition."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s high-profile effort to transfer migrants from the United States to the Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is being buffeted by concerns inside and outside his administration over living conditions there and the arduous, expensive process of making it a suitable site for deportees.\n\nLast month, the administration took the unprecedented step of sending migrants to Guantanamo Bay on US military aircraft, sparking fierce backlash from immigrant advocates and prompting a lawsuit from immigrant advocacy groups. The last flight by military aircraft to Guantanamo Bay was March 1, a US official told CNN, and there are no DOD flights to the base expected in the coming days.\n\nAs of Thursday, there were no migrants detained at the Naval base, and 40 people were flown back to the US this week, the official said. CNN reported in February that plans to house migrants in tents were being halted amid concerns the structures didn\u2019t meet detention standards required by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAmid those stumbles, the administration has already spent roughly $16 million on the operation, according to Democrat Rep. Sara Jacobs, who visited the base last week as part of a congressional delegation visit.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw really was that there is very low capacity there, and it\u2019s really expensive, and I could see no operational reasons for using Guantanamo Bay for immigration detention,\u201d Jacobs told CNN. \u201cIt was clearly just because Donald Trump liked the optics.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department declined to comment for this article and referred further questions to ICE. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\ufeffLegal challenges have been filed to the administration\u2019s plans for Guantanamo, but on Friday, a federal judge rejected requests for emergency intervention in a lawsuit dealing with the legality of using the military base for immigration detention. In a second case, the judge zeroed in on issues detainees have had accessing legal counsel there. The rulings from US District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump-appointee, hung largely on the fact that there are currently no immigrants with final removal orders being held at the base, though he signaled that the challengers might have other issues in their case.\n\nStill, Nichols said there were \u201cserious questions\u201d about whether the administration had the authority to use Guantanamo for immigration detention purposes and made clear that some of the plaintiffs \u2013 10 immigrants being detained in the US with final removal orders who feared they could be transferred to Guantanamo \u2013 would be able to file new requests for quick judicial intervention if they were transferred to the base.\n\nFor weeks, federal agencies including the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security have scrambled to execute on Trump\u2019s direction to prepare to house up to 30,000 migrants \u2014 though the base can barely accommodate a fraction of that number. The current capacity is 225 people, according to Jacobs.\n\nJuan Lopez-Vega, ICE official who oversees the operations at Guantanamo, recently said in court records that a total of 290 migrants from multiple countries had been transferred to the base.\n\nIn late February, the administration deported 177 Venezuelan migrants \u2014 who were held in Guantanamo Bay after being transferred from the US \u2014 to Venezuela.\n\nThe US official told CNN that DOD and DHS recently signed a memorandum of understanding formalizing each department\u2019s role and DOD\u2019s support to ICE at Guantanamo.\n\nAnother US official described the facility as \u201cnot a primary course of action,\u201d saying instead that officials are looking more intently at using US military bases to house migrants.\n\nThe use of Guantanamo has also been cited in plans to detain migrants deemed to be dangerous, like members of criminal organizations including the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, one source said. The second US official also said it was likely the Naval base could be used for detaining cartel members. Tren de Aragua was recently designated a foreign terrorist organization and is the primary target for the expected use of a sweeping wartime authority.\n\nBut one of the sticking points facing officials has been trying to meet rigorous ICE detention standards, which outline requirements for facilities holding immigrants, and trepidation among contractors given the logistical challenges, one source said.\n\nJacobs told CNN that of the money spent by DOD, $3.1 million was spent solely on setting up tent structures, which ultimately were not in use and still not operational. As of now, the tents that were set up at the Naval base are expected to be left up for potential use during hurricane season, the second US official said.\n\nAside from the tents, Camp VI \u2014 the detention facility at Guantanamo \u2014 consists of single-person cells with toilets and sinks and has daily access to a communal day room, whereas the already-existing Migrant Operations Center is outfitted dormitory-style and allows outdoor recreation, according to court documents describing the facilities.\n\nConditions at the facilities have come under scrutiny. Some detainees have refused meals, which has led to weight loss, the US military officer overseeing the task force in charge of detention operations at Guantanamo Bay, Lt. Col. Robert Green, said in court documents. Green also said a restraint chair was used six times on February 28 \u2014 each time because of Venezuelan detainees who were engaging in self-harm.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ang\u00e9lica Franganillo-D\u00edaz and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAlan Simpson, a longtime Republican senator from Wyoming who championed bipartisan solutions and steadfastly advocated for a moderate blend of conservatism, has died. He was 93.\n\nSimpson died early Friday after struggling to recover from a broken hip in December, according to a statement from his family and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West provided to The Associated Press.\n\nSimpson, a man of blunt rhetoric whose towering 6-foot-7 stature made him an instantly recognizable figure on Capitol Hill, made a career of taking on difficult congressional assignments, bringing his signature candor to epic legislative battles.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Simpson was at the heart of seminal debates over environmental protection, nuclear regulation, and care for veterans \u2013 always injecting a healthy dose of humor to his work. \u201dIn your country club, your church and business, about 15% of the people are screwballs, lightweights and boobs, and you would not want those people unrepresented in Congress,\u201d he once said.\n\nSimpson largely aligned with his party on key votes and championed GOP prescriptions for social welfare rollbacks, immigration and foreign policy. But he wasn\u2019t afraid to cross party lines on pressing issues, as he supported abortion rights and was an early GOP advocate for same-sex marriage. \u201cI\u2019ve worked very closely with the gay-lesbian community; we\u2019re all human beings, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said in 2008.\n\nSimpson\u2019s support for same-sex marriage was especially apparent in a contentious interview with comedian Bill Maher in 2004 after Maher quipped that he\u2019d apologize to \u201cthe two gay people in Wyoming\u201d for a joke about gay Republican lawmakers.\n\n\u201cOh come on, pal. That\u2019s just bullsh*t,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to come on this program \u2013 I don\u2019t have to come on this program when Matthew Shepard was killed in this state and the people of this state were offended. So put that one in your pipe.\u201d\n\nSimpson was also a fierce supporter of federal support of the arts. \u201cIf you\u2019re just interested in politics alone, it\u2019s barbaric. That won\u2019t keep you alive,\u201d he once said.\n\n\u201cYou have to have the marvelous softening agents of books and letters and art and culture and theater, and I love that, and that\u2019s what Ann and I have always thoroughly supported and loved and independently and also politically.\u201d\n\nHis unapologetic nature attracted friendships as much as it challenged them. Simpson\u2019s decades-long alliance with former Vice President Dick Cheney, for example, survived a tense dispute with Cheney\u2019s wife, Lynne, who reportedly told Simpson to \u201cshut up\u201d at a reception in 2013. According to Simpson, the exchange took place after Cheney\u2019s granddaughter asked him to sign a football for charity but couldn\u2019t confirm if it would be used to raise money for Liz Cheney\u2019s Senate campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not out to hurt anyone,\u201d Simpson said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n\nSimpson is survived by his wife of 70 years, Ann, and their three children; Colin, Susan and William.\n\nA \u2018monster\u2019 in his youth\n\nBorn in Denver on September 2, 1931, Simpson grew up in Cody, Wyoming, a town of fewer than 10,000 people. His father, Milward Simpson, served in the Senate and as governor of Wyoming, while his mother, Lorna Kooi Simpson, served as president of the Cody Red Cross.\n\nA self-proclaimed \u201cmonster\u201d in his youth, Simpson was on federal probation for two years after shooting mailboxes with his friends. His behavior reached an inflection point after he says he \u201cbelted\u201d a police officer trying to arrest him after Simpson had shoved another man outside a pool hall. Simpson ended up in jail for a night in a \u201csea of puke and urine.\u201d\n\nSimpson, spurned from the experience, described a \u201ccreeping maturity\u201d that shifted the trajectory of his life. \u201cThe older you get, the more you realize \u2026 your own attitude is stupefying, and arrogant, and cocky, and a miserable way to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnybody in our society \u2212 unless they are totally out to lunch \u2212 can understand that a guy of 25 or 35 is not the same guy of 17. You can\u2019t just throw a kid in the clink forever.\u201d\n\nAfter completing high school in Cody, he graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1954 and earned his law degree from the school four years later.\n\nTwo years in the US Army and work as a private attorney would precede a winding political journey that began in earnest in 1965 when Simpson was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives, a post he would hold for more than a decade.\n\nSimpson would leverage those years, and his reputation for bringing life experiences to the job, into a successful Senate bid in 1978. The tallest senator in US history until 2017, Simpson served as Republican whip from 1985 to 1995 and was even considered a potential candidate for vice president in 1988.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a legislator. I love to legislate,\u201d he told the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center in 2008. \u201cPlotting, strategizing, philosophizing, those things mean nothing to me. I\u2019m a trigger guy. Give me an issue; let me wrench the emotion, fear, guilt, and racism out of it and get some facts into it and see if we can pass the son-of-a-bitch.\u201d\n\nSimpson declined to run for reelection in 1996 and went on to teach at Harvard University. But his years away from Capitol Hill didn\u2019t dull his disdain for partisanship. In 2010, he co-chaired a bipartisan Presidential Commission on deficit reduction alongside Democrat Erskine Bowles. The panel, created by then-President Barack Obama, was tasked with identifying policies to \u201cimprove the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run.\u201d\n\nWhile the group\u2019s plan failed to gain traction, Simpson\u2019s role in the effort vaulted him back into the political spotlight as a commanding voice on national debt, an issue he tried to impress upon young people.\n\n\u201cStop Instagramming your breakfast and tweeting your first world problems and getting on YouTube so you can see \u2018Gangnam Style,\u2019\u201d he said in a 2012 video in which the octogenarian hopped to the song in an effort to raise awareness about the national debt.\n\nIn a statement released after Simpson\u2019s death, former President George W. Bush described Simpson as \u201cone of the finest public servants ever to have graced our nation\u2019s capital\u201d and noted how the former senator delivered a eulogy at the funeral for his father, former President George H. W. Bush, in 2018.\n\n\u201cMy family will remember him best not for his many accomplishments, but for his loyal friendship \u2013 and sharp sense of humor,\u201d Bush said.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden cited Simpson\u2019s \u201cspirit\u201d when he presented his former Senate colleague with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in July 2022.\n\nIn this July 2022 photo, President Joe Biden presents former Sen. Alan Simpson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe allowed his conscience to be his guide. And he believed in forging real relationships even with people on the other side of the aisle, proving we can do anything when we work together as the United States of America,\u201d Biden said from the White House.\n\n\u201cIt matters, it matters, it matters. We need more of your spirit back in the United States Senate on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nIndeed, by the end of life, Simpson had also identified the growing political divide in Congress as a key threat to the nation\u2019s well-being, lamenting to CNN in 2018, \u201cYou can see the bitterness that goes on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see the fact that if they\u2019re a Democrat, you just ignore them, or if they\u2019re a Republican, you ignore them.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Michael Williams contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nWhen White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced at the very beginning of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term that new and independent media would be invited to play a big role in covering the administration, the collective eye roll from traditional media was as immediate as it was condescending.\n\nWe all remember Trump\u2019s first term, when his press conferences often devolved into a full-contact sport, with former CNN correspondent Jim Acosta wrestling a female White House aide for the microphone, for example, amid nothing but constant \"gotcha\" questions.\n\nMARK HALPERIN AND FORMER POLITICO REPORTER SCORCH \u2018LIBERAL MEDIA BIAS\u2019 ON NETWORKS LIKE MSNBC\n\nThe snarky back and forth from the media in those days created entertainment, but a lot more heat than light. The White House press in Trump\u2019s first term sought always to expose Trump for this or that, but almost never to truly understand the administration\u2019s policies.\n\nThere were exceptions, of course, such as your favorite cable news network, whose White House correspondents play it down the middle no matter who\u2019s in office. But in general, Trump faced a daily inquisition, while his successor, President Biden, more or less got a free pass throughout his abysmal four years as president.\n\nToday, the addition of independent outlets such as Epoch News, The Post Millennial, OAN, and others has transformed Trump\u2019s press availabilities from a hackling shouting match, into a substantive, almost daily discussion of the administration's actions and priorities.\n\nWith the exemption of the recalcitrant Associated Press, which has weirdly decided to die on the hill of defending the name \"Gulf of Mexico,\" all the old Trump haters from The New York Times to NBC News are still in the room; they just don\u2019t completely dominate it anymore.\n\nIf you listen to a news conference with Trump now, as opposed to five years ago, you do not come away with the impression that he is some sort of pariah who everyone hates and thinks is a liar. We have a full spectrum of media in there, and it has brought comity to the process, but there are still tough questions, too.\n\nDoes the new, mostly conservative, media in the White House toss up some softballs? Sure. Are the online thank yous to Leavitt for opening up the room a bit saccharine? Certainly.\n\nBut compared to what? A mainstream media that just nodded along as former White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told us Biden was fit as a fiddle and she was a very important historical figure? Spare me.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that outlets like the Daily Caller or even Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room, are no more biased to the right than NPR, a long-time staple in the Oval Office, is biased to the left, nor are they abnormal. Even super leftwing California Gov. Gavin Newson just had Bannon on his new podcast.\n\nFor four years, we had a White House press corps that, with the exception of Fox News and Real Clear Politics, ran cover for Biden and KJP. Even CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper is now out with a book, basically apologizing for the liberal media\u2019s horrible coverage of Grandpa Joe.\n\nSo if we all admit that the press did a terrible disservice to the American people with its one-sided and farcical coverage of Biden, then how can we complain that both sides of the American political divide are now represented in the room?\n\nSeventy percent of Americans do not trust journalism today, and for extremely good reasons like those outlined above. I'm a journalist, and even I don\u2019t trust journalism. But this fresh approach from the White House could be a step in restoring some level of trust.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nAmericans know when they are only getting one side of the story, we have a basic sense of fairness that rankles when we see the powerful put a thumb on the scale, and by inviting all perspectives in the room, the White House is allowing us to weigh arguments freely and fairly.\n\nI came up in independent conservative media, writing for outlets including The Federalist and The Daily Wire, which have unwavering commitments to honesty. Of course, they belong in the White House, and everyone is better off for their presence there.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo turn an old saying upside down, \"if it's broke, fix it,\" and the news media\u2019s coverage of the White House, for years now, has been badly broken, maybe, just maybe, these new and formerly banished voices in the Oval Office are just what we need to fix it."

            "full_content": "Former GOP Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a political legend whose quick wit bridged partisan gaps in the years before today's political acrimony, has died. He was 93.\n\nSimpson died early Friday after struggling to recover from a broken hip in December, according to a statement from his family and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, a group of museums where he was a board member for 56 years.\n\n\"He was an uncommonly generous man,\" Pete Simpson, his older brother, said in the statement. \"And I mean generous in an absolutely unconditional way. Giving of his time, giving of his energy \u2014 and he did it in politics and he did it in the family, forever.\"\n\nAlong with former Vice President Dick Cheney, Simpson was a towering Republican figure from Wyoming, the nation's least populated state.\n\nSimpson was famous for his humor and often quipped, \"We have two political parties in this country, the Stupid Party and the Evil Party. I belong to the Stupid Party.\"\n\nA political moderate, Simpson's three terms as senator from 1979 to 1997 covered the Republican Party's rejuvenation under President Ronald Reagan. Simpson played a key role rallying GOP senators around the party's legislative agenda as a top Senate leader during that time.\n\nSimpson was better known for holding his own views, though, with sometimes caustic certainty. A deficit hawk with sharp descriptions of people who relied on government assistance, Simpson supported abortion rights.\n\nHis Democratic friends included Robert Reich, who was labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Norman Mineta, the transportation secretary under President George W. Bush.\n\nSimpson and Mineta met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyoming, during World War II.\n\nAfter leaving politics, both promoted awareness of the incarceration of some 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in camps during the war. Mineta, who died in 2022, recalled that Simpson once was asked what was the biggest difference between them as a Republican and a Democrat.\n\n\"Alan thought about it and he said, 'Well, I wear size 15 shoes and he wears a size 8 and a half,'\" Mineta replied, according to the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation.\n\nSimpson was \"gifted in crossing party lines and building bipartisan consensus,\" Colin Simpson, one of his three children and a former Wyoming House speaker, said in the statement.\n\n\"Dad and Pete have anchored the extended Simpson family for decades with the same love, humor, compassion and dedication their parents did before them,\" he said. \"Dad was a mighty force and with Mom's steady hand by his side we are so blessed and proud to have been along for the ride of a lifetime.\"\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama tasked Simpson with co-leading a debt-reduction commission that developed a plan to save $4 trillion through tax hikes and spending cuts. The plan lacked support for serious consideration by Congress.\n\nAt 6-foot-7, Simpson was literally a towering figure \u2014 tallest on record in the Senate until Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who is 6-foot-9, took office in 2017.\n\nBig as Simpson's shoes were, he had huge ones to fill politically.\n\nHis father, Milward Simpson, was a governor, U.S. senator and state legislator. His mother, Lorna Kooi Simpson, was president of the Red Cross in Cody and on the local planning commission.\n\n\"I saw Dad loved politics and the law, and I wanted to do that,\" Simpson once said.\n\nSimpson was born in Denver in 1931. After a childhood of reckless gun-shooting and vandalism in Cody that put him in danger and in trouble with the law, he graduated from Cody High School in 1949 and the University of Wyoming in 1954.\n\nAlso that year he married Ann Schroll, of Greybull, Wyoming, and joined the U.S. Army, where he served in the Fifth Infantry Division and the Second Armored \"Hell on Wheels\" Division in Germany.\n\nAlan and Ann Simpson celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary with a community ice cream social attended by relatives and hundreds of others in a Cody park last summer.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Simpson got a law degree from the University of Wyoming in 1958 and joined his father's law practice, where he worked for the next 19 years. He was elected to the Wyoming House in 1964 and served there until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1976.\n\nA football and basketball athlete at the University of Wyoming, Simpson fondly described politics as a \"contact sport.\"\n\n\"I've been called everything,\" he said in 2003. \"What the hell. If you don't like the combat, get out.\"\n\nSimpson's candor made him popular with voters. He also was known as a well-read, hardworking and sometimes hard-nosed politician involved in immigration, veterans' affairs and environmental issues.\n\nHe served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.\n\nSimpson opposed sentences of life without parole for juveniles and said he supported review of criminal sentences after a period of time.\n\n\"When they get to be 30 or 40 and they been in the clink for 20 years, or 30 or 40, and they have learned how to read and how to do things, why not?\" he told The Associated Press in 2009.\n\nBy 1995, he'd had enough of the Senate and decided not to run again.\n\n\"Part of me said I could do this for another three or four years but not six,\" he said at the time. \"The old fire in the belly is out. The edge is off.\"\n\nOthers of his family in politics and government included his older brother, Pete, a University of Wyoming historian who served in the Wyoming House and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor in 1986. Alan Simpson's son Colin was speaker of the Wyoming House, and his nephew Milward Simpson directed the state parks department.\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he often urged college students to be politically involved.\n\nUS President Joe Biden presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Alan Simpson, former US Senator from Wyoming, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., US, on Thursday, July 7, 2022.

Simpson has died at age 93. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nCHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, a political legend whose quick wit bridged partisan gaps in the years before today\u2019s political acrimony, has died. He was 93.\n\nSimpson died early Friday after struggling to recover from a broken hip in December, according to a statement from his family and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, a group of museums where he was a board member for 56 years.\n\n\u201cHe was an uncommonly generous man,\u201d Pete Simpson, his older brother, said in the statement. \u201cAnd I mean generous in an absolutely unconditional way. Giving of his time, giving of his energy \u2014 and he did it in politics and he did it in the family, forever.\u201d\n\nAlong with former Vice President Dick Cheney, Simpson was a towering Republican figure from Wyoming, the least-populated state. Unlike Cheney, Simpson was famous for his humor.\n\n\u201cWe have two political parties in this country, the Stupid Party and the Evil Party. I belong to the Stupid Party,\u201d was among Simpson\u2019s many well-known quips.\n\nA political moderate by current standards, Simpson\u2019s three terms as senator from 1979 to 1997 covered the Republican Party\u2019s rejuvenation under President Ronald Reagan. Simpson played a key role rallying GOP senators around the party\u2019s legislative agenda as a top Senate leader during that time.\n\nSimpson was better known for holding his own views, though, with sometimes caustic certainty. A deficit hawk with sharp descriptions of people who relied on government assistance, Simpson supported abortion rights \u2014 an example of moderation that contributed to his fade in the GOP.\n\nHis Democratic friends included Robert Reich, labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Norman Mineta, transportation secretary under President George W. Bush.\n\nSimpson and Mineta met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson\u2019s hometown of Cody, Wyoming, during World War II.\n\nAfter leaving politics, both promoted awareness of the incarceration of some 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in camps during the war. Mineta, who died in 2022, recalled that Simpson once was asked what was the biggest difference between them as a Republican and a Democrat.\n\n\u201cAlan thought about it and he said, \u2018Well, I wear size 15 shoes and he wears a size 8 and a half,\u2019\u201d Mineta replied, according to the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation.\n\nSimpson was \u201cgifted in crossing party lines and building bipartisan consensus,\" Colin Simpson, one of his three children and a former Wyoming House speaker, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cDad and Pete have anchored the extended Simpson family for decades with the same love, humor, compassion and dedication their parents did before them,\" he said. \u201cDad was a mighty force and with Mom\u2019s steady hand by his side we are so blessed and proud to have been along for the ride of a lifetime.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama tasked Simpson with co-leading a debt-reduction commission that developed a plan to save $4 trillion through tax hikes and spending cuts. The plan lacked support for serious consideration by Congress.\n\nAt 6-foot-7, Simpson was literally a towering figure \u2014 tallest on record in the Senate until Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who is 6-foot-9, took office in 2017.\n\nBig as Simpson\u2019s shoes were, he had huge ones to fill politically.\n\nHis father, Milward Simpson, was a governor, U.S. senator and state legislator. His mother, Lorna Kooi Simpson, was president of the Red Cross in Cody and on the local planning commission.\n\n\u201cI saw Dad loved politics and the law, and I wanted to do that,\u201d Simpson once said.\n\nSimpson was born in Denver in 1931. After a childhood of reckless gun-shooting and vandalism in Cody that put him in danger and in trouble with the law, he graduated from Cody High School in 1949 and the University of Wyoming in 1954.\n\nAlso that year he married Ann Schroll, of Greybull, Wyoming, and joined the U.S. Army, where he served in the Fifth Infantry Division and the Second Armored \u201cHell on Wheels\u201d Division in Germany.\n\nAlan and Ann Simpson celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary with a community ice cream social attended by relatives and hundreds of others in a Cody park last summer.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Simpson got a law degree from the University of Wyoming in 1958 and joined his father\u2019s law practice, where he worked for the next 19 years. He was elected to the Wyoming House in 1964 and served there until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1976.\n\nA football and basketball athlete at the University of Wyoming, Simpson fondly described politics as a \u201ccontact sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called everything,\u201d he said in 2003. \u201cWhat the hell. If you don\u2019t like the combat, get out.\u201d\n\nSimpson\u2019s candor made him popular with voters. He also was known as a well-read, hardworking and sometimes hard-nosed politician involved in immigration, veterans\u2019 affairs and environmental issues.\n\nHe served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.\n\nSimpson opposed sentences of life without parole for juveniles and said he supported review of criminal sentences after a period of time.\n\n\u201cWhen they get to be 30 or 40 and they been in the clink for 20 years, or 30 or 40, and they have learned how to read and how to do things, why not?\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2009.\n\nBy 1995, he\u2019d had enough of the Senate and decided not to run again.\n\n\u201cPart of me said I could do this for another three or four years but not six,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThe old fire in the belly is out. The edge is off.\u201d\n\nOthers of his family in politics and government included his older brother, Pete, a University of Wyoming historian who served in the Wyoming House and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor in 1986. Alan Simpson\u2019s son Colin was speaker of the Wyoming House, and his nephew Milward Simpson directed the state parks department.\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he often urged college students to be politically involved.\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden awarded Simpson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nSimpson is survived by his wife, Ann; his brother Pete Simpson; sons Colin Simpson and William Simpson; and daughter Susan Simpson Gallagher."

Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters/File\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to invoke a sweeping wartime authority to speed up the president\u2019s mass deportation pledge in the coming days, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe little-known 18th-century law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, gives the president tremendous authority to target and remove undocumented immigrants, though legal experts have argued it would face an uphill battle in court.\n\nCNN previously reported that the authority was being widely discussed at several agencies as administration officials prepared to implement the law. The primary target remains Tren de Aragua (TDA) , a Venezuelan organized crime group that is now operating in the United States and other countries and was recently designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nAt the start of his term, Trump had ordered his administration to designate TDA as a foreign terrorist organization and use the measure to remove those identified as members.\n\nThe announcement, which could come as soon as Friday, has been a moving target as officials finalize the details. The move would likely pave the way for quicker removals of certain immigrants.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nMore about the law: It\u2019s designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so. Legal experts say it would be difficult for Trump to use the act when the US isn\u2019t being attacked by a foreign government, even if the administration does cite threats from gangs or cartels.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has been invoked three times in US history \u2014 all during war \u2014 according to the Brennan Center. During World Wars I and II, it was used to justify detentions and expulsions of German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian and Japanese immigrants. The law played a role in the infamous US policy of Japanese internment during World War II, according to the nonpartisan law and policy institute."

Tim Walz, D-Minn., is hosting town halls in Republican-held congressional districts in Iowa and Nebraska, following reports that the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) told Republicans in Congress to stop holding in-person town hall meetings.\n\nThe Republicans in those districts told Fox News Digital that Walz has some questions to answer of his own.\n\nThe Minnesota governor is holding a town hall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday morning \u2013 Republican Rep. Don Bacon\u2019s home congressional district. The event\u2019s digital flier said they will discuss \"Trump and Musk's cuts to critical programs from Medicaid and SNAP to our national parks.\"\n\n\"Don Bacon is not holding an in-person town hall. Nebraska Democrats are stepping up and taking action,\" the flier said. But Bacon fired back in a statement to Fox News Digital, urging Walz to answer for the inconsistencies in his record that plagued his 2024 campaign alongside former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWALZ IS BACK IN MINNESOTA WITH $1M IN THE BANK AND 'WANTS THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT'\n\n\"First, Nebraska Democrats brought in Bernie Sanders, the most liberal Senator, to the district. Now they\u2019re bringing in the most liberal Governor in America. Perhaps at the townhall, Gov. Walz can finally clarify what Army rank he actually retired at and when the supposed combat deployment he used to talk about occurred. If he wants to call into our townhall, he can answer these questions,\" Bacon added.\n\nAOC 'GOING ON THE OFFENSE' TO RALLY RED-DISTRICT VOTERS AGAINST TRUMP: REPORT\n\nOn Friday, Walz is hosting a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, where Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, has represented the state's 3rd Congressional District in the House of Representatives since 2023. The Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s fundraising flier for the event alleges \"Zach Nunn has refused to host a public town hall since he was sworn into office in 2023.\" Nunn took aim at the Democrats, in response to the town hall, for calling \"a fundraiser a forum.\"\n\n\"The American people spoke loud and clear in November\u2014they voted for change. I\u2019m delivering to: secure the border, unleash US energy, and cut taxes for working Americans. If out-of-state Democrats want to call a fundraiser a \u2018forum,\u2019 they should join us at our listening sessions, where Iowans help drive real results. Next week, I begin my Air Force Reserve duty\u2014I hope the Senate avoids a Schumer Shutdown, so our troops continue to get paid,\" Nunn said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\nWalz's office did not reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment on his upcoming town halls.\n\nThe NRCC, the political campaign committee tasked with electing more Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, advised against town halls following a series of disruptions by Democrats' discontent with President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nWalz announced on Wednesday if a Republican representative refused to meet with his constituents, then he would \"lend a megaphone\" to the red state constituents.\n\n\"I\u2019m hitting the road, traveling to red states across the country to lend a megaphone to the people. Your congressman may not want to listen, but they\u2019re going to hear from us anyway,\" Walz said in a post on Wednesday.\n\nThe NRCC said the protests that shut down Republicans' town hall meetings were \"manufactured productions.\" Fox News Digital reported last month about the coordinated effort by progressive groups protesting the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMEET THE FAR-LEFT GROUPS FUNDING ANTI-DOGE PROTESTS AT GOP OFFICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY\n\n\"The Democrat Party has sold themselves out to the far-left crazies and their mega-donors who are funding these clown show protests. This isn\u2019t grassroots \u2014 it\u2019s manufactured productions, orchestrated to distract voters from the Democrats\u2019 failed and out of touch record. Sending out Tampon Tim won\u2019t solve the Democrats\u2019 \u2018massive brand problem,\u2019 despite what they may think,\" Mike Marinella, NRCC National Press Secretary, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\nMoveOn.org, which has accepted millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Policy Center, announced in a press release last month that it was mobilizing resources as part of a \"Congress Works for Us, Not Musk\" initiative \"aimed at pressuring lawmakers to fight back against the Trump-Musk agenda.\"\n\n\"MoveOn members and allies will show up at congressional-led town halls and congressional offices across the country, targeting House Republicans whose votes will be crucial in opposing Trump and Musk\u2019s harmful policies,\" MoveOn.org said in the press release.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., kicked off his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour in Omaha last month. Sanders drew thousands of supporters to his stops in Michigan and Wisconsin this past weekend as the Vermont senator stands out as the leading progressive voice opposing Trump\u2019s second term. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has reportedly started planning her own rallies in Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nWalz teased his red state tour in a post last week, promising to host events in Republican-held congressional districts \"to help local Democrats beat \u2018em.\"\n\n\"If your Republican representative won\u2019t meet with you because their agenda is so unpopular, maybe a Democrat will. Hell, maybe I will. If your congressman refuses to meet, I\u2019ll come host an event in their district to help local Democrats beat \u2018em,\" Walz said in the post.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that town hall protests should be the \"first clue\" that Republicans \"should drop their terrible agenda.\"\n\n\"Americans are organizing in public, and Republicans have seen these frustrations at town halls. That should be the first clue that they should drop their terrible agenda. When a lead Republican in the House tells Republicans, you better cancel your town halls, they're running away from their policies and priorities,\" Schumer said.\n\nNRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told reporters it was a \"shame that the Democrats are threats to democracy by disrupting this dialogue\" at town halls. Hudson also emphasized the expanded reach of tele-town halls, where representatives can meet with thousands of constituents at a time.\n\nDEMOCRATS ARE MAKING EARLY MOVES TO LINE UP 2028 PRESIDENTIAL BIDS\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson told reporters last week that town hall protesters could be paid professionals.\n\n\"George Soros-funded groups and others literally pay protesters,\" Johnson said. \"Democratic activists who don't live in the district very often will show up for these town hall events, and they'll go in an hour early and fill all the seats, and so the constituents and the people from the community that are actually represented don't even get a seat.\"\n\n\"There are people who do this as a profession. They're professional protesters. So why would we give them a forum to do that? Right now, the best thing that our members can do is communicate directly, frequently, consistently with their constituents. There are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side soundbites. I mean, they're doing this for the cameras. We all know it,\" Johnson added.\n\nTrump also dismissed the protesters as \"paid troublemakers\" in a Truth Social post.\n\n\"Paid \u2018troublemakers\u2019 are attending Republican Town Hall Meetings. It is all part of the game for the Democrats, but just like our big LANDSLIDE ELECTION, it\u2019s not going to work for them!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries shut down Trump and Johnson\u2019s claims in a video message posted last week, saying, \"We don't need paid protesters, bro. The American people are with us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm told that Donald Trump, Mike Johnson and the extreme MAGA Republicans are claiming that Democrats are sending paid protesters into their town hall meetings. What's wrong with y'all? What's wrong with y'all? You don't need to send paid protesters into your town hall meetings.

            "full_content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s no better example of where the newly applied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel will be felt than craft brewers, an industry that uses both materials in all facets of production and sales.\n\nAnd for Wesley Keegan, owner and founder of Nashville-based TailGate Brewery, the implementation of the tariffs will have swift effects on his business. \u201cEverything costs more,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe get a price increase letter just immediately from every supplier.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump enacted a new round of tariffs on the raw metals. Since much of it comes from abroad, US companies \u2014 small and large \u2014 that rely on steel and aluminum may have to pass on the cost of those tariffs to consumers.\n\nBut specifically how much more Keegan\u2019s customers will pay for a 6-pack of his brewery\u2019s ciders, stouts and lagers isn\u2019t clear just yet. He admits that businesses like TailGate have to be \u201cwilling to take the haircut\u201d in terms of profits.\n\n\u201cThe hard piece is juggling the reality that you can\u2019t be in business if you\u2019re not making money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then you also have to continue to take those price changes on the chin because the consumer is only willing to give you so much.\u201d\n\nKeegan said that TailGate tries to \u201cabsorb\u201d as much as it can, but beyond tariffs \u201cthere is not a single input in our industry that hasn\u2019t increased prices every single year for the last five years.\u201d\n\nMounting issues\n\nIt\u2019s been a difficult several few years for craft brewers.\n\nThe pandemic sapped the lifeblood \u2014 taproom sales \u2014 from many operations, forcing them to lean more heavily on to-go vessels such as cans and bottles. Then, global supply chain challenges caused shortages and drastic price hikes of key inputs, including cans, which already were getting more expensive following the 2018 tariffs.\n\nPlus, the breweries that are still standing were then stung by a shift in consumers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 palates for beverages beyond beer.\n\nAll of those were lessons for how Keegan operates TailGate, a 10-year-old company that has gradually expanded to nine taprooms across Tennessee.\n\nAn exterior view of a TailGate location. Courtesy TailGate Brewery\n\nOne aspect of his business that changed post Covid-19 was the sourcing of aluminum. Before 2020, the primary source was Canada, but he has since diversified to additional places, including China, the US and even Jordan.\n\nAnd now, the aluminum industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation, with some companies shifting to only working with major brewers such as Anheuser-Busch InBev or being bought by other manufacturers, resulting in a decline in smaller brewers to work with third-party companies that hunt and source aluminum on a global scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the functions of the last round of tariffs, plus Covid-19, has been that it\u2019s introduced a third party to the equation where we\u2019re frankly just too small,\u201d Keegan said. \u201cEven though we buy a lot of cans and we\u2019re a pretty sizable brewery, they don\u2019t want to talk to us \u2026 we\u2019re so small, it\u2019s just annoying for them.\u201d\n\nTrouble with tariffs\n\nTaprooms have evolved into a \u201cthird place\u201d for communities, and naturally a place where the day\u2019s topics are discussed \u2014 like tariffs. Operating in Tennessee, which overwhelmingly voted for Trump and his policies, can be difficult for a small business that is constantly battling constantly changing regulations that could hurt places like TailGate, but Keegan keeps politics out of it.\n\n\u201cThis state voted for this administration, and if they see the headlines, and the tariffs and things like that, they still don\u2019t want to feel the effects of something like an aluminum increase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change what they\u2019re rooting for, but it does mean they don\u2019t want to be paying any more either.\u201d\n\nTailGate, as well as 9,000 other small and independent brewers, are part of the Brewers Association, which has been more vocal in its displeasure with tariffs. The group said in a statement to CNN that the tariffs \u201ccould place a significant financial burden on brewers, many of whom rely on imported materials, ingredients, and equipment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese proposed tariffs could have far-reaching implications for brewers, consumers, and local economies, as they\u2019re likely to further increase the cost of craft beer, erode brewer margins, or a combination of both,\u201d a BA spokesperson said."

            "full_content": "FIRST ON FOX \u2013 GOP state attorneys general previewed their upcoming meeting Friday at the Department of Justice, where President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi will discuss collaborating with state top cops to combat crime.\n\nFox News Digital is told much of the conversation is expected to focus on fighting the scourge of fentanyl in communities.\n\nTrump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday previewing his Justice Department speech. He nodded to problems faced in cities, such as subway violence. \"We don't want to have crime in the streets. We don't want to have people pushed into subways and killed,\" Trump said. \"We want to have safety in our cities, as well as in our communities, and we'll be talking about immigration. We'll be talking about a lot of things. The complete gamut.\"\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares championed Bondi's \"proactive\" approach, saying he had received more calls from the DOJ in Trump's first 30 days in office than he did in his prior three years of service under the Biden administration.\n\n\"They keep open lines of communication. Whereas, before, the only time I ever heard from Merrick Garland was if he was trying to sue Virginia for some reason,\" Miyares told Fox News Digital.\n\nMiyares said he viewed the fentanyl epidemic as both a national security and domestic challenge, citing how an average of 105,000 Americans were dying every 12 months of addiction deaths at the peak of the crisis. By contrast, over 50,000 Americans died in the Vietnam War over the course of 15 years. \"It was two Vietnam wars happening every 12 months in this country to absolutely devastating impact. Virginia was not lost on that,\" Miyares said.\n\nFENTANYL'S FINANCIAL GRIP ON US SKYROCKETED TO $2.7T AT HEIGHT OF BIDEN ADMIN: STUDY\n\nVirginia has seen a 40% reduction in addiction deaths since 2021, one of the most significant drops in the country, Miyares said, arguing he and Gov. Glenn Youngkin's three-prong approach of prosecution, prevention and treatment can be applied nationally. He noted that Trump's nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, is currently serving as Virginia\u2019s Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security.\n\n\"He's going to be an exceptional, exceptional head of a DEA,\" Miyares said. \"He knows what we've done in Virginia because he's been part of it. I look forward to seeing him bring that nationwide.\"\n\nMiyares praised Trump's Inauguration Day executive order designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. As for the Biden administration, Miyares said he \"never felt that they took it as seriously.\" He said one federal agent told him the Biden administration discouraged posting about drug busts online, describing the attitude at the top of the bureaucracy as signaling,[ \"We don't want to admit we have a drug problem in this country.\"\n\n\"It was almost like an ostrich with its head in the sand. The other problem was the border. More fentanyl was crossing our southern border in one year to kill every man, woman and child in America three or four times over. It was staggering,\" Miyares said. \"The reality is the Sinaloa Cartel is the single most dangerous criminal enterprise, I would argue, in the history of the world, they have a reach that is staggering.\"\n\n\"It was President Trump who has declared the cartels a foreign terrorist organization. The Biden administration could have done so,\" Miyares said. \"These were criminal enterprises that, in my opinion, were conducting chemical warfare on everyday Americans to levels that we don't see even lost in war or happening to our kids, our friends and our neighbors. They are terrorist organizations.\"\n\nWith Democrats having lost control of both houses of Congress, Democratic attorneys general have led their party's charge against the Trump administration's agenda on a number of issues, including immigration. Miyares urged fellow state top cops across the aisle to \"lock arms and work together\" when it comes to the fentanyl epidemic, because \"it affects every American Republican or Democrat, red state or blue state.\"\n\n\"Make sure you do that partnership so we can save lives, because our real enemy is not the other political party,\" he said. \"Our real enemy are the cartels and these dealers poisoning our kids.\"\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday told Fox News Digital that keeping families together is a crucial component to public safety. He also said that Republicans must have a greater presence in inner cities long controlled by Democrats.\n\n\"The only way that we can maximize outcomes to keep people safe in this country is when we all work together. And having a Justice Department that's aligned with my philosophy of public safety, that without safe communities, nothing else matters, it puts us in a position where we can take that collaboration to the next level,\" Sunday said. \"Citizens have the absolute right to demand that their government works to keep them safe.\"\n\n\"As I go into this meeting tomorrow, I view this through a positive lens. This is an opportunity for us,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This epidemic not only is killing people. It's destroying our economy, and it's tearing families apart. And that's one of the absolute worst parts of this. You know that the family in America is one of the most crucial components to a thriving community and public safety.\"\n\n\"When you have addiction permeating our community, that tears families apart. And it's something that I absolutely do not want to see,\" Sunday said. \"Local law enforcement cannot do the job by themselves.\"\n\nSENATE DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'LL OPPOSE GOP FUNDING BILL AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINE LOOMS\n\nHe said from his experience as a local prosecutor that some of the \"most painful meetings I've ever had are with parents who've lost their children to addiction.\"\n\n\"The thought of having to watch a child slip away into the web of addiction and become someone that's not even, you know, the person that you knew. It's so gut-wrenching,\" he said.\n\nSunday said part of the conservative values important to him is \"keeping families together,\" explaining that he views his role as a father as \"my most important job.\" And fatherhood and family can be applied through a public safety lens. \"There's a lot of kids out there, especially in violent communities, that don't have any mentorship. They don't have anyone that looks after them,\" Sunday said.\n\nSunday praised the Trump administration's prioritization of border security, noting that fentanyl coming across from Mexico \"takes probably less than maybe 24 hours to arrive here in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nAs Pennsylvania experienced the turning of a red tide in the last election, Sunday said his focus as attorney general included inner cities plagued by open-air drug markets and other quality of life concerns. He spoke to Fox News Digital on Thursday from Philadelphia, where he was getting ready to attend the mayor's budget address \"so that people see the Republican attorney general is a part of Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"I'm here, and I'm not going away, and my resources are going to be here, and they're not going away because the citizens in Philadelphia have every right to demand that I work hard for them, just like anyone else,\" Sunday said. \"When you have, you know, one party like the Democrat control over a city like this, without the influence, you know, of, I'll say, a Republican prosecutor, that creates a situation like we've dealt with.\"\n\nSunday said he values both holding people accountable and redemption programs. A former district attorney in York County, Pennsylvania, which sits outside of Baltimore, Maryland, he said he worked every single day with the Black Ministers Association and with Latino organizations \"because they're victims of crime, just like everyone's a victim of crime.\"\n\n\"We live in this world right now where, you know, people make judgments about other people solely based on, you know, their political party,\" Sunday said. \"And there are a lot of citizens here that probably have never dealt with a Republican attorney general, even physically being here . . . I have seen amazing things happen when people talk to each other.\"\n\nAhead of Friday's meeting at the DOJ, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey championed the Trump administration's crackdown on China in fighting the fentanyl crisis.\n\n\"We must address the fentanyl crisis at its source and hold China accountable. They continue to supply Mexican drug cartels and terrorist organizations with the necessary components for fentanyl production, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands and causing untold suffering in our communities,\" Bailey said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Our recent $25 billion judgment against China for unleashing COVID-19 on the world is just one example of how attorneys general across the nation can begin fighting back against foreign actors who threaten our way of life.\"\n\nMississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch also applauded Trump \"for using tariffs as tools to take decisive action against the fentanyl crisis and put Americans\u2019 safety and our national security first.\"\n\n\"In Mississippi, we are primed and ready to partner with him,\" Fitch told Fox News Digital. \"We are raising awareness of the dangers of fentanyl and equipping citizens with the knowledge and tools to stop an overdose with our One Pill Can Kill Campaign. We are creating a network of law enforcement through our Fentanyl Strike Force to get this deadly drug and its dealers off the streets.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement to Fox News Digital that \"fentanyl has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and kills thousands more Tennesseans each year, a death toll that demands an uncompromising response.\" He said he was grateful that Trump and Bondi \"recognize the urgency of this crisis and are acting forcefully to save lives.\""

            "full_content": "Photo: Barry Williams/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nEric Adams is more than happy to be the Justice Department\u2019s yo-yo. Keep me on a string, bounce me back and forth, do what you will, the mayor\u2019s legal position goes, just so long as you dismiss my indictment and don\u2019t bring it back.\n\nThis remains the key point of contention as we play out the endgame of the Adams legal saga. It\u2019s now all but certain the Adams indictment will be dismissed, as both he and the new Justice Department leadership have requested. The only remaining question is whether the Trump administration can keep Adams dangling as its well-placed institutional plaything.\n\nQuick recap: The U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York in September 2024 indicted Adams for bribery, conspiracy, and federal election crimes primarily related to his acceptance of financial benefits from Turkish nationals in return for official favors. The case seemed sound, if not quite overwhelming; a trial jury could have come out either way.\n\nBut when the Trump administration took over in early 2025, acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove \u2014 former SDNY prosecutor and, more recently, Trump\u2019s criminal defense lawyer \u2014 ordered the SDNY to dismiss the indictment. Bove acknowledged that he had reached his conclusion \u201cwithout assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\u201d Rather, the new DOJ honcho explained, the prosecution \u201cunduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019s ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime\u201d in New York City, in furtherance of the president\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nThere\u2019s the crux of the problem: For the first time in modern history \u2014 perhaps ever \u2014 federal prosecutors explicitly gave a criminal defendant a free pass because he promised to support the president\u2019s political agenda. The SDNY\u2019s conservative, Trump-administration-appointed acting U.S. attorney, Danielle Sassoon, sharply rejected Bove\u2019s crooked order and resigned instead. \u201cI cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations,\u201d she wrote. At least a half-dozen other experienced prosecutors at the SDNY and Justice Department headquarters followed Sassoon out the door in protest.\n\nLast month, Judge Dale Ho called the parties into court to discuss the DOJ\u2019s unusual request; the federal rules of criminal procedure provide that a prosecutor must obtain \u201cleave of court\u201d \u2014 the judge\u2019s permission \u2014 to dismiss an indictment. The judge asked probing questions of Bove, who confirmed that the DOJ\u2019s decision was predicated on Adams\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s policy agenda \u2014 yet denied that there had been any quid pro quo between the parties. We are indeed rewarding Adams because of his political support and assistance, Bove explained, but not in (explicit) exchange for it. It\u2019s a mighty-thin tightrope.\n\nAt one ominous moment, Judge Ho asked whether a similar prosecution-for-politics calculation would apply to other cases involving public officials. \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d Bove confirmed. Apparently, this prosecution-for-politics approach will serve as a prototype for the new Trump DOJ. Wonderful news for all public officials: If you get indicted, you can always wriggle out of it by endorsing some unrelated Trump policy initiative.\n\nRecognizing that he had heard only from one side \u2014 Bove, Adams, and the defense team all heartily agreed on a dismissal, but Sassoon and other dissenters had no voice in the courtroom \u2014 Judge Ho took an unusual (but not unprecedented or unwarranted) step. He appointed Paul Clement, a respected conservative who served as U.S. solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, to study and report back on the knotty legal questions around whether and under what circumstances a judge must accept a request by the DOJ to dismiss an indictment.\n\nClement has now filed his report, and it is entirely sensible and well-supported in the law and logic. He concludes that \u201cneither the courts nor the citizenry can compel the executive to initiate a criminal prosecution,\u201d and judges are \u201cconstitutionally powerless to compel the government to proceed\u201d with a case that it wants to dismiss. Clement explains persuasively that, like it or not, it would violate core separation-of-powers principles for a judge to force prosecutors to carry on with a prosecution against the will of the executive branch.\n\nBut, critically, Clement concludes that the law does allow a judge to determine whether the DOJ can dismiss a case without prejudice (meaning the case can be refiled in the future) or with prejudice (meaning the case is dead for all time).\n\nThat\u2019s particularly important here, given that the DOJ insists that the Adams indictment be dismissed without prejudice. The Trump administration\u2019s plain intent is to keep the New York City mayor in line on immigration (and perhaps other) issues with a built-in enforcement mechanism for if he strays. Witness the Fox News cringefest wherein Trump \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan crowed, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come through, I\u2019ll be back in New York City, and we won\u2019t be sittin\u2019 on the couch, I\u2019ll be in his office, up his, up his butt, sayin\u2019, \u2018What the hell, where is the agreement we came to?\u2019\u201d Adams overlaughed nervously as Homan batted around his new plaything on national TV.\n\nClement called out the precise problem posed by the DOJ\u2019s proposal to keep Adams dangling: \u201cA dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution \u2026 could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the accused.\u201d Thus, Clement concluded, the Adams indictment should be dismissed with prejudice, ending the prosecution permanently and preventing the DOJ from resuscitating its case. Perversely (but probably correctly, legally), the law dictates that Adams must receive an even more valuable gift (dismissal with prejudice) than the one Bove initially meant to confer (dismissal without prejudice). It\u2019s good to be the mayor.\n\nWe should hear from the judge any day now, and I expect him to follow Clement\u2019s recommendation and dismiss the indictment with prejudice, effectively cutting the string that the DOJ would\u2019ve used to bounce Adams back and forth. But the whole saga reveals something deeper and more disturbing.\n\nAdams was willing to do absolutely anything necessary to escape the consequences of an indictment, including kissing up to the president, conforming the city\u2019s policies to please him and then offering himself up to the administration as a willing and pliable political operative moving forward. And the Justice Department was not content merely to reward Adams for his sycophancy. Rather, the Trump administration insisted on keeping control of the mayor, even beyond the end of the criminal case, by dangling the threat of a new prosecution.\n\nIf Judge Ho follows Clement\u2019s counsel and ends the case with prejudice, then at least the prospective political damage will be mitigated and Adams \u2014 and, by extension, the city he manages \u2013 won\u2019t remain completely in hock to the Trump administration. In a saga that has torpedoed the integrity of both Adams and the Justice Department, it\u2019s a small but vital consolation.\n\nThis article will also appear in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.

            "full_content": "The Trump administration unveiled new sanctions on Wednesday against an Iranian-linked Swedish gang that coordinated an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm in January 2024, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe sanctions freeze assets for members and those affiliated with the Foxtrot Network, a transnational criminal organization that the Treasury Department said is one of the most \"prominent\" drug trafficking organizations in the region. The sanctions also single out and target the group\u2019s fugitive leader, Rawa Majid.\n\n\"Iran\u2019s brazen use of transnational criminal organizations and narcotics traffickers underscores the regime\u2019s attempts to achieve its aims through any means, with no regard for the cost to communities across Europe,\" Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said in a Wednesday statement. \"Treasury, alongside our U.S. government and international partners, will continue to hold accountable those who seek to further Iran\u2019s thuggish and destabilizing agenda.\"\n\nTRUMP REINSTATES \u2018MAXIMUM PRESSURE\u2019 CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN\n\nIn addition to trafficking drugs, the Foxtrot Network is a criminal organization that conducts violent acts, including shootings, contract killings and assaults, and is responsible for increased violence in Sweden. It is notorious for employing teenagers to conduct these violent acts, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nIran has increasingly utilized criminal networks to conduct attacks targeting the U.S. as well as attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets in Europe, the Treasury Department said.\n\nFor example, the agency accused Iran of colluding with the Foxtrot Network to conduct an attack on the Israeli Embassy in 2024 after Swedish officials identified a \"dangerous object\" believed to be an explosive device at the embassy. While security forces neutralized the device, Sweden\u2019s security police moved to investigate the attack as a \"terrorist crime,\" according to Reuters.\n\nThe Treasury Department also said on Wednesday that Majid has coordinated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, which is already under U.S. sanctions, and faces charges in Sweden pertaining to narcotics and firearms trafficking.\n\nThe White House referred Fox News Digital to the Treasury and State Department's statements on the sanctions.\n\nThe sanctions against Majid and the Foxtrot Network align with President Donald Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign against Iran, which he reinstated in February through a series of sanctions aimed at sinking Iran\u2019s oil exports.\n\nTRUMP SAYS \u2018SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN VERY SOON' WITH IRAN AS HE PUSHES TO NEGOTIATE NUCLEAR DEAL\n\nTrump signaled Friday a nuclear deal with Iran could emerge shortly, and he revealed that he sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to push for Tehran to agree to a nuclear agreement. Otherwise, he said Tehran could count on facing military consequences.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I would rather negotiate a deal,\" Trump told Fox Business in an interview Sunday. \"I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily.\"\n\n\"But the time is happening now, the time is coming up,\" he said. \"Something is going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran, and I've written them a letter saying I hope you're going to negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them.\""

A federal judge has ordered the government not to remove Khalil from the United States while his case is pending. We will see what happens next.\n\nThe Trump administration has not been subtle about its intentions. A White House official, speaking anonymously to the Free Press, told the right-leaning media organization that Khalil\u2019s arrest would be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for other actions. Khalil is a \u201cthreat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States,\u201d said the official. \u201cThe allegation here is not that he was breaking the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was mobilizing support for Hamas and spreading antisemitism in a way that is contrary to the foreign policy of the U.S.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have largely denounced the arrest, which is gratifying. Republicans have either cheered for Khalil\u2019s deportation or gone silent. A select number of pro-Israel hawks, like former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who is now running for mayor, have said little. A smaller segment of Democrats, fiercely supportive of Israel, have been satisfied to see the government take drastic action against an individual they believe is an antisemite and a menace to other students.\n\nBut even if being pro-Palestine or anti-Israel could be fully equated with antisemitism \u2014 the Jewish people are more than one nation-state in the Middle East \u2014 it would be absurd and dangerous to arrest and try to deport someone over political beliefs they espouse. There\u2019s no evidence Khalil is partnering with Hamas to try to overthrow the United States. If somehow Khalil had a literal link to Hamas, it wouldn\u2019t be much different than the Irish Americans who supported the ferociously violent IRA for decades. Or, more shockingly to most people today, the millions who backed Nelson Mandela, who remained on a U.S. terrorist watch list until 2008.\n\nAs disturbing and authoritarian as Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on nonviolent college protesters remains, it tragically belongs to a rich American tradition. For more than a century, presidents and federal law enforcement have abused their power to menace activists, typically on the left. Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Palmer Raids inaugurated the first Red Scare in the late 1910s, and J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI harassed, spied on, and infiltrated leftist and civil-rights organizations for many decades. The CIA\u2019s Operation CHAOS, less well-known than the FBI\u2019s notorious COINTELPRO, extensively surveilled antiwar, civil-rights, and women\u2019s-liberation organizations, holding files on thousands of American citizens.\n\nDeportation as a political weapon is not new, either. In the early years of the Great Depression, during the presidency of Herbert Hoover, more than a million people of Mexican descent were forcibly sent to Mexico. As many as 60 percent were American citizens, and they were targeted under the nativist assumption that they were responsible for stealing jobs that the stock-market crash had bled away.\n\nAfter 9/11, George W. Bush continued to expel immigrants under the auspices of the War on Terror. A 16-year-old girl who had emigrated from Bangladesh at the age of 5 was deported when the FBI found she was visiting an internet chat room containing sermons from a London imam encouraging suicide bombing. Federal authorities also wielded the threat of deportation to force immigrants to become informants. One 24-year-old Moroccan permanent resident who had immigrated legally was blocked from returning to the U.S. and had his green card suspended; he was threatened with detention if he did not inform against alleged terrorists.\n\nNone of this is to excuse what the Trump administration is seeking to do to Khalil and many other activists who are merely exercising their speech rights. It\u2019s merely to underscore that the American government has walked this dark and potentially bloody road before. On the issue of Israel, what\u2019s become clear is that the traditional \u2014 and more benign \u2014 approach of lusty support and soft propaganda through trips like Birthright (I briefly considered, and then turned down, such a free foray to Israel in college) have given way to furious suppression of any and all dissent. In the long run, much of this will backfire on American Jews who hope to inculcate an affection for the Jewish State in young people.\n\nRather than perceive any hope or glory in Zionism, these young people will associate it with the federal government\u2019s harassment of nonviolent activists. Any students targeted for deportation will be turned into martyrs for their cause. The generation gap around Israel will only swell. While a majority of Americans remain strongly supportive of Israel and Zionism broadly, younger voters are much more sympathetic to the Palestinians than prior generations. Their views are unlikely to shift with age, especially as the religious right continues to exert great sway over Israeli politics and the bipartisan consensus around unconditionally backing Israel breaks down.\n\nIn the short term, pro-Israel hawks will be successful in the United States because they have Trump on their side and colleges are terrified of losing federal funding. They see Trump freezing grants to Columbia and wealthy donors demanding fresh investigations into antisemitism on college campuses that conflate the genuine article with advocacy for dying Gazans. Activists have every reason to worry as college administrators seek to clamp down on political organizing. But what they should also take heart in is the fact that the median American teenager with a social conscience is going to look on at the Khalil arrest with great horror.\n\nFor pro-Israel hawks who dream of converting the young American masses to their cause, who hope to make Palestinian activism anathema to all that is right and true, all of this does the opposite. To any sane American, arresting and deporting Khalil is indefensible. Whatever overreach pro-Palestinian activists can be accused of \u2014 virtually all of it boils down to language and little more \u2014 none of it compares to the boot heel of the federal government crashing down on the people who legally live here. This is what Trumpism looks like."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that she plans to mobilize her massive base of followers to oppose what she described as an \u201cacquiesce\u201d by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept the House GOP funding bill.\n\n\u201cI think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, where House Democrats are huddling for their annual policy retreat. She said she and her fellow Democrats are \u201ctexting, calling, sending carrier pigeons,\u201d to mobilize the Democratic base against Schumer\u2019s plan to allow the GOP funding bill to advance.\n\nAnd she slammed Senate Democrats for their decision to \u201ccompletely roll over and give up on protecting the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Senate Democrats need new leadership, Ocasio-Cortez would say only that she is focused on how to prevent her party from accepting the GOP bill.\n\n\u201cWe have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no. We can correct course, and that is the most important thing in front of us right now,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nThe New York Democrat has been among the most vocal Democratic officials nationwide in the push against the House GOP funding bill. Using her social accounts, Ocasio-Cortez has urged fellow Democrats across the country to exert maximum pressure on their own senators on the funding bill, which is the first major point of leverage in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nPrivately, House Democrats are so infuriated with Schumer\u2019s decision that some have begun encouraging her to run against Schumer in a primary, according to a Democratic member who directly spoke with Ocasio-Cortez about running at the caucus\u2019 policy retreat. Multiple Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and others directly encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run on Thursday night after Schumer\u2019s announcement, this member said.\n\nThe member said that Democrats in Leesburg were \u201cso mad\u201d that even centrist Democrats were \u201cready to write checks for AOC for Senate,\u201d adding that they have \u201cnever seen people so mad.\u201d\n\nAsked by CNN about fellow Democrats encouraging her to challenge Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez declined to answer and said she was focused on keeping Democrats from backing the funding bill: \u201cWe still have an opportunity to correct course here, and that is my number one priority.\u201d\n\nBut speaking to reporters, Ocasio-Cortez did not hold back on her criticism of Senate Democrats for backing out of a vote that all but one battleground House Democrat was willing to take.\n\n\u201cThere are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare,\u201d she said. \u201cJust to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a huge slap in the face. And I think there is a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as currently planned.\u201d"

Others were ready for the top Senate Democrat to lead them into their first big battle against President Donald Trump \u2014 and instead have been left fuming.\n\nSchumer\u2019s declaration Thursday night that he would vote for Republicans\u2019 stopgap spending bill, backing down in the party\u2019s first big leverage point in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term has confirmed a dire political reality for his caucus: Democrats had no good options left to avert a government shutdown with just hours to go until the deadline.\n\n\u201cIf we go into a shutdown, and I told my caucus this, there\u2019s no off-ramp. The total off-ramp of a shutdown, how you stop a shutdown, is totally determined by the Republican House and Senate, and that is totally determined because they\u2019ve shown complete blind obeisance [to] Trump, DOGE, etc. They could keep us in a shutdown for months and months and months,\u201d Schumer told reporters Thursday night.\n\nThe Democratic leader\u2019s decision privately disappointed many in his caucus, and stunned his House colleagues across the US Capitol \u2014 leaving the party deeply divided on the path ahead at a moment when their base is clamoring for a strong response against Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s actions to radically reshape the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe are in a perverse, bizarro land where we\u2019re having to decide between letting Donald Trump wreck the government this way or wreck the government that way,\u201d New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said of Democrats\u2019 predicament.\n\nIt\u2019s a moment that has been months in the making. Still, top Democrats in Congress struggled to find a cohesive message and strategy that would allow them room to fight without the potential risk of what it would mean if thousands of government workers were suddenly thrust into more uncertainty with a shutdown.\n\nPerhaps the clearest sign of the dilemma: Their top two leaders took opposite paths, with Schumer deciding to vote for the GOP plan that top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries has spent a full week bashing.\n\n\u201cDr. King once made the observation that, although everyone may not see it at the moment, the time is always right to do what\u2019s right. This week, House Democrats did what was right. We stood up against Donald Trump. We stood up against Elon Musk. We stood up against the extreme MAGA Republicans,\u201d Jeffries said to applause in Leesburg, Virginia, at a party retreat Thursday night, according to a person in the room. \u201cWe can defend that vote because we stood on the side of the American people.\u201d\n\nWhen the Senate votes Friday, many Democrats expect the vote to reflect the generational divide in the chamber. Freshmen senators, like Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Ruben Gallego of Arizona \u2014 who many believed would vote for the bill because they hold seats in states Trump won in November \u2014 instead remained firmly opposed and signaled they wanted to use the funding bill to fight the president. And the disconnect reflects a simmering tension that runs through the Democratic Party far beyond Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pissed,\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern told CNN shortly after Schumer\u2019s floor speech. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll toughen up for the fight on reconciliation, I don\u2019t know. \u2026 This guy [Trump] is ruining the country. And you know, I just expected more fight.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have been handwringing over how to handle the shutdown for months. The decision between voting for a shutdown and voting for a bill many believe has serious cuts in funding to programs that are important for Democrats has led to marathon party lunches, endless discussion and little clarity on what many Democrats would ultimately do.\n\nIn order to avert a shutdown, at least eight Senate Democrats need to vote to allow the bill to move forward. Four sources familiar with the discussions said Schumer spent Thursday privately asking members whether they planned to advance the House-passed spending bill that would fund the government until the end of September. And after a lengthy lunch Thursday, several senators who spoke on the condition of anonymity to privately discuss internal party deliberations, told CNN they believed the votes would be there on their side to avert a shutdown.\n\n\u201cI believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country to minimize the harms to the American people,\u201d Schumer said on the floor Thursday in a highly anticipated speech that made clear Democrats would lend the votes needed by the GOP to keep the government open.\n\nStill, several Democrats dug in against the bill as the week stretched on. Gallego announced Thursday he\u2019d vote no, as did a half dozen others, citing concerns over cuts to programs and arguments that voting for the stopgap measure would only embolden Trump and Musk to continue reprogramming money that was already part of previous spending bills.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves. This is a bad resolution that gives Elon Musk and his cronies permission to continue cutting veterans\u2019 benefits, slashes resources for Arizona\u2019s water needs and abandons our wildland firefighters. I can\u2019t stand by that, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m voting no,\u201d Gallego said in a statement.\n\nEven retiring senators like Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota announced she was opposed to the bill on both a procedural vote to advance the measure and on the final vote.\n\nAdding to the mounting frustration, Senate Democrats have complained their party leaders have not been more decisive on how to proceed. The day before Schumer told his caucus he would vote to advance the bill, the Democratic leader went to the Senate floor and said his caucus was united against a vote to advance it.\n\n\u201cHow on earth could we find ourselves in this position? We knew this was coming. We have no plan. We are getting blamed. Progressives are really agitated,\u201d one senior Democratic aide told CNN. \u201cWe have a case to make. We just have not had the leadership and guidance on how to prosecute that.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democratic senators who were asked to respond to questions about their party\u2019s strategy and if it had been effective declined to comment.\n\n\u201cLook, my frustration right now is that this bill is not a CR. It is a brand new budget bill and it is going to cut veteran services by $1.2 billion, FEMA by $300 million, cut wildfire firefighters and water in Arizona and the fact that Trump thinks that\u2019s a good thing for this country astounds me and I\u2019ll think about the other question at a later time and date once we get past this,\u201d Gallego told reporters.\n\nThirty miles away, as more than 100 House Democrats gathered for their policy retreat, lawmakers\u2019 mouths were agape at reports that Schumer was planning to vote with Republicans. Privately, they fumed at his reversal \u2014 a direct contraction of their position that nearly their entire caucus took just 48 hours earlier. Some called on him to lose his position as leader.\n\nBut most declined to comment publicly, wary, they said, of deepening the ugly divide within the Democratic Party. One senior aide described the House Democrats\u2019 reaction as \u201ccollectively ripsh*t.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Democrats pointed to several miscalculations made by their party. For one, most Senate Democrats never thought the House could pass a stopgap funding measure with just Republican votes. Then, Speaker Mike Johnson \u2013 with major muscle from Trump \u2013 convinced more than 30 conservatives who just months ago voted against another stopgap spending bill to vote for one.\n\nSome Senate Democrats expressed intense frustration with the attacks they faced from House colleagues, who they believe have painted them into a corner after they had the privilege of voting against a spending bill without directly risking a shutdown. The bill passed out of the House with almost every single Republican voting \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nToo few Democrats voting \u201cyes\u201d in the Senate could trigger a shutdown. Meanwhile, some progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been urging their constituents to flood the phone lines of Democratic senators to lobby them to vote against the bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating to see these tweets,\u201d one Democratic Senate staffer told CNN.\n\nAnother Democratic office told CNN that their phone lines had been so inundated with calls from the base that they\u2019d received more than 4,000 phone calls in a single day.\n\n\u201cI think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters.\n\n\u201cThere are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare. Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a slap in the face.\u201d\n\nAnd House Democrats \u2013 before it was clear that Schumer intended to back down \u2013 defended their decision to amplify pressure on the Senate.\n\n\u201cGod gave the Senate six-year terms for a reason,\u201d centrist Rep. Scott Peters told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m in the fight. We\u2019ve done what we can do. We need them to do what they can do.\u201d\n\nRep. Susie Lee, a Democrat who represents a tough swing seat in Nevada, told CNN she\u2019s personally made the pitch to her state\u2019s two senators.\n\n\u201cThey have the House and the Senate and the presidency. They made a choice to not negotiate with us,\u201d Lee said. The Nevada Democrat acknowledged that Senate Democrats had a \u201cfear\u201d of a shutdown. But she argued that Democrats could easily explain to their voters that it was the Republicans, not their own party, that triggered the funding lapse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard task. It\u2019s their government. They have the majority,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think that they need to own it.\u201d"

But in the chaos of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.\n\n\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.\n\nHe was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.\n\nThree years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.\n\n\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"\n\nHe says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.\n\nVanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies immigrate to the U.S.\n\nSince 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.\n\nThis includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.\n\n\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.\n\n\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"\n\nAfter trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.\n\nOn Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.\n\nTamim Satari is reunited with his son at Newark Liberty International Airport in January after they were separated in Afghanistan in 2021. CBS News\n\nThe Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.\n\nThree days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"\n\nA federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.\n\nAccording to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.\n\n\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.\n\n\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.\n\nMcCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.\n\n\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.\n\nAfghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. They go through several in-person interviews and their biometrics are checked against government databases, in addition to extensive medical screening.\n\n\"Afghans who come to this country via the CARE program are the most vetted immigrant population in our country's history,\" said a former State Department official.\n\nSatari remains hopeful he will not be one of the last to be reunited with his family. He has settled in New Jersey and is employed in a mechanical job while he studies for his real estate license.\n\n\"I have a lot of hope in the future. I would like to have a great life,\" Satari said. \"I am responsible for taking care of my son, to enroll in school and start lessons over there. I have a big hope.\""

The arrest shows that while the Trump administration has eased up pressure on Russia in some areas, such as offensive cyber operations, the Justice Department is still aggressively pursuing accused criminals with a connection to Russia.\n\nBesciokov had been living in Russia, according to the Justice Department. It is unclear why Besciokov traveled to India.\n\nPolice in the southwest Indian state of Kerala arrested Besciokov this week, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that referred to Besciokov as a \u201cfugitive.\u201d\n\nThis screenshot shows the Garantex website which the US Justice Department, in coordination with Germany and Finland, disrupted and took down. The cryptocurrency exchange website allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations \u2014 including terrorist organizations \u2014 and sanctions violations, according to the US Justice Department. From Garantex.org\n\n\u201cI can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States,\u201d US Justice Department spokesperson Nicole Navas Oxman told CNN in an email. She declined to comment further.\n\nCNN has been unable to reach a lawyer representing Besciokov.\n\nThe arrest comes less than a week after the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and Aleksandr Mira Serda, a Russian man, for allegedly running Garantex. Besciokov was in charge of keeping Garantex online and running its infrastructure, while Mira Serda was the exchange\u2019s co-founder and \u201cchief commercial officer,\u201d according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe Besciokov case is an example of how putting accused money launderers in handcuffs is the surest way to disrupt their activity. The US Treasury Department sanctioned Garantex in 2022. In response, Besciokov and others \u201credesigned Garantex\u2019s operations\u201d to evade sanctions and dupe US businesses into working with Garantex, according to the Justice Department. The exchange processed $96 billion in transactions between 2015 and 2019, according to the indictment."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we explore the next steps in the shutdown battle after Senate Democrats said they would block the GOP\u2019s government funding bill. Plus, Andrea Mitchell examines how the U.S. might convince Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nSenate Democrats make their move in the shutdown fight\n\nAs we wrote yesterday, the House\u2019s passage of a Republican stopgap funding bill has put Senate Democrats in a bind: Either back a measure they disapprove of and give up some of the only leverage they will have on major legislation this year, or reject it and allow a government shutdown to occur.\n\nThat bind was on full display today as they debated their next moves with the government set to run out of money in just over 48 hours.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer finally staked out his position, saying Democrats wouldn\u2019t provide the votes to pass the GOP\u2019s six-month continuing resolution. The measure requires 60 votes to advance in the Senate, and Republicans only control 53 seats.\n\n\u201cFunding the government should be a bipartisan effort but Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input \u2014 any input \u2014 from congressional Democrats. Because of that, Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nInstead, he called for a one-month funding bill to provide more time to both sides to negotiate a deal.\n\n\u201cOur caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s remarks on the Senate floor came after a lunch meeting among Democratic senators. Outside the room, reporters could hear senators loudly making their point to their colleagues.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said they want to have the ability to propose changes to the bill.\n\n\u201cThere are not the votes right now to pass it,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cDemocrats had nothing to do with this bill. And we want an opportunity to get an amendment vote or two. And so that\u2019s what we are insisting on.\u201d\n\nStill, some Democrats fear that a shutdown would be worse than accepting the bill.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, both outcomes are bad,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said. \u201cElections have consequences, but this is an extreme bill. If it passes, it will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground. If the government shuts down, that will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground, and so that is the dilemma in which we found ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m weighing the badness of each option,\u201d added Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democratic leaders urged their Senate counterparts to vote down the GOP funding bill as they kicked off a three-day policy retreat.\n\nRead more from Sahil Kapur, Ryan Nobles, Julie Tsirkin and Frank Thorp V \u2192\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nFollow live updates \u2192\n\nWhat comes next in the Russia-Ukraine ceasefire talks\n\nBy Andrea Mitchell\n\nPresident Donald Trump said \u201cit is up to Russia now\u201d to agree to the monthlong ceasefire proposed by the U.S. and accepted by Ukraine.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz has now spoken to his Russian counterpart. White House envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to be flying from Qatar to Moscow to close the deal. There\u2019s talk of a Trump call to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the offing. During the past week, the administration pummeled Ukrainian President Zelenskyy into submission by withholding weapons and intelligence from Ukraine.\n\nWhat leverage does the U.S. have with Putin? Trump said today he could \u201cdo things financially that would be very bad for Russia.\u201d He has mentioned the possibility of sanctions, but with China, North Korea and Iran helping keep Russia afloat, existing sanctions on Russia have been largely ineffective.\n\nAnd in almost all of Trump\u2019s statements and actions since returning to the White House, he is again demonstrating an affinity for the Russian president. When Russia was, by Trump\u2019s own admission, \u201cbombing the hell out of Ukraine\u201d after the U.S. halted military aid, Trump said he still thought Putin wanted peace, saying \u201che\u2019s doing what anybody else would do.\u201d\n\nDespite U.S. assessments that Russian-based hackers are responsible for Salt Typhoon, a massive hacking of U.S. targets, the administration is firing top counterintelligence experts at the CIA and FBI, and welcoming back Russian diplomatic missions previously expelled from the U.S. for espionage activities. The U.S. also sided with Russia, China and Belarus at the United Nations against a resolution supporting Ukraine. And all of this comes amid Trump\u2019s continual searing criticism of NATO and the European Union, stunning America\u2019s traditional Western allies and closest \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence partners.\n\nWith Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying \u201cthe ball is in Russia\u2019s court,\u201d it is likely in Russia\u2019s interest to accept the ceasefire and instead try to defeat Zelenskyy at the negotiating table. Clearly, tortuous negotiations lie ahead over territory, security guarantees, reparations, NATO membership and more in a war that has been a \u201cmeat grinder,\u201d to use Walz\u2019s term.\n\nSo despite White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, \u201cWe are at the 10th-yard line and the president is expecting the Russians to help us run this into the end zone,\u201d it would be wise to avoid declaring \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d\n\nThe Trump effect goes overseas\n\nA party that has sharply criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to take over Greenland secured a surprise election victory Tuesday in the Danish territory, but it may have to govern with a partner with a far warmer view of the U.S. president, Astha Rajvanshi reports.\n\nThe center-right, pro-business Demokraatit party, which favors a gradual move toward independence from Denmark, won 30% of the total vote share, not enough to single-handedly rule the Arctic territory. The party will instead need to partner with opponents to form a coalition.\n\nForemost among those other parties is the second-placed opposition party Naleraq, which won a quarter of the vote share, favors rapid independence and has reserved warm words for the Trump administration.\n\nThe victory of two parties who favor independence \u2014 seceding from Denmark is broadly popular in Greenland \u2014 may be taken as a positive in Washington, where interest in the world\u2019s largest island has sharply jumped since Trump began his second term.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \u2b05\ufe0f Heading toward the exits: Sen.

            "full_content": "How new tariffs could make beer more expensive\n\nSweeping 25% tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports could cause prices on a range of consumers foods, including cars and washing machines, to rise. Components used in manufacturing and for construction such as nails, could also become more expensive.\n\nAnything that's made with metal, from homes and cars to canned foods and beverages could soon get a new and higher price tag.\n\n\"All manufacturing that uses steel or aluminum, or uses something that uses steel and aluminum will be affected,\" international trade expert Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nDr. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank, called the forthcoming tariff impact \"a barn burner,\" leading to higher prices and an economic slowdown.\n\nHe added that all \"broad-based core commodities\" are vulnerable to price hikes as a result of the levies. In addition to automobiles and electronics, which rely heavily on metals, that includes less obvious goods like canned goods, whose prices could rise if packaging costs jump.\n\n\"We are going to see it in places you don't expect it,\" Winegarden said.\n\nAmerican consumers likely to see higher prices on cars and more\n\nCar, truck, bus and tractor parts were the largest import category by volume last year, that will be covered under the tariffs, according to the United States International Trade Commission.\n\nAmerican Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the new tariffs \"will add significant costs for automakers, suppliers and consumers\" in a statement to CBS News.\n\nInevitably, some of those added costs will be passed along to consumers.\n\n\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices. Makers of vehicles will face higher costs, which will be passed on to consumers,\" Layna Mosley, politics and international affairs professor at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nMetal parts on doors, window frames and other hardware used in the construction of housing will also be subject to the levies, leading to growing costs for homebuilders.\n\nJim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to estimates showing that the metal tariffs could add up to $10,000 to the cost of a home, although he noted it is likely to take months for the impact to become clear. \"Those costs are going to be passed on to the ultimate homeowner or renter,\" he told CBS News.\n\nMachine parts, including steel wires, screws and more are also likely to be hit, raising the price of a broad range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners.\n\n\"Just look around the house. Anything that has steel or aluminum in it will be exposed to tariffs,\" McDaniel said.\n\nGym and sports equipment will also be tariffed, though manufacturers may have stockpiled some materials in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect, enabling them to head off price hikes for a short period, Mosley noted.\n\nHigher price for aluminum cans\n\nIn addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.\n\nCoca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.\n\n\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"\n\n\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"\n\nFor Brooklyn-based brewery Talea, the tariffs on aluminum, which the company uses for its beer cans, could lead to higher operating costs, co-founder LeAnn Darland recently told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady. Darland said she hopes to share any increased costs with suppliers, because she's not sure consumers will be willing to swallow any price hikes.\n\nEven without the tariffs, said Darland, \"Sometimes we get complaints that our beer is too expensive.\"\n\n\u2014CBS News' Natalie Brand contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "The soon-to-be-retired Senate veteran Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Photo: Nathan Posner/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats anxious to deny Donald Trump and his Republican Party a governing trifecta as soon as possible are feeling pretty good about their prospects for flipping the House in 2026, given the GOP\u2019s fragile margin of control and the historical pattern of sizable midterm losses for the president\u2019s party. But the Senate, which has the power to confirm Trump\u2019s executive branch and judicial nominations, is really going to be a reach. Democrats would need to flip four Senate seats to win control of the chamber. And an already difficult landscape is being made even tougher by the retirements of Democratic incumbents Gary Peters of Michigan, Tina Smith of Minnesota, and now Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. All three of these open seats could potentially trigger competitive races in 2026.\n\nOf the three retirees, Shaheen certainly has the best case for having earned the right to call it a day. She\u2019s 78 years old (Peters is 66 and Smith is 67) and is completing her third full Senate term. Before that, she served three two-year terms as governor of New Hampshire. There\u2019s also a robust Democratic bench in her state; both current U.S. House members, Chris Pappas and Maggie Goodlander (along with former congresswoman Annie Kuster), are considering races to succeed Shaheen.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown publicly indicated interest in this seat the minute Shaheen announced her retirement. Brown gained global renown by winning a 2010 special election to fill the Senate seat of the late Ted Kennedy in a huge upset that nearly derailed the passage of the Affordable Care Act. After losing the seat in 2012 to Elizabeth Warren, he moved back to his native New Hampshire and ran against Shaheen in 2014, losing by three points in a very good year for Republicans. He has plenty of name ID but would be less formidable than the GOP\u2019s dream candidate, former governor Chris Sununu, who passed up a Senate race in 2024 but hasn\u2019t ruled out a run for Shaheen\u2019s seat.\n\nLooking at the big picture, as Nathaniel Rakich points out, these retirements are probably better timed for Democrats in 2026 than in an election year when Republicans are more likely to have the wind at their back. But still, given the emergency represented by Trump 2.0, the future is now for Democrats, and having to fight to hang on to three seats they currently hold reduces their already slim odds for regaining the Senate. According to the Cook Political Report\u2019s race ratings, there are only three Republican-held Senate seats up in 2026 that are anything other than a lock for the GOP: those held by Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina (both rated \u201cLean R\u201d) and Jon Husted of Ohio (rated \u201cLikely R\u201d). Meanwhile, four Democratic-held Senate seats are vulnerable: the races to fill the Shaheen and Smith seats are rated \u201cLean D,\u201d while the contest over Peters\u2019s seat and a likely big-time challenge to incumbent Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff are rated as \u201cToss Ups.\u201d Even if 2026 turns out to be a very good year for Democrats, it\u2019s hard to see where that fourth flipped seat would come from and easy to see possibilities for losses."

            "full_content": "FIRST ON FOX: A longtime ally of California Gov. Gavin Newsom repeatedly helped a now-former CCP official while she was serving as the Chinese consul in San Francisco, according to a LinkedIn post unearthed by Fox News Digital.\n\nYing He, who served as the Chinese consul general in San Francisco between 2012 and 2016, lavished praise on Darlene Chiu-Bryant in a 2017 LinkedIn recommendation, calling the former Newsom aide and longtime ally of the governor a \"Super lady.\"\n\n\"Darlene is the right person when you need to develop business (sic) in either California or Beijing,\" said He, who was serving as the division director for the Ministry of Commerce, a CCP government arm, at the time of the 2017 LinkedIn post. \"She is an excellent PR professional and able to fulfill the most challenging tasks. She helped me a lot when I was consul in SF, promoting US-Sino investment and trade. In all, she is a friend in need and a Super Lady indeed.\"\n\nHe\u2019s LinkedIn reveals that she has served in multiple roles at the Ministry of Commerce for over a decade and her profile boasts that she has \"extensive connections with Chinese and U.S. governments\" and \"15+ years with a Chinese central government agency and 4 years as a diplomat in San Francisco.\"\n\nCONGRESS EXPOSES CHINA'S POTENTIAL LOOPHOLE FOR TRUMP TARIFFS: 'DRAWING A LINE IN THE SAND'\n\nAt the time of the LinkedIn post, Bryant was serving as the executive director of ChinaSF, which is facing renewed scrutiny for its ties to the CCP and recruiting over 100 Chinese companies into San Francisco, according to a new book Fox News Digital exclusively reported on Monday. In the book, there is a chapter dedicated to how Newsom helped launch a nonprofit organization almost a decade earlier, in 2008.\n\nOne of the several companies discussed in the book was Suntech, a Chinese solar company developed by the CCP that was personally recruited by Newsom into the U.S., and he publicly praised the company\u2019s CEO, Dr. Zhengrong Shi, multiple times, and made him an advisory board member for ChinaSF.\n\nIn addition to green energy companies that streamed through ChinaSF, real estate companies were also involved, and the book alleges that Newsom received over $23,000 in anonymous contributions from Chinese real estate company Z&L, whose billionaire owner was criminally sentenced for bribing a San Francisco government official. In 2017, ChinaSF posted a photo of Bryant, Newsom and others in front of a wall that said Z&L Properties.\n\n\"ChinaSF was started by our Lt Governor Gavin Newsom when he was Mayor of San Francisco in 2008,\" the photo caption said. \"Proud to work with our partners and companies recruited to the SF Bay Area.\"\n\nAccording to China Daily, a Chinese state media outlet, Newsom launched the group while visiting Shanghai.\n\n\"The two most important things for us are energy independence and establishing a stronger relationship with China,\" Newsom said ahead of the trip.\n\nTHE PLAN TO CONFRONT CHINA AND KICK OUT COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM THE U.S.\n\nBryant, who traveled with Newsom to China in 2005 when she was serving as his deputy communications director and would later be tapped to run ChinaSF, was repeatedly mentioned in a chapter in the new book, \"Fool's Gold: The Radicals, Con Artists, and Traitors Who Killed the California Dream and Now Threaten Us All.\"\n\nIn the book, authors Susan Crabtree and Jedd McFatter make the case that ChinaSF served as a gateway for CCP officials and Chinese criminals to exploit California. In addition to the book exposing how Bryant was referred to locally as \"the Fixer\" for any Chinese businesses \"wanting to make hay in San Francisco,\" her personal Facebook profile and other Facebook pages are littered with photos showing her involvement with ChinaSF. There are also several photos of her and Newsom, in addition to other California politicians.\n\nIn 2019, GlobalSF posted a photo of Newsom and Bryant at an event. The photo caption, which appears to be written by Bryant, called Newsom a \"visionary leader.\"\n\n\"So good to see my ex boss now Governor of our Golden State of [California], [Gavin Newsom],\" the post said. \"As a visionary leader, he started [ChinaSF] in 2008 to be the China Desk for the city and county of [San Francisco] to facilitate inbound investment.\"\n\nAnother photo on Facebook shows Bryant attending Newsom's inauguration in early 2019.\n\nFox News Digital has previously reported on another prominent Chinese consul general, Huang Ping, who oversaw the office in New York City for several years and often promoted CCP propaganda while publicly denying the alleged Uyghur genocide in China.\n\nIn addition to his controversial public statements, Ping would often travel to U.S. universities and other events, meeting with business leaders and elected officials, sparking concerns from some about potential influence peddling for the CCP.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party is playing for keeps at the nuclear level and every layer below that,\" Michael Sobolik, author of \"Countering China\u2019s Great Game: A Strategy for American Dominance,\" told Fox News Digital last year. \"And it's not just the universities. The Chinese Communist Party is looking to infiltrate every aspect of American society.\"\n\n\"If we try to edit undo our way out of this whole list of infiltrations and threats that the CCP sends our direction that's good policy work. We need to insulate ourselves. But good housekeeping is the bare minimum of waging a cold war and winning a cold war,\" Sobolik added.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment and received a response pointing to an article about conspiracy theories with the headline, \"Conspiracy theorists really do see the world differently, new study shows.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Bryant, but did not receive a response by press time."

            "full_content": "Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nNo one is going to rank Mike Johnson among the great arm-twisting Speakers of the House, like Henry Clay, Tom Reed, Sam Rayburn, or even Nancy Pelosi. Indeed, he still resembles Winston Churchill\u2019s description of Clement Atlee as \u201ca modest man with much to be modest about.\u201d\n\nBut nonetheless, in the space of two weeks, Johnson has managed to get two huge and highly controversial measures through the closely divided House: a budget resolution that sets the stage for enactment of Donald Trump\u2019s entire legislative agenda in one bill, then an appropriations bill keeping the federal government operating until the end of September while preserving the highly contested power of Trump and his agents to cut and spend wherever they like.\n\nDespite all the talk of divisions between the hard-core fiscal extremists of the House Freedom Caucus and swing-district \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans, Johnson lost just one member \u2014 the anti-spending fanatic and lone wolf Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 from the ranks of House Republicans on both votes. As a result, he needed not even a whiff of compromise with House Democrats (only one of them, the very Trump-friendly Jared Golden of Maine, voted for one of the measures, the appropriations bill).\n\nNow there are a host of factors that made this impressive achievement possible. The budget-resolution vote was, as Johnson kept pointing out to recalcitrant House Republicans, a blueprint for massive domestic-spending cuts, not the cuts themselves. Its language was general and vague enough to give Republicans plausible deniability. And even more deviously, the appropriations measure was made brief and unspecific in order to give Elon Musk and Russ Vought the maximum leeway to whack spending and personnel to levels far below what the bill provided (J.D. Vance told House Republicans right before the vote that the administration reserved the right to ignore the spending the bill mandated entirely, which pleased the government-hating HFC folk immensely). And most important, on both bills Johnson was able to rely on personal lobbying from key members of the administration, most notably the president himself, who had made it clear any congressional Republican who rebelled might soon be looking down the barrel of a Musk-financed MAGA primary opponent. Without question, much of the credit Johnson is due for pulling off these votes should go to his White House boss, whose wish is his command.\n\nBut the lesson Democrats should take from these events is that they cannot just lie in the weeds and expect the congressional GOP to self-destruct owing to its many divisions and rivalries. In a controversial New York Times op-ed last month, Democratic strategist James Carville argued Democrats should \u201cplay dead\u201d in order to keep a spotlight on Republican responsibility for the chaos in Washington, D.C., which might soon extend to Congress:\n\nLet the Republicans push for their tax cuts, their Medicaid cuts, their food stamp cuts. Give them all the rope they need. Then let dysfunction paralyze their House caucus and rupture their tiny majority. Let them reveal themselves as incapable of governing and, at the right moment, start making a coordinated, consistent argument about the need to protect Medicare, Medicaid, worker benefits and middle-class pocketbooks. Let the Republicans crumble, let the American people see it, and wait until they need us to offer our support.\n\nCongressional GOP dysfunction could yet break out; House and Senate Republicans have struggled constantly to stay on the same page on budget strategy, the depth of domestic-spending cuts, and the extent of tax cuts. But as the two big votes in the House show, their three superpowers are Trump\u2019s death grip on them all, the willingness of Musk and Vought and Trump himself to take the heat for unpopular policies, and a capacity for lying shamelessly about what they are doing and what it will cost. Yes, ultimately, congressional Republicans will face voters in November 2026. But any fear of these elections is mitigated by the realization that thanks to the landscape of midterm races, probably nothing they can do will save control of the House or forfeit control of the Senate. So Republicans have a lot of incentives to follow Trump in a high-speed smash-and-grab operation that devastates the public sector, awards their billionaire friends with tax cuts, and wherever possible salts the earth to make a revival of good government as difficult as possible. Democrats have few ways to stop this nihilistic locomotive. But they may be fooling themselves if they assume it\u2019s going off the rails without their active involvement."

Canada was just 102nd-highest on a World Bank list of 137 countries\u2019 trade-weighted average tariff rates in 2022 \u2013 and had a lower average (1.37%) than the United States (1.49%) that year, the most recent for which the data is available.\n\nCanada\u2019s dairy tariffs: Trump falsely claimed to reporters Friday that he had Canada\u2019s dairy-tariff situation \u201cwell taken care of\u201d at the time he left office the first time, \u201cbut under Biden, they just kept raising it.\u201d In fact, Canada did not raise its dairy tariffs during the Biden administration. The tariffs Trump is denouncing were left in place by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement he signed in 2018, though that agreement did secure greater US access to the Canadian dairy market.\n\nTrump has also persistently failed to mention that Canada\u2019s high dairy tariffs only kick in after the US has hit a certain Trump-negotiated quantity of tariff-free dairy sales to Canada each year \u2013 and as the US dairy industry acknowledges, the US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum in any category of dairy product, so the tariffs aren\u2019t being applied.\n\nCanada\u2019s imports of US agricultural products: Trump, speaking of Canada, claimed to reporters in February that \u201cthey don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part\u201d; he mentioned dairy, then said, \u201cA little bit they do, but not much.\u201d This is false even with Trump\u2019s qualifiers. Canada was the world\u2019s second-largest buyer of US agricultural exports in 2024, according to the US Department of Agriculture, purchasing about $28.4 billion worth.\n\nWhile Canada does limit foreign access to its dairy, egg and poultry markets in particular, these are exceptions rather than the rule. The US Department of Agriculture notes on its website that \u201calmost all\u201d US agricultural exports to Canada face zero tariffs or quotas, and that \u201cCanada consistently ranks among our top markets for agricultural product exports, representing one of our most significant and reliable trading partners.\u201d\n\nCanada and US banks: Trump falsely claimed in both February and March that Canada prohibits US banks. While Canada\u2019s tight regulations have discouraged many foreign banks from opening retail branches there, Canada does not forbid these banks; in fact, US banks have been operating in Canada for well over a century. The Canadian Bankers Association industry group said in a February statement that \u201cthere are 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches with around C$113 billion in assets currently operating in Canada\u201d and that \u201cU.S. banks now make up approximately half of all foreign bank assets in Canada.\u201d\n\nCanada, Russia and China: Trump falsely claimed in a January social media post that Canada joining the US would secure Canada \u201cfrom the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them.\u201d Canada has never been surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships, let alone been \u201cconstantly\u201d surrounded. In fact, a smattering of Russian and Chinese military ships and jets, as well as Chinese research vessels viewed with suspicion by Canada and the US, have been occasionally spotted in recent years in the vicinity of the US state of Alaska \u2013 and have been monitored or intercepted by the Canadian and US militaries.\n\nThe Canadian government did warn in December that among the \u201cpotential threats\u201d in its Arctic region were \u201cincreased Russian activity in Canadian air approaches\u201d and \u201cChina\u2019s regular deployment of dual-use \u2013 having both research and military application \u2013 research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data.\u201d But that\u2019s not the same as being \u201csurrounded.\u201d\n\nTrudeau and the trade war: Trump said in a social media post Thursday: \u201cI think that Justin Trudeau is using the Tariff problem, which he has largely caused, in order to run again for Prime Minister.\u201d Trump framed this as his own thought, but it was clearly false nonetheless. Trudeau\u2019s successor as Liberal Party leader and prime minister was set to be chosen in a party vote three days following this Trump post; Trudeau did not compete in the leadership race after announcing in January that he would step down after the new leader was chosen.\n\nCanada\u2019s defense spending: Trump falsely claimed in January that Canada spends \u201cless than 1%\u201d of GDP on defense. Official NATO figures show Canada spent an estimated 1.37% of GDP on defense in 2024, up from an estimated 1.31% in 2023 and from 1.2% in 2022. That\u2019s all short of NATO\u2019s 2% target, which incoming prime minister Mark Carney has vowed to meet by 2030, but not as low as Trump claimed."

It\u2019s as simple as that. This is not about free speech,\" Rubio said. \"This is about people who do not have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a greed card by the way.\"\n\n\"So when you apply for a student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason, but I think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down, being complicit in what are clearly crimes, vandalization, complicit in shutting down institutions,\" Rubio added. \"There are kids at these schools that can\u2019t go to class.

He has since obtained a green card and is married to an American citizen who is reportedly eight months pregnant.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York on Monday temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation as the case plays out. His attorneys argue that his constitutional rights of free speech and due process under the First and Fifth amendments were violated and filed a motion challenging the validity of Khalil\u2019s detention. They are pushing for Khalil to be returned to New York, while Trump administration lawyers say they intend to file a motion to dismiss or transfer the case out of the Southern District of New York by Wednesday night.

            "full_content": "Dramatic and unexpected election results in Greenland saw long-governing legacy parties kicked out of power and more right-wing, pro-American politicians set to dominate parliament for the first time.\n\nThe provisional results for the Greenlandic elections held on Tuesday show a historic result not forecast by pollsters, with the longstanding political establishment parties punished and relegated to third and fourth positions, respectively.\n\nThe election comes amid intense discussion of Greenland\u2019s potential independence domestically and global attention over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated overtures to the country to become part of the United States. As things stand, Greenland is now a region of its former colonial master Denmark, and as well as being divided between left and right, its politics are also split into pro- and anti-independence camps.\n\nThe present Greenland government is a coalition of the largest party, the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit, and the second-largest, the centre-left Siumut. Both parties are pro-independence but not especially friendly to America and certainly not to Donald Trump. Voters punished both parties, which have dominated Greenland politics since the 1970s, yesterday, falling from 12 seats to five and from ten to four, respectively.\n\nShould they leave power now, which seems all but certain, it would be the first time in Greenland\u2019s modern history that it hasn\u2019t been governed by either Inuit Ataqatigiit or Siumut.\n\nNow, the largest party is the centre-right Democrats, with a vote share surging 21 points and seats increasing from three to ten. In second place are the centrist Naleraq, up 12.5 points and seats doubled from four to eight.\n\nBetween them, these two parties \u2014 also pro-independence \u2014 have enough to form a government and coalition negotiations will likely follow.\n\nImportantly, Naleraq has positioned itself as the most pro-American party in Greenlandic politics. While there is no such thing as a pro-Donald Trump party, as such, Naleraq has made clear if it came to power, it would work closely with the United States as an independent, sovereign nation.\n\nFor President Trump, this election produces a Greenland government which will at least work constructively with him, rather than reject American overtures with contempt.\n\nIndeed, Naleraq party leader Pele Broberg wrote an opinion piece in English for USNEWS the day before the vote, laying out in very clear terms what he foresees such a relationship would look like. While Broberg would likely end up a junior coalition partner and not Prime Minister in the coming Greenlandic government, under European political systems, junior coalition partners can enjoy outsized influence on government policy.\n\nBroberg wrote on Monday that his party is the most enthusiastically pro-independence of all the factions in Greenland, having campaigned for a snap referendum to be called quickly, and that he believed his country could develop faster and to greater benefit of its own citizens without control from Europe.\n\nOf President Trump, Broberg acknowledged the U.S. President\u2019s interest in \u201cmineral resources and possible oil and gas reserves\u201d on the Arctic island of fewer than 60,000 people and said that Trump had been friendlier to the Greenlandic people than the Danish government or the European Union.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u2026The U.S. president has offered us security guarantees, financial support and, if desired, U.S. citizenship should we choose to sever ties with Denmark\u2026 No other leader in Denmark or the EU has expressed such strong support for Greenlandic independence.\n\nNevertheless, he said recent research in Greenland showed citizens didn\u2019t want to achieve independence only to be swallowed into another country, and the path he foresaw was one of a close alliance with America. This could be a \u201cfree association status\u201d with Washington like that of \u201cby the Pacific island states of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe would get U.S. support and protection in return for military rights, without becoming a U.S. territory\u201d, Broberg proposed."

            "full_content": "Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHouse Republicans passed a bill on Tuesday night to keep the federal government funded beyond March 14 only after Vice-President J.D. Vance promised that the Trump administration would ignore the bill and make its own unilateral funding decisions. Yes, you read that right.\n\nThanks to grumbling among the fiscal nihilists of the House Freedom Caucus, there were fears that enough Republicans would join Democrats to vote down the so-called \u201cclean CR\u201d (short for continuing resolution, or just an extension of current spending levels). Earlier, House Speaker Mike Johnson appealed to these extremists by making the \u201cclean\u201d bill pretty dirty, adding major new spending for defense and mass deportations while cutting $13 billion in domestic spending. But that wasn\u2019t enough, so Vance came to the rescue, as Politico reported:\n\nVance told House Republicans they need to vote for the GOP funding bill to clear the runway for the massive domestic policy bill Republicans are now in the process of assembling, the people added. By failing to pass the stopgap, Vance added, Republicans will lose momentum on securing the border and lose credibility with voters.\n\nHe also assured Republican members that Trump would continue cutting federal funding with his Department of Government Efficiency initiative and pursue impoundment \u2014 that is, holding back money appropriated by Congress.\n\nIn other words, the veep was telling Republicans they were approving a spending measure written in disappearing ink because Elon Musk at DOGE and Russ Vought at OMB would continue to cancel spending as they wished without any input from or concurrence by Congress. As Edith Olmstead of The New Republic rightly observed, it was an act of institutional suicide by the party controlling the legislative branch:\n\nIf it seems a little outrageous that even with control of the House, Senate, and White House, the Republicans must openly admit that they are working to pass laws they have no intention of actually enforcing, that\u2019s because it is. Rather than forge actual party unity behind his agenda, Trump wants the power to act unilaterally \u2014 leaving Vance to bully party members into saying \u201cyes\u201d to Trump doing whatever he wants when it comes to federal funding.\n\nThe only catch is that pulling off this abandonment of the constitutionally assigned congressional \u201cpower of the purse\u201d will require at least some complicity from the minority party. After House Democrats demanded (and Republicans quickly rejected) language ensuring that the appropriations were binding on the Trump administration, only one of their members voted for this shady CR, Maine\u2019s egregiously Trump-friendly Jared Golden.\n\nNow that the CR has passed, it goes to the Senate, where 40 of the 47 Democrats (along with Republican Rand Paul, who wants deeper spending cuts guaranteed) can stop it with a filibuster. Multiple Democrats, however, reportedly fear that if they actively fight this bill, they \u2014 rather than the Republicans who totally control the executive, the legislative, and much of the judicial branch of the federal government \u2014 will be blamed for a destructive government shutdown. To put added pressure on them, House Speaker Mike Johnson quickly adjourned the House after the passage of the CR so as to \u201cjam\u201d the Senate with a bill that cannot be amended. So Democrats have the terrible choice of enabling a Republican-engineered government shutdown or enacting a bill that preserves the DOGE-OMB option of gutting rather than shutting the government.\n\nIf Senate Democrats (or at least enough of them) do choose the easy way out by refusing to stand in the way of the CR locomotive, they must live with the realization that they\u2019ve given up the one bit of leverage they had this year. From here on out, Republicans intend to enact Trump\u2019s legislative agenda via a giant budget reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered and which will exclude Democrats from having any say over the size, shape, and purpose of the federal government. As DOGE continues to abolish and slash programs and fire federal workers, and as OMB picks and chooses which appropriations it will actually make available, Democrats can only hope the federal courts intervene or Republicans somehow fall into disarray."

            "full_content": "As universities around the country race to assess new federal policies geared toward ending programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, one college administrator is in a potentially tricky position.\n\nLakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College. She is also Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine, served on the university's biological sciences diversity committee, and has written proudly of her school's commitment to diversity.\n\nThe university features its diversity efforts prominently on its website and a letter from Chilukuri to incoming students emphasizes the school's \"steadfast adherence to principles that drive equity, inclusion, and an embrace of diversity.\"\n\nUndated: Lakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College and Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. screen grab, University of California San Diego video\n\n\"As we come into the new academic year with the pandemic not quite yet in the rearview mirror, with issues of equity and systemic racism, anti-Blackness and anti-Asian racism yet unresolved, we have before us both opportunity and responsibility,\" Chilukuri wrote in the undated letter. The Internet Archive shows the letter was first posted in late 2021, with minor edits made over the next year. It has since remained as the main body of text on the Sixth College's \"About\" page.\n\nA crackdown on what President Trump and Vance call \"wokeness\" has been a hallmark of their administration's first weeks. Widespread scalebacks of DEI programs in academia, government and across corporations have marked some of the administration's earliest marquee victories.\n\nVance said in a statement, \"I don't like DEI, and I'm proud of what our administration has done on that front.\"\n\n\"But I love my mother-in-law. If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance said. \"I'll choose instead to focus on her kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\"\n\nVance added, \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" Chilukuri did not reply to emailed questions. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding. A Feb. 14 \"Dear Colleague\" letter from the Department of Education to schools across the country warned that they risked federal funding if they continued to take race into account when making scholarship or hiring decisions, or include race as a policy factor in any \"other aspects of student, academic and campus life.\"\n\nThe administration's anti-DEI campaign led a U.S. attorney to warn the Georgetown Law School that its students wouldn't be considered for jobs at his office unless the school renounced its DEI programs. Mr. Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has removed from its websites most references to diversity and inclusion, and on March 7, the University of Virginia's governing board voted to dissolve its office of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nMany corporations have followed suit, including CBS News' parent company Paramount, which in late February ceased using hiring goals related to race, ethnicity, sex or gender, among other policy changes related to DEI.\n\nVance has been vocal about combatting DEI, speaking about it frequently since his earliest days in politics. In a 2021 speech, Vance, quoting Richard Nixon, said professors are \"the enemy,\" and called on Americans to \"aggressively attack the universities in this country,\" saying \"they care more about diversity, equity and inclusion than they do their own society.\" That view is shared by the president, and the White House has backed it up, issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold federal funding from institutions operating what it calls \"illegal\" DEI programs. It has not clarified exactly what that means.\n\nThe president also ordered federal agencies to identify colleges with endowments over $1 billion that might be susceptible to investigation or lawsuits due to their DEI policies. UCSD's endowment is more than $1.4 billion, according to the UC San Diego Foundation's website. Last fiscal year, UCSD received more than $500 million in federal funds for research.\n\nVance married Chilukuri's daughter Usha in 2014, and the couple have three young children. Vance said in a 2020 podcast interview that Chilukuri took a yearlong sabbatical from her work as a professor to help care for one of her grandchildren. He described Chilukuri and her husband \u2014 also a professor \u2014 as classic, doting grandparents.\n\n\"You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them, like they spoil him and sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren,\" Vance said. \"But it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents, and the evidence on this, by the way, is like super clear.\"\n\nChilukuri has worked at UCSD for decades, rising through the ranks to become provost in 2018.\n\n\"Professor Chilukuri has a demonstrated record of commitment to undergraduate education, equity, and diversity,\" wrote the university's chancellor and executive vice chancellor in an announcement of her promotion to provost. They called Chilukuri \"a creative and dynamic educator.\"\n\nThe popular professor, who also goes by \"Provost Chill\" and \"Dr. C,\" championed DEI initiatives at the school. A 2019 article on the UCSD website examined BILD 60, a class that the school's 2024-2025 catalog lists as satisfying students' DEI course requirement.\n\nThe course, called \"Exploring Issues of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Relation to Human Biology,\" was developed because members of the school's Division of Biological Sciences' Diversity Committee, including Chilukuri, \"recognized the need for a course that looked at DEI issues through a scientific lens,\" according to the article.\n\nHer commitment to inclusiveness was apparent long before she was a provost. Former student Kjeld Aamodt recalled fondly taking a freshman year lecture taught by Chilukuri nearly two decades ago.\n\n\"It was a huge class. It was probably 500 people in that class, but I remember feeling like she recognized me and made me feel special, and had a genuine interest in me,\" Aamodt said in an interview with CBS News.\n\nAamodt, now an orthodontist, said Chilukuri was one of just a few professors to leave a lasting impact on him \u2014 repeating, \"verbatim\" he said, some of her teachings to his own children.\n\n\"I remember her being fairly consistent about [diversity and inclusion], even then we were a very diverse student population, a lot of different ethnicities, and all under one roof and one big auditorium, you know, 500 strong,\" Aamodt said. \"And I remember feeling welcomed and observing her being able to connect with people from very different backgrounds, and I got that feeling that she was practicing what she preached.\"\n\nThat commitment to diversity is clear in Chilukuri's letter to incoming students. She wrote of the \"opportunity and responsibility\" to address systemic racism:\n\n\"How we embrace both will greatly influence who we are as a college and a community. Whether through our African Black Diaspora Living Learning Community, our Multi-Cultural Living Learning Community, programming through our Student Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Advising, Student Council, Student Organizations, or our Culture Art and Technology core academic program, I invite each of you to be part of the conversation and part of the solution.\""

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nOver 500 days have passed since Hamas\u2019 brutal October 7th attack\u2014the deadliest assault on Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nMore than 500 days of platitudes from certain politicians. More than 500 days of empty words. And yet, hatred against Jews isn\u2019t declining\u2014it\u2019s exploding. In New York, home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, Jewish students aren\u2019t just unwelcome, they\u2019re unsafe.\n\nJewish students across New York are under siege. The numbers don\u2019t lie:\n\n72% of Jewish students feel unwelcome on campus.\n\n52% have personally experienced antisemitism at their school.\n\n67% say their university did nothing to protect them after October 7th.\n\n43% actively hide their Jewish identity out of fear.\n\nThis crisis is real, and it\u2019s getting worse. Reports place New York in the \"Hall of Shame\" for campus antisemitism. Institutions like Cornell, Columbia, The New School and NYU have received failing grades for their handling of attacks on Jews. City University of New York (CUNY) and State University of New York (SUNY) schools have also been plagued by repeated incidents of antisemitic harassment. It\u2019s beyond unacceptable\u2014it\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nTRUMP ADMIN WON\u2019T TOLERATE ANTISEMITISM IN SCHOOLS, SAYS LEO TERRELL AS NYC SCHOOLS UNDER MICROSCOPE\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: free speech does not mean free rein to terrorize Jewish students. At Barnard College, we\u2019ve witnessed pro-Palestinian classroom disruptions, protesters storming the campus, injuring a school employee and escalating tensions beyond control. These individuals weren\u2019t expressing an opinion. They were making it impossible for Jewish students to safely learn.\n\nStudents have the right to protest. They do not have the right to commandeer property, intimidate their classmates or spread violent hate. If you cross the line from protest to persecution, the appropriate response isn\u2019t a warning. It\u2019s expulsion. While states like Florida and Texas are taking bold action, New York\u2019s leadership remains asleep at the wheel. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams deliver the same tired speeches, condemn hatred in press releases and then do nothing. Jewish students are still being harassed, assaulted and silenced. New York\u2019s Democratic leaders take the Jewish vote for granted\u2014but they shouldn\u2019t. They have allowed this crisis to fester under their watch.\n\nAs a proud Jewish-American legislator and a member of the Jewish Legislators Caucus in the New York State Assembly, I refuse to stand by while our students are forced to live in fear. Fighting antisemitism isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about moral clarity. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m taking action.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nI introduced the United Against Hate Act, a bold, common-sense plan to combat antisemitism through education, awareness, and action. My bill includes:\n\nA \"New York Stands with Israel\" License Plate \u2013 allowing New Yorkers to proudly display their support while funding hostage rescue efforts. A Statewide High School Art Competition \u2013 teaching students about the dangers of antisemitism and the reality of October 7th through creative expression.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about policy\u2014it\u2019s about making sure the next generation understands that Jew hatred is not an abstract concept. It\u2019s a real and present danger.\n\nWhile New York\u2019s Democratic leaders offer lip service, President Donald Trump has been the strongest defender of Jewish students in America. His administration took real action against campus antisemitism when others only offered empty words. President Trump\u2019s executive order on Combatting Antisemitism empowered the Department of Education to hold universities accountable under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Because of this order, the federal government has launched investigations into five universities where antisemitic harassment has run rampant. That\u2019s what real leadership looks like. And that\u2019s the standard we should demand.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHistory will judge us by what we do at this moment. Will we stand by while hatred against Jews spreads unchecked, or will we take bold action to stop it?\n\nJewish students should not have to hide their identity to feel safe at school. They shouldn\u2019t have to wonder whether their professors, classmates or administrators will defend their rights. And they certainly shouldn\u2019t be left to fend for themselves while politicians offer nothing but hollow statements. If schools and universities refuse to act, then we must hold them accountable. If they tolerate antisemitism, they should be defunded\u2014plain and simple.\n\nThis is a test of moral clarity. I know where I stand. Where do New York\u2019s leaders stand?"

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump added Tuesday to his rapidly growing list of false claims about Canada, wrongly asserting on social media that Canada is \u201cONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.\u201d\n\nCanada is a low-tariff country compared to most others. In fact, figures published by the World Bank show Canada had a lower average tariff rate (1.37%) than the US (1.49%) in 2022, the most recent year for which the data is available, weighted for how much of various products each country imported. Of 137 countries for which the World Bank published these trade-weighted 2022 tariff averages, Canada was 102nd from the top.\n\nBermuda topped the list at 29.52%. Seventeen additional countries, a dozen of them in Africa, were above 12%. To cite an assortment of other countries with tariffs higher than Canada: India was at 11.46%; South Korea was at 8.63%; Brazil was at 7.44%; Mexico was at 4.75%; China was at 3.09%; the United Kingdom was at 3.07%; and Japan was at 1.64%.\n\nThere are various ways to assess a country\u2019s overall tariff picture, but Canada is also nowhere near the top when you use other standard calculation methods. Canada also had a lower 2022 tariff rate (1.83%) than the US (2.72%) in a simple-average comparison that doesn\u2019t factor in trade volumes, the World Bank data show.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim about Canada is \u201cnonsense,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, who discussed the World Bank figures in a February article.\n\nCanada did this month impose new tariffs on imports from the US in response to Trump\u2019s own new tariffs on imports from Canada. Two days after Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, he suspended them, until April 2, on Canadian imports covered by his US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nCanada\u2019s dairy tariffs are an exception, not the norm \u2014 and not actually hitting any US products\n\nAs he has before, Trump pointed in the Tuesday social media post to one set of notably high Canadian tariffs \u2014 dairy duties exceeding 250% on some products \u2014 as a prime example of Canada\u2019s supposedly unfair trade practices. But he again failed to mention that these Canadian dairy tariffs only kick in after the US has hit a certain, Trump-negotiated quantity of zero-tariff sales to Canada. The US is not currently filling its zero-tariff sales quota in any category of dairy product, so the tariffs aren\u2019t being applied.\n\nTrump also did not acknowledge that Canada\u2019s \u201csupply management\u201d protectionism over its dairy and poultry industries is the exception, not the norm. \u201cThe overwhelming proportion\u201d of US trade with Canada has for decades been tariff-free for both countries, noted Dartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin; \u201cCanada does not apply tariffs on most US goods.\u201d The US Department of Agriculture itself points out that \u201calmost all\u201d US agricultural exports to Canada faced zero tariffs or quotas under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that took effect in 1994 and continue to face zero tariffs or quotas under the USMCA that modified NAFTA in 2020.\n\nDaniel Schwanen, senior vice president at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Canada, said Trump\u2019s claim about Canada being a high-tariff country has \u201ca grain or an element of truth\u201d given Canada\u2019s hefty dairy and poultry tariffs on imports above the tariff-free quota thresholds \u2014 but Schwanen said Trump\u2019s claim is still \u201cwrong as a general statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be really unfortunate if people got the impression that Canada is in general a high-tariff country, especially vis-\u00e0-vis American products. That\u2019s not the case. It is the case with respect to, really, a sliver of trade,\u201d Schwanen said in a Tuesday interview.\n\nTrump made the false claim in a social media post in which he said he was doubling, to 50%, his tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in response to the Canadian province of Ontario announcing a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states (which Ontario\u2019s premier said later Tuesday he was suspending, prompting Trump to abandon his own retaliation plan).\n\nTrump also threatened in the post to impose car tariffs \u201cwhich will, essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada\u201d if Canada doesn\u2019t remove \u201cegregious, long time Tariffs.\u201d And he repeated his call for Canada to become the 51st US state, a notion overwhelmingly rejected by Canadians."

            "full_content": "Photo: Susan Walsh/Getty Images\n\nLife can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forward, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard once asserted. And so it goes with public policy. It\u2019s easy, in retrospect, to criticize any particular decision and express exasperation with the experts who handed down their decrees. A full five years has come and gone since the coronavirus began infecting and killing Americans. It was exactly this week, in 2020, when COVID officially entered the mass consciousness: The NBA suddenly canceled its season, Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive for the new virus, and Donald Trump delivered a disorienting Oval Office address.\n\nAs much as we would like to pretend otherwise, we all carry COVID scars. More than 1 million Americans are dead. We\u2019ve either lost loved ones or know those who have suffered mightily. We\u2019ve all, inevitably, had COVID ourselves, and some iterations of the virus were far from mild. Children, teenagers, and young adults lost some of their most formative years to Zoom screens. Remote work hollowed out the downtowns of many cities. The inflation that the pandemic at least partially triggered lingers to this day. In 2019, few were talking about a nationwide housing crunch or the hefty cost of groceries. Life today is far better than it was during the depths of the pandemic: Tourism roared back, restaurants filled again, and the economy is far stronger than it was in the spring of 2020, when many feared a second Great Depression was upon us. But we can\u2019t undo the loss of life nor the loss of time.\n\nWhat could have been done differently? With five years of hindsight, what sort of decisions should politicians and public-health officials have made? What were the worst avoidable mistakes? There are no easy answers. But given that we now live in a period of surging anti-vaxx sentiment and distrust of the public-health Establishment, it can be reasonably argued that several messaging and policy failures helped power the return of Trump and the installation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to establish what the public-health Establishment \u2014 and liberals, broadly \u2014 got right about COVID. The coordinated citywide and regional lockdowns in the early weeks of the pandemic were successful at averting mass death. In King County, home to Seattle, and the Bay Area of California, local leaders worked closely with governors to communicate effectively with the public and rapidly close down any venues where mass gatherings might occur. The coronavirus arrived earliest there and it was little-heralded leaders like Jay Inslee, then the governor of Washington, who took the pandemic seriously and helped to keep his state\u2019s death rate among the very lowest in America over the next several years. When vaccines were unavailable, early action was pivotal. California, too, would suffer through subsequent COVID waves, driving its death rate up, but it still lost fewer lives, relative to its population, than other states that were ravaged at a comparable time.\n\nAs governor, Andrew Cuomo was initially celebrated for his pandemic leadership, delivering press briefings that were watched by millions. Several scandals would subsequently dent that popularity, including his alleged manipulation of the death-toll data in nursing homes and his decision to accept more than $5 million to write a pandemic memoir, but it\u2019s been mostly forgotten that Cuomo, in the earliest weeks of COVID\u2019s appearance in the U.S., was likening the virus to the common flu and downplaying its potential devastation. Cuomo, who is now running for mayor, actually dithered over locking down New York City, blocking his political rival, Mayor Bill de Blasio, from initially issuing a shutdown order. Public-health researchers found this delay might have led to many thousands of deaths as COVID tore through the region.\n\nIn hindsight, though, certain kinds of lockdowns lasted too long. It was sensible to close schools in March 2020 and let children learn remotely for the rest of the school year. But the decision, in certain big city and suburban school districts, to institute remote learning for the entirety of 2020 and 2021 proved disastrous. Children themselves, and young people broadly, were far less likely to die of COVID and could have, in most instances, safely gone to school to learn and socialize. Teachers were more vulnerable, but relatively few of them belonged to the most threatened cohort of Americans: the elderly and the immunocompromised. There\u2019s mounting evidence to suggest that school closures contributed to devastating learning loss and stunted social development. Some students dropped out and never returned.\n\nPublic-health officials and politicians greatly erred, too, in shuttering parks, playgrounds, beaches, and other outdoor spaces where people could have clustered more safely. The padlocking of playgrounds was as absurd as shaming Floridians for heading to the beach. The public-health Establishment should have been honest with Americans: The pandemic was going to be a multiyear endeavor, and this meant that it was unsustainable to curtail human interaction indefinitely. Go outside and wear a mask was simple enough messaging. Absolutism did not work, and only provoked backlash. There was a fantasy, in the first months of COVID, that millions of people, acting together, could collectively will the pandemic away. No country could do this \u2014 not even those, like China and New Zealand, that implemented extraordinarily aggressive lockdown measures.\n\nNeither political party knew how to talk about the COVID vaccine sensibly. After taking credit for Operation Warp Speed, which quickly funded the development of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, Trump pivoted to strenuous vaccine skepticism because that\u2019s where Republicans had migrated during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Conservatives pitched ineffective alternative cures and cooked up lies about the vaccine, blaming it for every sudden death or claiming it could alter a person\u2019s DNA. In poorer, rural states, which are now disproportionately Republican, the decision of some conservatives with comorbidities to refuse vaccination probably contributed to the mass deaths there. The states with the highest COVID death rates \u2014 including Kentucky, West Virginia, and Mississippi \u2014 overwhelmingly backed Trump.\n\nBut Democrats \u2014 and the left-leaning public-health officials they staunchly supported \u2014 peddled what would be, in retrospect, their own misinformation. In early 2021, the COVID vaccines were sold as a miracle cure that could stamp out the pandemic for good. Public-health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci promised that vaccinated individuals would be much less likely to spread the virus. The idea was wrongheaded, if straightforward enough: Get a COVID vaccine and you\u2019d no longer be a vector for the coronavirus. This would prove wildly untrue as 2021 dragged on and new variants of COVID, like Delta and Omicron, appeared. Should public-health officials be blamed for not foreseeing any kind of COVID mutation? Probably. Or, if they\u2019re spared, they can certainly be accused of failing to adjust their messaging once it became obvious the vaccinated and unvaccinated could equally infect others.\n\nPerhaps no policy did greater damage to the cause of vaccination in America than the vaccine mandates that mostly Democratic mayors and governors imposed in 2021 and 2022. If they did spur an uptake in vaccination rates, they also alienated millions of Americans, many of them working class, who could not understand why the status of their employment was now bound to their personal medical decisions. Teachers, sanitation workers, and military personnel were all fired for refusing the vaccine, and the unvaccinated were barred in certain Democrat-run states and cities from a wide range of jobs and greater public life. The political fallout, for the left, was severe: formerly liberal individuals driven rightward, the deep reddening of Florida, and the rise of RFK Jr., who rode decades of anti-vaccine activism to Washington, D.C.\n\nA more effective and humane approach would have been to heavily market the COVID vaccine to the elderly and the immunocompromised. Vulnerable populations needed protection. Forcing the vaccine on children and teens made less sense, however, and bred long-lasting suspicion of public-health authorities. Entirely downplaying the reality of vaccine injuries \u2014 a small percentage of the population experienced adverse side effects, like myocarditis \u2014 only further fanned the flames of conspiracy. And not every vaccine manufacturer produced a sterling product: Both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were eventually pulled from the market altogether, with the former causing rare, fatal blood clots. If vaccine injuries, like the possibility of COVID\u2019s origin in a Wuhan lab, were discussed and debated more honestly from the beginning, enormous gaps would not have opened up for misinformation and conspiracy to take root.\n\nWhat the federal government should be doing now \u2014 and tragically will be doing little of, thanks to Trump \u2014 is investing significantly in vaccine research, especially as bird flu becomes a greater threat and makes the leap to infecting humans. Luckily, bird flu is far less contagious among humans than the coronavirus. In the future, though, new pandemics might arise, those that combine the transmissibility of COVID with a virus that has a higher fatality rate. The federal government should invest in new hospital capacity or at least have a working plan to immediately assist states with providing excess beds in the event hospitals rapidly fill up. Decades of consolidations and closures have left cities and rural areas alike bereft of functioning hospitals. In New York City, hospitals were immediately overwhelmed, and lives might have been saved if some of the old hospitals in the outer-boroughs that were shuttered decades ago were still able to receive COVID patients.\n\nIn the interim, public-health authorities should reckon with where their messaging went awry \u2014 and the policies they championed that proved counterproductive. Americans craved honesty and consistency in a terrifying time; they didn\u2019t often get it. It\u2019s hard to know how the nation would react if another pandemic appeared tomorrow. We can only hope it never does."

His lawyers want him brought back to New York and released under supervision.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NYPD made arrests after several protesters blocked a downtown street in Manhattan, even after warnings to clear the roadway, according to the New York Post.\n\nWHO IS MAHMOUND KHALIL, THE ANTI-ISRAEL COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ACTIVIST ICE ARRESTED?\n\nOne demonstrator was tackled to the ground by a pair of officers during his arrest.\n\n\"Move cops, get out the way, we know you\u2019re Israeli-trained,\" some protesters shouted as police blocked them from entering City Hall Park. \"Oink, oink, piggy, piggy. We\u2019re gonna make your lives s--tty.\"\n\nPolice repeatedly warned protesters that if they remained on the roadway, they would be arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nThe NYPD said late Tuesday that one person was charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration charges while 11 others were issued summonses, the New York Post reported.\n\nPolice also took a man into custody after he got into an argument with a protester, according to the outlet.\n\nICE AGENTS ARREST ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST WHO LED PROTESTS ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FOR MONTHS\n\nEarlier, about 350 protesters marched from Washington Square Park to Federal Plaza Immigration Court as they chanted anti-Israel slogans and called for Khalil\u2019s freedom, the outlet noted.\n\n\"There is only one solution, intifada revolution,\" protesters chanted.\n\nThe group was attempting to make speeches in front of the federal courthouse in the middle of the street when they were told by the NYPD to continue walking.

            "full_content": "Summary House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Barry Loudermilk disagree on the scope the investigation relitigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nJohnson wants a narrower focus, according to three sources, while Loudermilk prefers a broader mandate.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes disagreement has in part prevented the select subcommittee announced by Johnson in January from starting its work.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Johnson before taking office that the investigation should be a priority.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRepublicans are at a standstill over their investigation relitigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, with House Speaker Mike Johnson and the Republican leading the effort disagreeing on how to move forward.\n\nJohnson wants Republicans to stop investigating the former January 6 committee, including former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, and narrow its focus, according to three sources familiar with the negotiations. But GOP Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who has been tapped to helm the probe, would prefer a broader mandate, a position backed by some officials at the White House. President Donald Trump told Johnson before he took office that he wanted this investigation to be a priority, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe tapered scope would also prohibit the investigation from looking at security preparedness leading up to the attack and how to improve security at the US Capitol going forward, the sources added.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes disagreement that has deadlocked negotiations is in part why Loudermilk\u2019s new select subcommittee, which Johnson announced in January, has not yet started its work, the sources said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoudermilk told CNN in a statement Thursday: \u201cWhen former Speaker Kevin McCarthy tapped me to lead House Republican\u2019s investigation into the security failures at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Pelosi\u2019s Select Committee, I told him I would accept the challenge under these two conditions: I would have the autonomy and resources needed to effectively pursue the facts without political bias or outside influence, and I would have the authority to report whatever we find to the American people. I still believe this is what is needed to effectively pursue the truth.\u201d\n\nIn the last Congress, Loudermilk zeroed in on the former January 6 committee and its work product. The House GOP report culminated by recommending Cheney be investigated by the FBI for her role in probing the Capitol attack.\n\nBut if Johnson has his way, Loudermilk would not be able to pick up his work where he left off. Housing Loudermilk\u2019s new probe under the House Judiciary committee, as Johnson would prefer, would limit the topics the subcommittee could investigate. Its focus would shift to subjects like the former federal investigations under the Department of Justice into January 6; trying to identify the person who placed two viable pipe bombs near the Republican and Democratic National Committee headquarters; and the confidential human sources \u2014 paid FBI informants \u2014 who were in Washington DC on January 6. Both areas are already being looked at by Trump allies at DOJ, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel.\n\nThe dispute over how to handle the probe speaks to broader divisions that persist in the Republican party over how to handle the topic of January 6. Many Republican lawmakers would like to move on, but can\u2019t because Trump himself isn\u2019t done with the past and continues to make former January 6 committee members a top target.\n\nGOP Rep. Mike Collins of Georgia, who has referred to rioters who stormed the Capitol as \u201cpeaceful grandmothers,\u201d said of Loudermilk\u2019s investigation: \u201cI hope it\u2019s not stalled.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, who represents a swing district, told CNN he wasn\u2019t aware that his colleagues were continuing to investigate January 6, indicating that this is not a top priority across the conference.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was an effort to keep this going to be honest with you,\u201d Ciscomani said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only way that Johnson is stalling when it comes to how he handles January 6.\n\nJohnson still has not hung a plaque to honor the Capitol Police officers who responded to the attack on January 6, even though former President Joe Biden signed a law that Congress passed back in 2022 mandating such a plaque be displayed on the front of the Capitol.\n\nGiven the chaotic first two months of the Trump presidency, the impasse over how to move forward with Loudermilk\u2019s investigation has largely stayed under the radar.\n\nBut it won\u2019t go unnoticed forever.\n\nGOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who has supported the effort to declare that Trump did not engage in an insurrection, told CNN that Republicans still need to investigate the former January 6 committee, security lapses and claims about the FBI.\n\n\u201cWe need to absolutely look into that,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with comment from Rep. Barry Loudermilk."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAmericans are not impressed with President Donald Trump\u2019s stewardship of the economy, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, putting him underwater on the nation\u2019s top issue even as he sees ratings among the best of his presidential career on other key priorities.\n\nAs markets slide and investors worry in response to Trump\u2019s trade policies, a 56% majority of the public disapproves of his handling of the economy, worse than at any point during his first term in office. By contrast, the 51% who now say they approve of his work on immigration \u2013 headlined by stricter enforcement efforts \u2013 is 7 points higher than at any point during his first term.\n\nAmericans are closely divided over Trump\u2019s performance so far in handling the federal budget and managing the federal government \u2013 48% approve on each, with about half disapproving \u2013 while giving him lower ratings for his work on health care policy (43%), foreign affairs (42%) and tariffs (39%).\n\nTrump\u2019s overall job approval rating currently stands at 45%, with 54% disapproving, in line with the numbers he saw in March 2017 and matching his highest ratings for his first term in office. Overall, 35% of Americans say things in the country are going well, a rise from 29% in January, reflecting a surge in positive sentiment within the GOP. His ratings remain highly polarized, with Republicans roughly 10 times as likely as Democrats to approve of his job performance.\n\nThere\u2019s overwhelming agreement across party lines that Trump\u2019s use of presidential power reflects a break from historical precedent. An 86% majority of Americans, including more than three-quarters of adults in each party, say that Trump is taking a completely different approach to presidential power in comparison to past presidents, with 49% calling this a bad thing and 37% saying it\u2019s a good thing. Just 14% say his approach to his second term has been generally in line with past presidents\u2019.\n\nEconomic concerns continue to dominate, the poll finds, with 42% of Americans choosing the economy as their top issue from a list of seven \u2013 more than doubling the share who picked any other issue, including the state of US democracy (19%), the way the federal government works (14%), immigration (12%), health care (6%), foreign policy (3%) or climate change (2%).\n\nThe economy is also the issue with the most resonance across party lines, narrowly landing behind concerns about democracy among Democratic adults (36% choose the state of US democracy, 33% the economy), and dominating the issue landscape among Republicans and independents (45% in each group choose the economy).\n\nPerceptions of Trump as able to bring the change the country needs (50%) and manage the government effectively (49%) are significantly higher than they were during the latter half of Trump\u2019s first term (43% and 42%, respectively, in November 2019). Roughly half of Americans currently say that Trump has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively (51%), with fewer calling him an effective world leader (46%) or saying he respects the rule of law (38%).\n\nWorries about Musk\u2019s role, government cuts\n\nTrump has spent his first months back in office seeking to sharply cut spending and reduce the federal workforce. The public\u2019s views of that effort and Elon Musk, to whom Trump has given a prominent role, are largely negative.\n\nJust 35% of Americans express a positive view of Musk, with 53% rating him negatively and 11% offering no opinion \u2013 making him both better known and more substantially unpopular than Vice President JD Vance (whom 33% of Americans rate favorably and 44% unfavorably, with 23% having no opinion.) Roughly 6 in 10 Americans say that Musk has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make changes to the way the government works. There is uneasiness about Musk even among some of the president\u2019s supporters: 28% of those who see Trump\u2019s changes to the government as necessary doubt the tech billionaire has the judgment to carry them out.\n\nA 55% majority of Americans say that the Trump administration\u2019s changes to the federal government are being made largely to advance his agenda, with 45% calling the changes necessary to ensure the government functions properly.\n\nAsked to weigh whether they\u2019re more concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the federal government going too far or not far enough, 62% of Americans say they\u2019re more worried about the former and fear important programs being shut down. The other 37% say they\u2019re more worried about the cuts not going far enough in eliminating fraud and waste in the federal government. Nine in 10 Democrats and 69% of independents say they\u2019re more concerned about losing important federal programs, while 73% of Republicans say they\u2019re more concerned that fraud and waste will remain an issue in the government.\n\nLingering doubts since first term\n\nSome opinions of Trump\u2019s second presidency echo dynamics seen throughout his political career. The shares who describe Trump as caring about people like them (40%) or being able to unite the country (34%) remain about as negative as they were in 2019. During his first term, the share who strongly disapproved of his performance as president consistently outstripped the share who strongly approved; in the latest survey, those numbers stand at 41% and 26%, respectively.\n\nHe has never been seen by a majority of Americans as having the right presidential priorities, and in the latest survey, 57% say he hasn\u2019t paid attention to the country\u2019s most important problems. The 59% of US adults who currently call Trump\u2019s views and policies too extreme marks a modest uptick from the 54% majority of registered voters who said the same last September, shortly before he was reelected to the White House.\n\nSignificant shares of the public express some degree of mixed views about Trump\u2019s policies or his qualities as a leader: 12%, for instance, say they approve of his handling of immigration but disapprove of his work on the economy; 15% say both that Trump does not respect the rule of law and that he can bring the kind of change the country needs.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from March 6-9 among a random national sample of 1,206 US adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among all adults have a margin of sampling error of \u00b13.3 percentage points.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta and Edward Wu contributed to this report."

More specifically, I called for a \"tactical pause\" that would allow Democrats to \"regroup, look forward and make decisions about where we want to get to over the next two years.\" The reaction to that piece was as depressing as it was predictable\u2014a bicoastal condemnation.\n\nMolly Jong-Fast, the estimable commentator, took to Vanity Fair, calling me out and calling for the Democratic Party to mount a full-court press, \"making noise on TV and social media\" in response to the chaos inflicted by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, on the Pacific Coast, California Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom shared with Charlie Kirk on his new podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom\" just how much he disagrees with me.\n\nWe saw the Newsom/Jong-Fast/Green strategy in play last Tuesday night during the president's address to Congress \u2014pink suits, paddles and dry-erase boards aplenty.\n\nContrast that with the Carvillian approach taken by Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and the responses they both solicited.\n\nCARVILLE SCOLDS DEMOCRATS FOR 'FOOLISHNESS' AT TRUMP'S ADDRESS WHILE US FACES 'GREATEST PERIL' IN 80 YEARS\n\nI think it\u2019s evident to anyone and everyone that Democrats' response needs to be deliberate, determined and dignified\u2014not \"The Charge of the Light Brigade.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nI understand that Democrats are anxious and demanding more, but there\u2019s a thing called a calendar, and there are opportunities abound.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs I think of what\u2019s to come, I\u2019m reminded of former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan: \"Events, my dear boy, events.\""

            "full_content": "Bernie Sanders in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Photo: Jim Vondruska/Reuters\n\nLast month, as Elon Musk\u2019s malevolent influence on Donald Trump\u2019s second term was coming into focus, a friend DM\u2019ed me a clip of Chuck Schumer leading a protest against Musk\u2019s efforts to access sensitive Treasury Department data. \u201cWe will win! We will win!\u201d croaked the Senate minority leader, the crowd clearly reluctant to join this confused approximation of what impassioned resistance might look like. My friend wrote, \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna die.\u201d\n\nBeing uninspired by the Democratic Party is a national pastime, but 2025 has ushered in new levels of loathing, with the party\u2019s approval rating sinking to record lows. Schumer\u2019s efforts have been so limp that a group of liberal governors in January begged him to grow a spine in opposing Trump\u2019s agenda and cabinet nominees. Schumer\u2019s counterpart in the House, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, has fared no better, alternating between sphinxlike nonresponses to revelations that Trump had essentially bought New York City mayor Eric Adams in a quid-pro-quo deal with the Justice Department and bizarrely menacing anti-GOP diatribes performed in sweats in empty rooms. Congressional Democrats were widely mocked for the little protest paddles they held up during Trump\u2019s State of the Union, while Representative Al Green was kicked out for a disruption that was derided as pathetic and unconvincing.\n\nMeanwhile, California governor Gavin Newsom has started a podcast to interview conservative influencers and throw trans athletes under the bus, Representative Elissa Slotkin\u2019s official rebuttal to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address was a paean to Ronald Reagan, and Connecticut senator Chris Murphy has appeared on any news outlet that will have him speaking in a very loud voice about how mad he is. It can often seem that, when it comes to opposing Trump, Democrats have no idea what to say or how to say it.\n\nThis has not been the case, however, with the two most prominent leftists in the broader Democratic tent. Bernie Sanders has spent the first month and a half of Trump\u2019s second presidency doing what you\u2019d expect Bernie Sanders to do: raging against the corrosive influence of billionaires on politics. \u201cI fear very much that under President Trump, we are not seeing a \u2018government of the people, by the people, for the people,\u2019 but rather a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, and for the billionaire class,\u201d the 83-year-old warned his Senate colleagues last month. He has sounded the same alarm during his \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, which has drawn thousands of attendees across the Midwest in recent weeks, including 2,600 people at a rally on Saturday in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of only 10,000.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been even more combative toward the administration, boycotting Trump\u2019s swearing-in ceremony and State of the Union address while feuding with everyone from border czar Tom Homan to White House adviser and virulent xenophobe Katie Miller. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s critiques, in which she has called Musk \u201ca leech on the public\u201d for threatening to overhaul Social Security and immediately condemned the detention of pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil, feel both precise and cathartic and regularly go viral. Ocasio-Cortez will join Sanders on the road soon while launching her own solo appearances in Republican-held districts.\n\nThere is solace to be found in these familiar spectacles, reassurance that, even with the government and civil society exploding around us, some Democrats can be counted on to fight back and fight back well. But it also raises a question that will define the next four years in American politics: Why are Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez so much better at this than their colleagues?\n\nOne answer is that they have credibility and devoted followings built over the years they\u2019ve spent at odds with not only Republicans but more moderate factions within their own caucus. They are as disappointed with the Democrats as seemingly the rest of America is. Sanders is a grizzled relic of the kind of class politics that was swept aside by genteel liberals like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and his diagnosis that the party was undone in 2024 because it abandoned the working class lines up with analyses that have been offered up by gloating MAGA Republicans and disillusioned anti-woke liberals alike. Ocasio-Cortez, for her part, has proven deft at integrating herself with the Establishment but remains a go-to scapegoat for the party whenever something goes wrong. When the centrist think tank Third Way urged Democrats to move \u201caway from the dominance of small-dollar donors\u201d in its post-2024 autopsy, it was hard not to interpret it as a shot at Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBroadly speaking, each has a track record of standing by principles and beliefs that make their protests against Trumpism both coherent and believable. This is one of the advantages of belonging to one wing of the party, as opposed to bearing responsibility for the coalition as a whole \u2014 the purview of congressional leaders like Schumer and Jeffries and potential presidential aspirants like Murphy and Newsom. But it does put a glaring spotlight on the fact that mainstream Democrats have been so consumed by a desire to triangulate that they seem to have no idea what they believe in.\n\nNo wonder thousands of people in Republican districts are lining up to see Sanders while so many Democrats are begging his colleagues in their own districts to do something. Which has some intriguing implications for who will lead the Democrats going forward, since it is the moderates who own the conventional wisdom on what\u2019s best for the party but the leftists who have the energy. The liberal pundit Matt Yglesias interpreted the \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour as a ploy by Sanders to get the last laugh in the ongoing, never-ending fallout from the 2016 primary. \u201cIs Bernie running in 2028?\u201d Yglesias tweeted over the weekend. \u201cIs he going to endorse someone?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez retorted, \u201cBelieve it or not, some people\u2019s everyday actions aren\u2019t motivated by some long-term career ambition, but out of a genuine love for people and a desire to do right by them.\u201d\n\nWhile that may be true, Yglesias was right to identify a proxy battle for the party\u2019s future. Mainstream Democrats intent on sidelining leftist insurgents seem to have not so much surrendered as fallen into self-defeating inertia, treating Trump\u2019s popularity as such an article of faith that they have willingly sacrificed both their own popularity and the health of our society to avoid alienating his voters. It\u2019s becoming harder, as Trump continues his rampage, to imagine spending the next four years taking cues from leaders whose principles are this difficult to ascertain."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAn elected leader once dubbed \u201cThe Punisher\u201d was handed to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs, in a breathtaking reversal of fortune for a politician who once openly boasted about killing people and placing opponents on hit lists.\n\nRodrigo Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which he oversaw a brutal crackdown on drugs, openly threatened critics with death and tongue-lashed a host of global leaders from the Pope to former US President Barack Obama.\n\nOn Wednesday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands confirmed the former Philippines leader was now in its custody.\n\nA former prosecutor, congressman and mayor, Duterte built his no-holds-barred reputation in the southern Philippine city of Davao. He swept to the presidency in 2016 on a populist \u2013 and popular \u2013 promise to replicate the hardline tactics of his hometown and wage war against drugs and drug pushers across the Southeast Asian nation.\n\n\u201cAll of you who are into drugs, you sons of b**ches, I will really kill you,\u201d he told a huge crowd in one of his many characteristically profane-laced 2016 campaign speeches. \u201cI have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.\u201d\n\nOnce in power he unleashed what rights groups called \u201cdeath squads\u201d to eradicate drug pushers \u2013 many of the victims young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen as part of a campaign to target dealers.\n\nPolice data said 6,000 people were killed. Some rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000 with innocents and bystanders often caught in the crossfire.\n\nDuterte\u2019s blood-soaked presidency ended in 2022. Three years later, only 8 policemen had been convicted for 5 of the victims killed in the war on drugs, according to court documents.\n\nThe ICC launched an investigation into allegations of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d committed by Duterte during both his time as national leader and mayor of Davao.\n\nDuterte has long denied the accusations of human rights abuses and contends the drug issue is one for domestic law enforcement. He has repeatedly said he will not kowtow to foreign jurisdiction and taunted the ICC, urging prosecutors to \u201churry up\u201d and move on him.\n\nTwo days before his arrest, he slammed the ICC in a typically fiery speech to supporters in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cFrom my own news, I have a warrant\u2026from the ICC or something\u2026 these motherf***ers have been chasing me for a long time. What did I do wrong ?\u201d he said.\n\nPolice gather outside Villamor Air Base, where former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was held after his arrest in Manila on March 11, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA sudden arrest\n\nBut the tide had suddenly turned. Authorities were waiting for Duterte to return from Hong Kong, and arrested him at the main airport in Manila, sparking chaotic scenes.\n\nAs the news filtered out, many were left in shock.\n\nSome flocked to churches in the majority Catholic country to attend impromptu mass to commemorate the thousands of victims of his drug war, seeing the move as a first step towards overdue justice.\n\nAnd just before midnight, Duterte was back on a plane \u2013 this time bound for the Netherlands in what appeared to be a stunning end to a stormy and violent stint at the top of Philippine politics.\n\nIn a Wednesday statement, the ICC said Duterte was \u201csurrendered\u201d to its custody, and a hearing would be scheduled in \u201cdue course.\u201d It is unclear when he will make his first court appearance.\n\nShortly before landing in Rotterdam, Duterte released a defiant video message on his Facebook page. \u201cI was saying to the police and military that you do your job and I will take responsibility, so it has come to this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis will be a long legal proceedings, but I say to you, I will continue to serve my country. And so be it, if that is my destiny,\u201d he added.\n\nSupporters of former President Rodrigo Duterte gather outside the gate of Villamor Airbase, where Duterte was taken following his arrest on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant, on March 11, 2025 in Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images\n\nWhy now?\n\nThe arrest likely owes more to Duterte being on the wrong side of a feud between two of the Philippine\u2019s most high-profile families than the might of the ICC, which cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants\n\nDuterte\u2019s clan was previously in an alliance with the famed Marcos political dynasty, with his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio serving as deputy to current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nAn emotional mass was held in memory of the drug war victims at a church in Manila on March 11, 2025 following news of Duterte's arrest. Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut in recent months the alliance collapsed, descending into public tirades and name-calling.\n\nIn October, Duterte-Carpio aired a litany of grievances against the president in a two-hour livestreamed press conference, saying she \u201cwanted to chop his head off.\u201d\n\nThen she said in an online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and House Speak Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn\u2019t a joke.\n\nMarcos had said the Philippines will \u201cdisengage\u201d from any contact with the ICC, as Manila does not recognize its authority over matters of national sovereignty.\n\nThat\u2019s because Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.\n\nBut under the ICC\u2019s withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state.\n\nPresident Marcos said he was obliged to follow Interpol\u2019s request to arrest Duterte.\n\n\u201cInterpol asked for help, and we obliged because we have commitments to the Interpol, which we have to fulfil. If we don\u2019t do that, they will not, they will no longer help us with other cases involving Filipino fugitives abroad,\u201d Marcos said in a late-night presser after the plane carrying Duterte took off.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nCarlos Conde, a Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW) Conde said Duterte\u2019s swift arrest and removal was a \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d that caught also a lot of people off guard.\n\n\u201cThe victims of the drug war \u2013 thousands of victims \u2013 have pretty much lost faith in the domestic accountability mechanisms in the Philippines. So, they were pinning their hopes on the ICC,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nNobel laureate Maria Ressa told CNN Duterte\u2019s arrest marks a major moment for the country and signals that years of impunity can be ended.\n\nCatholic priest Flavie Villanueva comforts a woman while watching the exhumation of her father's remains at Navotas Cemetery in the Philippines on July 8, 2021. Eloisa Lopez/Reuters\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s historic for the Philippines, it\u2019s the first time a Philippine president has been arrested for crimes against humanity. That an Interpol-led arrest actually ended this impunity under president Duterte that now has him going to The Hague,\u201d said Ressa, former CNN Manila bureau chief and CEO and founder of news site Rappler.\n\nHuman rights campaigner Aurora Parong told CNN many advocates and drug war victims\u2019 family members were elated with a momentary sense of relief after hearing Duterte had indeed been arrested.\n\n\u201cBut there is this mixed feeling of joy and hope and anxiety because we do not exactly know where this will end up to what will be the outcome. Will there really be accountability?\u201d said Parong, who is also co-chair of the Philippine Coalition for the ICC (PCICC).\n\nBut she cautioned it would be an excruciatingly long road to justice.\n\n\u201cIt is time consuming. It will take years before there will be a conviction at the International Criminal Court. The waiting is really difficult for the victims and the families of the victims of the bloody war on drugs.\u201d\n\nWhat is the ICC?\n\nLocated in The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression against the territory of its member states, of which there are 125.\n\nDuterte\u2019s arrest and transfer is a significant victory for the body. The court cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants \u2013 which often rests on domestic politics and political will on whether to follow through.\n\nMany of those on its wanted list remain at large, unruffled by the serious charges laid against them.\n\nThe court has been rounded on by the United States for seeking the arrests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023, attack.\n\nThe ICC simultaneously sought the arrests of top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed.\n\nNeither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC.\n\nThe court has also issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, although it is unlikely the warrant will be served any time soon. Putin travelled to ICC member Mongolia last year, but was not arrested."

            "full_content": "BlackRock founder Larry Fink is warning President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA policies might cause some inflation before emerging technology allows American citizens to earn higher wages without inflation.\n\nThe mega-investor on Wall Street told a March 10 conference hosted by S&P Global:\n\nWhen I go to Washington, when they talk about these [MAGA] policies, I ask \u201cAt what cost are you willing to tolerate [wage-driven inflation]? Yes, we may have opportunities to create better and more robust jobs, but then the offside of that will be, it will probably create a little more elevated inflation in the short run.\n\nThe \u201clittle more\u201d inflation from rising wages can be reversed by productivity gains from emerging technology, Fink said. The \u201cbig deflation because of the advancement of AI and robots \u2026 is going to reshape the economy,\u201d Fink said.\n\nForeign companies are already deploying the new technology that also shrinks inflation, he said:\n\nI was with an Asian CEO that builds phones and they\u2019re now applying AI robots \u2014 robots that have much more tensile dexterity, that they believe over the course of the next two years, their workforce will be down 30 percent with the advent of more technology and more robotics. If you translate that across all the economies, we\u2019re going to have shortage of [workers for] some things, like I said, in construction and electricians, and we\u2019re going to have job [reductions] in many other industries that robots through AI are going to [cause].\n\nChina has invested heavily in robots and automation and leads the world in manufacturing output and in manufacturing technology.\n\nFink described the balancing act that faces Trump and his deputies:\n\nWith the whole idea that we\u2019re going to have to use private capital to build up this economy, are we going to have enough workers? I\u2019ve even told members of the Trump team that we\u2019re going to run out of electricians as we build out AI data centers.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of low migration and Fink\u2019s worries about shortages of agriculture workers, construction crews, and electricians are good news for Trump\u2019s blue-collar voters and their teenage children. That is because labor shortages ensure U.S. workers and their families gain higher wages \u2014 and also ensure companies will buy high-tech machinery to help them get more work and wages each day.\n\nThat result would be good news for GOP politicians because wage gains will likely prompt happy citizens to vote for Trump and GOP politicians in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nRising wages \u201care good for national politics if you\u2019re a politician, for sure,\u201d then-U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue told Breitbart News in 2020. \u201cIf you look the other side of your question: \u2018Are decreasing wages good for national politics?\u2019 Hell, no.\u201d\n\nMany of these wage and productivity gains will be delivered by the foreign companies that are moving investment into the United States under Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs.\n\nBut those wage and productivity gains, however, will be sunk if Trump and GOP legislators agree to import more migrants or H-1B visa workers because of loud demands from employers, investors, donors, ethnic politicians, Democrats, and their chorus of pro-migrant establishment journalists.\n\nFink manages $10 trillion of investments in many companies. His job requires him to balance his investors\u2019 demands for maximum short-term profits and stock-price gains against other demands for the research and investment that create long-term innovation, productivity, and general prosperity.\n\nIn April 2024, Fink suggested American politicians should grow wealth via investment instead of via President Joe Biden\u2019s policy of extracting migrant consumers, renters, and wage-cutting workers from poor countries.\n\n\u201cI can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,\u201d Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued:\n\nThat\u2019s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don\u2019t allow anybody to come in \u2014 [so they have] shrinking demographics \u2014 these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology \u2026 If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations.\n\nBut on Monday\u2019s event in Houston, Fink focused on the near-term inflation expected as Trump rolls back Biden\u2019s mass legal and illegal migration. Fink argued:\n\nI do believe deportations \u2014 and the speed at which it is happening \u2014 is going to have a severe impact on the agricultural sector [and] the construction sector. I\u2019ve talked to CEOs in the ag sector, and they remind me that 70 percent of the men and women who work in agriculture were not born in the United States. Many are U.S. citizens. Now many of them have work permits and many of them don\u2019t. Now 40 percent of the construction workers were not born in the United States. You add that up and what\u2019s going on? I think \u2026 are we going to have enough workers to harvest the crops?\n\nBiden\u2019s high-migration economy reduced wage-driven inflation by importing several million migrant workers. For example, wages rose by less than 1 percent from January 2024 to January 2025 under Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s deputies forgot that migrants need housing, food, and autos \u2014 and those prices zoomed upwards as roughly 12 million migrants crowded into the United States. The resulting consumer-caused inflation caused massive political problems for Biden and his Democrats.\n\nTrump has ended Biden\u2019s migration policy, so he faces no additional consumer-caused inflation. But he and his deputies are zig-zagging forward, by welcoming modest wage gains for Americans while hoping those wage gains do not drive up prices and inflation.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s deputies are deporting perhaps 2 million foreign criminals and migrants already ordered home by judges. Many other migrants are in hiding, some are being caught during workplace visits, and some are voluntarily going home \u2014 but there is no sign that Trump\u2019s deputies are already targeting agriculture workers or construction crews.\n\nThere are millions of unemployed American men and women who might replace deported migrants.\n\nAt least 5 million demoralized or alienated men have fallen out of the labor force since 2000 and are not officially counted as unemployed. Many can be cajoled, shamed, enticed, or pushed back into the workforce once companies run out of cheap workers. The return of the sidelined workers will reduce pressure for further wage gains, and so reduce inflation.\n\nU.S. companies will also likely increase efforts to raise productivity via high-tech automation, just as they did in Trump\u2019s first term."

            "full_content": "Ukraine on Tuesday agreed to a preliminary proposal put forward by the Trump administration that called for a 30-day ceasefire contingent on Russia's acceptance of the terms in a major step toward ending the brutal war.\n\nBut even if the Trump administration is able to get Moscow to the negotiating table and end the three-year war under a new treaty, which several security experts say Russian President Vladimir Putin is under no real pressure to do, can the Kremlin chief be trusted?\n\nRussia under Putin has repeatedly violated formal international agreements intended to protect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, chiefly from its former Soviet overlord.\n\nUKRAINE ACCEPTS DEAL, SAYS RUBIO: 'WE'LL TAKE THIS TO THE RUSSIANS'\n\nThese agreements include the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear arsenal in exchange for assurances over its territorial integrity after its 1991 withdrawal from the Soviet Union, as well as the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership by which Moscow and Kyiv agreed to respect one another\u2019s existing borders. Both deals were first violated in 2014 when Putin seized Crimea and backed Russian separatist forces in the Donbas region.\n\nThe 2014-2015 Minsk Agreements, though criticized as \"weak,\" attempted to end Russia\u2019s aggression in eastern Ukraine, an agreement that was never fully achieved and was again violated by Putin's 2022 invasion.\n\nSome world leaders and security officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have cautioned that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely to be achieved in the near term and against Putin\u2019s reliability in adhering to any international agreement without serious security commitments from the West.\n\n\"The problem here is that the Russians only understand win-lose outcomes, which means that to prevent them from ever attacking Ukraine again, they must see themselves to be the losers in the war just as they did at the end of the Cold War,\" Michael Ryan, former deputy assistant secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy and former acting assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, told Fox News Digital.\n\nSecurity officials interviewed by Fox News Digital argued that securing Ukraine\u2019s future is not about \"trusting\" Putin. It\u2019s about actually putting Russia in a position where any future violations would hinder Moscow more than it could be enticed by unchecked opportunity.\n\nTRUMP THREATENS SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, DEMANDS PEACE AFTER MAJOR HITS IN UKRAINE\n\n\"Even if a deal is concluded, Russia will continue clandestine operations across the world to expand its footprint in terms of geopolitical influence,\" Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital, noting the former KGB operative can be counted on to \"continue election interference campaigns, cyber warfare, espionage and destabilization operations across the globe.\n\n\"There\u2019s no such thing as peace in Russia\u2019s strategic military thinking. You are in a constant confrontation.\"\n\nRyan argued a Trump-brokered peace deal needs to reflect on the lessons learned from previously failed agreements, like the post-WWI Treaty of Versailles, which arguably led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.\n\n\"How to solve this conundrum? Just as we did after World War II \u2026 reconstruction of Ukraine must include economic reconciliation with Russia,\" Ryan said. \"The Russians saw how we rebuilt the losing side in World War II Germany and Japan. They expected us to do the same for Russia after the Cold War, but we did not.\n\n\"We can't make that same mistake if we want lasting peace for Ukraine and if we want to split Russia from China,\" he added, noting other adversaries are watching how the West handles this geopolitical hurdle.\n\nThere are numerous obstacles when it comes to the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to negotiate with Putin, including arguments over occupied territory, international recognition of occupied lands, international aid and support for Ukraine, international confiscation of frozen Russian assets, Zelenskyy\u2019s standing at home, the return of prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children, according to Peter Rough, senior fellow and director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the Hudson Institute.\n\n\"Putin has officially annexed four Ukrainian oblasts as well as Crimea. But Moscow has yet to conquer any of the four entirely,\" Rough told Fox News Digital while traveling to Ukraine. \"I can\u2019t imagine that Ukraine will withdraw from the areas they control, having fought tooth and nail to defend those regions.\n\n\"I also doubt that the West will offer de jure recognition to the areas Moscow controls,\" he added. \"So, Putin would have to swallow all of that in a peace deal.\"\n\nEach issue alone is a massive undertaking to negotiate, and while Ukraine this week may be outlining concessions it could make to secure a deal coordinated by the U.S., Putin is unlikely to do the same, according to Koffler, who briefed NATO years ahead of the 2022 invasion on Putin\u2019s plans.\n\nRUBIO SAYS MINERAL DEAL \u2018NOT MAIN TOPIC ON AGENDA\u2019 IN UKRAINE MEETING\n\n\"Putin is unlikely to make any concessions as he believes he is in a strong position,\" Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"The disparity in combat potential dramatically favors Russia over Ukraine, which is out-manned and outgunned because Putin transitioned the Russian military and economy on a wartime footing seven years prior to the invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Putin believes he has prepared Russia to fight till the last Ukrainian and till the last missile in NATO\u2019s arsenal,\" she added, echoing a January warning issued by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who said Russia\u2019s defense industry output over a three-month period equates to what all of NATO produces an entire year.\n\n\"Putin is highly unlikely to agree to a ceasefire because he doesn\u2019t want to give a strategic pause to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO to re-arm,\" Koffler said. \"He doesn\u2019t trust Washington. He doesn\u2019t trust President Trump any more than we trust Putin.\n\n\"He trusts Trump even less than Biden because he could read Biden and predict his behavior. He cannot read Trump because Trump is unpredictable.\"\n\nThe experts argued there are too many variables that could play out during negotiations that will determine whether Putin can be adequately held accountable or \"trusted\" regarding future agreements.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUltimately, Koffler said, Putin will not leave eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine has always been a red line for Putin, in terms of who has geopolitical control of it, Russia or the West. And he will continue to enforce this red line,\" she said. \"The only way to ensure that Putin doesn\u2019t invade another country is to make NATO strong again, beef up force posture, increase defense spending, secure its command-and-control networks and develop actual deterrence and counter-strategy that addresses every prong of Putin\u2019s strategy.\""

He also criticized Trump for cutting off military aid to Ukraine after that Oval Office slugfest which Volodymyr Zelenskyy botched, trying to talk over Trump as he was scolded, and ended up being evicted from the White House.\n\nWe all know that Musk is a business genius and an impulsive guy. He often delivers punches on the X platform he has transformed, with a post-first-ask-questions-later approach.\n\nHe clearly relishes political combat. Musk has engaged in bitter exchanges with Marco Rubio (though they\u2019re playing nice now) and with Steve Bannon. But Elon has become a lightning rod, especially since his DOGE team has made a series of high-profile mistakes, firing and rehiring crucial experts.\n\nTrump decided to stand by his man, and posted this:\n\n\"To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is \u2018putting it on the line\u2019 in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!

That\u2019s the big one to eliminate.\"\n\nPerhaps Musk should concentrate on the plunging stock market, caused primarily by uncertainty over Trump\u2019s tariff wars but also by worries about the impact of DOGE\u2019s mass firings.\n\nPeople pay into Social Security over a lifetime with the expectation it will be there when they retire. It\u2019s the main source of income for many elderly people. Of course the program eventually has to be rescued from insolvency, but talking about \"the big one to eliminate\" \u2013 including Medicare \u2013 seems rather callous.\n\nAnd in case you think the market is only for elite investors, if you have a 401-K, the calamity on Wall Street affects you, and your retirement fund just lost a helluva lot of value.\n\nEXPERT CALLS OUT MEDIA FOR NEGATIVE COVERAGE OF TRUMP'S ADDRESS: 'THAT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A JERK, NOT TRUMP'\n\nThe market dropped again yesterday when Trump, responding to retaliation by Ontario taxing electricity to the U.S., raised the tariff on all Canadian steel and aluminum exports from 25 percent to 50 percent. The Ontario premier reacted by dropping the electricity threat.\n\nTesla stock has tanked since its mid-December high, with a 16 percent decline Monday, causing Musk\u2019s net worth to plunge by $140 billion. But don\u2019t worry\u2013he\u2019s still the richest guy on the planet.\n\nHe\u2019s also become a highly visible target.

            "full_content": "James Carville\u2019s political instincts remain sharp, though he is not as in tune with the current political moment as he was 33 years ago. Still, you could do worse as a political maxim than \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe economy has long been a top issue, though far from the only issue, for Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s business acumen, entrenched in the voters\u2019 minds through a decades-long public relations blitz culminating in a star reality TV turn, was a major reason the electorate was willing to entrust the presidency to a political neophyte.\n\nIf the economy of Trump\u2019s first term, with low unemployment, low inflation, and solid GDP growth, had continued through election day, in retrospect it is clear that he would have been reelected. Not by a landslide, but probably by a margin similar to what he achieved last November. Alas, the pandemic\u2014and Anthony Fauci\u2014intervened and aborted the Trump boom.\n\nBut as the Joe Biden interregnum wore on, voters developed a nostalgia for the economy of circa 2019. Inflation began spiking, soon reaching 9.1 percent, a 41-year high. The economy still grew most quarters and unemployment remained low by historical standards, even if the jobs market was often less rosy than it initially appeared as the numbers were revised downward. But the high cost of living eroded whatever advantages accrued from other, more positive economic metrics.\n\nAt least some voters came to understand that the economic downturn of 2020 was caused mainly by the lockdowns, of which Trump was at best a reluctant adopter. They wanted their pre-pandemic economy back. Polls consistently showed Trump was trusted to do a better job handling the economy than Biden or Kamala Harris.\n\nThat sentiment prevailed on election day, according to the exit polls, with Trump winning 81 percent of voters who listed the economy as their top issue, 70 percent among those who rated the economy as poor or not so good, and 88 percent of voters who said it was just poor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has always had other issues besides the economy, such as immigration, anti-wokeness, and general resistance to the left on the culture war. On those, he still retains an upper hand. But for the first time since the height of the pandemic, people are feeling anxious about a Trump-led economy. The stock market and other indexes of economic confidence are down.\n\nThe tariffs are less targeted than during the first term, and their status is changing frequently. This time the tariffs, rather than tax cuts (which Congress still needs to extend) or deregulation, is dominating the coverage of the Trump agenda. And Elon Musk actually wants to cut spending.\n\nWhile Trump wants to be associated with general prosperity, a \u201cgolden age\u201d even, his ambitions were always greater than restoring the economy of 2019. He wants to reindustrialize vast swathes of the country and reshore American jobs. Many, perhaps most, economists believe that Trump has bitten off more than he can chew.\n\nThat was said of Ronald Reagan, too. Passing a big tax cut in a period of inflation worse than under Biden was viewed as pouring gasoline on an already roaring fire. Most economists believed there was an inherent tradeoff between cutting inflation and unemployment, which Reagan rejected. And there was an attempt to cut federal spending and personnel, beginning with the firing of striking air traffic controllers.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve tightened the money supply to put the screws to inflation, largely with Reagan\u2019s support despite the chairman having been appointed by Jimmy Carter, the economy did initially get worse. There was a recession in 1982, during which unemployment reached 10.8 percent, the highest since the Great Depression. Republicans lost seats in the midterm elections that year.\n\nBut after that, the economy began to recover and then boom. Inflation and unemployment both fell. By 1984, the annual growth rate was the highest in 34 years. Between 1983 and 1989, the U.S. added the equivalent of Japan\u2019s whole economy to its GDP. Reagan was reelected in a 49-state landslide. He was fewer than one vote per precinct in Minnesota, his Democratic challenger\u2019s home state, away from sweeping all 50.\n\nThe Reagan economic legacy, and especially its relevance to public policy in subsequent times, remains hotly debated today. But the bottom line is that a lot of dire predictions either failed to come to fruition or were short-lived and stagflation ended.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, that is not the only possible historical analogy. There is a more recent one. Biden was warned that continuing to increase federal spending, especially as the pandemic was ending and people were already returning to work, would pour gasoline on a then just smoldering inflationary fire. That is exactly what happened, and the problem was far from \u201ctransitory.\u201d His presidency was basically ruined in its first months, and Trump was later returned to office.\n\nOf course, it is possible that none of the historical analogies favored by those of us who write about politics for a living will describe what happens under Trump. But he surely prefers the story of the man whose picture he hung in the Oval Office to that of the man he ousted from the premises.\n\nThat\u2019s the story Carville would rather tell about his candidate, anyway."

            "full_content": "A House hearing ended abruptly Tuesday after an exchange between a Republican and a Democratic committee member over the GOP chair\u2019s misgendering Rep. Sarah McBride.\n\nAt the hearing hosted by the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, recognized McBride, D-Del., to speak and misgendered her in the process. McBride is the first openly trans member of Congress.\n\n\u201cI now recognize the representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride.\u201d\n\nWithout missing a beat, McBride responded by thanking Self and referring to him as \u201cmadam chair.\u201d\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe subcommittee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, then interjected and asked Self to repeat his remarks. After Self doubled down and called McBride \u201cmister,\u201d he said, \u201cWe have set the standard on the House floor.\u201d\n\nKeating turned to Self and said those remarks were \u201cnot decent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, you are out of order,\u201d Keating said. \u201cMr. Chairman, have you no decency? I mean, I have come to know you a little bit, but this is not decent.\u201d\n\nSelf tried to continue the hearing, but Keating stopped him, saying, \u201cYou will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way.\u201d\n\nIn response, Self struck down his gavel and declared the hearing adjourned. As people shuffled out of the room, Keating patted McBride on the shoulder.\n\nThe hearing was billed as a discussion of the State Department and policies on arms control, international security and U.S. assistance to Europe.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed that the Chair decided to end a committee hearing early,\" McBride said in a statement Tuesday night. \"I was prepared to move forward with my questions for the Subcommittee on nuclear nonproliferation and US support for Democratic allies in Europe.\"\n\nWhen reached by NBC News, a spokesperson for Keating said the congressman \"doesn't think there is a need for additional comment as the video speaks for itself.\"\n\nSelf's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRep. Keith Self, R-Texas; Rep. Bill Keating, D-Mass.; Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. Getty Images\n\nSelf responded to a clip of the confrontation on X, writing, \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump used that language in a Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the federal government will only recognize two, unchangeable sexes.\n\nRep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., on Feb. 6 referred to McBride as \u201cthe gentleman from Delaware\u201d during remarks on the House floor. Miller criticized the Congressional Record for initially revising her words to say \u201cMs. McBride,\u201d in a post on X.\n\nThe Congressional Record from that day now refers to McBride as said by Miller: \u201cThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. MILLER of Illinois). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. MCBRIDE, for 5 minutes.\u201d\n\nIn November, McBride made history by becoming the first out transgender person elected to Congress.\n\nBefore she was sworn in, McBride quickly became a target for some Republican lawmakers. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced a resolution weeks after McBride was elected banning transgender women from using female bathrooms in the Capitol.\n\nThe next day, Mace said her resolution was \u201cabsolutely\u201d aimed at McBride.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., informally enacted the bathroom policy in November and renewed it at the start of this year as one of the policies for the 119th Congress.\n\nMcBride told NBC News in January that she was not taking the \u201cbait\u201d over the bathroom policy, adding that it was meant to \u201cdiminish my capacity to be an effective member of Congress\u201d and that people who secured historic \u201cfirsts\u201d like her must \u201cpick their battles.\u201d"

Graham Hughes / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIt's also leading to canceled shipment orders and stalled liquor agreements with potential trading partners, some Kentucky bourbon businesses say.\n\nThe family-owned Michter\u2019s Distillery in Louisville has already lost $115,000 in canceled bourbon shipment orders to Canada, its largest foreign market as liquor stores in most Canadian provinces have been asked to remove products from their shelves.\n\nAndrea Wilson, chief operating officer at Michter\u2019s Distillery in Louisville, Ky. Kailani Koenig / NBC News\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reality of it,\u201d said Andrea Wilson, chief operating officer of Michter\u2019s. \u201cWe would prefer to see less tariffs than more.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico \u2014 two of the country\u2019s largest trade partners \u2014 before postponing it amid trepidation of a broader trade war.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump amplified his tough tariff talk, saying he would double the tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum imported from Canada.\n\nThe threat came one day after Ontario\u2019s premier, the leader of Canada\u2019s most populous province, announced it would charge 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million Americans.\n\nKentucky\u2019s bourbon industry pours about $9 billion into the local economy annually, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association.\n\nMichter\u2019s bourbon barrels. Kailani Koenig / NBC News\n\nThe state produces about 95% of the bourbon sold in the world, the association estimates.\n\nWhile data on the tariffs\u2019 effects is unavailable, U.S. consumers likely won't see a price increase on bourbon for at least a few months, said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR.\n\nBut Kentucky distilleries could feel an immediate pinch if some of their shipments to Canada are being cancelled, he said.\n\nWilson said she fears her business could face further losses if the tariff war continues.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not selling to our largest export market, that\u2019s a significant impact to our business, and it\u2019s very sad for us, because we have friends, we\u2019ve built relationships in that country for a long time,\u201d she said.\n\nBlack-owned Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville is having its own set of problems caused by the tariff war.\n\nVictor Yarbrough, CEO of Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville. Kailani Koenig / NBC News\n\nThe company was in the midst of negotiating to sell its products in Canada for the first time, but discussions abruptly ended when the trade war started.\n\nThe deal fell through \u201cas soon as the tariffs were announced,\u201d CEO Victor Yarbrough said.\n\n\u201cLiterally, we\u2019re in the middle of expansion. Everything\u2019s been suspended, they don\u2019t have the ability to purchase,\u201d Yarbrough said, adding his plans for 2025 were to also ship alcohol to France and the United Kingdom.\n\nNow he\u2019s considering sending his products to South Africa or Brazil, but Canada would have been the bigger market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just like, how can we help get back to square one? How can we facilitate good, neighborly, you know, relationships that we\u2019ve been having?\u201d he asked.\n\nFawn Weaver, founder of Black-owned Tennessee whiskey brand Uncle Nearest, had her alcohol products pulled off the shelves in Canada, but said she was already bracing for the fallout.\n\nWeaver, who contends a tariff war could be predicted during the presidential campaign, said the tariffs mean her business can\u2019t be as aggressive in the global market for now.\n\n\u201cAs an independent brand, I can\u2019t afford those tariffs. I can\u2019t afford to absorb it, and I can\u2019t pass it on to the consumers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be argued that this is exactly what the current administration wants \u2014 for all of us to bring in our business in the U.S.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe already knew coming into this, Trump was very clear in what he was going to do, even though we didn\u2019t know where the tariffs would hit.\u201d\n\nKailani Koenig and Maggie Vespa reported from Louisville, Deon J. Hampton from Denver and Bracey Harris from Mississippi."

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, we dive into the next steps on Capitol Hill after the House passed a short-term funding bill with a government funding deadline fast approaching. Plus, Steve Kornacki looks into voter trends that are shaping Wisconsin\u2019s upcoming Supreme Court election, the first major battleground state race of 2025.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f We want to hear from you!\n\nHave a question for the NBC News Politics Desk on the flurry of Trump administration moves, Elon Musk and DOGE\u2019s activity, or what comes next on Capitol Hill?\n\nSend your questions to politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com and we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter.\n\nThe pressure is on Senate Democrats after the House passes a funding bill to avert a shutdown\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson passed another major test today in the narrowly divided House, muscling through a stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown.\n\nIt puts Senate Democrats in a politically precarious position, with government money sent to run dry Friday night.\n\nThe six-month funding bill passed 217-213, Scott Wong, Kyle Stewart, Sahil Kapur and Rebecca Kaplan report from Capitol Hill. Just one House Republican, the conservative Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, voted against it. And just one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, who represents a district President Donald Trump carried in Maine, voted for it.\n\nThe outcome is a victory for GOP leaders and the White House, who do not want to see a shutdown in the first two months of the new administration and are eager to move on to advancing Trump\u2019s agenda on the border, taxes and other policy areas.\n\nOver the past several days, Trump and his top aides called undecided Republicans to urge them to back the funding bill, multiple sources familiar with the calls told NBC News. And ahead of the vote Tuesday morning, Vice President JD Vance huddled with House Republicans at the Capitol to rally support.\n\nRep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., one of the Republicans who were on the fence, voted for the bill after she said she visited the White House earlier in the day.\n\nBut the drama is far from over. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has made clear he\u2019s firmly against the funding bill. That means at least eight Democratic senators would have to support it to cross the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold and send it to Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders were staunchly against the bill. They blasted Republicans for drafting the bill on a partisan basis and argued they gave the Trump administration too much discretion in how to spend certain pots of money.\n\nSenate Democratic leaders, however, have stayed mum. After an unusually long Senate Democratic lunch meeting on Tuesday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to state his position on the bill, a sign that his members lack consensus on the path forward.\n\nPublicly, many Senate Democrats said they wanted to see how the House voted first before weighing in. But Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said he would vote for the bill.\n\n\u201cI refuse to burn the village down and to claim to save it,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t agree with many facets of that CR, but when the choice is about shutting the government down, I don\u2019t want to be involved with that.\u201d\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nMassie fallout: Trump\u2019s patience appears to be running thin with Massie, who also voted against the House GOP\u2019s budget resolution last month. Trump said on Truth Social he would \u201clead the charge\u201d to find a primary opponent to challenge him next year.\n\nBut as Melanie Zanona reports, that didn\u2019t sit well with Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas. During a closed-door House GOP caucus Tuesday morning, Roy said he didn\u2019t appreciate Trump\u2019s threat, according to two sources in the room. Roy also called on Republican leadership to stand up for Massie, which Johnson later did at a news conference.

Prominent Republican donors and activists are squarely behind conservative Brad Schimel, while Democrats are with liberal Susan Crawford.\n\nTurnout will be far lower than in November, and the electorate figures to be skewed toward voters who are more politically engaged and partisan, making this an imperfect test. But the outcome will at least offer clues about how the political winds might be shifting in what is arguably America\u2019s premier swing state.\n\nThere are a few key patterns and trends that enabled President Donald Trump to flip the state in November that will be under the microscope next month.\n\nWhere Republicans made gains\n\nEight of the 10 counties where Trump improved his performance the most from the 2020 elections are in the southwestern part of the state, in what is called the \u201cDriftless Area\u201d (a nod to the unique topography that resulted from the lack of glacial coverage more than 10,000 years ago).\n\nPolitically, it represents a significant growth opportunity for the GOP, having remained loyal to Democrats until more recently than other small towns and rural parts of the state. It was Trump\u2019s emergence in 2016 that triggered the area\u2019s movement toward the GOP.\n\nDoes this represent a partisan realignment that is ongoing and that will allow Republicans to build an even bigger advantage here going forward? Or is it more tentative and Trump-specific, offering Democrats a chance to stabilize and improve their performance without Trump on the ballot? Notably, the area did return to its Democratic roots in recent state Supreme Court races.\n\nWhere Democrats are in growth mode\n\nThe \u201cWOW\u201d counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha outside of Milwaukee have historically been the biggest vote bank in the state for Republican candidates, and all favored Trump by double digits last year. But the GOP\u2019s advantage has been receding.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s declines here match the national trend of the last generation or so of highly educated, professional-class, white suburbanites shedding their previous Republican allegiance \u2014 which accelerated drastically with Trump\u2019s emergence.\n\nEven while losing ground statewide, Democrats modestly improved their performance in the WOW counties last November. In Ozaukee and Waukesha, Harris won a higher share of the vote than any Democratic presidential nominee there since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.\n\nThat the Democratic gains have been particularly stark in Ozaukee is no surprise. Outside of Dane County (home of the University of Wisconsin-Madison), it has the highest concentration of white, college-educated voters in the state.\n\nLast November, Democrats were banking on even bigger gains in the WOW counties, which could have pushed Harris over the top statewide. Still, Democrats see an opportunity to make further strides here and to cement them, with Republicans hoping to arrest their slide without Trump at the top of their ticket.\n\nRead more from Steve \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s other top stories \ud83d\udcc9 Taking stock: Trump has previously pointed to the stock market as a key indicator of his administration\u2019s economic success.

Laurel Libby has been an outspoken critic of Maine\u2019s state policy allowing transgender girls to compete in girls\u2019 sports.\n\nLibby recently posted on social media to draw attention to the Maine high school girls\u2019 indoor track and field state championship, where a student who competed as a boy last year but now identifies as transgender took first place in girls\u2019 pole vault. That first-place finish propelled the student\u2019s team to win the championship by a single point.\n\nLibby\u2019s post included the student\u2019s name and photographs. While Libby was criticized for naming the student, her lawsuit notes, \u201cThe Championship was a public event, was streamed online, and the names, schools and photographs of the winners were posted publicly.\u201d\n\nThe post received national attention and prompted a heated exchange between Democratic Maine Gov. Jill Mills and President Donald Trump over transgender athletes. Mills told the president \u201cSee you in court\u201d after he said he would deny federal funding to the state if it refused to comply with his executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThree federal agencies have also launched investigations into the Maine Department of Education and its compliance with Title IX.\n\n\u201cI had no idea my post would go viral like it did, but it did because it so inherently unfair to see a young man on a podium that a Maine girl deserved to be standing on,\u201d Libby told CNN in an interview.\n\nAfter Libby\u2019s post, the Democratic-controlled Maine House voted along party lines 75-70 to censure Libby, declaring her post \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cincompatible with her duty and responsibilities as a member of the House.\u201d\n\nThe censure required her to apologize, but she refused, so the House prohibited her from speaking or voting on the House floor for the rest of her term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious my censure is retaliation because they do not want to have a debate about the real issue, which is biological males participating in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d Libby said.\n\nLibby, who represents 9,000 constituents, alleges that the censure violates her First Amendment rights as well as the Equal Protection, Due Process, and Guarantee Clauses of the US Constitution. She is asking the court for injunctive relief that would allow her to continue her duties.\n\nA spokeswoman for Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nJudges recuse from case\n\nOn Wednesday, every federal judge in Maine recused themselves from the lawsuit.\n\nThe Chief Judge of Maine said in a court filing that these recusals constitute an \u201cemergency\u201d under federal law and the case will now be moved to Rhode Island. The judges did not provide a reasons for their recusals from the case.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nOne of the trends that Donald Trump and his supporters wanted to reverse with his big speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 was a steady erosion of his job-approval ratings in the polls from the mildly positive \u201choneymoon\u201d levels he registered just after returning to the White House.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. And there\u2019s increasing evidence concerns about the economy and reaction to Elon Musk\u2019s assault on federal services and employees are beginning to take a toll on the new administration\u2019s base of support. On Thursday, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, having lost more than 10 percent of its value in three weeks.\n\nSilver Bulletin\u2019s comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of the polls show Trump\u2019s approval-rating averages now clearly underwater at 47.3 percent positive and 49.0 percent negative. RealClearPolitics, which produces simple arithmetical averages from a database that includes several dubious pro-Trump pollsters, shows his net job-approval averages dropping from 1.2 percent on March 4 to minus-0.7 percent on March 13.\n\nBeyond the overall numbers, the most recent polls show that worries about the economy continue to hound the 47th president. Here\u2019s how Emerson College explained the trends:\n\nAs President Trump reaches his first 50 days in office, his approval rating has declined from 49%-41% to 47%-45%, reflecting a nation deeply divided \u2026 Voters are most supportive of Trump\u2019s immigration policy, but they disapprove of his handling of the economy, believe tariffs will hurt economic growth, and are skeptical of his cryptocurrency policy.\n\nA number of polls before the speech suggested that even Trump supporters thought he was inadequately focused on inflation and prices, which could mean deeper trouble for him if his current wave of tariffs and trade-war threats produce higher retail prices, as most economists expect. The most recent plunge in stock prices may produce additional jitters as predictions of a possible recession return to news reports.\n\nA March 13 Quinnipiac survey shows that concerns over the economy are actually more intense than they were at the end of the Biden administration. The percentage of voters describing the economy as either \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d has increased from 64 percent in December to 76 percent now.\n\nWhere is Trump losing ground among the electorate? Polls differ, but the latest, the above-mentioned Emerson poll, showed Latinos disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance by a 51.6 to 35.2 percent margin. Another post-speech poll from TIPP Insights shows self-identified moderates disapproving of the job Trump\u2019s doing by a 54 to 33 percent margin. It appears that the less MAGA-oriented elements of the electorate where Trump made important gains last November may be proving soft spots in his coalition, which isn\u2019t surprising since he\u2019s now responsible for a status quo with which a lot of Americans are chronically unhappy. The chaos in his administration probably isn\u2019t helping. As Axios reports, the occasional pollsters who ask about Elon Musk and DOGE are sensing some negative vibes:\n\nIn a Feb. 13-18 Washington Post-Ipsos poll, a net 34% of respondents said they approved of how Musk was handling his job, compared to 49% disapproving and 14% not sure.\n\nThe poll displayed a stark divide based on party ID, with just 6% of Democrats approving of how Musk has handled his job compared to 70% of Republicans. But when asked if they approved of Musk shutting down federal government programs he deemed unnecessary, a smaller slice of Republicans (56%) gave their blessing, while 25% said they weren\u2019t sure and 18% disapproved \u2026\n\nOver half of respondents (55%) in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted Feb. 13 to 17 said Musk has too much power in making decisions affecting the U.S., while 36% think he has about the right amount of power.\n\nA Pew survey of U.S. adults taken Jan. 27 to Feb. 2 showed that Americans had more negative (54%) than positive (42%) views of Musk (DOGE\u2019s dissection of the federal government has dramatically escalated since the poll was conducted).\n\nThe more recent Quinnipiac poll shows self-identified independents disapproving of Musk and DOGE by a 68 to 28 percent margin.\n\nIf alarm over arbitrary federal budget cuts and employee layoffs coincides with troublesome economic news, Trump may soon find himself back in the more decisively negative public-opinion territory he has inhabited for much of his political career."

            "full_content": "Washington \u2014 A pair of federal judges warned Tuesday of continued threats against members of the judiciary amid criticism leveled by Elon Musk and threats of impeachment by Republicans in Congress. They warned such attacks strike at judicial independence.\n\nJudges Jeffrey Sutton and Richard Sullivan, who sit on the federal appeals courts, raised concerns about the increase in threats against judges in a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal judiciary.\n\nSullivan, who chairs the committee on judicial security, said the protection of judges and federal courthouses around the country is a top priority for the judiciary and recent cuts to the U.S. Marshals Service's budget is a concern. The agency provides security for federal courts and judges.\n\n\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" he said. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"\n\nSutton, meanwhile, said that while the types of threats against judges have evolved over time, they arise directly from the fact that they're doing their jobs.\n\n\"We're supposed to say what the law means, and there's 1,000 federal judges out there, we each take that responsibility seriously,\" he said, adding that judges take an oath to interpret the law neutrally and dispassionately. \"It's a shame to see people attacking judges simply for doing their level best to do their job.\"\n\nSutton and Sullivan both noted that the justice system allows the losing party to appeal an adverse decision from the trial court to an appeals court and then the Supreme Court.\n\n\"We allocate disappointment to half the people that come before us,\" Sutton said. \"Criticism is no surprise. It's part of the job. But I do think when it gets to the level of a threat, it really is about attacking judicial independence, and that's just not good for the system or the country.\"\n\nSutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.\n\nThe concerns from the two GOP-appointed judges come as Musk and allies of Mr. Trump have attacked judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration. Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"\n\nIn a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"\n\nRepublicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.\n\nThe impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.\n\n\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" Sutton said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"\n\nSullivan said that amid the evolving threat landscape, and as there are more threats to judges, public officials must be responsible in their comments about the system of justice.\n\n\"The reality is that there are a lot of folks who will respond and react perhaps inappropriately based on something they heard or read, and so, I just think it's important for everyone to be responsible in what they say about our process,\" he said.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts separately spoke of the importance of preserving judicial independence in his year-end report closing out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting judges from threats, the federal judiciary's Vulnerability Management Program provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members last year, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report, released Tuesday.\n\nThe program was established after Congress passed legislation responding to the 2020 killing of the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. The gunman found the judge's address, pictures of her house and vehicle information online.\n\nThe measure, signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022, aims to make it more difficult to find judges' personal information on the internet."

            "full_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nUS Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has begun the process of eliminating a US Food and Drug Administration program called GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe,\u201d that critics say has been abused by the food industry for decades.\n\nNearly 99% of new chemicals used in food or food packaging since 2000 were green-lit for use not by the FDA but by the food and chemical industry, according to a 2022 analysis.\n\nDuring that period, food manufacturers asked the FDA\u2019s permission to introduce a new substance only 10 times, according to the analysis conducted by the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an environmental and health advocacy organization based in Washington.\n\n\u201cFor far too long, ingredient manufacturers and sponsors have exploited a loophole that has allowed new ingredients and chemicals, often with unknown safety data, to be introduced into the U.S. food supply without notification to the FDA or the public,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cEliminating this loophole will provide transparency to consumers,\u201d he said, and \u201chelp get our nation\u2019s food supply back on track by ensuring that ingredients being introduced into foods are safe.\u201d\n\nMany challenges ahead\n\nExperts applauded the move, calling it long overdue, but questioned how realistic any change will be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for dealing with the GRAS loophole. It\u2019s way past time for the FDA to close it,\u201d said Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard Professor Emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, in an email.\n\n\u201cFood companies should not decide for themselves whether their additives are safe,\u201d said Nestle, who has written books on the politics of the food industry.\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that this administration will give the FDA the resources it needs \u2014 and this means well-paid experts in food toxicology \u2014 to take on additive assessments, especially while agency personnel are being fired right and left,\u201d she added.\n\nFormer FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf, who resigned from his position on January 20, added that any reform would have to make it past the powerful food industry lobby, which has traditionally fought change.\n\n\u201cIf it were to happen, it would be a real reversal of years of lobbying and politicians who mostly were blocking the efforts to make this happen,\u201d Califf said. \u201cThe industry has resisted it; the Republican Congress has blocked it. Now, if they\u2019re in favor, let\u2019s take advantage of it and get this done. I\u2019d be all for it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kennedy announced that he had met with the chief executive officers of Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Tyson Foods, Kellogg\u2019s, Smuckers and Pepsi to discuss a solution.\n\n\u201cYou should be able to exercise informed choice. You should know what that product is, what\u2019s in your food and what the health impacts are, and that\u2019s all we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview aired Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to incentivize people, to incentivize companies to be transparent, and we\u2019re going to inform Americans about what\u2019s making them sick,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cNobody wants to be sick.\u201d\n\nMelissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, which represents the food industry, told CNN in an email that the meeting was \u201cconstructive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continued engagement with the secretary and the qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\u201d Hockstad said.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., center left, posted a photo on social media of himself with, from left, Kraft Heinz Co. CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Consumer Brands Association CEO Melissa Hockstad, PepsiCo North America CEO Steven Williams, General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening, Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King, Kelloggs, US CEO Gary Pilnick and Smuckers CEO Mark Smucker. From Secretary Kennedy\n\nWhat is the problem with GRAS?\n\nCreated by a 1958 amendment to the 1938 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, GRAS was intended to be narrowly applied to safe, commonly used ingredients such as garlic, oil, vinegar and baking soda. In 1997, however, an overwhelmed and underfunded FDA made the program voluntary, allowing industry to say a substance was GRAS without first providing safety data to the agency.\n\nSince then, critics say, food manufacturers have introduced numerous untested additives into the food supply, many of which have later been identified as harmful.\n\nOne of these, brominated vegetable oil or BVO \u2014 a vegetable oil used in citrus sodas and sports drinks \u2014 was declared no longer GRAS in 1970. But the FDA did not officially ban the additive from use in the US food supply until July 2024.\n\n\u201cThe FDA knew for decades that brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, would be harmful, but it was allowed to remain in use at the request of food manufacturers,\u201d Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias said at a September news briefing. Giannoulias was a coauthor of the Illinois Food Safety Act, which passed the Illinois Senate and is currently before the House of Representatives.\n\nTired of waiting for the FDA, other states have also acted. In October 2023, California banned four substances \u2014 BVO, potassium bromate, propylparaben and red dye No. 3 \u2014 due to links with serious health concerns as cancer, endocrine and reproductive issues, and heart and liver problems.\n\nThe FDA banned red dye No. 3 in January, more than 30 years after scientists discovered links to cancer in animals. A synthetic color additive made from petroleum and chemically known as erythrosine, red dye No. 3 was used to give foods, candy and beverages a bright cherry-red color.\n\nAdditional chemicals being targeted by legislative bills in 31 states include red dye No. 40; blue dye No. 1 and No. 2; green dye No. 3; yellow dye No. 5 and No. 6; titanium dioxide; and azodicarbonamide, a dough conditioner that is also used in yoga mats, according to the Environmental Working Group.\n\nHurdles to overcome\n\nEliminating the GRAS loophole would require companies to \u201cpublicly notify the FDA of their intended use of [new] ingredients, along with underlying safety data, before they are introduced in the food supply,\u201d HHS said in the statement.\n\nHowever, representatives for food companies say the GRAS process plays an important role in enabling companies to \u201cinnovate to meet consumer demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the administration looks to revise GRAS, we stand ready to work with agency experts on continued analysis of safe ingredients and increase consumer transparency,\u201d said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy and federal affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, in an email.\n\nEliminating GRAS isn\u2019t as simple as removing the regulations, said Jensen Jose, regulatory officer for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit food safety organization.\n\n\u201cThere are many secret GRAS chemicals that are already in our food supply,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cMaking these chemicals immediately illegal until obtaining FDA approval may cause disruptions in the food supply. Ensuring that existing GRAS chemicals are safe to remain in our foods should be a systematic process.\u201d\n\nIn addition, not everything GRAS should be eliminated during reform, said Jennifer Pomeranz, an associate professor of public health policy and management at New York University\u2019s School of Global and Public Health in New York City.\n\n\u201cThey should grandfather ingredients that were GRAS in 1958 when Congress created the food amendment, like garlic, salt and pepper, that we have eaten for decades without harm,\u201d she said. \u201cPast that, have everything go through a food additive petition to assure its safety.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that while changing the GRAS process, the food industry could pass along the cost to consumers in the form of higher prices, Califf said.\n\n\u201cTo do this research costs money. That\u2019s a lot different than just declaring our stuff is safe, versus actually doing the work rigorously and having an independent government evaluation,\u201d he said.\n\nTeasing out the health impact of food additives over long periods of time is also difficult and time-consuming, Califf said: \u201cThese are not issues of people developing cancer in one week. It\u2019s increased risk of cancer 20 years later.\n\n\u201cIt takes large-scale epidemiology, a lot of expertise and teams of people, including people who know about the chemistry and biology and the epidemiology and human disease, and it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me that beefing up the FDA budget, this would be a good deal for the American people.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US Education Department announced Tuesday that it is cutting nearly 50% of its workforce, as President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating the agency altogether.\n\nHundreds will be laid off starting Tuesday evening, in addition to those who took voluntary \u201cbuyouts.\u201d Those actions will cut the department\u2019s workforce of about 4,100 at the start of the Trump administration in half.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s reduction in force reflects the Department of Education\u2019s commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. \u201cI appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department.\n\nMcMahon said later Tuesday that the reductions are the first course of action in shutting down the agency, which Trump has vowed to do, although she acknowledged that fully eliminating the department would require Congress to act. CNN reported last week that White House officials have prepared an executive order directing McMahon to begin the process of dismantling the department.\n\nAsked on Fox News whether the layoffs were \u201cthe first step to a total shutdown,\u201d McMahon said, \u201cYes, actually it is, because that was the president\u2019s mandate as directed to me clearly is to shut down the Department of Education.\u201d She went on to describe the layoffs as \u201celiminating what I think is bureaucratic bloat.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 1,300 employees notified of their layoff will be terminated in 90 days, according to senior agency officials. Those fired will begin teleworking starting Wednesday and go on paid administrative leave starting March 21, the officials said, adding that the employees will receive severance pay based on the length of their service.\n\nThe cuts are in addition to the 63 probationary employees who were fired as part of a White House directive last month, the officials added. More than 300 employees also took voluntary separation incentives worth up to $25,000 while about 260 accepted a deferred resignation package.\n\nTuesday\u2019s cuts follow similar layoffs at other federal agencies as part of Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s continued efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.\n\n\u2018Significant changes to the way that we work\u2019\n\nThe senior officials told reporters that the cuts will not impact federal student aid \u201cin any way, shape or form,\u201d as experts raise alarm about whether the agency can carry out its usual duties with such a massive reduction.\n\nThe officials added that an earlier memo sent to employees announcing that the agency\u2019s offices will be temporarily closed for unspecified \u201csecurity reasons\u201d was due to the layoffs. The earlier memo, obtained by CNN, instructed employees to work remotely until Thursday.\n\nThe laid off employees will telework beginning Wednesday until March 21 \u201cfor safety reasons to protect the 2,183 employees that are going to remain after\u201d the reduction in force is complete, one senior official said.\n\nThe officials also announced that several of its offices across the country will be shuttered as part of the changes, including in San Francisco and New York. The agency plans to eventually consolidate into one office in Washington, DC, where it currently has three.\n\nMinutes before employees were required to vacate the building, security guards were seen locking the doors of the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DC. Offices are expected to reopen Thursday.\n\nLongtime department staffers told CNN they can\u2019t remember a time that all offices were closed, even when significant VIPs have been on site.\n\nSeveral Department of Education employees earlier told CNN they were nervous about impending mass layoffs and the looming executive order from Trump.\n\nIn an email sent to employees not impacted by the cuts and obtained by CNN, the agency said, \u201cThere will need to be significant changes to the way that we work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile your position was not directly affected, I understand that seeing valued colleagues and friends depart is never easy,\u201d the agency\u2019s chief human capital officer said in the email, adding, \u201cWhat we choose to prioritize, and in turn, not prioritize, will be critical in this transition.\u201d\n\nUnions stress impact of cuts on students\n\nUnions representing Department of Education workers and teachers quickly responded to the cuts on Tuesday, expressing concern for the workforce and the impacts on tens of millions of students served by the agency.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear from the past weeks of mass firings, chaos, and unchecked unprofessionalism is that this regime has no respect for the thousands of workers who have dedicated their careers to serve their fellow Americans,\u201d Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, said in a statement. \u201cIt is also clear that there is a rampant disinformation campaign to mislead Americans about the actual services, resources, grants, and programs that the U.S. Department of Education provides to all Americans.\u201d\n\nAnother major teachers\u2019 union slammed Trump and Elon Musk for their reshaping of the federal government that led to Tuesday\u2019s cuts. \u201cThe real victims will be our most vulnerable students,\u201d Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said in a statement.\n\nSuch sweeping reduction \u201cis a reason to be concerned,\u201d one expert previously told CNN.\n\n\u201cIf [Trump] says, \u2018We\u2019re going to have a 50% reduction in staff,\u2019 there is reason to be concerned about how the system will work: Is that enough people?\u201d said Neal McCluskey, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute. \u201cWe\u2019re going to learn whether or not they can do the job with fewer of them.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Michael Williams contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Yikes! Photo: Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nFor many decades, true-blue anti-government conservatives and libertarians have secretly or semi-secretly longed to take a chain saw to Social Security, the crown jewel of the New Deal and of America\u2019s sorta-kinda welfare state. But with a few exceptions (e.g., Barry Goldwater in his disastrous 1964 presidential campaign and George W. Bush in a 2005 partial-privatization initiative that went nowhere), Republican politicians have understood that Social Security is indeed the third rail of American politics: Touch it and you\u2019ll die. And Donald Trump has been especially keen to disclaim any interest in messing with the retirement benefits that so many of his voters rely upon and that most feel they\u2019ve richly earned.\n\nUnfortunately, that sense of basic political reality is not shared by the extremist businessman whom Trump has given unprecedented power to identify and eliminate federal programs and personnel he deems wasteful. Elon Musk has repeatedly called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,\u201d a point of view that will especially infuriate current beneficiaries whom he is implicitly accusing of profiteering. The Social Security Administration was one of DOGE\u2019s earliest targets; it\u2019s where DOGE has demanded and obtained big reductions in customer-service offices that might affect the smooth payment of \u2014 and adjustments in \u2014 benefits. At DOGE\u2019s insistence, Social Security has also announced plans to lay off at least 12 percent of its employees.\n\nAs Musk himself made clear in a March 10 interview with Fox Business personality and MAGA insider Larry Kudlow, he wants to go after benefits in the worst way. After assuring Kudlow that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere despite highly dubious media claims that Trump has \u201creined in\u201d the DOGE edgelord, he put a bull\u2019s-eye on entitlement programs like Social Security. Musk said:\n\nWe\u2019re just getting things done, as opposed to writing a report. Like I say, reports don\u2019t mean anything. You\u2019ve got to actually take action.\n\nSo, I mean, the waste report in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements. So that\u2019s, like, the big one to eliminate. That\u2019s the sort of half-trillion, maybe 600, 700 billion a year.\n\nThese numbers are either being pulled out of the air or perhaps reflect a wild distortion of estimates of invalid claims in Social Security and other retirement programs, as the Associated Press suggests:\n\nMusk\u2019s estimate for the level of fraud in entitlements far outpaces figures from watchdogs like Social Security\u2019s inspector general, who previously said there was $71.8 billion in improper payments from fiscal years 2015 through 2022. That\u2019s less than 1% of benefits paid out during that time period.\n\nNumbers aside, Musk made it clear to Kudlow that he believes almost any myth ever heard about Social Security fraud. Both he and his boss in the White House have been ventilating about dead people being in the Social Security database:\n\nThere have been many good audits, like I said, done by inspector generals and by Government Accountability Office. And they just haven\u2019t been implemented. Nothing\u2019s been done. I think the GAO identified that there were 17 million dead people in the Social Security database several years ago. It\u2019s now 20 million.\n\nUnfortunately for this lurid claim, having a Social Security number is not the same as receiving Social Security benefits, and there\u2019s no evidence that significant numbers of ineligible people are actually receiving checks. In fact, as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities recently explained, Social Security just isn\u2019t a program with a serious fraud problem:\n\nSocial Security has a payment accuracy rate of over 99 percent. Only 0.3 percent of Social Security benefits are improper payments, which are typically caused by mistakes or delays.\n\nBut Musk, who before his DOGE self-assignment probably knew as much about Social Security as a hog knows about the Spanish Inquisition, revealed to Kudlow that he has bought into the deeply racist Great Replacement Theory for why the welfare state was invented and persists:\n\n[Entitlement spending] is also a mechanism by which the Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants by essentially paying them to come here and then turning them into voters. So this is why the Democrats are so upset about the situation, because they\u2019re losing, you know \u2014 if we turn off this gigantic money magnet for illegal immigrants, then they will leave.\n\nThis claim represents a tight bundle of multiple lies. Other than court-ordered educational benefits and emergency health care, undocumented immigrants do not qualify for any federal benefits, and there\u2019s no evidence of widespread fraudulent access to such benefits. There\u2019s even less evidence of the noncitizen voting that Trump and other Republicans have recently used to challenge any elections they happen to lose.\n\nOne of the problems with giving a completely unaccountable figure like Musk the kind of unlimited access he now has to the innards of the federal government is that nobody voted for him, and nobody can rebuke him for holding ignorant and conspiracy-laden views of a public sector he clearly despises and would like to dismantle. Indeed, he offers cover to Trump and Republican politicians who can depict him as a disinterested technician instead of a knuckle-dragging ideologue who couldn\u2019t be elected dogcatcher."

            "full_content": "An illegal alien who worked as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-NY) deputy communications director says he has self-deported to Colombia.\n\nDiego de la Vega was born in Quito, Ecuador, and was seven years old when he entered the United States and then overstayed a visitor\u2019s visa for 23 years living in New York City, which is a sanctuary city.\n\nIn an interview with Migrant Insider, de la Vega says that while growing up, \u201cWe lived in fear because we were not of the right status, but I had a pretty good childhood in New York. We worked hard, starting out in a basement apartment. But we went to school and got jobs.\u201d\n\nThe former illegal alien says his political activism began with the Dream Act in 2010. After it failed to pass into law (thank heaven), \u201cHe started organizing for immigrant rights, first as a communications worker in the New York State Assembly, then for Make the Road NY, an immigrant rights organization.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s two jobs he stole from legal citizens.\n\nThen it all came together:\n\nHis work did not go unnoticed. Within a year, he was hired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reelection campaign, where he eventually became her deputy communications director. \u201cAlexandria comes from an organizing background herself, so she likes to hire people who share that experience,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s an excellent communicator, and the team she built is top-notch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiego is amazing,\u201d AOC told Migrant Insider. \u201cWe love him.\u201d\n\nDe la Vega wanted to work on Capitol Hill. Thankfully, only legal citizens are allowed to work in national politics, which seems like a pretty smart law to me, because here is the bottom line about this DACA enrollee\u2026 See if you can spot the problem with Mr. Amazing Diego\u2026\n\n\u201cIn my late 20s, I began to seriously consider how precarious my future in the U.S. was,\u201d de la Vega said. \u201cI thought about what would happen if I just left, if I went to Latin America, if I embraced my identity as a Latino instead of trying to fit the image of a picture-perfect immigrant.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNot being able to leave the U.S. or visit my country was hard.\u201d\n\nAnd there you go\u2026\n\nDe la Vega had no desire to become an American. Oh, he wanted citizenship, but that\u2019s something very different from wanting to become an American. He lives here 23 of his 31 years and still refers to Colombia as \u201cmy country,\u201d still wants to embrace his \u201cidentity as a Latino instead of trying to fit the image of a picture-perfect immigrant.\u201d\n\nNo normal person wants immigrants like this guy living in our country: people who demean America while flying the flag of a foreign country. When my wife and her family came here (legally) from Mexico, they desperately wanted to become Americans \u2014 to learn the language, embrace our ideals and customs, and appreciate the prosperity. My wife is proud of her Mexican heritage, and in our beautiful melting pot she has held on to the traditions she loves. But if you ask what her country is, she will proudly say \u201cAmerica.\u201d\n\nAnyway, it appears as though things worked for everyone. For those of us who believe in the rule of law, an illegal alien has self-deported. As far as that illegal alien, he appears much happier where he belongs \u2014 in his own country: \u201cDiego de la Vega has a new life in Colombia\u2014one without fear, with freedom of mobility, and with the agency he never had during his 23 years in New York City.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cAfter some time, it\u2019s been a real pleasure to be here\u2026 It feels fulfilling to be home.\u201d\n\nDiego is fulfilled instead of stealing a legal citizen\u2019s job.\n\nI believe that\u2019s whachoocall a win-win, baby.\n\nOne down, about 29 million to go.\n\nJohn Nolte\u2019s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

            "full_content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump waited to appear in public on Tuesday until the final hour of trading on Wall Street, when he stepped out of the Oval Office to forcefully defend his whipsaw tariff decisions that have roiled the financial markets.\n\n\u201cWe had the greatest economy in history,\u201d Trump said, recalling his first administration. \u201cThis economy, in my opinion, is going to blow it away.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he believes the United States is heading toward a recession, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see it at all.\u201d\n\nHis comments did little to calm markets. Stocks again swooned; the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been paring earlier losses, dropped 350 points in the final hour of trading to end the day down 1.14%.\n\n\u201cMarkets are going to go up and they\u2019re going to go down, but you know what?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to rebuild our country.\u201d\n\nLong before the president emerged on the South Lawn, his words had already spooked investors. After threatening a new round of tariffs in a social media post earlier Tuesday, markets sank again.\n\nAs he pursues a hardline trade agenda and announces plans for new tariffs on a near-daily basis, Trump is sending jitters through the economy and drawing blowback even from some of his allies, who see their political or financial fortunes in the balance.\n\nIn a speech to some of America\u2019s top business leaders Tuesday night, Trump dismissed any concern from the roiled financial markets.\n\nReporters were escorted out of the Business Roundtable event after a single question, but two attendees said the president\u2019s remarks shed no new light on his tariff plans.\n\n\u201cThere was no new clarity or certainty,\u201d one business leader told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the White House.\n\nThe president insisted he was not backing away from his April reciprocal tariff plan, another person who attended the meeting said, describing the question-and-answer session as familiar ground Trump has covered before.\n\nEarlier in the day, the White House touted fresh job-creating investments and blamed policies of the Biden administration, which press secretary Karoline Leavitt called an \u201ceconomic nightmare.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans, along with business executives and economists, have warned that Trump\u2019s harsh approach toward the United States\u2019 largest trading partners could risk major damage to what had been an improving economy.\n\n\u201cThis market is just blatantly sick and tired of the back-and-forth on trade policy. It feels as though the administration continues to move the goal posts,\u201d Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview earlier Tuesday. \u201cWith that much uncertainty, it\u2019s impossible for investors to have any confidence.\u201d\n\nThe president did, however, seek to offer reassurance to one American company whose stocks fell 15% on Monday, raising losses since the beginning of the year to 45%, before rebounding some on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,\u201d Trump posted on social media.\n\nLater that afternoon, he stepped out of the Oval Office into the bright sunshine to size up several Tesla models \u2013 red, silver and blue \u2013 that were parked in the south driveway of the White House. As Musk watched, the president took a close look at the electric vehicles in a moment that unfolded like a Tesla promotion.\n\n\u201cWe have to celebrate someone who has the courage to do this,\u201d Trump said, showering praise upon Musk. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be penalized because he\u2019s a patriot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how carefully Trump\u2019s combative approach to tariffs has been planned out. His Tuesday threat to ramp up duties on steel and aluminum on Canada, which were set to go into effect Wednesday, was not drawn up into formal paperwork ahead of time, officials said.\n\nAnd during the appearance with Musk, Trump veered again, saying he would \u201cprobably\u201d reverse course on higher tariffs. The White House later confirmed that the planned tariff was back to 25%, with Ontario agreeing to suspend its 25% surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.\n\nSince Trump entered office 50 days ago, there have been few weekday afternoons when he hasn\u2019t invited reporters into the West Wing to hold forth on camera. Monday was one of them. As stock markets tumbled, Trump remained behind closed doors, hosting tech executives and swearing in his new Secret Service chief all without cameras rolling. It was Trump\u2019s own comments a day earlier, refusing to rule out a recession, that caused markets to sink, rendering his silence Monday even more notable.\n\nFor a president who boasts of one record-setting moment after another, he has taken an unusually equivocal tone on the slowing economy. Shortly after taking office, he talked about \u201cshort-term pain.\u201d In his speech to Congress last week, he acknowledged the prospect of \u201ca little disturbance\u201d in the economy, adding: \u201cIt won\u2019t be much.\u201d\n\nBut Trump has yet to seize the bully pulpit in the way he has on other issues, fueling uncertainty that markets have rejected day after day.\n\nTrump\u2019s aides have been quick to downplay recession fears, suggesting instead that the new tariffs will cause momentary \u201cdisruption\u201d as global trade is realigned toward the United States.\n\n\u201cSince President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump\u2019s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs,\u201d Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement after markets closed Monday. \u201cPresident Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.\u201d\n\nBut for a businessman who has long seen a rising stock market as a critical metric of economic success, the steep declines on Wall Street have cast doubt on Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that he isn\u2019t paying attention.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market,\u201d Trump told Fox Business in an interview that aired over the weekend in which his comments declining to rule out a recession touched off a fresh wave of anxiety and led to the biggest market decline of the year.\n\nThat admonition from Trump, which even many of his allies and advisers privately concede they don\u2019t fully believe, is at odds with what he said throughout the campaign and during his transition back to power.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say this, it\u2019s too braggadocios, but we\u2019ll say it anyway \u2014 the Trump effect,\u201d he told a crowded rally on the eve of his inauguration, basking in applause from his supporters. \u201cSince the election, the stock market has surged.\u201d\n\nToday, the Trump effect is seen in a far different light. The New York Post, one of his favorite old tabloids that he reads religiously, blared a warning on Tuesday\u2019s edition: \u201cBuckle Up! Markets plunge as Trump takes the economy on a wild ride.\u201d\n\nAs Trump remained uncharacteristically out of public view on Monday, a question began emerging among some Republican donors, investors and business leaders who scrambled to explain the sudden economic whiplash: Is Trump working to engineer a recession \u2014 or not actively building a narrative against it \u2014 to force the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates?\n\nIn his second presidency, Trump has far fewer dissenting voices in his administration, particularly those who may offer a different economic view on tariffs.\n\n\u201cTariffs are going to be the greatest thing we\u2019ve ever done as a country,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make our country rich again.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s view, the disruption caused by his tariffs is a necessary step toward correcting decades of bad decisions on trade that hollowed out American manufacturing and led to core US industries being moved overseas.\n\nHis whipsaw tariffs have thrown foreign governments off balance, prompting their leaders to scramble to get Trump on the phone to plead for a reprieve.\n\nThe tariffs are also a necessary revenue driver that, in Trump\u2019s plan, will be used to pay for new tax cuts he promised as a candidate, and an extension of the tax cuts he hopes to approve later this year.\n\nTrump arrived in office having inherited strong a economy, with rising wages and consumer spending, low unemployment and inflation \u2014 albeit higher than consumers or the Federal Reserve would like \u2014 appearing to slow.\n\nAll presidents, at points in their terms, find themselves frustrated by the relative difficulty of directly improving the economy from the Oval Office. While they catch blame from the public, many of the factors that influence the economy Americans feel are out of their control.\n\nFor Trump, however, many of the most pressing economic concerns can be directly linked to his policies.\n\nNew tariffs have the potential to aggravate already high prices that Trump himself credited with helping him win. Mass government layoffs could push up unemployment, while also causing workers uncertain about their future to pull back on spending. And large-scale deportations could cause rising costs in industries dependent on migrant labor, including construction and health care.\n\nAll of the uncertainty could cause businesses to hold off on hiring and investing, helping push down growth forecasts.\n\nFor Trump, however, uncertainty appears part of the plan.\n\n\u201cThey always say that. \u2018We want clarity,\u2019\u201d he said in his Fox Business interview. \u201cThey have plenty of clarity.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "One of the newest federal judges in the U.S. has found himself squarely in the crosshairs of the Trump administration\u2019s battle over foreign aid spending after the Supreme Court tasked him with determining how, and when, the government must pay nearly $2 billion owed to foreign aid groups and contractors.\n\nJudge Amir H. Ali, a Biden appointee, has served on the court for less than four months and is among the 25 newest federal judges confirmed by the Senate to serve on a federal district court.\n\nDespite his short tenure, Ali, a U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C., is already at the center of some of the most high-profile court cases to date, presiding most recently over the lawsuit seeking billions in unpaid invoices for USAID-funded projects.\n\nThe case is the first significant case of President Donald Trump's term to be heard by the Supreme Court \u2013 and Amir's handling of it has brought renewed scrutiny from conservatives over his previous work as a litigator, including for progressive legal groups.\n\nSCOTUS RULES ON NEARLY $2 BILLION IN FROZEN USAID PAYMENTS\n\nFar from being a wallflower, Ali has had a prolific and high-profile career as both a professor and litigator, including arguing civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, and serving as the director of Harvard Law's Criminal Justice Appellate Clinic. His work has earned awards or recognition from groups such as the NAACP, the American Constitution Society \u2013 where he was a finalist for the David Carliner Public Interest Award \u2013 and Bloomberg, among others.\n\nMuch of Ali's work prior to his confirmation to the bench focused closely on police and prosecutorial misconduct and civil rights protections, some of which made headlines during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year.\n\nIn 2017, Ali helped open the Washington, D.C., branch of the MacArthur Justice Center, where he represented dozens of plaintiffs, including before the Supreme Court, where he argued and won two separate civil rights cases. The MacArthur Justice Center was formed in 1985 to challenge the death penalty in Illinois, and it has since expanded to support reductions in over-incarceration and the elimination of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, among other reforms, with offices in four states and Washington, D.C.\n\nAli's first case, Garza v. Idaho, expanded the constitutional right to counsel for defendants under the Sixth Amendment. His second, Thompson v. Clark, made it slightly easier for individuals who claim they were wrongfully arrested to sue police for malicious prosecution. (Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, authored the 6-3 majority opinion.)\n\nHe was later appointed executive director of the Washington, D.C., branch, a role he held through 2024, when he was appointed to the federal bench.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing last February, Ali was grilled by Republicans over remarks made by his MacArthur Justice Center colleague, Cliff Johnson \u2013 who suggested during a podcast interview in 2020 that defunding the police is the first step in a \"movement toward making police departments obsolete.\"\n\nAli stressed in response that he did not share those views, and that the views were not endorsed by the MacArthur Justice Center.\n\n\"Let me be very clear about this,\" Ali said. \"I have never advocated for taking away police funding. I would not take that position, and the MacArthur Justice Center has not taken that position.\"\n\nUS JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMIN TO PAY PORTION OF $2B IN FOREIGN AID BY MONDAY\n\nNow, as a judge, Ali has been tasked with presiding over some of the most consequential cases to come up during Trump's second term.\n\nLast month, he sided with foreign aid groups and contractors who sued the Trump administration for roughly $1.9 billion owed for previously completed projects that were funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\nAli gave the Trump administration just two weeks to pay the outstanding funds, prompting Justice Department lawyers to file an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately rejected the Trump administration's request to extend the freeze in 5-4 vote, remanding it back to D.C. federal court, and Ali, to hash out the specifics of what must be paid, and when \u2013 a role Ali stressed that he takes \"very seriously.\"\n\nPlaintiffs sued over the Trump administration's executive action earlier this year that froze nearly all foreign aid spending, changes made in the name of government \"efficiency\" and eliminating waste, according to administration officials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stated plans to cut some 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts and to slash an additional $60 billion in foreign aid spending and at issue in the case is how quickly the Trump administration must pay the outstanding invoices from completed projects.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Monday that roughly 83% of USAID programs are slated to be canceled following a six-week review process led by DOGE.\n\nThe canceled contracts, Rubio wrote, amount to \"tens of billions of dollars\" that were being spent in ways he alleged \"did not serve\" U.S. national interests. He added that the rest of the USAID programs and contracts will be transferred to the State Department to be managed.\n\nLAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS\n\nMost recently, Ali ordered the Trump administration Monday evening to pay by March 14 all owed funds to USAID contractors and other international groups for previously completed projects. Ali said the Trump administration's withholding of the funds, which had already been appropriated by Congress, was likely \"unlawful\" and a violation of the separation of powers doctrine under the Constitution.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Trump administration will move to challenge that ruling in court.\n\nLast week, Ali moved expeditiously on the Supreme Court directive, ordering both parties back to court last week for an hours-long hearing to weigh plausible repayment options. He heard from both plaintiffs in the case, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, who argued that the Trump administration \"never took steps towards compliance\" with Ali's order requiring the administration to unfreeze the federal funds to pay the $1.9 billion in owed project payments.\n\nDuring the hearing, which stretched on for nearly five hours, Ali also focused heavily on other issues, including the government's role in reviewing all foreign aid contracts and grants.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration told Ali they had already completed and made final decisions for these contracts. Stephen Wirth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, objected to the administration's \"breakneck\" review of the contracts and grants, arguing that they \"had one objective \u2013 to terminate as many contracts as possible.\"\n\nLawyers were also pressed by Ali over whether the Trump administration can legally move to terminate projects whose funds are allocated and appropriated by Congress. This could eventually kick the issue back up to the Supreme Court.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Ali ordered the government to pay at least a portion of the owed funds by Monday at 6 p.m. \u2013 taking what he described as a \"concrete step\" forward in resolving some of the confusion surrounding the Trump administration's freeze on most foreign spending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think it\u2019s reasonable to get the plaintiffs' invoices paid by 6 p.m. on Monday,\" Ali said.\n\nIt is unclear what payments the government has made since last week."

            "full_content": "Photo: Justin Merriman/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDespite suggesting on Truth Social this past weekend that he\u2019d like Americans to \u201cshut up\u201d about the price of eggs, Donald Trump is actually very concerned about Americans\u2019 economic problems \u2014 or at least, the plight of one specific South African\u2013born Canadian American businessman.\n\nThe U.S. stock market cratered on Monday amid concerns about both the impact of Trump\u2019s chaotic trade war and the president refusing to rule out a recession this year. Trump has yet to say anything to ally these concerns (in fact, he announced additional tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum on Tuesday). But the president did offer his support to Elon Musk after shares in Tesla, his electric-car company, dropped more than 15 percent on Monday.\n\nTesla shares have plunged more than 50 percent from a mid-December peak as the DOGE chief\u2019s political antics impacted the brand. Tesla sales have been falling in the U.S. and Europe, including a 76 percent decline in Tesla sales in Germany where Musk has endorsed a far-right political party. In recent weeks acts of vandalism have been reported against Tesla vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations, and there have been protests against Musk\u2019s drastic cuts to the federal government at Tesla dealerships across the U.S.\n\nSo early on Tuesday morning, Trump tried to do his part by claiming, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nTrump promoted the company outside the White House on Tuesday afternoon, posing with Musk, his son, and a line of Tesla vehicles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy because number one, it\u2019s a great product. As good as it gets. Number two, because this man [Elon Musk] has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, and I think he has been treated unfairly,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nHours before Trump posted his initial Tesla endorsement, Sean Hannity announced (while chatting with Lara Trump, First Daughter\u2013in\u2013Law/Fox News anchor) that he, too, will buy a Tesla to help out poor Elon. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a gesture on my part, and I like new technology, but it\u2019s just a way of saying, \u2018Look what they\u2019re doing to this guy,\u2019\u201d the Fox host explained.\n\nTo be clear, Musk is not literally poor in any way. He remains the world\u2019s richest man, though his net worth has dropped by $132 billion in 2025, or more than 30 percent as of March 10, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBut Americans should still take heed of Trump\u2019s Truth Social post, if not for their concerns for Musk\u2019s billions, then for the president\u2019s complaint that the \u201cRadical Left Lunatics\u201d are \u201ctrying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla.\u201d Declining to buy a Tesla isn\u2019t currently against the law, but you might want to adjust your finances just in case that changes. A new Cybertruck costs around $80,000, so between that, skyrocketing egg prices, and the potential recession, you\u2019d better start saving.\n\nThis post was updated after Trump\u2019s Tuesday afternoon photo op."

(AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- U.S. officials have not determined who was behind an apparent cyber attack on the social media site X that limited access to the platform for thousands of users, according to a Trump administration official familiar with the ongoing investigation into the matter.\n\nMonday's outage was described as a cyber attack by the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The official added that the Republican administration takes all cyber attacks against American companies seriously but underscored that the U.S. government had not gleaned any specific intelligence about who might have been behind the attack.\n\nThe comments came after Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X and a top adviser to President Donald Trump, claimed in an appearance on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cKudlow\u201d show that the cyber attackers had \u201cIP addresses originating in the Ukraine area\u201d without going into detail on what that might mean.\n\nCybersecurity experts quickly pointed out, however, that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the attack originated in Ukraine.\n\nMusk bought what was then Twitter in 2022 and serves as the CEO of Tesla, all while effectively running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nHis electric vehicle company has faced some headwinds as he's become the face of Trump's effort to dramatically shrink the size of the government through DOGE. Its stock plunged 15% on Monday, its biggest one-day loss since September 2020.\n\nAnalysts have said Musk\u2019s shift to right-wing politics doesn\u2019t appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy, environmentally conscious liberals who have turned to electric vehicles in an attempt to reduce fossil fuel emissions.\n\nTesla has also been a target of protests and vandalism in the U.S. and elsewhere over Musk's push for large-scale federal government layoffs, contract cancellations and other budget slashing moves.\n\nTrump said on his social media platform that he\u2019ll buy a Tesla on Tuesday to demonstrate \"confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???\u201d Trump said."

August Pfluger, the legislation's House sponsor, shared the potential long-term benefits will \"tremendously impact\" his central and west Texas district, as the state \"is the leading LNG exporter in the United States.\"\n\n\"This bill will support thousands of new jobs in Texas, from construction and engineering to operations at export terminals along the Gulf. Furthermore, it will give natural gas producers in Texas a more competitive edge in international markets, ensuring that Texas remains a global energy leader,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be excited about the prospect of expanding LNG efforts domestically, as Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright both visited a facility in Louisiana last week amid an $18 million investment from its owner, Venture Global. The U.S. currently leads the world in natural gas creation, according to the Department of Energy.\n\nUS 'ENERGY DOMINANCE': WRIGHT, BURGUM VISIT LOUISIANA LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITY AMID $18B EXPANSION\n\n\"If you think about the America First strategy, the simple answer is an America Last strategy is depending on foreign adversaries for our energy, whether it's LNG, oil, gas, whatever it is. So the more we do in America to increase our production, the more we engage in the energy America First strategy,\" he said.\n\nThe legislation is meant to be a long-term measure to ultimately make it harder for the policies of a specific administration to determine what permits are approved.\n\nHowever, Scott noted in the short term that \"having President Trump in office is the most effective weapon.\"\n\nFIRED PIPELINE WORKER SAYS REVIVING KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE WILL HELP FAMILIES \u2018PROSPER\u2019\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Our goal, of course, is making sure that in the future, no matter who's in office, that we have in place something that tethers the production to FERC and hopefully avoids the disaster that we saw under the Biden administration \u2013 their ability to manipulate the Department of Energy,\" Scott added.\n\nLast year, legislation under the same title passed the House but did not make it to former President Joe Biden's desk."

            "full_content": "Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., is pushing to censure Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., over a TV interview in which the Republican congresswoman criticized Rep. Al Green, D-Texas.\n\nGreen notably heckled President Donald Trump multiple times during his first address of his second term to Congress last week until House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ordered the Sergeant at Arms to escort Green from the chamber.\n\nHoulahan submitted a resolution Monday calling to censure Boebert \"for her recent disparaging and derogatory comments\" about Green.\n\nREP. AL GREEN BLAMES 'INVIDIOUS DISCRIMINATION' FOR BEING CENSURED AFTER DISRUPTING TRUMP'S SPEECH\n\nDuring a March 7 interview with Real America\u2019s Voice News, Boebert said \"Al Green was given multiple opportunities to stand down, to sit down, to behave, to show decorum.\"\n\n\"For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,\" Boebert added.\n\nThe resolution said those words uttered by Boebert \"are disparaging, derogatory, and racist toward another colleague, and are a breach of proper conduct and decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.\"\n\nIt calls for Boebert to be censured, \"forthwith present herself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure,\" and that Boebert \"be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.\"\n\nIn a statement, Houlahan said, \"After my discussion on the House floor last week when Speaker Johnson told me he\u2019d have to censure half the members if he actually enforced the rules of the Congress, I decided to help, and tonight introduced a resolution to censure Representative Boebert for her racist and derogatory statements about Representative Al Green (D-TX).\"\n\nAt the start of Trump's address before Congress, Green stood up when the president described his electoral victory as a \"mandate\" from the American people.\n\n\"You have no mandate! You have no mandate to cut Medicaid!\" Green shouted, waving his cane at Trump.\n\nThe lower chamber of Congress voted to censure Green the next day, and Johnson condemned how the Democrat \"chose to deliberately violate House rules in a manner that we think is probably unprecedented in history.\"\n\nHoulahan initially voted to table the motion, but she was among the 10 Democrats who ultimately joined with Republicans to censure Green.\n\nEstablishment Democrats and progressives promptly turned on each other over their party's disrupting behavior during Trump's address, complaining how they've failed to have a unifying message against Republicans.\n\nTRUMP BLASTS REP AL GREEN AS 'AN EMBARRASSMENT' TO DEMOCRATS, SAYS HE 'SHOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE AN IQ TEST\n\nHoulahan acknowledged in an X post on Thursday that \"today's vote to censure my fellow representative was not easy and has angered many of you.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Philadelphia Inquirer afterward, she defended her decision but also criticized past behavior from Republicans in the chamber that she argued also warranted censure.\n\n\"I voted to table that because I think we have much, much better things to do with our time than to continue to do this tit-for-tat nonsense with one another,\" Houlahan told the newspaper. \"That being said, the motion to table failed, so we don\u2019t have the opportunity to not vote on this. And I believe we need to recognize that we have rules in the House of Representatives and we have standards of decorum that we all presumably agree to, and we all need to agree to those standards so we can get the work for the people done and so we can not be a banana republic.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Houlahan told the Inquirer she pulled Johnson \"to the side and had a very\u201a very strong conversation with him where I explained I voted in favor but I am not OK with arbitrary and capricious applications of the same rule.\"\n\nShe said she complained about how there was no censure or sanction against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Johnson replied, \"Well, she just wore a hat.\"\n\nBut Houlahan argued Greene \"also yelled at the President of the United States,\" referring to her treatment of former President Joe Biden last year, \"and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s OK that she did not have same treatment.\"\n\n\"And I think it\u2019s absolute hypocrisy that people after the vote were standing there yelling at Mr. Green when their own colleagues have done very, very similar things, not wearing masks when it was mandated, wearing MAGA hats when there are literally no hats allowed on the floor,\" Houlahan said. \"We had to make a special exception for wearing hijabs. It\u2019s insane\u2026 We need to behave like grown-ups and stop the madness.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHoulahan said it was a \"really, really, really hard vote for me,\" but ultimately she did her duty. \"And it\u2019s frustrating because Al Green\u2019s statement was true,\" Houlahan said. \"It wasn\u2019t provocative or offensive. It was the truth. But I think each one of us had to make decisions about how we were going to comport ourselves and what was appropriate, and I know each colleague on both sides made those choices, and each one of us knows there are consequences to those choices.\""

            "full_content": "Talks to determine whether Ukraine is ready to engage with President Donald Trump\u2019s peace process and consequently regain access to U.S. military aid and intelligence started on Tuesday morning.\n\nUkraine hailed talks with America as having started \u201cconstructively\u201d, Kyiv state media reported on Tuesday morning. Delegations from the United States and Ukraine met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the first in-person discussions between the two countries since Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s disastrous attempt at strong-arm diplomacy at the Oval Office in February.\n\nRepresenting the United States are U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, both of whom also sat around the table at the earlier Saudi talks with Russia. For Ukraine, the delegation includes Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha, Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s trusted aide and Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, and Minister of Defence Rustem Umerov.\n\nPresident Zelensky himself was in Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with the Crown Prince but left the country before today\u2019s talks began. Today\u2019s talks are being mediated by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, and their National Security Advisor Mosaad bin Mohammad al-Aiban.\n\nYermak, a former film producer who has been close to Zelensky since his pre-politics days as a Ukrainian comedian and actor, said of talks as they kicked off: \u201cThe meeting with the U.S. team started very constructively; we are working towards a just and lasting peace\u201d.\n\nBoth sides evidently hope for a resetting of relations between the nations following sarcastic retorts by President Zelensky in the Oval Office last month which led to an angry response on respect from Vice President J.D. Vance and Zelensky being asked to leave the White House with nothing. Speaking before today\u2019s talks, Yermak stated Ukraine is ready for \u201ca just and lasting peace in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nWhile this may be a positive development and a step towards a resumption of U.S. aid to Kyiv, similar remarks were made before the White House meeting, with Ukraine\u2019s conception of a \u201clasting peace\u201d meaning robust security guarantees the U.S. appears to believe will be incompatible with a negotiated peace. President Trump has emphasised the importance of even being able to get Russia to the negotiating table at all, and finding a peace agreement to end what the President has called the \u201ckilling fields\u201d of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on his plane to Saudi Arabia overnight Rubio also telegraphed his hopes for talks, saying for the United States the key ambition for Tuesday is to discover whether Ukraine really is ready for peace or not, reported The Guardian. He said: \u201cThe most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things, to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nBoth sides need to come to the realisation there will never be a military victory for one or other of them in the conflict, Rubio said. His stating Ukraine won\u2019t be able to fight its way back to its 2014 borders has been interpreted as meaning a likely outcome of the eventual peace talks will be Ukraine ceding at least some territory as a price for an end to the killing.\n\nBoth Rubio and his colleague the United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have previously made clear the U.S. suspension of aid to Ukraine is a negotiating tactic of Washington to encourage Kyiv to take peace talks seriously, and that it would be reversed when Ukraine came to the table.\n\nRussia is not present at today\u2019s talks but nevertheless made its view on proceedings clear, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claiming Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory \u2014 pointing to a drone attack against Moscow overnight \u2014 as evidence that Kyiv will try to \u201cspoil\u201d talks in favour of keeping the war going."

            "full_content": "House Democrats have launched an effort to bar President Donald Trump from unilaterally moving to \"invade or seize territory\" from Greenland, Canada and Panama.\n\nThe measure, known as the No Invading Allies Act and spearheaded by Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., bars funding from going toward the armed forces to engage in operations seeking to take over Greenland, Canada and Panama.\n\nMagaziner said Trump\u2019s \"reckless\" rhetoric about obtaining territory from the three countries makes the president untrustworthy with the war powers granted to him.\n\n\"Americans do not support sending troops unnecessary wars, especially with allies of the United States who pose no threat to our country,\" Magaziner said in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital. \"Unfortunately, President Trump has recklessly refused to rule out taking the territory of other nations by force. Under the Constitution it is Congress, not the President, who has the power to declare war. It is time for Congress to reclaim that constitutional power and ensure that the President adheres to the will of the American people.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital about Magaziner's measure.\n\nAnd while Trump has discussed acquiring territory from these countries, he has not suggested using military force to seize them or conduct an invasion.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nWhile the U.S. Constitution dictates that Congress has the authority to approve declaring an act of war, Congress last formally declared war in 1942, and modern presidents have entered conflicts without securing explicit or formal congressional approval, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nFurthermore, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the executive branch to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action and bars troops from remaining engaged for more than 60 days without congressional approval. However, the legislation does not define \"hostilities,\" and previous administrations have asserted their actions engaging military forces did not qualify as hostilities and, therefore, congressional approval was not required, according to the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers who have co-sponsored the measure include Reps. Eric Swallwell of California and Pramila Jayapal of Washington. The legislation has been referred to both the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees.\n\nTrump has discussed acquiring Greenland, Canada and Panama for months \u2014 and has regularly referred to Canada as the 51st state in the U.S. Additionally, Trump asserted in a joint address to Congress March 4 that the U.S. would reclaim the Panama Canal for security reasons and acquire Greenland.\n\n\"And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland,\" Trump said. \"We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nTrump has discussed the possibility of expanding American territory for months and said in a post in December 2024 on Truth Social that \"the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"\n\nGREENLAND, PANAMA FIERCELY REJECT TRUMP'S AMBITIONS IN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nMeanwhile, leaders from Greenland, which is a territory of Denmark, and Panama pushed back on Trump\u2019s comments to Congress.\n\n\"We do not want to be Americans, nor Danes, we are Kalaallit (Greenlanders),\" Greenland Prime Minister M\u00fate Egede said in a post on Facebook translated by Reuters. \"The Americans and their leader must understand that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,\" Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a Wednesday post on X.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have cast doubt on whether Trump would actually launch a military conflict against countries like Greenland. For example, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said in an interview with NBC in January that the U.S. would not \"invade another country.\"\n\n\"Quite frankly, the president\u2019s been very clear,\" Lankford said. \"He is the president that kept American troops out of war. He is not looking to be able to go start a war, to go expand American troops, but he does want to be able to protect America\u2019s national security, and part of that is our economic security and our future.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Caitlin McFall and Alex Nitzberg contributed to this report."

The four-part series airs on Sundays at 10pm ET/PT from March 9th - 30th.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk spent the weekend with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, getting a round-trip ride on Air Force One. While Musk has spent an increasing amount of time with Trump, three of his companies are having a rough go.\n\nHis X social media platform was down for much of the day Monday; Tesla shares plunged 15% and erased the last of their post-Election Day gains; and SpaceX continued to struggle with the aftermath of yet another rocket explosion.\n\nThat\u2019s taking a toll on Musk\u2019s fortune: He lost $29 billion in net worth on Monday alone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nMusk has ramped up his visibility in politics and government, leading the new Department of Government Efficiency in what fans call efforts to curtail government fraud and critics call an unelected takeover and slash-and-burn. Meanwhile, his companies have struggled.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Monday, Musk acknowledged that he runs his companies \u201cwith great difficulty\u201d while also working for the Trump administration.\n\nFor a proponent of \u201chardcore\u201d work up to 16 hours a day, the slump in his business interests points to a fundamental truth: No matter how in political favor their leadership, companies still need to be run \u2013 and preferably run well.\n\nThis a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d for Musk as Tesla\u2019s stock price tumbles, wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to clients Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMusk needs to step up as Tesla CEO at this critical juncture,\u201d Ives wrote. \u201cIn a nutshell the word \u201cbalance\u201d has been missing with Elon Musk and his ability to run Tesla as CEO\u2026.while instead focusing all of his energy and time driving his DOGE initiative within the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nTesla slumps\n\nThe market broadly slumped on Monday \u2013 but shares of Tesla fell even more sharply. The 15% drop in Tesla shares wiped out the last of any remaining gains since Election Day.\n\nIn a show of support, Trump said early Tuesday morning he would buy a Tesla.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is\u2019 \u2018putting it on the line\u2019 in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\u201d\n\nMusk thanked Trump in a post on X.\n\nWhen Trump won the US presidential election in November, many shareholders thought Musk\u2019s proximity to Trump would help the company by leading to looser regulations, currying favor with the White House and removing subsidies that had helped Tesla competitors.\n\nThe reality has been somewhat different.\n\nSales are dropping, especially in Europe, which some analysts say is a direct result of both competition in the marketplace and Musk\u2019s wading into politics both in the US and abroad.\n\nTesla vehicles and showrooms have also been the targets of protestors and, in some cases, violence. Earlier this month a Tesla charging station in Boston was set on fire, and someone shot at a Tesla dealership in Oregon. Individual Tesla owners are claiming on social media their cars have been targeted as well.\n\nMusk has responded by reposting supportive comments about Tesla and its cars and thanking people for their support. He\u2019s blamed liberal activists including mega donor George Soros for the attacks.\n\nTrump, in his Truth Social post Tuesday, claimed radical leftists were working to \u201cillegally and collusively boycott Tesla\u201d so they can \u201cattack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???\u201d Trump added.\n\nResponding to an X user posting about Tesla stock, Musk wrote: \u201cIt will be fine long-term.\u201d\n\nX goes down\n\nOn Monday, X was hit with a barrage of outages. Website DownDetector registered tens of thousands of reports that X was down.\n\nMusk claimed the outage was due to a cyberattack.\n\n\u201cThere was (still is) a massive cyberattack against X,\u201d he wrote on Monday afternoon. \u201cWe get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.\u201d\n\nHe later agreed with an X user who posted: \u201cthey want to silence you and this platform.\u201d\n\nEric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, told CNN that it\u2019s likely too early to tell if an attack caused the issues.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that should always be taken with a grain of salt is any statements made in the short period of time, immediately after, or even in this case during an attack,\u201d Noonan said.\n\nMusk spent $44 billion to take X, then known as Twitter, private in October 2022. Fidelity estimated last October that Musk had erased about 80% of the site\u2019s value since his purchase.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s exploding rockets\n\nThe first two launches of SpaceX\u2019s giant Starship rocket have blown up \u2013 most recently on Thursday. The debris from the explosions could be viewed for miles and even caused some flight disruptions.\n\nThe first explosion in January left debris scattered over Turks and Caicos.\n\nMusk brushed off the rocket mishaps, replying to a photo of himself looking at debris from one of SpaceX\u2019s multiple early rocket failures.\n\n\u201cToday was a minor setback,\u201d he wrote last week. \u201cProgress is measured by time. The next ship will be ready in 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Authority is still investigating the rockets\u2019 failures."

            "full_content": "Photo: Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThere is only one great question hanging over this deeply unlikely Democratic primary for mayor of New York City: Can Andrew Cuomo run out the clock?\n\nThe former governor, bursting into a union hall a little over a week ago, put to rest many months of speculation and upended a race that already hinged on the unpredictability of Eric Adams, the once-indicted and historically unpopular incumbent. Almost no one in New York politics believes Adams, who now carries a catastrophic approval rating of 20 percent, can win again. He is set to become the city\u2019s first one-term mayor in 30 years. More than a few politicos are settling into the reality that Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace a little over three years ago, might just overpower the field with his universal name recognition and deep executive experience \u2014 the sort that the electorate might be pining for after the chaos of the Adams years. Cuomo is expected to play it relatively safe, mostly avoiding a relentless and adversarial city press corps and letting his well-funded super-PAC bludgeon his rivals into submission.\n\nIt\u2019s still a long way between now and June 24. Every Democrat running in the race, Adams included, will have one sole focus: dragging Cuomo\u2019s poll numbers down. The various Cuomo antagonists \u2014 the operatives working on a significant anti-Cuomo PAC and the candidates themselves \u2014 believe there are vulnerabilities that can be exploited. There are the sexual-harassment scandals and the fact that Cuomo so aggressively battled back against the young women who accused him, dragging them through court. There\u2019s his fraught decadelong tenure as governor, which had both undeniable successes (the rehab of La Guardia Airport) and ugly failures (the Buffalo billion corruption). His stewardship of the pandemic, beginning with how his administration tabulated deaths at nursing homes and his decision to accept more than $5 million in 2020 to write a memoir, will come in for far greater scrutiny.\n\nWho can beat Cuomo is the easy enough rejoinder to anyone who points out his myriad flaws or the softness of his polling lead. No one, for now, comes very close. Brad Lander, the progressive city comptroller, is aiming to be the primary alternative to Cuomo and could find a way there with strong fundraising and a growing list of endorsers. His major challenge will be winning over voters beyond his affluent Brooklyn base, just as Scott Stringer, his predecessor, must try to corral support beyond the West Side of Manhattan, where he\u2019s still well known. Zellnor Myrie, a young Afro-Latino state senator from Brooklyn, might have a higher ceiling than either man (or socialist assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who came in a distant third to Cuomo in a recent Quinnipiac poll), but he\u2019s yet to break out from the pack. All four of these Democrats have qualified for millions in public matching funds, so they must be regarded as the serious contenders in what will be an expensive, nasty race.\n\nThe panic over the possible inability of Lander-Stringer-Myrie-Mamdani to stop Cuomo has prompted Adrienne Adams, the City Council Speaker, to enter the fray. A soft-spoken and well-regarded legislative leader (who is not related to the mayor), she has a base of middle-class Black supporters in southeast Queens who are reliable primary voters. Urged to run by attorney general Letitia James, who would have been a formidable candidate herself if she chose to run, Adrienne Adams could steadily rise if large labor unions coalesce around her and she\u2019s successful at netting media attention.\n\nHer major challenge is fundraising. She has a little more than $200,000 in her war chest and will have to play catch-up with the Democrats who\u2019ve already banked multiple millions and will be ready, before her, to build out large field operations and run television ads. Adrienne Adams probably should have been a candidate three or four months ago. Had she launched in the fall, she would have qualified for public matching funds by now and been on an inside track to win over a wide array of elected officials and unions. Instead, she\u2019ll be fighting for oxygen, and she\u2019ll need a clear message to distinguish herself from a large field training their fire on Cuomo. If she wins, she\u2019d be New York\u2019s first female mayor, and perhaps that history-making potential will excite some of the electorate.\n\nNo one quite knows how ranked-choice voting will impact the race, and it will be only the second mayoral primary with RCV. In 2021, Kathryn Garcia finished third among first-place votes and then, once all the choices were tabulated \u2014 New York Democrats can rank up to five candidates \u2014 Garcia surged, coming within 10,000 votes of defeating Eric Adams. The lesson was twofold: It still pays to finish first, since Adams did win, but it\u2019s very possible to rise if you\u2019re appealing to a broad range of people. There are several RCV Cuomo theories. One school of thought is that his superior name recognition will carry the day and he\u2019ll show up on many ballots in many different neighborhoods, whether it\u2019s in the Latino areas of the Bronx or the Black enclaves of Queens or Orthodox Jewish Brooklyn. There\u2019s a multiracial coalition for Cuomo to build that could be larger than the one Adams assembled in 2021.\n\nBut RCV can also punish polarizing candidates. Andrew Yang, the front-runner four years ago, was dropped from a lot of ballots. Progressives are floating a new slogan, DREAM (Don\u2019t Rank Eric or Andrew for Mayor), and it\u2019s easy enough to see such a movement take off in large swaths of left-leaning Brooklyn and Queens. If the Working Families Party wants to get serious about growing their influence in municipal politics again, they can fund a multimillion-dollar initiative focusing only on convincing voters to leave Cuomo off their ballots. As Election Day draws closer, the various non-Cuomo candidates could form alliances and cross-endorse. There\u2019s evidence that a last-minute Garcia-Yang cross-endorsement four years ago netted Garcia votes from Yang supporters and drew her closer to victory.\n\nWhat\u2019s been most intimidating is Cuomo\u2019s polling. His actual campaign rollout has been a bit pedestrian \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to tell, for now, what that truly means. His launch video was an unwieldy 17 minutes and was ruthlessly mocked online. His endorsement roster is still shallow for a vaunted front-runner, featuring only a handful of sitting elected officials and labor unions not known for swaying citywide primaries. It is possible that his roster could grow quickly if no one else seems to be gaining traction. Major unions like 32BJ SEIU, the building-workers union, and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council might close ranks around Cuomo, prompting other institutional forces to join him. He could very well be an unstoppable political battleship. We\u2019ll know in the spring whether he\u2019ll take on any water."

Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who represented Orange County in the US House for three terms, announced Tuesday she\u2019s entering the race to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited from running again.\n\nPorter enters a field that already includes Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Senate Leader Toni Atkins and former state Controller Betty Yee. Last year, Porter finished a distant third in the state\u2019s top primary for an open US Senate seat that was ultimately won by Adam Schiff.\n\nPorter, a former law student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, often went viral for using calculations on a white board in congressional committee hearings\u2014and she has a white board as part of the background of her video announcement.\n\nThe thrust of Porter\u2019s announcement video is focused on national politics, featuring shots of President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson and former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Both her script and the imagery behind it reference a more open approach to immigration while fighting corruption, climate change and high costs.\n\n\u201cWhat California needs now is a little bit of hope and a whole lot of grit,\u201d Porter says. \u201cAs governor, I won\u2019t ever back down when Trump\u2019s hurting Californians.\u201d\n\nWith the long recovery and rebuilding ahead after the Los Angeles wildfires, Porter makes a specific reference to pushing for increased firefighter pay while in Congress. In a mark of a race that will likely be decided by which Democrat gets the most support, she also says she\u2019s committed to \u201cabortion rights, LGBTQ rights and immigrant rights,\u201d while saying she\u2019s against \u201cBig Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.\u201d\n\nNone of that may matter, though, if Harris decides to run \u2013 which people close to her have said would need to happen by the summer, so she could have time to make a full-fledged case for why she might want the job and not be seen as just going for a consolation prize after her presidential loss last year. Advisers and friends remain divided over whether they want her to try for the job in Sacramento next year or attempt another presidential run in 2028.\n\nPorter said in December that Harris entering would likely have a \u201cfield-clearing effect,\u201d and she is sticking by that even as she launches her run, which is why the former vice president and California senator isn\u2019t included in the numbers that her campaign is trying to tout. And though says she has a poll that has her in the best shape of \u201clikely\u201d Democratic candidates \u2013 her campaign\u2019s count of likely candidates notably doesn\u2019t include Harris.\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t run against Kamala,\u201d a Porter adviser told CNN, \u201cand likely none of the others will either.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Gerrit Cole has reason to be a little despondent. Photo: Brandon Sloter/Getty Images\n\nBecause the Yankees made it to the World Series last October, it\u2019s easy to forget that the team\u2019s fans were close to a full revolt before the 2024 season began. Sure, they had just acquired Juan Soto\u2019s services for a year. But in 2023, the Yankees had just gone 82-80, their worst record since 1992, and had missed the playoffs entirely. Manager Aaron Boone was heading into the final year of his contract; general manager Brian Cashman, who has astonishingly been with the team since 1986 (George Steinbrenner hired him as an intern after running into Cashman\u2019s dad at a horse-racing track), had more than worn out his welcome; the Yankees hadn\u2019t been to the World Series since their current starting shortstop was 8 years old. The natives were restless, and the villagers had their torches and pitchforks at the ready. Pick your metaphor: Fans were on the verge of hysteria.\n\nThen the Yankees went out and reached the World Series thanks largely to an all-world season from Aaron Judge, an almost-as-good year from Soto, and a surprisingly healthy rotation led by Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rod\u00f3n, and Rookie of the Year Luis Gil. Even with everything going just about perfectly, the team won only 94 games \u2014 that\u2019s as many as they won the year they (essentially) fired Joe Torre. They were fortunate to run into two middling American League Central teams in the postseason, but they did make it to the World Series. Yes, they lost to the Dodgers in not-all-that-competitive fashion, but this was still an achievement. Yankees fans did not descend on the Bronx with those pitchforks.\n\nNow, though, they just might.\n\nThe Yankees are still two weeks away from their first game of the 2025 season on Thursday, March 27. And while it\u2019s obviously very early, thus far they are experiencing exactly the opposite dynamic as last year: Everything is going wrong. Gil, the vaunted rookie breakthrough, will miss three months with a lat strain. Slugger Giancarlo Stanton, who was the ALCS MVP last season, has not swung a bat in more than a month because of elbow pain and may still need surgery at some point. Infielder DJ LeMahieu is hurt for the fifth straight year. And last weekend brought the nightmare of all nightmares: Ace Gerrit Cole, the Cy Young winner, the man making more money per season to pitch than anyone ever, reported elbow pain after a subpar Thursday-night spring-training start, receiving a worrying MRI, and is now having Tommy John surgery, which will force him to miss the rest of this season and probably most of the next. Other than Judge, there is no more important player to the Yankees than Cole, and now he\u2019s gone. As is Soto. As is Gil. As is Stanton. As is LeMahieu. Suddenly, the Yankees\u2019 World Series run last year looks less like a return to glory for the empire and more like a dead-cat bounce before the collapse really begins.\n\nThis injury explosion may not be Boone\u2019s or Cashman\u2019s fault directly, though you could make an argument that they seeded this turn of events by retaining so many players in their 30s. It\u2019s telling that after losing Soto, the Yankees spent some of the money they had earmarked for him on the sort of aging former stars who have perpetually gotten the team in trouble. Cody Bellinger (whom they received in a trade with the Cubs) and Paul Goldschmidt are former MVPs, but they are both many years removed from their prime; they don\u2019t add up to half of what the Yankees lost in Soto. The Yankees brought in left-handed starter Max Fried but for an exorbitant price: $218 million for eight years of another guy in his 30s who has thrown more than 175 innings in his career exactly once. (And missed most of 2023 with injury problems and hit the injured list last year as well.) Their only other reliable starter is Rod\u00f3n, notorious for being one of the most regularly injured pitchers in baseball. His track record is so spotty that his relative health in 2024 almost makes you more nervous for him in 2025, not less. The Yankees rotation, which was supposed to be a strength, is in tatters already. One more injury would be catastrophic.\n\nBut the Yankees lineup may be in even worse shape. It was already overly reliant on Judge last year, but with Soto (and Stanton and LeMahieu) gone, he\u2019s now essentially the entire offense. (The fifth-place hitter on this team is \u2026 Jazz Chisholm Jr.?) For all the fanfare about Bellinger and Goldschmidt, they were merely league-average hitters last year; now they\u2019re the only lineup protection Judge has. And here is the third rail of all Yankees talk: There is no assurance that Judge will stay as healthy as he has been the past few seasons. He played 157 games in 2022 and 158 in 2023, his two MVP seasons, but otherwise his career has been littered with injuries \u2014 112 games in 2018, 102 games in 2019, and 106 games in 2023, the last time the Yankees were as reliant on him as they are right now and, not coincidentally, the season in which they won only 82 games. Judge is a massive human being and will turn 33 next month, only two years younger than Stanton (his only real comparison by size), who has long since broken down. The Yankees have danced between the raindrops by avoiding Judge injuries the past few years. They are unlikely to remain so fortunate; it\u2019s only a matter of time. If Judge gets hurt? Forget returning to the World Series. The Yankees would be lucky to avoid last place, a fate they have endured only twice in the past 100 years.\n\nAll of this was avoidable. The Yankees have organizational problems that go beyond their penchant for signing aging stars: Their farm system is eroding, owner Hal Steinbrenner is seemingly more concerned with getting under MLB\u2019s luxury-tax line than winning that elusive 28th championship, and there\u2019s just a certain inertia that comes with a general manager being in the job as long as Cashman has. When the Mets and Steve Cohen outbid them for Soto this offseason \u2014 someone outbidding the Yankees! For one of their own guys! What is the world coming to? \u2014 it was about more than just taking away one of their best players. It was about smelling blood in the water, seeing a once-proud dynasty teetering on the edge of a cliff. The Yankees look as vulnerable right now as they have since \u2026 well, last March. And it sure seems as if Cashman and Boone \u2014 and, potentially, Steinbrenner himself \u2014 won\u2019t have a World Series appearance to bail them out this time. Any more bad news and this could get ugly fast, if it isn\u2019t already. Isn\u2019t spring training supposed to be the most hopeful time of the year?"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration is waging a war against the legal community in the United States with a target list growing by the day.\n\nThus far, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders that have targeted two law firms representing his perceived enemies, and his administration has attacked firms and law schools it says may be violating presidential initiatives against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nThe executive order Trump signed restricting Perkins Coie\u2019s access to classified information and federal buildings and thus hurting its ability to work for some clients is sending shockwaves through the legal establishment nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a president put out a specific order about a law firm,\u201d Ellen Podgor, a Stetson University law professor and legal ethicist, told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking away the ability of an attorney to act in their role as a lawyer,\u201d Podgor added. \u201cThe order to me is \u2026 depriving our whole right to counsel. This is a major amendment to our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s retaliation has been boldly a political response aimed at a group of lawyers and businesses that are known very little in public life outside of Washington. But the implications may be profound, with Trump\u2019s administration positioning itself in direct opposition to major institutions, using its power to quell the work of experienced and influential attorneys.\n\nThe moves also encroach on what the legal community views as a fundamental right for people needing lawyers to have the freedom to choose who represents them \u2014 an ability even Trump had as a criminal defendant being prosecuted by the Justice Department.\n\nThe executive order about Perkins Coie suspends the national security clearances of attorneys at the firm, because it was part of the effort to commission the now-infamous Russia dossier about Trump and his advisers during the 2016 election. The White House says it also may limit the firm\u2019s lawyers from visiting federal buildings and instructed agencies not to hire into government jobs employees from the firm.\n\nPerkins Coie sued on Tuesday, asking the federal court in Washington for emergency help to block Trump\u2019s order against it, and has enlisted another large private law firm to represent it.\n\nA White House aide said Thursday the administration plans to review other law firms\u2019 practices, saying there may be more retribution to come. Trump\u2019s order on Perkins Coie included a call for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review other \u201clarge, influential, or industry leading law firms\u201d in case they offer preferential hiring based on applicants\u2019 races.\n\nIn all, the steps the administration has taken have sent a \u201cchilling\u201d tone across the legal industry, said Cari Brunelle, the founder of a legal advisory firm that works with several large American law firms.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented in our country. \u2026 The message is: Watch where you step,\u201d she said.\n\nIn recent history, the closest comparison to the Trump White House blacklisting some in the legal industry is the approach then-President Richard Nixon took when he made an \u201cenemies list,\u201d Brunelle added.\n\nLaw firms in fear\n\nSo far, law firms have reacted out of fear, Brunelle said. Many want to avoid becoming a target, while others are looking at and rewriting what their websites say, especially regarding their diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which the administration says it is taking into consideration as it considers restricting more firms.\n\nOther lawyers\u2019 security clearances were stripped too in recent weeks by White House order, including those at Washington\u2019s largest private law firm, Covington & Burling, who have been involved in representing former special counsel Jack Smith, now a private citizen.\n\n\u201cAmerican law firms have always represented interests adverse to the US government, without worrying if there would be retribution or sanctions until now,\u201d Brunelle said. \u201cIt\u2019s created just an incredible amount of fear.\u201d (Brunelle\u2019s company doesn\u2019t have Perkins Coie or Covington & Burling as its clients.)\n\nBrunelle said there could be safety in numbers, if many large law firm leaders, law schools and others in the legal industry publicly criticized Trump\u2019s approach. But so far, the response has been muted from law firms themselves.\n\nMarc Elias, a lawyer to the Democrats who until 2021 was Perkins Coie\u2019s primary political law attorney, critiqued the lack of large law firms rallying behind those who lost security clearances in an email newsletter Monday. \u201cThat has not happened,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLaw schools and independent groups that represent the legal community have been bolder in pushing back.\n\nGeorgetown University Law Center responded, for instance, to a letter from the interim US attorney for Washington, DC, threatening not to hire its students if the school\u2019s curriculum wasn\u2019t in line with Trump\u2019s DEI policies.\n\nGraduates attend the Georgetown University Law Center commencement ceremony in Washington, DC, on May 19, 2024. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment, however, guarantees that the government cannot direct what Georgetown and its faculty teach and how to teach it,\u201d Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor wrote last week to Ed Martin.\n\nSeveral prominent national groups have called the Trump administration\u2019s actions hurtful to the rule of law in the US.\n\nThe American College of Trial Lawyers condemned recent statements from Trump\u2019s close adviser Elon Musk that called for the impeachment of some judges.\n\n\u201cWe call upon our Fellows and all lawyers, judges, legislators, executive officials, historians, political scientists, and citizens who value our democracy to speak out and condemn threats to impeach judges because of disagreement with the judge\u2019s lawful orders,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe elite, invitation-only group also responded to the executive orders retaliating against Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling by calling them \u201cescalating\u201d threats and an undermining of the justice system.\n\n\u201cLawyers throughout the country should unite in condemning these actions in the strongest possible terms,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe American Bar Association, a voluntary organization with a large number of America\u2019s lawyers as members, also has been deeply critical of the Trump administration\u2019s actions in recent weeks, with its president, William Bay, saying the approaches are an attack on the rule of law.\n\nThe group has been in the crosshairs of conservatives for years. The Federal Trade Commission last month banned its political appointees from taking leadership positions in the ABA or participating in its events, Bay pointed out. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, in a letter to staff in mid-February, called the group \u201cbeholden to the interests of Big Tech\u201d and a \u201cradical left-wing\u201d organization \u201cguided by the principles of the Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nIn a move with similar results, more than two dozen Justice Department employees who were set to speak at the ABA\u2019s White Collar conference in Miami canceled their plans to attend, the group\u2019s organizer, Raymond Banoun, told CNN.\n\nWhen the ethics panel spoke at the conference Friday, about some of the most political moves by the administration, there were essentially no Justice Department staffers there to hear them.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

            "full_content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nAt two points in his autobiography, \"My Early Life,\" Winston Churchill pauses to reflect on political parties:\n\n\"It is not the slightest use defending government or parties unless you defend the very worst thing about which they are attacked.\"\n\nMuch later in his account of his first 25 years, after he had been elected to Parliament and a group of like-minded young MPs got opposite of a senior figure on his Party\u2019s Front Bench, Joe Chamberlain, they invited Chamberlain to dine. He accepted.\n\nTRUMP TEASES TARIFFS AGAINST MEXICO, CANADA MAY GO HIGHER IN THE FUTURE\n\n\"I am dining in very bad company,\" Chamberlain remarked as he entered. When the young MPs challenged him on what they thought to be a rotten policy, Chamberlain responded, \"What is the use of supporting your own government only when it is right? It is just when it is in this sort of pickle that you ought to have come to our aid.\"\n\nAfter a fine dinner, as Chamberlain took his leave, he paused at the door, \"You young gentlemen have entertained me royally, and in return I will give you a priceless secret. Tariffs! There are the politics of the future, and of the near future. Study them closely and make yourself a masters of them and you will not regret your hospitality to me.\"\n\nChurchill would bolt the Conservatives for the Liberals over protectionism in 1904. He would return to the Tories in 1924. \"Anyone can rat, but it takes a certain amount of ingenuity to re-rat,\" he would declare.\n\nChurchill \"ratted\" over his belief in free trade. He re-ratted because of national security. Let\u2019s skip the drama over tariffs and stay focused on defending the country and the Constitution. Give Trump the time (and the votes in Congress when he needs them) to enact what he ran on. Give the Party and its president a chance. Most Republicans from the Reagan-era have been \"Free Traders,\" just as most of the Lincoln-to-McKinley era Republicans were supporters of tariffs. Many have now settled on the \"tariffs-as-part-of-national-security-good, tariffs as revenue producers bad.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe president of Hillsdale College, Dr. Larry Arnn, likes to say \"The Natural Law does not speak to me on tariffs,\" and in that quip is great wisdom. I leave the field to others, save for full-throated backing of tariffs on the critical goods necessary to the country\u2019s security and health which should be made here in whole or large part, but the supply chains for which are in the People\u2019s Republic of China in shop or critical part. To depend upon the only other superpower for our national security is nuts. President Trump wants to lay on 20% of such goods coming to the U.S. from China? Fine by me, and yes, I know some Americans will pay a price such ad many farmers who sell their products to the vast China market.\n\nI don\u2019t get tariffs on Canada. I do on Mexico. Fentanyl is flowing into the U.S. because of the cartels. The drugs kills tens of thousands of Americans every year. Mexico doesn\u2019t want us striking at cartel operations? Fine. Crush them yourselves, but crush them.\n\nWhich brings us round-a-bout to the big \"Continuing Resolution\" Speaker Johnson unveiled and President Trump endorsed this past weekend.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBravo. I don\u2019t know what is in the 99-page bill save for the beginning of a defense build-up, but it will allow the government to stay open while Trump and the GOP figure out the budget and reconciliation package(s) \u2014there can be one or two. I am in favor of whatever the GOP passes just as I will support the president\u2019s approaches on trade and peace negotiations at least for year one.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a party man. Always have been. Always will be. Parties are the only way to advance political agendas and, in this era, the Republican Party is the only way to protect the Constitution as the Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court and crush the rule of law in the process of doing so. So, yes, join the GOP if you like a free and prospering USA. Don\u2019t like tariffs, or CRs, or pressure on Ukraine? That\u2019s not the point. Trump won, leads the GOP and he is doing exactly what he promised to do.\n\nHugh Hewitt is host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

            "full_content": "Greenlanders will head to the polls to vote in their country\u2019s parliamentary election on Tuesday, in what will likely prove to be a historic vote not because of any seismic shifts within the nation but because of the geopolitical message it will send.\n\nIndependence from Denmark is not on the ballot itself, but who is elected to Greenland\u2019s parliament will signal how the country could move forward in not only divorcing itself from Copenhagen, but in handling what some critics have perceived as threats issued by President Donald Trump.\n\nParliamentary elections on the world\u2019s largest island, a nation of less than 60,000 people, have previously picked up scant coverage due to their relatively low impact on world affairs.\n\nTRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nBut all that changed in January when, ahead of his inauguration, Trump refused to rule out the possibility of \"acquiring\" Greenland through economic or military means and has since repeated his interest in the strategically important island.\n\nWhile the majority of Greenlanders support independence from Denmark, they also align in their opposition to Trump\u2019s ambitions for the island nation.\n\nThere is not a single lawmaker in Greenland that ran for election in this cycle on becoming a part of the U.S., but the leading opposition party known as Naleraq, which currently holds just five of the 31 seats in Greenland\u2019s parliament, may have a solution to achieve independence while also appealing to Trump\u2019s interests.\n\nQupanuk Olsen, a 39-year-old running under the Naleraq party who has garnered a massive social media presence with over a million followers spread over Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, shared a video in January where she addressed questions regarding her opinion on the matter.\n\nWithout directly noting her position on Trump\u2019s ambitions, as she said she wants to keep her social media presence as \"A-political as possible,\" she emphasized her support for expanding Greenland\u2019s partnerships.\n\n\"I strongly believe in Greenland\u2019s independence,\" she went on to say, \"To achieve this we must expand our collaborations and establish business relationships with countries beyond Denmark.\n\n\"We Greenlanders, Kalaallit, deserve to be independent,\" she continued in reference to the Greenlandic Inuit ethnic group. \"And I hope we will strengthen our connections with our fellow Inuit in Canada and Alaska significantly more in the near future.\"\n\nGREENLAND, PANAMA FIERCELY REJECT TRUMP'S AMBITIONS IN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nThough Greenland won self-rule in 1979, with Denmark continuing to oversee issues relating to defense and foreign policy, the Naleraq party has pushed for a swift transition to complete independence.\n\nThe leading opposition party has argued this could be achieved by bolstering existing business opportunities like its fishing industry, as well as by establishing defensive agreements with nations like the U.S., in which it would allow Washington to continue to operate its military interests from the island in exchange for security assurances without becoming a U.S. territory.\n\nThough it remains unclear if such a deal would win over Trump, who could be viewing the Artic nation as an untapped opportunity for its rare earth minerals and oil and gas reserves \u2013 which Greenland has blocked even the EU from accessing.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions over whether expanding ties with Greenland would appease Trump\u2019s ambitions, though on Sunday Trump reiterated his position on the island nation.\n\n\"As I made clear during my Joint Address to Congress, the United States strongly supports the people of Greenland\u2019s right to determine their own future,\" he said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"We will continue to keep you safe, as we have since World War II.\"\n\nTHE HISTORIC IMPORTANCE OF GREENLAND FOR US NATIONAL SECURITY AS DEBATE OVER ISLAND'S FUTURE ROARS ON\n\n\"We are ready to invest billions of dollars to create new jobs and make you rich \u2013 And, if you so choose, we welcome you to be a part of the Greatest Nation anywhere in the World, the United States of America,\" he added.\n\nTrump drew rebuke in some quarters following his address to Congress, where his tone on Greenland was softer than previous remarks, but he concluded by saying, \"One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"\n\nAccording to a January poll, some 85% of Greenlanders oppose Trump\u2019s push to make Greenland a part of the U.S., including Prime Minister Mute Egede, who has been not only a huge proponent of independence from Denmark, but who has also been staunchly opposed to Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland.\n\nEgede\u2019s Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which currently holds 11 seats, is expected to pick up an even greater majority following the Tuesday election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEgede, who has repeatedly told the U.S. president that Greenland is \"not for sale,\" on Monday said Trump\u2019s unpredictability was sowing international chaos.\n\n\"The things that are happening in the world right now worry me quite a lot,\" Egede told Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR). \"There is a world order that is faltering on many fronts, and perhaps a president in the United States who is very unpredictable in a way that makes people feel insecure.\""

            "full_content": "Most people think of government workers as part of a faceless bureaucracy with cushy and clearly useless jobs.\n\nNow it\u2019s true that the federal workforce is bloated and needs to be trimmed. But the politics of Elon Musk\u2019s mass firings are shifting, prompting President Trump to soften his approach to the DOGE campaign.\n\nA major factor in this evolution is the negative media coverage, which Trump follows with great interest. It\u2019s no accident that he said the other day the budget cutbacks should be done with a \"scalpel\" and not a \"sledgehammer.\" He\u2019s acutely attuned to the growing backlash against the massive layoffs\u2013which include 80,000 at Veterans Affairs.\n\nMany of the stories, on television and in print, follow a formula: Lead off with one person who has been booted or negatively impacted by the Musk bros. That puts a face to the story, an actual saddened person whose life has been upended.\n\nConsider this New York Times piece:\n\n\"At the Veterans Affairs hospital in Pittsburgh, researchers spent months preparing for a clinical trial of a new drug to treat advanced cancers of the mouth, throat and voice box.\n\nLATEST TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL SHIFT POWER OVER MANAGING NATURAL DISASTERS OUT OF DC\n\n\"They were ready last month to start enrolling patients \u2014 veterans whose cancer had spread to other tissue and who had run out of treatment options.\n\nThen a problem arose.\n\n\"The hospital was unable to renew the job of a key staff member involved in running the study, a typically routine process thwarted by a hiring freeze imposed under the government-cutting project led by President Trump and Elon Musk. Suddenly, the clinical trial was on hold.\n\n\"\u2018They were ready to enroll,\u2019 said Alanna Caffas, the chief executive of the Veterans Health Foundation, which administers the trials. \u2018They had the lab kits on site. They had the drug to dispense. But they couldn\u2019t get the clinical research coordinator renewed.\u2019\"\n\nHere\u2019s a Washington Post report from Texas:\n\n\"Jaylee Williams needed to find somewhere to deliver her son.\n\nThe 19-year-old knew more about barrel racing on her horse Bet-n-pep than the complicated metrics of who takes what health insurance. But relief for Williams and her boyfriend, Xander Lopez, came when they realized Medina Regional Hospital \u2014 just 15 minutes from their home \u2014 accepted Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers medical costs for lower-income Americans. \"Provider groups an hour away in San Antonio had refused to take the insurance, she recalled while cradling little Ryker. \u2018You never know when something could happen,\u2019 Williams said, with Lopez adding, \u2018I have no idea where we would have gone\u2019 without Medina Regional Hospital.\n\nBut the lifeline that the 25-bed critical-access hospital offered to Williams and Lopez could disappear in Hondo and other communities like it.\"\n\nThat\u2019s because rural hospitals are fearing \"massive Medicaid cuts,\" since they\u2019re so dependent on the federal-state program. Trump says he will not allow cuts to Medicaid, as well as Medicare and Social Security, but that would be the only way Republicans could save a promised $80 billion. Some 72 million people are on Medicaid.\n\nIn the Atlantic, Jonathan Lemire says Trump\u2019s shift on DOGE began on Feb. 19.\n\n\"Jesse Watters, a co-host of the Fox News hit show \u2018The Five\u2019...told a surprisingly emotional story about a friend working at the Pentagon who was poised to lose his job as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. \u2018I finally found one person I knew who got DOGE\u2019d, and it hit me in the heart,\u2019 said Watters, who urged his Fox colleagues to \u2018be a little bit less callous.\u2019...\n\n\"Trump watched the clip and asked advisers if it was resonating with his base of supporters, according to one of three White House officials I spoke with for this story.\"\n\nLemire adds that \"over the ensuing weeks, the president grew unhappy with the television coverage of cuts affecting his voters, according to two of those officials, while the White House fielded calls from Cabinet members and Republican lawmakers frustrated by Elon Musk.\"\n\nMUSK VOWS TO TRACE HACKERS BEHIND 'MASSIVE CYBERATTACK' CRIPPLING X SOCIAL MEDIA SITE\n\nTrump decreed that agency heads should make the layoffs and cutbacks, and Musk should step in only if they fail to take action. The move also may be aimed at the various lawsuits against Trump, since Musk is only supposed to be an adviser and not a government employee.\n\nTensions have been rising behind the scenes (as well as publicly at town hall meetings, to the point that the GOP urged its members to stop holding the events). As the Times reports:\n\n\"Marco Rubio was incensed. Here he was in the Cabinet Room of the White House, the Secretary of State, seated beside the president and listening to a litany of attacks from the richest man in the world.\n\nSeated diagonally opposite, across the elliptical mahogany table, Elon Musk was letting Mr. Rubio have it, accusing him of failing to slash his staff.\n\nYou have fired \u2018nobody,\u2019 Mr. Musk told Mr. Rubio, then scornfully added that perhaps the only person he had fired was a staff member from Mr. Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubio\u2019s control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting on Thursday in front of President Trump and around 20 others \u2014 details of which have not been reported before \u2014 Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest.\n\nMr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement in buyouts? Didn\u2019t they count as layoffs? He asked, sarcastically, whether Mr. Musk wanted him to rehire all those people just so he could make a show of firing them again. Then he laid out his detailed plans for reorganizing the State Department.\n\n\"Mr. Musk was unimpressed. He told Mr. Rubio he was \u2018good on TV,\u2019 with the clear subtext being that he was not good for much else.\"\n\nThe president, who eventually defended Musk, has denied that such a confrontation took place. \"ELON AND MARCO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. ANY STATEMENT OTHER THAN THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!!\" he posted.\n\nAnother source of conflict involves Steve Bannon, the former campaign chief and White House official whose \"War Room\" podcast is hugely influential with the MAGA crowd.\n\n\"In mid-February,\" says a story co-authored by Maggie Haberman, \"the president told Mr. Bannon that he wanted him to lay off the attacks on Mr. Musk and for the two men to sit down privately, according to two people familiar with the comments.\"\n\nBannon has, among other things, called Musk a \"parasitic illegal immigrant\" and \"truly evil person.\" Bannon said last month that he and Musk \"have a chasm that is probably insurmountable.\"\n\nMusk has fired back on the X platform he has transformed: \"Bannon is a great talker, but not a great doer. What did he get done this week? Nothing.\"\n\nAOC VOWS TO TURN UP THE HEAT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH RALLIES ON HIS HOME TURF\n\nThe proposed meeting hasn\u2019t taken place, and may never happen.\n\nMore important than the backstage sniping is Trump\u2019s softening on the DOGE crusade as the human toll becomes clear.\n\nOne thing Trump hasn\u2019t talked about, and this is directly related to his tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, is the stock market, with the Dow plunging thousands of points in recent days.\n\nThe president told Fox\u2019s Maria Bartiromo that you can\u2019t look at the stock market, though he loves to boast about it when it\u2019s going up.\n\nOn her Sunday show, Bartiromo asked Trump if he expected a recession this year.\n\n\"I hate to predict things like that,\" he said. \"There is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big.\"\n\nIn journalese, this became TRUMP REFUSES TO RULE OUT RECESSION, though all he did was dodge the question. (But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on \"Meet the Press\" that \"there\u2019s going to be no recession in America.\")\n\nThe DOGE reputation has also been tarnished by an appalling series of mistakes. Musk has acknowledged firing the Ebola prevention team and having to hire them back. He also ousted bird flu experts and those responsible for maintenance of nuclear weapons, and had to hire them back.\n\nAnd the Musk gang has been caught claiming savings by ending contracts that actually expired years ago.\n\nWould this track record be deemed acceptable in the private sector?\n\nTesla stock, meanwhile, has been plummeting for days, along with the market, including a 16 percent drop yesterday. Musk\u2019s net worth has sunk by $121 billion since mid-December, according to Forbes. But fear not, he\u2019s still the world\u2019s richest man.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen X suffered a global outage for hours yesterday, it seemed like a metaphor for Elon Musk\u2019s woes. He later said the site once called Twitter had been hit by a \"massive cyberattack.\"\n\nSlashing government jobs, with identifiable victims, just isn\u2019t the same as laying off software engineers, and the backlash was inevitable. That\u2019s why Donald Trump is tapping the brakes on the entire effort."

(AP Photo/Dylan Lovan)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- With a new distillery set to open soon, the makers of Brough Brothers bourbon in Kentucky were ready to put their business plan into action. They were looking to ramp up whiskey production to break into lucrative new markets in Canada and Europe.\n\nNow the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs has disrupted those plans.\n\nEfforts by the Black-owned distiller to gain a foothold in Canada are on hold, as are plans to break into Germany and France, said Brough Brothers Distillery CEO Victor Yarbrough. That's because the iconic American spirit's widening global appeal is caught in the crossfire of trade conflicts instigated by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d said Yarbrough, who started the Louisville distilling company with his brothers, Bryson and Chris. \u201cWe are collateral damage.\u201d\n\nFor distillers looking to sell to consumers of all political stripes, talking politics can be as distasteful as discussing Prohibition. But along with the turmoil and uncertainty over tariffs, bourbon makers and other U.S. firms trying to do business in Canada are confronting public relations challenges still reverberating from the president's blunt-force \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to international relations.\n\nWith Canadian hockey fans booing the U.S. national anthem and some liquor stores north of the border clearing American spirits from their shelves even before there\u2019s clarity over tariffs, businesses like Brough Brothers are watching to see how the trade conflict plays out.\n\nIn the building being converted into the new distillery near the Ohio River, drywall dust covers the floor of the project that the brothers hope will raise the company's profile in the ultra-competitive bourbon world.\n\n\u201cI believe there\u2019s going to be some type of repair of the relationships that needs to happen,\" said Yarbrough, who was hoping, before the trade war erupted, to introduce his bourbon in New Brunswick and later expand to Ontario and other parts of Canada. \"So I think some type of media blitz, PR blitz is definitely going to have to take place.\u201d\n\nThe trade wars pose an immediate threat to an American-made success story, built on the growing worldwide taste for bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and other products.\n\nKentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said the president's zig-zagging tariff policy is hurting the American economy and will lead to higher consumer prices while disrupting business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the imposition of tariffs, it\u2019s this month-to-month, \u2018I may do it to you at any moment\u2019 policy,\u201d said Beshear, a potential presidential candidate in 2028. \u201cYou can't create stability.\u201d\n\nTrump on Thursday postponed 25% tariffs on some imports from Canada for a month amid fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. Yarbrough said his company's expansion plans are still in limbo.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change our situation,\" he said. \u201cJust as quickly as it changed to a reprieve, it could just as quickly turn into next month that we\u2019re back on.\u201d\n\nFor an industry that has to plan well into the future, based on aging its whiskey products, such angst is widespread in Kentucky, which produces 95% of the world's bourbon supply. At this point even a delay in tariffs wouldn't alleviate the practical problems confronting U.S. whiskey makers.\n\n\u201cThe issue for us is long-term planning, and a postponement does nothing for us in long-term planning except leaves it still up in the air,\" said Judy Hollis Jones, president and CEO of Buzzard's Roost in Louisville, which sells to two provinces in Canada and has been looking to expand.\n\n\u201cMaybe other people adapt to it easier than I do, but I tend to like some certainty,\" Jones said.\n\nThe Kentucky Distillers' Association says the newest trade conflicts feel like deja vu. The industry group has long sounded the alarm that tariffs and retaliatory levies would wreak havoc on the spirits industry. Along with the North American trade dispute, the European Union is set to reinstate a tariff by April 1 on American whiskey if nothing is done to head it off.\n\nThat trans-Atlantic dispute is a reprise of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on European steel and aluminum. The EU\u2019s retaliatory tariff caused American whiskey exports to the EU to plunge 20%, costing distillers more than $100 million in revenue from 2018 to 2021, the Distilled Spirits Council says. Once the tariff was suspended, EU sales rebounded for American distillers.\n\nNow, Europe's infatuation with Kentucky bourbon and other U.S. spirits is threatened by the potential 50% tariff \u2014 double the previous levy \u2014 that would inflict \"irreparable harm to distillers large and small,\u201d said Chris Swonger, the council\u2019s CEO.\n\nTariffs amount to a tax, which whiskey producers can either absorb in reduced profits or pass along to customers through higher prices \u2014 and risk losing market share in highly competitive markets. In 2024, the EU was by far the largest export market for U.S. distilled spirits, followed by Canada, the council said.\n\nTrump maintains that open trade has cost the U.S. millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to American-made prosperity.\n\nLarge distillers possess the capital and market reach to ride out disruptions caused by tariffs \u2014 built-in luxuries that most small producers don't have.\n\nCanada accounts for just 1% of total sales for Brown-Forman Corp., the maker of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and the Louisville-based company could withstand disruptions there, said its CEO, Lawson Whiting.\n\nBut Whiting said the decision by Canadian provinces to take American products off store shelves is \u201cworse than a tariff because it\u2019s literally taking your sales away.\u201d He called it \u201ca very disproportionate response to a 25% tariff.\u201d\n\nThe threat of a prolonged trade war has Brough Brothers exploring other options. They could lean harder into domestic sales or look for other markets overseas \u2014 but again, it's hard to plan.\n\n\u201cTalking about this is starting to make my head hurt,\u201d Yarbrough said.\n\nFor Tom Bard, another Kentucky craft distiller, the risk is that all his hard work to gain a foothold in Canada could evaporate due to the cross-border trade conflict.\n\nBard and his wife, Kim, own The Bard Distillery in Muhlenberg County in western Kentucky. Their products had penetrated British Columbia and Alberta, but a new purchase order for north of the border is on hold amid Trump's ever-changing trade war.\n\n\u201cThat hurts,\u201d Bard said. \u201cFor a small distillery like us, where every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference, that\u2019s huge for us.\u201d\n\nBard said his team invested heavily to break into Canada, where business grew so quickly that he had hoped it would account for at least 25% of his overall sales this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to ship as much of it as we can to Canada,\u201d Bard said. \u201cWe just expanded our distillery to take advantage of all the global demand for our products. What we hate is that once we get this equipment online this year, that we won\u2019t be able to run it full throttle because we\u2019ll be afraid to put too much inventory away not knowing what\u2019s going to happen.\"\n\nThe dispute needs to be resolved before Canadian distributors will risk accepting shipments of American spirits, he said.\n\nBard plans to ramp up domestic distribution to try to make up for lost sales in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re small-business Americans, so we\u2019re going to make it work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be nice to not have these roadblocks.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\n\nNUUK, Greenland -- The single polling station in Greenland \u2019s capital city is ready.\n\nThis big Arctic island with a tiny population holds early parliamentary elections Tuesday that are being closely watched. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear he wants to take control of the region that occupies a strategic North Atlantic location and contains rare earth minerals key to driving the global economy.\n\nTrump\u2019s overtures aren\u2019t on the ballot, but they are on everyone\u2019s minds.\n\nThis self-governing region of Denmark is home to 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds. It has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009. Now, Greenlanders are debating the best way to ensure they control their future.\n\n\u201cI think most of us have been scared since the new year because of (Trump\u2019s) interest,\u201d Pipaluk Lynge, a member of parliament from the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit, or United Inuit party, told The Associated Press. \u201cSo we\u2019re really, really looking to Europe right now to see if we could establish a stronger bond with them to secure our sovereign nation.\u201d\n\nOpinion polls show most Greenlanders favor independence.\n\nMost say they don\u2019t dislike Americans, pointing to the good relations they have with the local Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, where U.S. military personnel have been stationed since 1951.\n\nBut Greenlanders show no sign of wanting to become Americans. Even some of Trump\u2019s biggest fans cling to the principle that they should control their destiny. That includes Gerth Josefsen, a 53-year-old fisherman from Nuuk who sports a MAGA hat and is proud to have visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida home.\n\nTheir mantra is that Greenland is open for business, but not for sale.\n\n\u201cThe situation has changed because of Trump and because of the world,\u201d said Doris Jensen, representative of the social democratic Siumut party who said she has always favored independence, \u201cSo we have decided in our party that we have to do (it) more quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attention has transformed the deeply local process of democracy. Suddenly, the presence of journalists from as far away as Japan and Croatia are reminders that these are far from normal times.\n\nAfter candidates\u2019 final televised debate at a school auditorium in Nuuk, Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede was greeted by about 75 supporters who were almost outnumbered by photographers and cameramen.\n\n\u201cAll these reporters are frightening to us,\u2019\u2019 said Aviaja Sinkbaek, who works at the school. \u201cIt means that something must be happening soon.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI wonder what Trump has up his sleeve.\u201d\n\nPolitics in Greenland have a different rhythm. Debates during campaigning rarely got heated. People who became too animated were asked to step outside. Issues included building a skilled workforce and how to decorate the new airport, which opened a runway long enough to handle jumbo jets in November.\n\nOn Tuesday, the capital\u2019s lone polling station at the Nuuk sports hall will have political parties pitching tents outside, with campaigners offering hot drinks and Greenlandic cake -- a raisin-laced bread served with butter -- in hopes of swaying voters.\n\nA bus will circle the city of about 20,000 people, offering rides.\n\nUnofficial election results should be available soon after polls close, but they won\u2019t be certified for weeks as ballot papers make their way to the capital from remote settlements by boat, plane and helicopter.\n\nThat\u2019s because there are no roads connecting communities across the island\u2019s 2.16 million square kilometers (836,330 square miles), which make Greenland the world\u2019s 12th biggest country.\n\nNow the vast size has drawn outsize attention.\n\nGreenlanders know what they have. They hope the rare earth minerals will help diversify an economy where government jobs account for 40% of employment.\n\nBut the government has imposed strict rules to protect the environment on the island, most of which is covered by ice year-round. The harsh atmospheric conditions raise questions about whether extracting them is commercially feasible.\n\nHurricane-strength gusts over the weekend triggered warnings for boats and building materials to be securely tied down. As the wind howled like a revving jet engine, local people retreated to their homes to play board games."

InfoWars founder Alex Jones called White a \u201cone-of-a-kind man who poured his devotion into anything he did.\u201d\n\nShortly before Midnight on Sunday, Austin police officers responded to a \u201cshoot/stab hotshot\u201d call at an apartment complex in the 2300 block of Douglas Street. Responding officers found a male in the parking lot with \u201cobvious signs of trauma,\u201d KXAN NBC reported. EMS crews transported the man to a local hospital, where he died a short time later from his wounds.\n\nAustin Detective Leah Ratliff told reporters that officers attempted to save the man\u2019s life but he died at 12.19 a.m on Monday. She said it was unclear what kind of injuries caused his death. Police are investigating the death as the city\u2019s eighth homicide of the year.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, InfoWars founder Alex Jones identified the slain man as his reporter, Jamie White. \u201cJamie was a light we were blessed to experience as much as we did,\u201d Jones said while announcing the news. \u201cHe\u2019s a one-of-a-kind man who poured his devotion into anything he did.\u201d\n\nJones blamed White\u2019s murder, in part, on the policies of \u201cSoros Austin, TX D.A. Jose Garza.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pledge that Jamie\u2019s tragic death will not be in vain, and those responsible for this senseless violence will be brought to justice,\u201d Jones stated. He pledged to carry on \u201cJamie\u2019s important work.\u201d\n\nMediaite quoted more from Jones broadcast announcing White\u2019s death:\n\nWe sent some people over this morning when he didn\u2019t answer the phone because he\u2019s always here early, loves to work, loves to fight tyranny, loves to promote freedom, and when they got to the apartment complex there was yellow tape everywhere, blood all over the parking lot. Jones continued, \u201cI\u2019m gonna talk about in a moment who I hold responsible for this, and who is responsible for this, and who are accomplices to Jamie and so many others\u2019 murder,\u201d before describing Garza \u2013 whose campaign for district attorney was funded by billionaire Democratic Party donor George Soros \u2013 as \u201ceven worse than Alvin Bragg\u201d and \u201cprobably the worst in the country.\u201d\n\nJones said police told InfoWars that they have some suspects. \u201cI\u2019m gonna leave it at that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to tell us whether it was a stabbing or a shooting. I can just tell you that from the amount of blood I heard, it was serious.

            "full_content": "In a rare and candid discussion, conservative firebrand Michael Savage sat down with Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom for a conversation on his new podcast that defied expectations, covering a wide range of topics \u2014 from the state of San Francisco to the future of the Democratic Party \u2014 offering sharp disagreements but also moments of surprising common ground.\n\nAn exclusive sneak peek provided to Breitbart News in advance offers a glimpse into the soon-to-be-released interview where Savage takes the seat as the second guest on the governor\u2019s This Is Gavin Newsom podcast, where no topic appears to be off-limits.\n\nPolitical Divides and JFK\u2019s Influence\n\nDespite their ideological differences, the iconic right-wing commentator and Democratic California governor acknowledged their decades-long acquaintance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other over the course on and off for a couple decades now, right?\u201d Newsom remarked.\n\nSavage, in turn, reflected on how John F. Kennedy inspired him as a young man.\n\n\u201cI loved JFK. He was one of my heroes \u2026 \u2018Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country\u2019 \u2014 that put steel in my spine; I wanted to go out and march into something for my country,\u201d Savage recalled, as they criticized modern politics for losing that sense of responsibility.\n\nBorders, Language, and Culture\n\nReasserting his long-standing mantra, \u201cBorders, language, culture,\u201d Savage \u2014 citing historical examples \u2014 argued that without these, a nation ceases to exist. Newsom countered, touting California\u2019s efforts to support border enforcement, claiming he deployed nearly 400 National Guard members to supplement border security.\n\n\u201cWe put down almost 400 \u2026 National Guards since the week I first became governor to supplement and support Customs and Border Patrol at the border,\u201d he stated.\n\nHowever, Savage actually voiced support for long-term undocumented workers, saying, \u201cI know of a person who was here 20 years from Mexico. He\u2019s worked seven days a week, he\u2019s paid taxes, he can\u2019t become a citizen. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nNewsom agreed, adding that \u201c67 percent of people that are here without documentation in California have been here for ten-plus years \u2026 and paying taxes.\u201d\n\nHealth and Nutrition\n\nTurning to Savage\u2019s background in nutritional ethnomedicine, Savage detailed his academic journey.\n\n\u201cI earned [my PhD] in two years and seven months, which is a world record,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe also criticized what he saw as discrimination in academia: \u201cI was rejected from every position I applied for. And I was told point blank \u2014 we can\u2019t hire you because we have to fill quotas.\u201d\n\nSavage lamented the state of the healthcare system, sharing a personal story of being delayed in a hospital ER while suffering a heart attack.\n\n\u201cI have to wait in line. It\u2019s filled with illegal aliens, and the girl at the desk makes me wait,\u201d he stated. \u201cI said [to her], \u2018I\u2019m dying, do you understand?\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsom responded by defending California\u2019s approach, emphasizing preventative care.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we do preventative care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have a different approach.\u201d\n\nClimate Change and Science\n\nSavage dismissed mainstream climate concerns as \u201ctotal bullshit,\u201d citing the Vostok ice core samples.\n\n\u201cThere were carbon dioxide increases millennia ago, but they always followed temperature increases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t cause the temperature increases.\u201d\n\nNewsom countered by pointing to extreme weather patterns, saying, \u201cWe had a three-year historic drought \u2014 the most significant drought in California\u2019s history since statehood \u2014 and it ended in three weeks with the wettest three weeks since statehood.\u201d\n\nHowever, Savage remained skeptical, insisting that climate change has always occurred naturally.\n\n\u201cIn 1872, it was so hot in the state of California before there was the first internal combustion engine, the cornfields exploded in the Sacramento Valley from a heat wave,\u201d he stated.\n\nCrime and San Francisco\u2019s Decline\n\nSavage described a turning point for his relationship with San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI was having dinner in North Beach, and a man comes by \u2014 if you want to call him that \u2014 takes his pants down and defecates outside the window in the street,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwithout civility, there could be no civil order in a country.\u201d\n\nNewsom acknowledged the crisis but defended the city\u2019s efforts, saying, \u201cThe homeless population \u2026 it\u2019s not a static environment \u2026 It\u2019s been decades.\u201d\n\nHowever, Savage argued for a more forceful approach, offering his own \u201csolution\u201d to the issue.\n\n\u201cYou build camps for them in places outside cities and you give them the care that they need \u2014 against their will,\u201d he suggested.\n\nNewsom countered that California was already addressing this issue, citing recent reforms, including having \u201cstrengthened the conservatorship law so we can begin to get people off the streets.\u201d\n\nThe Future of the Democratic Party\n\nAsked what the Democratic Party needed to learn from recent political shifts, Savage pointed to what he saw as the party\u2019s alienation of working-class voters.\n\n\u201cThe thing that triggered most of the people who turned against the Democrat party was this incessant drumbeat, going back years, vilifying the white male,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018White supremacy,\u2019 \u2018white supremacy,\u2019 \u2018white supremacy.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also cited the influence of gender ideology in schools as a turning point.\n\n\u201cThe trans issue triggered the women who were normally liberal,\u201d Savage said. \u201cBut when you have kids being brainwashed in school to accept that stuff into kindergarten \u2014 hey, I\u2019m a sexual libertarian, I really don\u2019t care what people do to make themselves happy \u2014 but leave the kids alone.\u201d\n\nTrump and Savage\u2019s Influence\n\nSavage claimed that many of President Donald Trump\u2019s key talking points were inspired by his own work, with one of Trump\u2019s advisers \u201cexplicitly telling me: \u2018We took all of your books [and] we made talking points. He ran on your platform.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalling himself \u201cthe father of a lot of what [Trump\u2019s] doing,\u201d he expressed frustration at not being formally recognized for his influence, saying, \u201cNo one called me from the White House and said, \u2018We want to give you the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe conversation was marked with mutual respect, despite the sharp debates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with you, nor you with me, for us to sit and have civilized conversations,\u201d Savage noted. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to solve the problems of the state and of the country\u2019s rights, and I feel the same thing about the country itself: the left and the right are at each other\u2019s throats. They hate each other, and they would like me not to have been on this podcast and be screaming and yelling like a foaming idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get nowhere with that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s idiotic, idiotic.\u201d\n\nNewsom agreed, adding that that is \u201cthe whole point\u201d of these discussions.\n\nThe full interview, which offers a fascinating glimpse into two towering figures from opposite ends of the political spectrum, engaging in the kind of frank discussion rarely seen in today\u2019s divided climate, is scheduled to be released Tuesday.\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The law is designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five individuals who challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the act.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDozens of people have been reported killed after US President Donald Trump ordered \u201cdecisive\u201d military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen, opening a new salvo against the Iran-backed group that has targeted shipping lanes in the Red Sea.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the US would deploy \u201coverwhelming lethal force\u201d against the Houthis \u201cuntil we have achieved our objective,\u201d signaling the start of a major operation that could last weeks and prompting the Houthis to warn of escalation.\n\nThe US strikes killed at least 53 people and wounded almost 100 others in Yemen, including women and children, the Houthi-run health ministry said according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe strikes killed \u201cmultiple\u201d Houthi leaders, according to US national security adviser Michael Waltz. They were an \u201coverwhelming response,\u201d Waltz told ABC News, adding that they were also aimed at \u201cholding Iran responsible\u201d for supporting the Houthis.\n\nOn Sunday, the Houthis claimed to have launched 18 missiles and drones at the American aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman in the northern Red Sea in response to \u201cAmerican aggression.\n\n\u201cIf they continue their aggression, we will continue the escalation,\u201d the group\u2019s leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said.\n\nAccording to two US officials, there were no injuries or damage on the Truman, and it is not clear from initial assessment whether the carrier had to intercept any launches.\n\nThe Houthis, based in Yemen, started launching drone and missile strikes on vessels in the Red Sea in late 2023 in what they say is revenge for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The sustained strikes significantly impacted global trade.\n\nThe Houthis stopped their attacks when a Gaza ceasefire was declared in January, but have since threatened to resume them due to Israeli aid blockages to Gaza.\n\nIn his post, Trump accused the group of waging \u201can unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.\u201d\n\nHe said US personnel were carrying out aerial attacks on Houthi bases, leaders and missile defenses \u201cto protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nFurther actions after Saturday will depend on battle damage assessments from this series of strikes, a US defense official told CNN. But there is expected to be more action against the Houthis over the next several weeks.\n\nTrump also delivered a warning for Iran, the Houthis\u2019 main backer, saying it must \u201cimmediately\u201d end support for the group. He warned that if Iran threatened the American people or their president, \u201cAmerica will hold you fully accountable and, we won\u2019t be nice about it!\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi hit back in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe United States Government has no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEnd support for Israeli genocide and terrorism. Stop killing of Yemeni people.\u201d\n\nThere were fatalities in Yemen\u2019s capital Sanaa, according to the health ministry, as well as the northern province of Saada.\n\nPeople gather at the site of a house hit by a strike in Saada, Yemen, March 16, on Sunday. Naif Rahma/Reuters\n\nIn Saada, strikes targeted a power station in the city of Dahyan, causing a power outage in the city and its suburbs, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.\n\nStrikes also targeted Houthi military sites in Yemen\u2019s southwestern city of Taiz, Reuters reported, citing two witnesses.\n\nThe Houthis\u2019 political bureau condemned the US strikes as a \u201cwar crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation,\u201d it said in a statement seen by Reuters.\n\nTrump approved the Houthi strike plan \u2014 which he requested be drawn up several weeks ago \u2014 late last week, and the final order was given on Saturday to begin what officials describe as a sustained attack on the group\u2019s positions in Yemen.\n\nA larger campaign of strikes took time to organize and plan because the US had to collect the intelligence necessary for more sweeping attacks against the Houthis. A senior military official recently told CNN the intel collection required for broader strikes had been completed.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the strikes with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, stressing that Houthi attacks \u201cwill not be tolerated,\u201d according to a readout from the State Department. Last summer, Russia was prepared to deliver weapons to the Houthis but pulled back following pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement that Lavrov \u201cemphasized the need for an immediate cessation of the use of force\u201d in Yemen in the phone call.\n\nThe US has been working to degrade Houthi capabilities for months as the entity worked to disrupt international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways, calling the attacks a response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza against Hamas. The group has targeted more than 100 ships and vessels, including with drones, missiles and small ships.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump pictured as military strikes are launched against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday. White House/Reuters\n\nThe Biden administration sought to respond by carrying out targeted strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen, including attacking underground weapons storage facilities in October and November, but the actions did not prevent further attacks.\n\n\u201cThis is not a one off. This is the beginning of an ongoing series of events that will last days if not weeks,\u201d a source familiar with the strategy told CNN. \u201cThere is not and will not be an invasion or troops on ground. But there will be a series of ongoing strategic targeted attacks.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Trump signed an order designating the Houthis a \u201cforeign terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nTrump, in his message, said the Biden administration\u2019s approach to the Houthis was \u201cpathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON\u2019T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!\u201d he said.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alayna Treene, Oren Liebermann , Sophie Tanno, Maria Kostenko and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemocrats have long found the flip phone Chuck Schumer still insists on using as an endearing quirk that illustrates how committed he is to his way of talking to all sorts of allies, all the time.\n\nAfter how he handled the spending fight, many inside and outside the Capitol are starting to see that phone as a metaphor for a leader who\u2019s out of date and refusing to change as politics changes radically around him.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that members of the caucus expressed frustration that he wasn\u2019t as inclusive as he could have been on decision making or strategy, but the stakes of this particular vote were huge,\u201d said one Senate Democrat, who like others, is still wary of going public with attacks on the leader.\n\nBut CNN\u2019s conversations with three-dozen Democratic senators, members of the House, top aides and other prominent leaders detail a cratering of support, with many starting to feel that he can\u2019t be the party\u2019s future and shouldn\u2019t be their present.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t lose it between now and then, he won\u2019t be leader in two years,\u201d said another Democratic senator, who added, looking ahead to the next expected Congressional showdown, \u201che can\u2019t be trusted alone to negotiate the debt limit.\u201d\n\nIn a video he blasted out to his supporters Friday night, longtime Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 an independent who caucuses with the Democrats \u2014 called the situation \u201can absolute failure of Democratic leadership.\u201d In a video he blasted out to his own supporters, freshman California Sen. Adam Schiff called it \u201ca bad day for our country \u2013 and for the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchumer tried to be too smart,\u201d said another Democratic senator, \u201cbut he ended up looking indecisive.\u201d\n\nSchumer and the nine Democrats who voted with him on Friday say they were making the responsible decision between two horrible choices. Option one: advance a bill full of major cuts and leeway for Trump\u2019s administration to reallocate billions of funds for their own purposes. Option two: enable a shutdown which could have stretched on indefinitely while Trump officials flexed executive authority over spending in ways they would find even more devastating, not to mention leaving tens of thousands of federal workers without pay and millions more without services.\n\nBut critics from across traditional Democratic divides of ideology, geography and age see a pile of excuses and false choices. They say Schumer flubbed weeks of strategy, essentially negotiating with himself for less to make the final bill worse than they could have gotten it to be with better pushback. They say he mismanaged dynamics internally with colleagues and publicly so that he ended up delivering a fresh round of dejection to a party already slumping on the ropes.\n\nAny Democrat paying attention knew this week of negotiations was going to be terrible for them. But, many say, it was Schumer\u2019s leadership that left them looking and feeling even worse\u2014and with much less leverage for future fight, now that Senate Republicans saw how easy it was to write what Trump wants into the bills, make no effort to reach out to Democrats, and watch them be the ones to attack each other.\n\n\u201cRepublicans saw Democrats were weak, and thought, \u2018We\u2019re going to call your bluff\u2019\u2014and they were right,\u201d said a top aide to one Senate Democrat. \u201cThis was always going to be no-win. But it didn\u2019t have to be this much of an \u2018L\u2019.\u201d\n\nLosing some faith in the Senate, much more outside the Senate\n\nAs Trump got exactly the bill he wanted while losing only two Republican votes combined between the House and Senate, Schumer has lost faith among several of his Democratic senators for being able to manage the fights ahead. He left several of his own senators distrusting others in their own caucus. Several Democratic governors, who have privately been knocking Schumer as inept for weeks, finished Friday feeling more validated than they ever wanted to be.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) (L) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) walk together as they leave a press conference introducing the Stop The Steal Act at the U.S. Capitol on February 04, 2025 in Washington, DC. The legislation, according to the Democratic leadership, is designed to combat Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) by preventing unlawful access to the Treasury Department's payment systems. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was not just frustrated by what played out, but annoyed that Schumer\u2014who otherwise calls multiple times a day to check in on everything from strategy to tweets\u2014barely talked to him about any of this over the last few weeks, according to several House Democratic sources. Always deliberate with his words, the only answer the fellow New Yorker would give on Friday when asked by CNN if he thought a change in Senate leadership was needed was, \u201cnext question.\u201d\n\nOutside the Capitol, many Democratic assessments of Schumer are much harsher.\n\n\u201cDemocrats need a leader who is up to the moment both in terms of willingness to fight and ability to communicate about that willingness to fight. I don\u2019t think at this point Senator Schumer has had either,\u201d said Amanda Litman, the co-founder of the group Run for Something, which helps younger and newer Democratic candidates put together campaigns on the local level.\n\nA leader of a major Democratic-aligned organization, for now reluctant to exacerbate the party fractures by speaking publicly, said Schumer has now made himself irrelevant.\n\n\u201cThe biggest impact of this last week is that from now on, the broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, from the center to the left, will be looking to the House for leadership,\u201d that person told CNN on Friday afternoon.\n\nSchumer believes he\u2019s the one really grappling with the reality of Trump\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to the press as they stand next to a Tesla vehicle on the South Portico of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSchumer sees what he did, by contrast, as truly grappling with how different Trump is as a president now, versus when they had their showdown fights in his first term. Then, Schumer said repeatedly in conversations, Trump wasn\u2019t looking for pretexts to fire federal government workers. Then, Schumer also said, Republican leaders in Congress were trying to avoid a shutdown, while now he saw them as egging one on in a way that he feared meant they wouldn\u2019t have allowed government to re-open anytime soon.\n\n\u201cOnce you shut down the government, it is totally up to DOGE and Trump and Musk how long we\u2019re in shutdown,\u201d Schumer said in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN on Friday evening. \u201cWe could have been in shutdown for months, and why did Musk and Trump want to shut down? Because they wanted this power to achieve their goal of dramatically shrinking, destroying, hurting innocent people in the government.\u201d\n\nSo Schumer\u2019s thinking going into the week, several people familiar with it told CNN, was trying to avoid letting House Speaker Mike Johnson use him as a foil\u2014being clearer with his position, the Senate leader thought, would make it easier to line up House Republican votes. He also felt he was giving Jeffries the maximum amount of space to unite against the bill. And he figured this Republican leadership wouldn\u2019t make any real concessions on the bill no matter what he did.\n\nFor three days in a row leading up to the vote, Schumer held long lunch meetings for the Senate Democrats to air their grievances and opinions about what to do. To many of the senators stewing and steaming through them, this felt like not having a strategy\u2014to the point that one senator, according to a colleague, spoke up to say that even former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, despite being constantly mutinied against by his own Republican colleagues, managed to get a meeting with then-President Joe Biden during their 2023 debt limit fight.\n\nSchumer has told allies he saw these lunches as his strategy, trying to let colleagues coalesce around which of the bad options they felt was worse by arguing with each other, but without his twisting arms either way. He didn\u2019t want a shutdown. He felt like Democrats would lose the political fight over one. But he says he wanted his colleagues to get there themselves.\n\nHe also called multiple senators into his office to tell them they had to convince particular colleagues to vote yes, and urged several leaders of Democratic-leaning organizations to tamp down their rhetoric pushing for a shutdown.\n\nAnd when Schumer announced his own yes vote, it was not just within a day of floating an alternative strategy\u2014he even surprised one of his closest allies, according to multiple senators: Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and far from a standard resistance figure. She ended up voting no.\n\nHouse Democrats were bewildered themselves by the suggestion that Schumer was doing them any favors. Several joined the nearly unanimous Democratic vote against the Republican budget bill not because they wanted a shutdown, but because they thought they were giving the Senate more leverage. Others were convinced that they needed to be part of a unified Democratic effort.\n\nSeveral close to Jeffries himself, meanwhile, scoff at Schumer\u2019s suggesting that House Democrats didn\u2019t think Johnson would pass the bill, arguing the senator doesn\u2019t get how much obedience to Trump has come to define Republicans in Congress. They think Schumer never understood Jeffries\u2019s strategy was to push for the fight since he was convinced Democrats could win, and worried about the policy and political consequences of putting a rubber stamp on the Republican bill.\n\nAt a panel of union leaders at their retreat, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro asked them to call Schumer to remind him that they supported a \u201cNo\u201d vote. Several did. Schumer told those he spoke with he still felt confident he was right.\n\nLater in that same strategy session, another House Democrat vented more broadly: \u201cWhat\u2019s Chuck Schumer thinking?\u201d\n\nAnother voice shouted back from the crowd, \u201cOf himself!\u201d\n\nMany members started to clap and cheer, according to two people in the room.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is broken,\u201d one House Democratic member told CNN. \u201cThe anger is so strong right now that the future is hard to imagine.\u201d\n\nDemocrats struggle to see Schumer as majority leader ever again\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, speaks during a news conference following the weekly Senate Democrat policy luncheon at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. The House is scheduled to vote on a six-month spending bill that would make sure the whole government doesn't shut down, interrupting the fast start of President Donald Trump's second watch. Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSchumer\u2019s fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who in 2017 stood out for voting against every one of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, by Thursday\u2019s lunch of Senate Democrats was speaking so loudly in favor of voting Yes to advance the government funding bill that reporters outside could her through the walls.\n\nGillibrand is the chair of the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm for the 2026 elections. After voting yes, despite a detailed justification she argued in a press release from her office on Friday, several of her colleagues and Democratic operatives told CNN they did not see how she could credibly appeal to donors and voters who wanted more of a fight.\n\n\u201cWe are confident we will have the resources we need to win,\u201d an aide to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told CNN. \u201cWhen given an explanation, donors are receptive and understand the negative consequences of a shutdown.\u201d\n\nOthers sympathetic to Schumer and Gillibrand argued to CNN that it\u2019s hard to believe the intricacies of a procedural vote in March 2025 will really shape the 2026 midterms, especially because by the fall Democrats are expecting Republicans to push through a bill to enact much of Trump\u2019s agenda that includes sweeping tax cuts and deep spending reductions on programs like Medicare without requiring a single Democratic vote, which they think will unify both Democratic officials and their supporters.\n\nBut with Senate Democrats acknowledging they probably don\u2019t have enough opportunities in races to get to the majority even in their best case scenario for 2026, they are hoping to get there by 2028. By then, Schumer would be 77, in Washington for as long as Joe Biden had been when he was elected president, and have weathered years of compromises with Trump. He\u2019d also have had to run for a sixth term that would keep him in office until his mid-80s.\n\nChatter about who will be the next Senate leader was whipping around Washington long before this week\u2014though the focus of much speculation, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, ultimately joined Schumer in voting \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAnd while multiple senators declined CNN\u2019s interview requests because, they said, they wanted to be able to tell Schumer they weren\u2019t involved in questioning his future, some of the No votes stood by him publicly.\n\n\u201cSchumer is a senator as well, and every one of us has to make these tough decisions,\u201d New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n said on Friday. When asked if he questioned the New Yorker\u2019s leadership, he said, \u201cI support Chuck Schumer.\u201d\n\nRepublicans \u201cown the pain that will result from this Continuing Resolution, and they will own the disastrous effects of cutting Medicaid and Social Security\u2014which they call a Ponzi scheme. We need to be ready for the fight ahead and redouble our efforts, and be unified,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, also a No vote.\n\nAsked if he had any concerns about Schumer\u2019s leadership going forward, Blumenthal answered without giving a yes or no, but insisted that was only because his only focus was Friday\u2019s vote.\n\nOr there was Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper\u2019s response when asked on Friday afternoon if he had a message to those Democrats outside the Senate so outraged that they\u2019re calling on Schumer to resign: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have a message\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Sarah Ferris and Manu Raju contributed to this report."

Never elected to any office before, Carney was sworn in on Friday to become Canada\u2019s 24th prime minister.\n\nHe is expected to call an election this week in a bid to keep the Liberals in power, and for him, to win a seat in the House of Commons.\n\nCount on the official opposition Conservatives, in a dead heat with the Liberals at 37% according to a recent Leger poll, to portray Carney as someone \"not connected to the common man\" and who has spent a fair amount of time outside Canada, Laura Kurkimaki told Fox News Digital. Kurkimaki served as deputy national campaign manager for the Conservative Party during the last federal election in 2021.\n\n\"Over the last five years, while Canadians have been lining up at foodbanks and experiencing a significant cost-of-living increase, he has not been in Canada,\" Kurkimaki said.\n\nSeen by detractors as out of touch, Carney, during a recent leadership debate, did not provide an answer when the moderator asked the candidates whether they knew the average cost of a week\u2019s worth of groceries.\n\nIn an appearance on \"The Rest is Politics\" podcast last month featuring Alastair Campbell, former British prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s press secretary, and past Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Scaramucci, Carney said that his \"weakness is people will charge me as being elitist or globalist.\"\n\nMARK CARNEY WINS LIBERAL PARTY NOMINATION TO REPLACE TRUDEAU AS CANADA'S NEXT PM\n\n\"Well, that happens to be exactly what we need,\" he said, adding that he\u2019s also \"a pragmatist\" and \"a leader in crisis.\"\n\nWhen Scaramucci asked Carney how he would respond to attacks that he is \"out of touch with the mainstream, common citizen in Canada,\" the new prime minister said that most of his life in Canada \"has been in service of Canadians.\"\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre also targeted Carney, who played hockey at Harvard and Oxford, after he was photographed playing goalie reportedly wearing high-end sneakers.\n\n\"Trying to be a normal guy playing hockey in $2000 shoes,\" Poilievre posted on X.\n\nKurkimaki said the upcoming federal election campaign with Carney at the Liberal helm could be a replay of the one in 2011 when another \"out-of-touch\" Liberal leader \u2013 historian Michael Ignatieff, who came from the world of academia \u2013 lost his House seat, and his party recorded its worst-ever result in a general election that the Conservatives won.\n\nCanada\u2019s new prime minister earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics at Harvard University and went on to receive master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in economics at the University of Oxford.\n\nWHO IS PIERRE POILIEVRE? CANADA'S CONSERVATIVE LEADER SEEKING TO BECOME NEXT PRIME MINISTER AFTER TRUDEAU EXIT\n\nCarney, who lived in the tony Ottawa neighborhood of Rockcliffe Park before becoming prime minister, also holds British and Irish citizenship. Earlier this month, he said that he had begun the process of renouncing both.\n\nAlong the way, the man whose looks were once compared to those of actor George Clooney made a fortune at England\u2019s central bank alone. Carney earned $1.3 million, including pay, allowances and housing costs \u2013 the highest for the head of any federal reserve at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, his current net worth might not be revealed any time soon. Before becoming prime minister, Carney divested his assets, \"other than his personal real estate, into a blind trust,\" a member of his team told CBC News. Under Canadian law, public-office holders need to divest their assets, such as stock options, either by selling them or having a trustee manage or sell them without, in this case, consulting Carney.\n\nCarney's spokesperson did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment."

            "full_content": "Tesla is now facing intense competition from other Chinese EV makers, including BYD.\n\nYet even there, a Chinese official also warned about the impact of Musk\u2019s high-profile politicking.\n\n\u201cAs a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: Treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,\u201d the secretary of China\u2019s Passenger Car Association, said in a briefing Monday, Bloomberg reported. \u201cBut if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the unavoidable risk that\u2019s come after he got his personal glory,\u201d the secretary, Cui Dongshu, said Monday, referring to Musk.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reported Tesla was planning to sell a Model Y costing at least 20% less to produce to defend its China share.\n\nAnd in the U.S., Tesla\u2019s January sales were down about 11%, according to data from the S&P Global analytics group \u2014 an outlier at a time when EV sales for all other brands are trending higher in America.\n\nThough he has long worn multiple proverbial hats, Musk\u2019s role in the White House as nominal head of the Department of Government Efficiency may be his most consequential. And having influence with the Trump administration could be critical to Tesla\u2019s fortunes. This week, Trump promised he would purchase a Tesla in a showy presentation on the White House lawn, seemingly further cementing the Trump-Musk alliance.\n\nOn X \u2014 the social media platform he owns \u2014 Musk\u2019s frenetic posting is increasingly focused on politics and America\u2019s culture wars, with an occasional nod to SpaceX launches.\n\nHis apparently undiminished role in the Trump administration \u2014 he was seen leaving the White House last weekend alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2014 has sparked boycotts in Europe, as well as protests and even acts of vandalism against auto owners in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhen people\u2019s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent to Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,\u201d Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d on Monday.\n\nIn a note to clients this week downgrading its estimate of deliveries, analysts with JPMorgan said the damage to Tesla\u2019s brand has been serious.\n\n\u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTesla itself is warning about the fallout from retaliatory measures taken by countries targeted by Trump\u2019s tariffs, saying in a letter to the U.S. trade representative this week that the company may be \u201cexposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.\u201d\n\nAlready, the Canadian province of British Columbia has announced it was ending subsidies for Tesla\u2019s products.\n\nFor all the oxygen Musk has taken up with his political activities, concerns about Tesla products themselves are equally keeping investors and analysts up at night.\n\nMusk has \u201cneglect[ed] the rest of Tesla\u2019s automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving \u2014 automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles,\u201d Fred Lambert, who covers the company for the Electrek electric vehicle blog, wrote in a recent post.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk decided to kill Tesla\u2019s cheaper, $25,000 model while going all-in on the Cybertruck, whose sales have yet to take off, Lambert said.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s core business remains selling cars and batteries,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there\u2019s no clear path to improvement.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, many analysts continue to take a much longer view of Tesla\u2019s outlook. In his most recent note to clients about the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most closely watched observers of Tesla, summarized the long-term outlook that he says continues to justify the company\u2019s eye-watering valuation.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive \u2018pure play\u2019 to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\u201d he wrote in a note March 2.\n\nWhile that was before the most recent sell-off intensified, Jonas said he was already discounting market gyrations.\n\n\u201cWhile the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,\u201d he wrote."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe chaos at the Internal Revenue Service began almost immediately after the first envoy from the Department of Government Efficiency arrived last month at the agency\u2019s Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\nWithin minutes of showing up, a twenty-something software engineer dispatched from DOGE began demanding access to the tax collection agency\u2019s most protected internal databases \u2013 first the IT systems and then one containing the personal and financial data for millions of American taxpayers and another system housing IRS contracts.\n\nAnother DOGE staffer sought to shut down nearly all of IRS\u2019s congressionally funded programs and initiatives planned for this fiscal year \u2013 many aimed at modernizing the agency and improving the tax filing process.\n\nAs DOGE has set up shop inside the IRS over the past month, the agency has fired thousands of workers and auditors and set out to shutter more than 110 taxpayer assistance offices across the country. Widespread layoffs are in the works, with plans to cut nearly 20% of all IRS employees by May 15.\n\nThe barnstorming, which has played out at multiple agencies, has thrown the IRS into turmoil at the height of tax season. While the business of processing returns and issuing refunds has been ongoing, sources say these DOGE actions could undermine the long-term operations of the IRS, which handles nearly all accounts receivable for the federal government.\n\nFormer Internal Revenue Service workers leave their office after being laid off in downtown Denver, Colorado, on Thursday, February 20. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post/Getty Images\n\nIn interviews with CNN, multiple current and former IRS officials, who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous, described an atmosphere of intimidation, especially of career staffers.\n\n\u201cThey just randomly drop by people\u2019s offices, demanding access to systems; they\u2019re bullying us and there\u2019s no discipline in what they are doing, which really worries me,\u201d said one IRS employee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clusterf***, and I can\u2019t believe no one is stepping in to do anything,\u201d said another top staffer who worked at the IRS.\n\n\u201cWe are paralyzed,\u201d said a third IRS source.\n\nAnother current IRS employee, who works outside Washington and is a local union leader, said it\u2019s now routine to see people crying in the office and managers going around apologizing for firings they had no decision in.\n\n\u201cMorale is suffering,\u201d the person said.\n\nNina Olson, who served from 2001 to 2019 as the independent National Taxpayer Advocate within the IRS, said the cuts were \u201cbasically gutting the agency\u201d by hollowing out the ranks, putting the IRS\u2019 future at risk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of new blood getting fired, that\u2019s supposed to be the future of the workforce,\u201d Olson said, referring to the agency\u2019s newly hired probationary employees. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got the most skilled people, at the height of their institutional knowledge, leaving through retirement.\u201d\n\nOlson, who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Taxpayer Rights, criticized this \u201cshotgun approach\u201d to staff reductions and predicated, \u201cnone of this bodes well for the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nIn response to CNN\u2019s reporting, the White House press secretary said in a statement, \u201cThis story is based on anonymous sources and the fraudsters always scream the loudest. The vast majority of Americans support President Trump rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll released last week found that 62% of Americans are worried that Trump\u2019s cuts to the federal government will go too far and lead to important programs being shut down. Only 37% said they\u2019re more worried that the cuts won\u2019t go far enough to eliminate fraud and waste.\n\nRemaking the IRS\n\nSince Trump\u2019s return, there have been a number of leadership changes at the IRS.\n\nThe Biden-appointed IRS commissioner, Danny Werfel, resigned on Inauguration Day. The acting commissioner who succeeded him retired four weeks later. The current leader, Melanie Krause has only been at the IRS for three-and-a-half years.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee to be the next full-time commissioner, former GOP congressman Billy Long, hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet.\n\nTrump announced Long\u2019s appointment in December. In a Truth Social post, Trump didn\u2019t say anything about the fact that Werfel\u2019s statutory five-year term \u2013 which is intended to give IRS commissioners some independence from the president \u2013 wasn\u2019t set to expire until 2027.\n\nDuring the transition, Werfel reached out multiple times to incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, seeking guidance on whether to resign or stay at the helm until Long was confirmed, to maintain stability amid tax season, according to a source familiar with the matter. Bessent never responded, the source said, and Werfel stepped down on January 20.\n\nIn this May 2024 photo, Biden-era Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Danny Werfel testifies before the House Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/File\n\nAlong with reducing headcount, sources say that it appears that DOGE\u2019s priority at the IRS has been around accessing its vast data systems.\n\nIn recent weeks, DOGE staffers have gained access to the IRS\u2019 human resource system that houses personal information of all the agency\u2019s employees, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile the courts weigh whether to allow DOGE to have full access to IRS data systems, the effort to remake the tax collection agency is well underway.\n\nIt began in mid-February when senior IRS staff were told DOGE would be visiting their offices. They were given just a 15-minute heads up that Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old software engineer, was on his way.\n\nWithin minutes of arriving, Kliger demanded access to the IRS\u2019s \u201ctax administration systems,\u201d according to an IRS employee familiar with the situation.\n\nIn a Bloomberg op-ed published Friday, Werfel, the former IRS commissioner, said DOGE should not have access to the sensitive data. He said it was akin the CEO of a bank walking into a branch and demanding access to all of the customers\u2019 safe-deposit boxes.\n\nOnly a select group of IRS employees have access to the systems that house taxpayers\u2019 sensitive financial data. Career employees informed Kliger that he could not access the agency\u2019s IT system without undergoing extensive background checks to ensure he would not pose an insider threat.\n\nTwo weeks later, Kliger was joined at IRS by Sam Corcos, a 36-year-old startup entrepreneur, who co-founded a company that helps people customize their diet to boost their metabolism.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taxpayer advocate on DOGE access to IRS data 05:00 - Source: CNN Taxpayer advocate on DOGE access to IRS data 05:00\n\nAs soon as Corcos got there, one IRS employee told CNN, he pushed to a halt nearly all the agency\u2019s congressionally funded programs and initiatives it was planning for fiscal year and calendar year 2025. The employee told CNN Corcos was making the demand without \u201cfully understanding how the agency works within the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come in and say we\u2019re going to delete that initiative\u2013 \u2018delete\u2019 is one of their favorite terms,\u201d said the IRS employee. \u201cSo, we are scrambling to figure out \u2018Does Sam have that authority? Does Gavin have that authority? Did Treasury give them that authority?\u2019\u201d\n\nCorcos also pushed for a fast-tracked background check which would have required federal employees to work on the weekend so he could quickly gain access to the IRS IT system.\n\nBy the following Monday, the agency\u2019s top HR officer was placed on administrative leave and told she was dismissed for being insubordinate after Kliger\u2019s demand for an expedited background check for his DOGE partner had not been fulfilled over the weekend, sources said.\n\nUsing tax data to find immigrants\n\nLike all of DOGE\u2019s actions, the moves at IRS are part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader efforts to purportedly root out fraud and abuse. But two IRS employees who spoke to CNN said that some of the actions taken by DOGE inside IRS appear to be aimed at finding ways to use the agency\u2019s protected data to find undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security circulated a draft memo to IRS that represented a sweeping request for information about suspected undocumented immigrants, including the home addresses of several hundred thousand individuals who paid federal taxes based on their individual taxpayer identification numbers, according to a source with direct knowledge of the document.\n\nThe memo also proposed IRS detail a dedicated group of several dozen senior IRS auditors to launch investigations into companies suspected of hiring undocumented immigrants.\n\nPrivacy experts say that would be a violation of the strict disclosure laws that the IRS operates under that prohibits the release of tax information by an IRS employee.\n\nTwo immigrant-rights groups in Chicago sued the Treasury Department and IRS earlier this month and asked a judge to block the agency from sharing taxpayers\u2019 identifying information with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement or DHS, as Trump pushes for more deportations.\n\nThe groups claimed federal law \u201cforbids\u201d IRS from giving this data to immigration authorities, because ICE and DHS aren\u2019t listed as exceptions to the confidentiality rules in the tax code.\n\nIf that does happen, lawyers for the groups wrote in filings that it would subject their members \u201cto harm in the form of the arrest, detention, or other deprivations of liberty associated with the Trump Administration\u2019s stated intention to engage in mass actions against immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe case is still pending in DC federal court, and the judge hasn\u2019t issued any rulings yet.\n\nCarts containing documents sit organized at the IRS Processing Facility on September 6, 2024 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThough the IRS\u2019s automated tax return systems continue to run smoothly, taxpayers in the long term may eventually experience the paralyzing effects of DOGE. Customer service wait times will likely increase as the agency loses staff. The employees CNN spoke with also expect delays with paper-based returns.\n\nFunding from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act allowed the IRS to staff up to improve taxpayers\u2019 customer service experience, including thousands of new call center representatives.\n\nData released by the IRS shows that wait times for customer service phone calls improved significantly from an average of 28 minutes during tax season in 2022, before the landmark legislation was passed, to four minutes in 2023, and three minutes last year.\n\n\u201cIn many cases those long wait times ended with a courtesy disconnect,\u201d the employee said. \u201cThey just hung up on you, so we are going back to those days.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly, Jeanne Sahadi and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Mahmoud Khalil. Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP Photo\n\nWhen ICE agents detained Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student and pro-Palestine activist, on March 8, Democratic leaders could not seem to agree on whether to stand up for him. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasted the arrest and threat of deportation of a green-card holder for no crime other than exercising his free-speech rights as \u201ctyrannical.\u201d The X account for the Senate Judiciary Democrats posted, \u201cFree Mahmoud Khalil.\u201d But other Democrats, from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo, stressed their opposition to Khalil\u2019s political views before grudgingly conceding that people should not be spirited away to a Louisiana detention center for those views.\n\nIn some ways, Khalil\u2019s case bears many of the hallmarks of a liberal cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Here we have a sympathetic protagonist whose edges are softened by his status as a father-to-be, pitted against despicable villains in Marco Rubio and Donald Trump. A federal judge has halted Khalil\u2019s deportation for now, and protests have erupted across the country as legal analysts and even Ann Coulter have voiced their dismay at what by all appearances is a full-scale trampling of the First Amendment. Yet because the issue involves Israel, which in the past year and a half has divided the liberal-left like no other issue, the support for Khalil is less than ironclad. Unfortunately, there is no pro-Palestine activist who could help the party avoid conservative pundit Jonah Goldberg\u2019s verdict that it has \u201ca gift for picking problematic martyrs,\u201d because the Democratic Party tends to treat everyone who stands up for Palestine like a problem.\n\nAnd that is the real crisis that Khalil embodies for Democrats. His cause is clearly just, but he is a member of one of the most marginalized and pilloried communities on earth \u2014 which is likely why the Trump administration feels comfortable targeting him. As a result, the party is buckling in the most prominent test yet of its commitment to opposing encroaching fascism.\n\nFor their part, conservatives from X to Capitol Hill have presented a unified front, smearing the 30-year-old Syrian national as a threat to national security and in some cases claiming he was a different Mahmoud Khalil who allegedly chanted, \u201cExplode the heads of Zionists!\u201d at a protest in Quebec. Trump has called Khalil\u2019s arrest \u201cthe first of many to come,\u201d and his plan to weaponize state resources against people who support Palestine is already entering its next phase. Department of Homeland Security agents were seen scouring two more Columbia dorms with search warrants on Thursday night. The Atlantic reported on Friday that Rubio has singled out a second unnamed green-card holder for deportation, hours before DHS announced that it had arrested a second former student who had participated in the Columbia protests, Leqaa Kordia, and that a third, Ranjani Srinivasan, had left the country voluntarily\n\nDemocrats including Schumer have seemed eager to go along with Trump\u2019s demagogic characterization of Khalil and his fellow activists \u2014 with the minority leader asserting, \u201cI abhor many of the opinions and policies that Mahmoud Khalil holds and supports\u201d \u2014 but it remains unclear if the supposedly abhorrent views he is accused of expressing are actually his. Social-media users have alleged that pamphlets from the Hamas Media Office were distributed at a protest at Barnard College earlier this month, but offered no proof that Khalil distributed them. Others have pointed to an Instagram post from Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a campus group that Khalil has protested with, calling for \u201cthe total eradication of Western Civilization.\u201d But Drop Site News reported that Khalil has nothing to do with CUAD\u2019s Instagram decisions. So far, anyway, it appears Khalil\u2019s principal views \u2014 that Palestinians should be free, that Columbia should divest from Israel \u2014 are within the mainstream.\n\nKhalil had open misgivings about protesting at Columbia because he feared the exact consequences he is now facing \u2014 \u201cthat I will be arrested and ultimately deported\u201d \u2014 so his primary role was as an intermediary between student protesters and the administration. This put him on the school\u2019s radar and, owing in part to the activity of extremist pro-Israel groups like Canary Mission and Betar US that dox pro-Palestine activists, eventually on Trump\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s an easier target than a lot of other students,\u201d said the Verge\u2019s Gaby Del Valle on Vox\u2019s Today, Explained podcast. This may account for the speed with which both Columbia and key Democrats have yielded to Trump\u2019s bellicosity. It\u2019s no coincidence that Khalil was arrested the day after the Trump administration canceled $400 million in federal funding to Columbia over its alleged failure to police antisemitism.\n\nHowever, the Democrats\u2019 alignment with the president on this issue is less about Trump than it is about them. John Fetterman, the Senate\u2019s most ostentatious Israel supporter, was in a meeting with pro-Israel activist Ross Glick while Khalil was participating in the Barnard protest. According to The Forward, Fetterman promised Glick, who has provided lists of campus protesters to federal immigration authorities in the past, that he would \u201cescalate\u201d pressure on the administration to deport pro-Palestine activists who were not citizens. Both parties are in lockstep providing material support and political justification for whatever Israel chooses to do to its Palestinian subjects, including a military assault on Gaza that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women, children, or the elderly.\n\nEven if Democrats were not proactive collaborators in Trump\u2019s assault on the First Amendment, their own past actions would be apt precursors: In 2023, 20 of them voted to censure Palestinian American congresswoman Rashida Tlaib for daring to criticize Israel\u2019s mass slaughter of Palestinian civilians, the most severe punishment for a member of Congress short of expulsion.\n\nThus, instead of riding the groundswell of outrage over Khalil\u2019s persecution and siding with him unequivocally, Democrats are drawing more attention to their own complicity and to their own conditional support for democratic institutions. Not only are they ceding critical ground to Trump\u2019s authoritarian takeover in the process, they are reminding people that the reason Khalil is in this situation to begin with, Israel\u2019s oppression of Palestine, is one they support and have shown no interest in wavering on. Even if they were not immobilized by their current lack of institutional power, entrusting them with Khalil\u2019s political defense would be a dicey proposition. Why trust a party whose moral convictions are as weak as their opposition to Trump has been?"

            "full_content": "Craig Peterson\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nUsing the R-word is vulgar, hateful and immature behavior. It must stop.\n\nIt would have been about 57 years ago. I was a first grader at Madison Elementary School in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. My mom would drop me off in the summer at Lindsay Park, just off Congress Avenue to play in the wading pool. There was an older boy in the pool, probably in eighth grade, who had Down syndrome. There was also a group of older boys on bikes hanging around the fence surrounding the pool.\n\nAt some point the kids on bikes began jeering at the boy with Down syndrome, laughing and yelling \"retard\" over and over. The boy in the pool laughed, too, as the group continued chanting the slur.\n\nWhat happened at Wauwatosa wading pool haunts me to this day\n\nI don't know when, but he eventually got out of the pool and joined the older kids who were now off their bikes.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThen there was a lot of commotion. It seemed like everyone jumped out of the pool at the same time and swarmed the group as the boys kept cheering as they lead the boy with Down syndrome into the bathroom.\n\nEveryone followed, like a mob caught up in the moment. It seemed like something exciting was going to happen. Then a couple of the kids grabbed the boy and forced his head into one of those big, stinky, county park toilets while another boy flushed the toilet, giving the young man a \"swirly.\"\n\nWhen he was lifted out of the toilet bowl with his wet head and water running down his cheeks, he laughed. Because the whole group was laughing. Yup, everyone.\n\nThat day and those images have haunted me for the last 57 years.\n\nI'm the proud father of a talented son with Down syndrome\n\nToday, I am the proud father of a very talented son with Down syndrome. I thought as a culture we had banished the R-word and begun welcoming everyone with special needs and disabilities into our lives with open arms and minds. Then came Elon Musk and the followers of Donald Trump.\n\nThey think it\u2019s cool and anti-woke to throw around the R-word to virtue signal their unwillingness to follow the norms of a polite and empathetic society.\n\nTheir actions are already picking up steam as more and more folks and conservative media types are using the R-word. Just because they heard Musk use it, they think it\u2019s OK and must be cool to not be \u201cpolitically correct.\"\n\nI'm afraid these celebrities, insensitive fools and keyboard rage posters are going to bring us back to a time when playground bullies felt empowered to use the R-word and act like young mobsters, giving swirlies and hinder-binders to the kids with disabilities. And the herd mentality will take over as other kids join in to become accessories to the cruelty.\n\nAll while everyone laughs.\n\nThat's not who we are, and we need to stop it right now. The R-word is never acceptable. Period.\n\nCraig Peterson is the CEO of Wisconsin's oldest independent public relations firm, Zigman Joseph & Associates in Milwaukee.

            "full_content": "Photo: Oliver Contreras/The New York Times/Redux\n\nThe path to women\u2019s liberation has always been blocked by other women. Before Amy Coney Barrett rose to the Supreme Court or Marjorie Dannenfelser began her war on legal abortion, there was Phyllis Schlafly, that self-styled paragon of wifely submission, and Anita Bryant, the unrepentant homophobe. In Right-Wing Women, the late feminist writer Andrea Dworkin skewered them and the culture of male violence they served. Now that Schlafly\u2019s heirs are in power, we owe Dworkin reevaluation, or so the argument goes. \u201cFew writers are pilloried so confidently by people who do not really know what they said; few writers provide, as a consequence, so many disorienting surprises,\u201d the writer Moira Donegan argues in a new foreword to the reissued book.\n\nDworkin published Right-Wing Women in 1983 as second-wave feminism faded and the Reagan revolution got underway. There was something unfashionable about her, even then. Her scalding analysis of woman-hatred ran counter to the Moral Majority\u2019s tender visions of the traditional white family, anchored by a mother in the home. Feminists, too, regarded her with suspicion if not hostility, and for good reason. In the porn wars years earlier, Dworkin sided with the censorious Christian right over many of her feminist peers, a decision that would undermine her work for the rest of her life. By the time she died in 2005, most people knew Dworkin the caricature, not Dworkin the writer.\n\nLike the rest of her work, Right-Wing Women is a hammer blow. \u201cFrom father\u2019s house to husband\u2019s house to a grave that still might not be her own, a woman acquiesces to male authority in order to gain some protection from male violence,\u201d she asserted, and who can fault her? The right-wing woman is ascendant, and with her rides the incel, the woman batterer, and the rapist. Andrew Tate\u2019s former attorney, Paul Ingrassia, now works for Donald Trump, an accused rapist, and so does Pete Hegseth, who has been accused of sexual assault and abuse himself. Hegseth hired Sean Parnell, whose ex-wife once testified that he choked her and abused their children. Dana White, the chief executive of the UFC and a prominent Trump ally, allegedly hit his wife and embraced Tate and his brother Tristan at a recent event. Texas lawyer Jonathan Mitchell represents men who are outraged over their partners\u2019 abortions, and some women have accused his clients of domestic abuse.\n\nWomen are in danger, and they know it. The right-wing woman knows it too and, Dworkin wrote, strikes a bargain to save herself. \u201cThe political Right in the United States today makes certain metaphysical and material promises to women that both exploit and quiet some of women\u2019s deepest fears,\u201d she argued. \u201cThese fears originate in the perception that male violence against women is uncontrollable and unpredictable.\u201d Today\u2019s tradwives agree to bear children, stay at home, and obey their husbands because the alternative is too frightful for them to contemplate, because the right wing tells them that it is their nature and because it\u2019s what they want to do. They believe abortion, contraception, and queerness prevent them from finding true satisfaction as women, so each must be destroyed. If they\u2019re bored enough, or zealous enough, they can follow Schlafly and Bryant and sell their choices to the masses. There\u2019s always TikTok.\n\nIn videos and on podcasts, right-wing women say they need men more than they need feminism. Of course, the opposite is true. We need feminism, but there are many feminisms, and they aren\u2019t all fit for purpose \u2014 any reevaluation of Dworkin must reckon with the full scope of her work. Though her defenders will sometimes admit some flaws in her thinking, they say her critics have judged her too harshly. She did not write that all heterosexual intercourse is rape, as is commonly reported, and whatever her flaws, her feminism had teeth. The rise of Trump, and later the Me Too movement, helped revitalize interest in Dworkin, whose excoriations of male brutality no longer seemed so outlandish. After all, what had sex positivity accomplished for women? \u201cIn her singular scorched-earth theory of representation, pornography was fascist propaganda, a weapon as crucial to the ever-escalating war on women as Goebbels\u2019 caricatures were to Hitler\u2019s rise,\u201d Johanna Fateman wrote in the introduction to Last Days at Hot Slit, a 2019 collection of Dworkin\u2019s work. In 2021, the academic Claire Potter wrote that Me Too had \u201copened the door to a long-overdue recognition of Dworkin\u2019s contributions to how we understand the politics of sex and gender,\u201d adding, \u201cI have always believed that part of the hostility that Dworkin aroused had something to do with a clarity of mind that terrified people who shy away from difficult and dangerous thoughts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an attractive logic. Twenty years after Dworkin\u2019s death, feminists have few friends and little institutional power. They certainly cannot look to the Democratic Party for aid, as members dither over rhetoric and strategy. A handful of Democratic women wore pink to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address because it is \u201cthe color of women\u2019s power, of persistence and of resistance,\u201d Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez told the New York Times. The pink-clad electeds held up signs as Trump rambled; it was Representative Al Green, not in pink, who interrupted the speech. (Some Democrats joined Republicans to censure him later.) Other Democrats try to appease the right by sacrificing trans girls and women on the altar of political expediency. With fascists on one side and quislings on the other, a militant response is overdue. Enter Dworkin, whose relentless anger and imaginative prescriptions can seem like the antidote not only to the right wing but to mainstream feminism itself, which told women that liberation ran through the Capitol and the courtroom and the corner office. Dworkin did not seek parity with men, but rather a new world altogether.\n\nThe pursuit of power for its own sake leaves most women behind, and the politics of compromise brings even the girlboss to her downfall. Right-Wing Women reappears in a moment of pitched anti-feminist backlash, as corporate America abandons all pretense of equal treatment and abusers of women fill the government. Women marched, rallied, and told their stories, but no hashtag is a match for misogyny. \u201cNo matter how often these stories are told, with whatever clarity or elegance, bitterness or sorrow, they might as well have been whispered in the wind or written in sand; they disappear, as if they are nothing,\u201d Dworkin wrote. Male outrage drowned out female pain. As she put it, \u201cThe tellers and stories are ignored or ridiculed; threatened back into silence or destroyed, and the experience of female suffering is buried in cultural invisibility and contempt.\u201d\n\nLately, pundits and policy wonks speak of men \u2014 their loneliness, their resentment, their decline \u2014 often presented as problems for women to solve. One popular theory says American men are moving to the right because they have been abandoned by liberals and alienated by feminism. The solution, of course, is for women to marry them anyway. Men need marriage and children to be happy, which is to say they need women; the worthiness of a man matters less to a pro-natalist than his fertility. Even a woman who seeks heterosexual marriage must know her place or be condemned. On the latest season of Love Is Blind, a contestant left her fianc\u00e9 at the altar because he attends an anti-gay megachurch, and the right wing erupted. \u201cThis man dodged a bullet,\u201d posted Isabella Maria DeLuca, a January 6 rioter. \u201cLiberal women are INSUFFERABLE & MISERABLE,\u201d posted Morgonn McMichael, who works for Charlie Kirk\u2019s Turning Point USA.\n\nMarriage is no sure refuge from male violence, and it can often become a trap, as Dworkin knew well. She endured molestation as a child and sexual violation during her incarceration as a war resister, only to marry a man who beat her savagely, once in front of her apathetic parents. In Right-Wing Women, she wrote almost sympathetically of Bryant, who was married to a controlling Evangelical husband. \u201cBryant, like all the rest of us, is trying to be a \u2018good\u2019 woman,\u201d she argued. Yet Bryant was responsible for her own choices and by all accounts died a bigot. There is no easy way to separate the right-wing woman\u2019s convictions from her victimhood, though we often try to do it anyway. In the silence of Usha Vance, some look for evidence of dissent, as if a woman of her obvious intelligence could not possibly agree with her husband\u2019s retrograde politics. Vance, like Bryant, is oppressed and oppressor at once.\n\nPortions of Right-Wing Women remind us that the Trump era has old roots. The Guardian reported earlier this month that an upcoming pro-natalist conference will feature eugenicists and purveyors of race science who believe women must have babies, but in the right way and with the right men. The argument is familiar, and so is the racism behind it. Dworkin recalled her encounters with a delegation of anti\u2013Equal Rights Amendment women from Mississippi. The Ku Klux Klan said it controlled the delegation, she wrote, and a man who accompanied them said he held a powerful role in the white-supremacist group. \u201cHe said that his wife had wanted him to be there to protect women\u2019s right to procreate and to have a family,\u201d she added.\n\nDworkin concluded later in Right-Wing Women that an extermination or \u201cgynocide\u201d may be on the way, though it was not inevitable. A rigorous thinker, she diagrammed a system of crimes against women to help her readers break free of the same. Her writing was one more act of optimism, shaped by her deep conviction not only in the necessity of liberation but in its possibility. In the years since her death, some feminists have identified a prophetic quality to her thinking, although that, too, risks caricature. A prophet is a divine vessel, and Dworkin was not that.\n\nOne of the principle functions of the right-wing woman is to police female sexuality and reproduction, and Dworkin\u2019s logic ultimately pushed her into a similar role. In Right-Wing Women, Dworkin attacked sex work, pornography, and reproductive technology with the same ferocity she applied to Schlafly\u2019s ilk. \u201cMotherhood is becoming a new branch of female prostitution with the help of scientists who want access to the womb for experimentation and power,\u201d she wrote, but the truth is somewhat more complex. For conservatives who defend technologies like IVF, science is another way to bind women to motherhood, but it can also detach reproduction from compulsory heterosexuality, and it offers women a way to bear children on their own terms, which is why it has always been in danger from some factions of the right wing. Dworkin admitted the irony, but as with her fight against pornography, she stood firmly on reactionary ground.\n\nIf there is a gynocide to come, as she feared, it would be carried out by the same forces who want to ban IVF, pornography, and sex work. The writer Sophie Lewis has called Dworkin\u2019s thinking an \u201cenemy feminism,\u201d an obstacle to the very liberation she sought. \u201cDid Dworkin herself not see the contradiction between her unjust arrest and subsequent rape at the hands of the state, and her apparent faith that this same coercive apparatus could be wrangled into the service of women?\u201d wrote the philosopher Amia Srinivasan in 2022. \u201cEven if we grant, with Dworkin and other radical feminists, that sex work cannot be understood outside the frame of gendered hierarchy, what does it mean to ignore sex workers\u2019 near-universal insistence that the criminalisation of their trade makes their lives less liveable?\u201d That\u2019s not an abstract question. The answer has life-or-death consequences.\n\nWith the right wing in power, the pursuit of liberation only becomes more urgent. \u201cWill it take a hundred fists, a thousand fists, a million fists, pushed through that circle of crime to destroy it, or are right-wing women essentially right that it is indestructible?\u201d Dworkin asked. \u201cThe freedom of women from sex oppression either matters or it does not; it is essential or it is not.\u201d We must agree that it is essential. In doing so, we must also understand why liberal \u201cwar on women\u201d rhetoric has failed. Misogyny is one reason, but misogyny serves a purpose, and today\u2019s anti-feminist moment was orchestrated by political forces that rely on our collective submission. The right wing tells all of us to bargain against our own liberation. They tell men that women\u2019s advancement deprived them of economic and emotional security, and they tell women that safety depends on the prosperity of men. All they can offer is hierarchy. Without meaningful political alternatives to that argument, misogyny will become more attractive, and the ranks of the right-wing woman will grow. Dworkin knew that women need a revolution, a feminism of fists. If it\u2019s going to succeed, it will have to be more transformative than even she imagined."

            "full_content": "Bosnia is on the brink of collapse following the sentencing of Milorad Dodik for defying the United Nations High Representative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina, located in the Western Balkans, is bordered by Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro. It is home to three main ethnic groups: Bosniak Muslims, Catholic Croats, and Orthodox Serbs.\n\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia and the war that followed left the country in ruins, with thousands of victims and deep ethnic and religious divisions.\n\nThe war, which began in 1992, ended with the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which divided the country into two federal entities: the Republic of Srpska, primarily inhabited by Orthodox Serbs, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, shared by Bosniak Muslims and Catholic Croats.\n\nThe Dayton Peace Agreement, however, failed to provide a long-term solution for Bosnia. As Tam\u00e1s Orb\u00e1n of the European Conservative aptly points out, \u201cBosnia and Herzegovina is not a country; it\u2019s a ceasefire between three nations pretending to be one, and it may soon come to an end.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ago, a court found Republic of Srpska President Milorad Dodik guilty of defying the authority of Bosnia\u2019s UN High Representative, Christian Schmidt. He was sentenced to one year in prison and barred from holding public office for six years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling has plunged the country into a constitutional and political crisis unlike any seen since the end of the war.\n\nJovan Tripkovic, a contributor to The American Conservative, sat down with President Dodik to discuss the ruling, the Biden administration\u2019s involvement in the judicial process against him, and his hopes of working with President Donald Trump to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe past few weeks have been incredibly turbulent for you. For our readers who don\u2019t closely follow developments in the Balkans, could you briefly summarize what has happened to you during this time?\n\nThis crisis has been building up for years, beginning with President Biden and his officials, including Ambassador Michael J. Murphy, who have acted like colonial rulers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their actions have undermined the country\u2019s constitution and the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was instrumental in establishing lasting peace in Bosnia.\n\nAt the end of the war, the Dayton Peace Agreement established the Office of the High Representative (OHR) for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The High Representative is appointed by the Peace Implementation Council\u2014PIC, an international body charged with implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement. The PIC comprises 55 countries and agencies.\n\nThe Biden administration installed Christian Schmidt through an ad hoc group that lacks any official international jurisdiction over Bosnia or the Dayton Peace Agreement. Russia and China opposed the appointment of Christian Schmidt, so he was appointed by the PIC Steering Board in 2021, but not confirmed by the UN Security Council due to Russian and Chinese opposition.\n\nFor this reason, we consider Christian Schmidt an illegitimate holder of the Office of the High Representative.\n\nUpon his arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt began unilaterally imposing decisions and altering the country\u2019s laws. The Muslim side welcomed these actions, believing they would pave the way for a unitary Bosnia, ultimately undermining the existence of the Orthodox Christian entity, the Republic of Srpska.\n\nAs the president of the Republic of Srpska, I refused to comply with Schmidt\u2019s unconstitutional and colonial imposition of changes to existing laws. That is my so-called \"original sin.\" I firmly believe that no foreigner should have the authority to unilaterally impose and alter a country\u2019s law at their discretion.\n\nThat is why I was found guilty of defying the authority of Bosnia\u2019s UN High Representative, Christian Schmidt. A few weeks ago, I was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office for six years.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the court\u2019s decision?\n\nThe court that sentenced me was biased, predominantly composed of Bosnian Muslims, as was the prosecutor\u2019s office that formally initiated the case against me. This verdict is politically motivated, aimed at removing me from political and public life.\n\nThe deep state attempted a similar tactic against President Trump in an effort to prevent his re-election. Fortunately, they did not succeed.\n\nConsidering everything you\u2019ve just told me, I have to ask\u2014do you believe Bosnia and Herzegovina is a failed state?\n\nSince the Dayton Peace Agreement ended the civil war in Bosnia in 1995, Democratic administrations have consistently worked to undermine it. Over the past 30 years, the Bosnian project has proven to be largely unsuccessful, as the country remains deeply divided along ethnic lines. The people of Bosnia\u2014Bosniak Muslims, Catholic Croats, and Orthodox Serbs\u2014do not wish to live in the same country.\n\nThese factors render Bosnia a non-functional nation-state and are the primary reason so many people are leaving for other countries. Bosnia is unable to meet the basic needs of its citizens, including fostering economic growth. This is why I believe Bosnia is a failed state in the heart of Europe.\n\nThe only thing that has not failed in Bosnia is international interventionism, driven by President Biden\u2019s administration and supported by other neoconservative officials in Washington, D.C., who continue to hold the country together.\n\nDuring her first presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton claimed she had come under sniper fire during a trip to Bosnia as first lady. However, she visited the country in March 1996, after the war had ended. This incident offers a revealing glimpse into how the Democratic Party\u2019s elites perceive Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSince 1992, the United States has invested over $2 billion in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Where has all that money gone?\n\nUntil recently, we knew very little about these funds. The new administration revealed that over the past four years, Bosnia received $402 million through USAID programs. However, Bosnia\u2019s financial regulatory agencies have confirmed receiving only $150 million during the same period. The fate of the remaining $250 million remains unclear.\n\nI am asking: Where did a quarter of a billion dollars go? What was it spent on? Why were American taxpayers required to fund Bosnia\u2019s nation-building process, including sponsoring the Office of the High Representative of the United Nations?\n\nI agree with officials from President Trump\u2019s administration who have stated that USAID operates as a criminal organization. While there is no doubt that some of the funds have supported beneficial projects for our communities, the majority of USAID grant money has been used to finance the nation-building process and other corrupt activities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on former U.S. federal prosecutor Martin De Luca\u2019s visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the initiation of an investigation into USAID misappropriations in the country?\n\nIt\u2019s very encouraging. I believe that any further investigation into USAID\u2019s activities and finances related to Bosnia will uncover deep-rooted corruption. I am also aware that a USAID official owned two consulting firms registered at the same address in Washington, D.C., even using the same telephone number.\n\nThrough these entities, he managed USAID grants for Bosnia, particularly in the judicial sector, where he worked to install liberal judges aligned with President Biden\u2019s agenda. I know for a fact that he awarded one of his firms a USAID grant of $11 million to oversee Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s judicial branch.\n\nI am willing to collaborate with President Trump\u2019s administration and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency in any future investigation into USAID corruption and misappropriation in Bosnia.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, it appears that Democratic administrations\u2014from President Clinton to President Biden\u2014have actively worked to shape the Bosnian nation, often at the expense of Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs. Is there any truth to this claim?\n\nAbsolutely. I\u2019ve been in politics for over 30 years and have witnessed this process many times. It is clear that Bosnia has a Christian majority. However, Democratic administrations\u2014including Clinton, Obama, and most recently Biden\u2014have consistently worked to place both Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs under the political and legal authority of a Muslim minority.\n\nThis is a deeply emotional issue for us. During and after the war, 150,000 Orthodox Serbs were forced to flee their homes, leaving their property behind after Muslims took control of Sarajevo. More than two decades later, President Biden\u2019s administration pressured Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs to accept Sarajevo as the nation\u2019s capital. As part of this effort, they centralized the entire judicial branch\u2014aligned with their agenda\u2014in Sarajevo.\n\nI am not the only person to face legal prosecution for opposing the nation-building process in Bosnia. Dragan \u010covi\u0107, the representative of Catholic Croats in Bosnia, was also sentenced due to his political activities. Although he was later exonerated, he still had to spend time in jail. This tactic is used to intimidate and discourage those who resist the nation-building agenda, effectively preventing representatives of Croats and Serbs from voicing their concerns about the assimilation of their people into the Muslim majority.\n\nYou\u2019ve shared a lot about the involvement of President Biden\u2019s administration in Bosnia. Could you also say a few words about the role of Biden\u2019s ambassador, Michael J. Murphy, in the judicial process against you?\n\nAmbassador Murphy orchestrated the judicial process against me, directing the illegitimate High Representative, Christian Schmidt, on how to handle my case. Years ago, Murphy served as an assistant to Richard Holbrooke, the key diplomat in the Clinton administration who brokered the 1995 peace agreement in Bosnia. Strongly influenced by Holbrooke\u2019s views on Bosnia, Ambassador Murphy has returned to complete the unfinished business of his former boss.\n\nAs soon as he arrived in Bosnia, Ambassador Murphy began acting against the country\u2019s constitution and the Dayton Peace Agreement. Bosnia\u2019s constitution, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, states that any powers not explicitly designated as federal jurisdiction are reserved for the entities. However, Ambassador Murphy sought to change that.\n\nDuring his tenure as ambassador in Bosnia, he behaved like a colonial ruler, effectively capturing the state by weakening its political institutions and manipulating decision-making to benefit the Biden administration and the Muslim majority. Ambassador Murphy justified his actions by leveraging his close relationship with Secretary Blinken as a shield.\n\nHe is the mastermind behind the judicial witch hunt against me, hoping that the people of the Republic of Srpska would support the court\u2019s ruling. However, Murphy overplayed his hand. According to the latest polls, an overwhelming majority of voters believe the verdict is politically motivated and illegitimate.\n\nFrom what I\u2019m hearing, it seems that President Biden\u2019s administration has deliberately fostered instability in Bosnia. Guided by identity politics favoring the Muslim side, Ambassador Michael J. Murphy has actively opposed a strategic agreement that would have increased U.S. gas imports. Max Primorac, a Senior Research Fellow at the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation and one of the authors of Project 2025, has publicly criticized Ambassador Murphy in a piece for the National Interest. Could you share with our readers what that was all about?\n\nAs an ambassador, Murphy acted like a colonial governor. When meeting with Croat representatives in Bosnia, he insisted that a gas terminal be built on their territory. However, he also told them\u2014and even threatened them\u2014that control and jurisdiction over the terminal must be handed over to Bosnian Muslims. This was an unjust and unfair approach toward Croatia and its people.\n\nWhy do you believe Ambassador Murphy favored the Muslim side in this energy agreement?\n\nI don\u2019t have concrete evidence of this, but there are many rumors about Ambassador Murphy\u2019s financial dealings with Bosnian Muslims. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they turned out to be true.\n\nWhat is the path forward to resolve the political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina? What would be the ideal solution for the Republic of Srpska?\n\nThere are no ideal solutions left. We can\u2019t accept an unconstitutional judicial system designed to prosecute anyone who disagrees with the Muslim side and their vision for the country. We do not seek war or any form of conflict\u2014we stand for peace.\n\nThe leadership of the Republic of Srpska seeks to restore the original interpretation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s constitution. Any issue not explicitly addressed in the constitution should be discussed and resolved through dialogue among representatives of Bosnian Muslims, Catholic Croats, and Orthodox Serbs.\n\nAll three nations must engage in dialogue and work toward a compromise on the pressing issues facing the country. Every group deserves to have its voice heard. However, Bosnia\u2019s diplomatic corps is overwhelmingly dominated by Muslim staffers.\n\nThe voices of Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs are virtually absent in Bosnian embassies abroad, including the one in Washington, D.C. and the Bosnian mission to the United Nations. This is not a sustainable way to govern the country. All sides must come together, engage in dialogue, and work toward an agreement on the country\u2019s future.\n\nPresident Trump is a busy man, dealing with the war in Ukraine, the immigration crisis, and a trade war with China, among other pressing issues. Given this, the crisis in Bosnia is unlikely to be a top priority for him. What interest would the United States have in actively participating in resolving the crisis in Bosnia? And would you be open to cooperating with President Trump\u2019s administration to find a solution?\n\nThe United States has wasted billions of dollars on the nation-building process in Bosnia and has received nothing in return\u2014absolutely nothing.\n\nIn the eastern region of the Republic of Srpska, near the Serbian border, there are substantial deposits of lithium, magnesium, and other rare earth minerals. Some estimates place their commercial value at over $100 billion.\n\nWe are open to discussions on a rare earth mineral deal with President Trump. We are willing to grant access to these mineral deposits to companies selected by his administration. Additionally, there is potential for collaboration with Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, whose government is involved in this investment.\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Srpska, in cooperation with President Trump, is prepared to fast-track the issuance of all necessary mining permits for American companies selected to participate in this rare earth minerals agreement.\n\nSo far, we have not granted mining rights to any country or foreign company. I am willing to discuss this matter exclusively with President Trump, and I believe we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nI assume you listened closely to Vice President Vance\u2019s speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he addressed the suppression of free speech, elections, and the democratic process. Given recent events in Bosnia, his words almost seem as if they were directed specifically at you. How do you interpret his message in the context of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nVice President Vance\u2019s speech at the Munich Security Conference has been an inspiring catalyst for change across Europe. It served as a sharp analytical wake-up call, signaling the need for a new approach. If properly understood, it represents the best offer from the U.S. to European leaders\u2014a call for a stronger, more independent Europe.\n\nWhile I was encouraged by Vice President Vance\u2019s address, I was somewhat surprised by Secretary Rubio\u2019s recent post on X, in which he accused me of undermining Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s institutions and threatening its security and stability.\n\nI want to make it clear that I am not undermining Bosnia\u2019s sovereignty, security, or stability. I support a peaceful and constitutional resolution to the current political crisis in Bosnia.\n\nAs the president of the Republic of Srpska, I strongly align with Vice President Vance\u2019s remarks in Munich and intend to act accordingly. His speech delivered a fresh and important message from Washington\u2014one that should not be diluted by conflicting statements from other U.S. officials, even if they come from Secretary Rubio.\n\nJust a few hours ago, Calin Georgescu was barred from the Romanian presidential election re-run. Do you see any parallels between the situations in Bosnia and Romania?\n\nI see clear parallels and still can\u2019t believe something like this has happened. Georgescu won the first round of the presidential election, only for it to be canceled after his victory. Now, he has been banned once again from participating in the new election out of fear that he might win. It\u2019s surreal. I am certain that the United States and its leadership do not support a world where such things are possible.\n\nI firmly believe we are witnessing the emergence of an anti-Trump bloc among European leaders. There are striking similarities between what is happening to Calin Georgescu and my own situation. Both cases appear to be orchestrated by German political and intelligence structures seeking to establish Germany as the dominant force in Europe.\n\nPresident Trump is not a strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and has also been critical of the European Union. Recently, the official X profile of the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina posted a statement criticizing your recent actions while expressing support for Bosnia\u2019s integration into the EU and NATO.\n\nAs someone who closely follows American politics, I can confidently say that President Trump is unlikely to prioritize Bosnia\u2019s membership in either organization. How do you interpret the apparent differences between President Trump\u2019s stance and the messaging from the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nThat is surprising to me. I believe these mixed messages, which contradict President Trump\u2019s America First agenda, originate from deep state bureaucrats and officials. The Biden administration has hired numerous Muslim staffers to work at the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo. In fact, over 90 percent of the embassy's staff, including its director of communications, are local Muslims.\n\nThe statements made by the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo and Secretary Rubio were unfair to Orthodox Serbs. Moreover, both were inconsistent with President Trump\u2019s America First policy.\n\nSecretary Rubio\u2019s post on X was one-sided, showing support exclusively for the Muslim side. I am not criticizing him; rather, I am inviting him to engage in dialogue. I want him to hear all three perspectives, not just that of the Bosnian Muslims, who seek to impose their rule on the country\u2019s Christian majority.\n\nWe have never advocated for war, nor have we taken any actions to provoke conflict. We stand for peace. Unfortunately, we continuously hear warmongering rhetoric from Muslim representatives. Some Bosnian Muslims have even called for NATO intervention against us.\n\nWhat message would you like to convey to President Trump and Vice President Vance?\n\nI am calling on them to help us and to prevent any form of NATO intervention in Bosnia. We do not want war\u2014we want peace. We seek to fight for our human rights through democratic means. Our goal is to restore the original interpretation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Help us overturn all illegitimate and undemocratic decisions imposed on us by President Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President Vance can play a pivotal role in ensuring the Dayton Peace Agreement is honored. If an agreement with Bosnian Muslims cannot be reached, there is no reason why all three nations\u2014Croats, Muslims, and Serbs\u2014cannot begin a dialogue about a peaceful, non-violent dissolution of Bosnia. I am ready and eager to engage with the new administration in discussions on all the challenges facing Bosnia and its future."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal appeals court will allow the Trump administration to implement directives from the president cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as an appeal of a ruling pausing those orders plays out.\n\nTwo of the three judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals panel wrote concurring opinions raising concerns about the anti-DEI directives, even as they concluded that the administration had met the bar for putting the trial judge\u2019s ruling on hold.\n\nThe circuit order is a major win for President Donald Trump, who has made the elimination of DEI programs a centerpiece of his administration.\n\nThe directives, laid out in two executive orders, instructed agencies to take steps targeting DEI programs, including those operated by government contractors. US District Judge Adam Abelson\u2019s February ruling said that the government could not freeze or cancel \u201cequity-related\u201d contracts, nor could it require recipients of grants to certify that their programs do not promote DEI. He also barred the administration from bringing False Claims Act enforcement action related to the anti-DEI certification requirement.\n\nThe 4th Circuit said it would be considering the merits of Abelson\u2019s ruling on an expedited timeline.\n\nChief Judge Albert Diaz, an Obama appointee, wrote a concurring opinion praising efforts to promote diversity, and he said \u201cthere should be room for open discussion and principled debate about DEI programs.\u201d However, he echoed a concurrence by a fellow member of the appellate panel, Judge Pamela Harris, by raising the possibility of constitutional violations depending on how agencies carry out Trump\u2019s orders. The concurring opinion from Harris, an Obama appointee as well, pointed out that some of Trump\u2019s directives appeared to be limited in scope as their language took aim specifically at \u201cconduct that violates existing federal anti-discrimination law.\u201d\n\nThe third member of the panel, Trump-appointed Judge Allison Rushing, stressed the panel\u2019s conclusions that the president\u2019s orders likely did not violate the Constitution, and she took a swipe at Diaz for praising diversity programs.\n\nThe case was brought by the city of Baltimore, two education associations and a restaurant association, who alleged various constitutional violations with the orders.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump delivered what sounded like one of his typical meandering, grievance-laden campaign speeches on Friday, but it was where he did it \u2014 inside the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 that mattered\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered what sounded like one of his typical meandering, grievance-laden campaign speeches on Friday, but it was where he did it \u2014 inside the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 that mattered.\n\nThe appearance marked Trump\u2019s clearest exertion yet of personal control over the country\u2019s federal law enforcement apparatus, which is normally run by appointees who keep at least an arm\u2019s length from the president to avoid the appearance that politics are governing prosecutorial decisions. Trump, instead, embraced the notion of the agency as his own personal tool of vengeance.\n\n\u201cAs the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,\u201d Trump told the audience, with Attorney General Pam Bondi (who is technically the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer) and FBI Director Kash Patel in the audience.\n\nOne of Trump's favorite campaign songs, \u201cYMCA,\u201d played after he wrapped up his nearly hourlong address inside the department's ceremonial Great Hall.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what Trump said, what the reality is and the significance of his words.\n\n\u201cThe same scum you have been dealing with for years. Guys like Andrew Weissman, deranged Jack Smith. There\u2019s a guy named Norm Eisen, I don\u2019t even know what he looks like. His name is Norm Eisen of CREW; he\u2019s been after me for nine years.\u201d\n\nTrump named lawyers and a legal nonprofit that he has tangled with over the years, which could serve as a roadmap for people he would like prosecuted by the officials in the room with him.\n\nTrump named lawyer Eisen, but misidentified him as running the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued to block Trump from running for reelection due to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Eisen was with the organization during part of Trump\u2019s first term but has since left.\n\nTrump rained vitriol on CREW as well as Eisen, who remains staunchly opposed to Trump and co-founded an online publication, The Contrarian, to take on the new administration. Still, Trump claimed Eisen has been \u201cviolent,\u201d which is laughable. He\u2019s a lawyer who\u2019s never used physical force toward Trump.\n\nWeissman was lead prosecutor for the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia during Trump\u2019s first term. One of the people Weissman convicted in that probe, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, watched the speech and was warmly introduced by Trump himself.\n\nTrump also name-checked Smith, who was the special prosecutor who filed charges against Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and for hoarding classified documents at his Florida resort.\n\nNotably, the president didn\u2019t name a single possible crime these lawyers or CREW committed other than opposing him.\n\n\u201cI believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they are really corrupt and they are illegal. What they do is illegal.\u201d\n\nThis was a remarkable moment \u2014 the president of the United States telling his Department of Justice that he believes the media are illegal because they write bad things about him.\n\nNeedless to say, CNN and MSNBC (which Trump tweaked by changing its initials) are not actually part of the Democratic Party. No matter if you think their coverage leans in that direction, there\u2019s no actual, legal connection.\n\nEven if there was, the First Amendment allows political groups to criticize a rival politician. It certainly allows the media to do so, regardless of any perceived ideological bias.\n\n\"What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.\u201d\n\nThis is one of Trump's favorite subjects \u2014 how he didn't really lose the 2020 election. He did, though.\n\nTrump has claimed falsely that widespread fraud cost him the 2020 election, but the evidence says otherwise. Trump lost dozens of court challenges, including some before judges he appointed, his own attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have tipped the election, and reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump contested his loss all affirmed Biden\u2019s win.\n\nIt's unclear who \u201cthe people who did this\u201d are in Trump's threat, but when a president says someone should go to jail while addressing the Department of Justice \u2014 especially about something that never happened \u2014 that's significant.\n\n\u201cI pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been grossly mistreated. We removed the senior FBI officials who misdirected resources to send SWAT teams after grandmothers and J6 hostages. And it was a great honor for me, a great honor to fire James Comey.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed he'd end what he called \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Department of Justice, but then quickly boasted of pardoning those who attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election loss on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump also boasted of firing Comey, who was the FBI director in his first term. It was one of Trump's most controversial acts then, but seems almost quaint now. The man whom Trump nominated to replace Comey, Christopher Wray, stepped aside in December after years of being targeted by Trump, who has now replaced him with Patel, a loyalist who never worked in the bureau.\n\nThe president boasting of firing top FBI officials is a clear signal to those inside the Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to scare the hell out of the judges. And they do it. How do you stop it? ... What do you do to get rid of it? You convict Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump has personally singled out judges who ruled against him for attack since he first ran for president in 2016. But, remarkably, Trump implied that the adverse legal decisions against him have been because his opponents are threatening judges.\n\nIn reality, the judge who presided over Trump\u2019s criminal in New York, Juan Merchan, received threats after Trump repeatedly attacked him and his family. Judicial organizations have reported a sharp rise in threats as Trump increasingly complained the legal system was \u201crigged\u201d against him as he fought four separate prosecutions during his campaign.\n\nTrump did accurately note negative coverage that conservative justices on the nation\u2019s highest court have received over some of their rulings and conduct. He has reason to want those justices to be sympathetic to him because several of his administration\u2019s initiatives are tangled up in litigation headed straight to the Supreme Court."
