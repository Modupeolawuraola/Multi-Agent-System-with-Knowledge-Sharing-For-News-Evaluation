            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Justice Department has placed on administrative leave a government immigration lawyer who in court this week expressed frustration at not being able to answer key questions from a judge over a mistaken deportation case, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nErez Reuveni argued the government\u2019s case in the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the government has said was sent to his native El Salvador last month due to a clerical error, despite a court order that he not be deported.\n\nReuveni said in court of the government\u2019s position: \u201cOur only arguments are jurisdictional. \u2026 He should not have been sent to El Salvador.\u201d\n\nAsked why the US couldn\u2019t simply ask for his return, Reuveni said, \u201cThe first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,\u201d adding that he did not get a direct answer.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi took issue with how Reuveni handled the case in court.\n\n\u201cAt my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,\u201d she said in a statement to CNN.\n\nBondi issued a memo on her first day as attorney general requiring lawyers to \u201czealously\u201d advocate for administration positions or face disciplinary action and potential firing.\n\nAugust Flentje, Reuveni\u2019s supervisor, was also placed on administrative leave, according to one person familiar with the matter. ABC News reported earlier Saturday that Flentje was told he had failed to supervise a subordinate. CNN has reached out to Flentje and the Justice Department for comment.\n\nReuveni didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. On LinkedIn five months ago, he posted that he had been promoted to a new position as acting deputy director at the Office of Immigration Litigation.\n\nFlentje, whose LinkedIn profile lists his title as deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation, is known for his work defending the travel ban in the first Trump administration, a role that garnered criticism from some DOJ colleagues.\n\nIn a court filing earlier this week, the Trump administration conceded that Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father of three, was deported \u201cbecause of an administrative error.\u201d That filing appeared to be the first time the administration has admitted an error related to its recent deportation flights to El Salvador, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.\n\n\u201cOn March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,\u201d the Trump administration\u2019s March 31 filing said.\n\nA Maryland judge has ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned by Monday night, but the Trump administration on Saturday filed an emergency stay attempting to block the order. The administration has said it cannot return him because he\u2019s now in Salvadoran custody.\n\nAbrego Garcia, who attorneys say fled gang violence in El Salvador more than a decade ago, had been identified by his wife in a photo of detainees entering intake at CECOT, the country\u2019s notorious mega prison.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "Austin, Texas CNN \u2014\n\nA district court judge awarded $6.6 million combined to four whistleblowers who were fired shortly after they reported Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to the FBI.\n\n\u201cBy a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d Travis County Judge Catherine Mauzy wrote in her Friday judgment, the plaintiffs proved liability, damages and attorneys fees in their complaint against the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cBecause the Office of the Attorney General violated the Texas Whistleblower Act by firing and otherwise retaliating against the plaintiff for in good faith reporting violations of law by Ken Paxton and OAG, the court hereby renders judgment for plaintiffs,\u201d Mauzy wrote.\n\nThe court found that the four Paxton aides were fired in retaliation for reporting allegations that he was using his office to accept bribes from an Austin real estate developer who employed a woman with whom Paxton was having an extramarital affair. Paxton has denied accepting bribes or misusing his office to help Nate Paul, the real estate developer.\n\nThe judgment also stated that the employees made their reports to law enforcement \u201cin good faith\u201d and that Paxton\u2019s office did not dispute any claims or damages in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIt should shock all Texans that their chief law enforcement officer, Ken Paxton, admitted to violating the law, but that is exactly what happened in this case,\u201d Tom Nesbitt, an attorney for Blake Brickman, and TJ Turner, an attorney for David Maxwell, said in a joint statement.\n\nIn a statement to the media, Paxton, a Republican, called the ruling \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cnot based on the facts or the law.\u201d He also said that his office intends to appeal the ruling.\n\nPaxton was at the center of a federal investigation after eight employees reported his office to the FBI in 2020 for bribery allegations. Paxton in 2023 agreed to a $3.3 million settlement and an apology, but no admission of wrongdoing, with four of the whistleblowers. After Paxton asked state lawmakers to fund the settlement, the Texas House rejected his request, conducted its own investigation and impeached him in 2023. He was later acquitted in the state Senate.\n\nIn November, the Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling that Paxton testify in the lawsuit.\n\nThe US Justice Department decided not to pursue its investigation into Paxton in the final weeks of the Biden administration, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nNo longer shadowed by the federal corruption investigation that hung over his rising profile in the Republican Party, Paxton is now gearing up for a potential US Senate run. Paxton, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has hinted at challenging GOP Sen. John Cornyn for more than a year but has not said when he will make a decision."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump arranged for far-right activist Laura Loomer to join him in the Oval Office this week for an extraordinary meeting that preceded a shake-up of his national security leadership, two sources familiar with their meeting told CNN.\n\nTheir sit-down came after Loomer reached Trump by phone, the sources told CNN. As a result of their call, Trump instructed staff to invite her to the White House, the sources added.\n\nWithin 24 hours of their meeting, the administration had fired the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, the United States\u2019 powerful cyber intelligence bureau, as well as staff members on the National Security Council. Loomer had advocated for their dismissal during her conversation with Trump, CNN previously reported.\n\n\u201cThis is called vetting,\u201d Loomer wrote on X early Friday, adding of the NSA leaders: \u201cTheir firings are a blessing for the American people.\u201d\n\nThe stunning series of events recalled Trump\u2019s first term, when informal advisers, fringe figures and longtime associates often bypassed traditional channels to gain direct access to the Oval Office. His aides have insisted the president\u2019s second term would be marked by discipline and structure.\n\nLoomer\u2019s previous inflammatory rhetoric has drawn rebukes from Republican leaders, and her access to then-candidate Trump was limited last fall after her appearances on the campaign trail alongside him prompted internal tensions and public criticism. Now, by securing a White House visit just 72 days into Trump\u2019s second term, Loomer has once again cast a spotlight on the external sources shaping the president\u2019s decision-making in what was supposed to be a closely guarded Oval Office.\n\nAnd it appears Loomer\u2019s work isn\u2019t finished. In the days since her meeting with Trump, Loomer has publicly accused the president\u2019s advisers of failing to block Republicans whom she sees as unfaithful to Trump from top White House and administration jobs. In response to what she calls a \u201cvetting crisis,\u201d Loomer recently announced she was starting an opposition research firm to dig into the backgrounds of executive branch hires on her own.\n\n\u201cI literally have a binder of receipts,\u201d she said in a recent podcast appearance, \u201cand I know who\u2019s loyal and I know who is disloyal.\u201d\n\nLoomer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. However, she told CNN earlier this week that she would \u201cdecline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security,\u201d she said in a statement Thursday.\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House about the meeting.\n\nAs a conservative provocateur who is fiercely loyal to Trump, Loomer has publicly positioned herself as a protector of the president against people she views as insufficiently committed to the MAGA movement and its leader. In social media posts, she shares her deep suspicions of Elon Musk and other tech billionaires who have lately cozied up to the president and is especially critical of Republicans who failed to stand by Trump after his defeat in 2020.\n\nUntil this week, she had largely operated from outside the halls of power in Washington \u2014 though not for lack of trying. Loomer, who twice ran unsuccessfully for Congress, has spent months attempting to gain access to the West Wing. On social media, she has accused the president\u2019s inner circle of pushing aside her and others whom she considers faithful Trump followers.\n\nWhile she regularly talks to Trump by phone, sources familiar with their relationship said, senior advisers had until recently largely thwarted her efforts at greater access and had limited her ability to gain an in-person audience with the president. The White House hasn\u2019t approved her attempts to secure a press credential and attend daily briefings, she has said on social media. The press office didn\u2019t respond to a CNN request for comment about the status of her application.\n\nBut the president was intrigued by Loomer\u2019s latest overture during their recent phone conversation, the sources familiar with the meeting said, which included detailed critiques of many officials serving in key intelligence agencies. After Loomer presented her case to the president in person \u2014 carrying a list of roughly a dozen names she encouraged him to dismiss over their political backgrounds \u2014 the White House moved to oust the individuals.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump acknowledged meeting with Loomer but downplayed her role in the dismissal of National Security Council staff, calling her \u201ca very strong person\u201d who \u201crecommended some people for jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody, I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nHours later, CNN reported that Trump had dismissed two more individuals flagged by Loomer, including the NSA director, Gen. Timothy Haugh, a Senate-confirmed official who also leads US Cyber Command.\n\nBut sources familiar with Loomer\u2019s Oval Office visit on Wednesday told CNN the meeting was a one-off, and they insisted her access to the president remained in check.\n\nThe firings also came amid intense internal scrutiny of national security operations following the revelation that top administration officials discussed an attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen over a Signal chat that mistakenly included a journalist. While it\u2019s unclear whether this week\u2019s dismissals were related to that incident, Trump and other top administration officials have remained wary behind the scenes of how the intelligence community is operating, CNN previously reported. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who was at the heart of the Signal scandal, was in the room Wednesday while Loomer condemned the staffers on his team.\n\nStill, it\u2019s the second time in recent weeks that Loomer has appeared to claim credit for a Trump decision. Loomer, in a mid-March social media post, accused the son of former President Joe Biden, Hunter, of vacationing in South Africa with the protection of US Secret Service agents. Asked about the allegations several days later, Trump said he \u201cjust heard about it for the first time\u201d and would \u201ctake a look at that.\u201d Shortly after, Trump wrote on Truth Social he was revoking Hunter Biden\u2019s protective service.\n\nLoomer has long occupied a place on the outer edges of Trump\u2019s inner circle, a position that brought considerable challenges for the Republican\u2019s 2024 campaign. For a time, Loomer accompanied then-candidate Trump on his private plane or met with him at his personal resort clubs, where she would share with him her theories.\n\nWhen Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 ethnicity during an especially tense interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last summer, an adviser blamed Loomer \u2014 who, leading up to Trump\u2019s appearance, baselessly accused Harris on X of hiding her Black heritage \u2014 for planting the seed. Asked by CNN last fall, Loomer did not weigh in on whether she influenced Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nLoomer notably accompanied Trump on his flight to the Republican National Convention last summer, just one day after an assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. And she was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane ahead of his September debate against Harris.\n\nHer proximity to Trump, though, soon became a source of friction. Democrats pounced and Republicans groaned when she appeared alongside Trump at a memorial service honoring those who died on September 11, 2001. Loomer had previously posted a video claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an \u201cinside job.\u201d (Loomer, in a phone interview with CNN last year, said, \u201cI\u2019ve never denied the fact that Islamic terrorists carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\u201d)\n\nAfter the controversy stirred by that appearance, advisers largely curtailed Loomer\u2019s access to Trump for the remainder of the campaign. This week, though, Loomer demonstrated her staying power as she defended Trump\u2019s firing of national security officials.\n\n\u201cThank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you,\u201d she wrote on X, \u201cand thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.\u201d"

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency is expected to take aim at the Department of Homeland Security in the coming days, seeking potentially major cuts to personnel across its agencies, including the US Secret Service, multiple sources tell CNN.\n\nDHS is bracing for what could amount to significant layoffs, four sources familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely told CNN, though no final decisions have been made, and the ultimate scale and scope has not been set.\n\nThis week, two of the sources said, there was back-and-forth negotiation and lobbying between DOGE, the White House, and Homeland Security leadership, with each of the department\u2019s components expected to be impacted differently. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is expected to be decimated, one of the sources said.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are also facing potential cuts, two of the sources said.\n\nA senior DHS official told CNN the department is \u201cdetermined to eliminate government waste that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer. Across DHS, we will be eliminating non-mission critical positions and bureaucratic hurdles that undermine our mission to secure the homeland. Secretary Noem is determined to return DHS to its core mission of keeping America safe.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to DHS and DOGE for comment. The Secret Service declined to comment.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to send an email to her department\u2019s personnel in the coming days laying out the expected cuts, with a separate email in the works detailing potential options for employees to include voluntary separations and early retirements. One of the sources made clear that Noem\u2019s name may be on that email \u2013 but it is top Trump aide Stephen Miller, DOGE and other White House staff making the key decisions.\n\nCuts to the Secret Service would come at a particularly challenging time for the agency, which has been strained by what top officials have cast as an unprecedented and dynamic threat environment, including two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump last summer. The agency has been wracked with low morale, burnout, low staffing, and retention issues.\n\nThe agency spent an unprecedented $2 million last February on a television recruiting advertisement, tapping blockbuster movie director Michael Bay for the ad.\n\nOfficials have repeatedly argued in testimony on Capitol Hill following the assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, that the agency is underfunded and under-resourced.\n\nAny cuts at the agency, one of the sources said, are likely to impact administrative and technical staff, but could also impact new hires and those who are within their probationary period, positions that are more easily cut. It is not expected, that source said, to immediately impact the agency\u2019s core missions and readiness \u2013 though it could in time, particularly if those in law enforcement roles need to backfill vacant support positions.\n\nThere is tremendous anxiety about what could ultimately take place at the USSS among rank-and-file staff, the sources said, and hesitancy to speak to reporters due to the threat of polygraph tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for the Service to execute on a strategy, which is to bolster their resources and funding \u2013 especially in the wake of the attack on President Trump in Butler. How do they build that strategy now having to reduce a workforce?\u201d questioned Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN contributor and former USSS agent.\n\nWackrow continued, \u201cThe mission is not directly impacted with what is being proposed at this moment \u2013 but it will over time. You start creating these intrinsic vulnerabilities in your workforce that could lead to another Butler.\u201d\n\nNews of the potential cuts sent shockwaves across DHS component agencies Saturday, multiples sources said, with personnel desperately seeking clarity from their managers regarding whether they might be impacted.\n\nAt the Secret Service, senior managers told personnel Saturday that DHS was conducting a downsizing assessment for each of its component agencies, sources said, but any possible cuts remained unclear. Senior Secret Service officials also told the rank-and-file they were awaiting further clarity from DHS leadership, which they hoped to have in the coming days."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA trio of election results this week have Republicans confronting a new reality: not only are they facing political headwinds as the party in power but simultaneously grappling with a dramatic reversal in the partisan preferences of the country\u2019s most reliable voters.\n\nFor years, Republicans were seen as the party that dominated lower profile elections outside presidential years, while Democratic voters were less consistent. But under President Donald Trump, Republicans worry their base has shifted to include low propensity voters who turn out for him but are not as motivated as Democrats to show up when he\u2019s not on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats have overperformed the top of the 2024 ticket in nearly every special election this year, flipped control of two state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania, halved the margins for two open US House seats in Florida and won a high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race by a resounding 10 points. While Democrats have said those results are a sign that voters are rejecting the Trump administration\u2019s agenda, some top Republicans have raised alarms about turning out the base.\n\n\u201cThe political problem on the Republican side of the aisle is how to get our base to vote in off-cycle elections,\u201d Vice President JD Vance wrote on X, adding that it was time for the GOP establishment to learn from Trump\u2019s political success.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, argued that Republicans must acknowledge that they are the party of low propensity voters, or people who don\u2019t consistently show up to vote.\n\n\u201cSpecial elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nKirk, whose organization worked to engage low propensity voters in swing states during the 2024 election cycle, said politics is an \u201cafterthought\u201d for many of their voters and Republicans needed to \u201cbegin to fully fund the infrastructure to match the Democrat machine\u201d ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nTurning out Trump loyalists who vote infrequently could be key to Republicans\u2019 electoral fortunes, especially as the president\u2019s agenda risks pushing away independent and moderate swing voters.\n\nRepublicans are also hoping to maintain control of the Virginia governor\u2019s seat, despite the state\u2019s Democratic lean and potentially build on their narrow House and Senate majorities.\n\nThe party that wins the White House historically loses seats in midterm cycle that follows, and voters have become increasingly willing to back split government \u2013 Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden all lost the House two years after first being elected.\n\nOne GOP political operative familiar with House campaigns said the party is still on offense and pointed to the 13 US House districts Trump won in 2024 that are held by Democrats. Republicans have also noted it\u2019s too early to say what the political climate, the economy or Trump\u2019s approval ratings will look like next year.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that Trump had a 43% approval rating, with 52% of Americans saying they agree tariffs on imported goods would do more harm than good and 57% viewing the president\u2019s moves to shake up the economy as too erratic.\n\nThe party of low propensity voters\n\nThroughout the Trump era, Democrats have pointed to special and off-year election victories and closer-than-expected losses as evidence of a momentum advantage. During Trump\u2019s first term, Democrats won a GOP-held Pittsburgh-area US House seat and an Alabama US Senate seat in special elections ahead of winning back the House in 2018. The party also significantly cut into GOP margins in a handful of special elections for deep-red US House seats in states such as Kansas and South Carolina.\n\nMike DuHaime, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, said Republicans would have to learn the same lesson Democrats did under Obama. Despite his 2008 and 2012 wins, Democrats suffered substantial downballot losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterms.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to turning out Republicans, it takes money, it takes a message, and it takes an exciting candidate,\u201d DuHaime said.\n\nHe pointed to Wisconsin, where Brad Schimel, a conservative state Supreme Court candidate endorsed by Trump, lost to liberal Susan Crawford. Though Schimel won 63% of the number of votes Trump received in November \u2013 exceeding the 60% mark Republicans estimated they needed to win \u2013 Crawford won 78% of the number of votes Vice President Kamala Harris received. Schimel lost despite Trump hosting a tele-rally to back him and Tesla CEO Elon Muskcombining with allied groups to spend more than $20 million to boost him.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel makes his concession speech to a crowd at his election night party on Tuesday in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. Andy Manis/AP\n\n\u201cIn Wisconsin, the money was certainly there,\u201d DuHaime. \u201cWhether or not the message and the candidate were there, that\u2019s where the question lies.\u201d\n\nSean Noble, an Arizona-based Republican strategist, said Republicans have failed over the years to build up a long-lasting get-out-the-vote infrastructure to compete with Democrats.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have an advantage over Republicans on what I would call a permanent infrastructure of turnout that Republicans have never taken the time or effort or money to really build and sustain over the long term,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2024, the Trump campaign and its allies made the risky decision to focus on turning out infrequent voters for the president. That bet paid off for the president, but Republicans in other races struggled to harness that support for themselves, even when they shared the ballot with Trump.\n\nWhile Trump won in Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin last year, the Republican Senate candidates he endorsed in those states lost after receiving several thousand fewer votes than the president. The Democratic Senate candidates were able to hold onto most of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 support or, in the case of Ruben Gallego in Arizona, surpass it.\n\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres dismissed the idea that the Republican Party as a whole had become the party most likely to benefit from turning out infrequent voters.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is president in no small part because of low propensity voters who turn out to vote for him,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to turn out to vote for other Republicans.\u201d\n\nAyres said Democrats\u2019 performance in recent special and off-year elections was reminiscent of the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats made huge gains in the House of Representatives. To avoid a similar fate next year, he said Republicans would need to avoid unpopular agenda items.\n\n\u201cYou might want to not tank the entire world economy with massive tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat might be a good start.\u201d\n\nA 2018 repeat?\n\nDemocrats have argued that the issue for Republicans isn\u2019t with infrequent voters, but with swing voters who elected Trump to lower prices and improve the economy.\n\n\u201cTheir problem is not that they plan for low propensity voters to vote in these special elections and they\u2019re not showing up,\u201d said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. \u201cWhat they\u2019re losing is Republicans, either to inaction or questioning their policies.\u201d\n\nJennifer Konfrst, Iowa\u2019s Democratic House Minority Leader, said Democrats in her state wereable to flip a Republican-held state Senate seat thanks to solid candidate recruitment \u2013 Democrat Mike Zimmer was an elected school board leader and longtime high school principal in district \u2013 and connecting with Democrats who are ready to re-engage in politics after their defeat in November.\n\n\u201cThere are some folks who have just been kind of unplugging for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are plugged back in now, and they are ready to fight.\u201d\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrats pointed to high turnout and Crawford\u2019s success in red areas as evidence that she\u2019d won over Trump voters. Crawford won ten counties that backed Trump in November, including Green Bay\u2019s Brown County, where Musk gave out two $1 million checks to voters at an event the weekend before the election.\n\nElon Musk gives a check to an audience member during a rally in support of a conservative state Supreme Court candidate in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Vincent Alban/Reuters\n\n\u201cThere were clearly MAGA voters that were voting for Brad Schimel, but there were a lot of Republican voters that were voting for Susan Crawford,\u201d Patrick Guarasci, a senior advisor to Crawford\u2019s campaign, told CNN.\n\nNational Democrats have become increasingly bullish on their chances of winning back the House after Tuesday\u2019s races.\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin said recent special elections showed \u201cvoters moving en masse towards the Democratic Party,\u201d during a press call this week.\n\nState party leaders are echoing that optimism. Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried said this week\u2019s special election results should scare any Republican who won by less than 15 pointslast November, while in Wisconsin, chair Ben Wikler said voters in his state sent a clear message: \u201cDemocrats are back.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nThe Chinese military officials in brown uniforms fan out around rows of young trees, shoveling soil into freshly dug pits. The camera pans to the most senior leaders one by one, in order of rank. But one prominent face is conspicuously absent.\n\nThe news segment, aired Wednesday night on China\u2019s state broadcaster, features a tree-planting event in the outskirts of the capital Beijing \u2013 an annual springtime tradition for the country\u2019s military leadership spanning more than four decades.\n\nBut Gen. He Weidong, the second-highest-ranking uniformed officer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, was nowhere to be seen. Nor was he named as a participant in a report by the official state news agency.\n\nGen. He\u2019s absence from the high-profile event has fueled ongoing speculation that the second-ranking vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) may have become the latest \u2013 and most senior \u2013 casualty in leader Xi Jinping\u2019s purge of the military\u2019s top ranks.\n\nAs Xi\u2019s No.2 general, He shares a long-standing relationship with the Chinese leader, dating back decades to the early days of their careers in the coastal province of Fujian.\n\nRumors about an investigation against He first surfaced among the Chinese dissident community following China\u2019s annual political meetings last month. The 67-year-old hasn\u2019t appeared in public for three weeks since the closing ceremony of the country\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature on March 11.\n\nThe Chinese government has offered little in the way of clearing the air.\n\nWhen asked about He\u2019s situation at a news briefing on March 27, Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said: \u201cThere is no information on this matter, and we are not aware of the situation.\u201d\n\nIt is now unclear what has happened to He, who also sits on the Communist Party\u2019s 24-member Politburo.\n\nThree weeks out of the public eye is not unheard of for a top general without a public-facing role and there is always a chance he resurfaces. But his no-show at a well-choreographed annual propaganda event stands out in a political system deeply attuned to the importance of symbolism.\n\n\u201cClearly the absence of one CMC vice chair is important symbolically,\u201d said James Char, a longtime PLA expert and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\nSimilar to the Communist Party Congresses and annual \u201ctwo sessions\u201d political gatherings, \u201cit\u2019s important for all the major figures that the rest of the world know of to show up to be in the same picture, because it helps to demonstrate the power and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 the unity of the party,\u201d Char said.\n\nReading the \u201ctree leaves\u201d\n\nIn the opaque world of Chinese politics, observers have long leaned on arcane signals of Communist Party traditions and protocol to interpret what is going on behind the scenes. The discipline, known as \u201ctea-leaf reading,\u201d has become more relevant than ever in Xi\u2019s era as he centralizes power into his own hands and makes the decision-making process even more obscure.\n\nAnd now, some experts are scouring this week\u2019s events for clues on the fate of one of Xi\u2019s top generals.\n\nThe annual ritual began as part of a nationwide tree-planting campaign launched by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in late 1981, following devastating floods he blamed on rampant deforestation. It was billed as a patriotic, selfless undertaking in \u201cgreening the motherland, building socialism and benefiting future generations.\u201d\n\nThe following spring, Deng, then chairman of the CMC, planted the first tree of the campaign, setting a tradition that has since been carried on by successive Chinese leaders and military top brass.\n\nWednesday marked \u201cthe 43rd consecutive year the CMC leadership has collectively participated in the voluntary tree-planting activity in the capital,\u201d said Xinhua, the state news agency.\n\nSince Xi came to power in late 2012, his two vice chairmen on the CMC had led military officers to plant trees without fail every spring \u2013 until He\u2019s rare absence on Wednesday.\n\nThe first-ranking CMC vice chairman, Gen. Zhang Youxia, attended the event, so did two other generals on the commission, Liu Zhenli and Zhang Shengmin.\n\nThe only other uniformed CMC member who did not show up was Adm. Miao Hua, who was suspended under investigation in November for \u201cserious violations of discipline\u201d \u2013 a common euphemism for corruption and disloyalty.\n\n\u201cI think He\u2019s absence is quite telling, but again, no one can be absolutely sure,\u201d Char said. \u201cThere\u2019s another school of thought, which is He Weidong was involved in the last two weeks with the preparations for the military exercises around Taiwan.\u201d\n\nStarting from Tuesday, combined forces of the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command held surprise exercises around Taiwan for two straight days, testing capabilities to blockade the self-ruling island, simulate strikes on its ports and other critical infrastructure, and launch long-range live-fire strikes.\n\nThe commander of the Eastern Theater Command from 2019 to 2022 was He. It was during his tenure that the Eastern Theater Command staged massive military drills and fired missiles around Taiwan in August 2022, in retaliation against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei.\n\nA prolonged absence from public view does not always signal trouble for Chinese officials. Some have resurfaced and resumed their duties. It\u2019s also not uncommon for officials to be taken in for questioning by graft busters to assist investigations into colleagues.\n\nLast November, Defense Minister Dong Jun was reported to be under investigation for corruption by the Financial Times, citing US officials. China\u2019s Defense Ministry dismissed the report as a \u201csheer fabrication.\u201d Dong reemerged in public a week later. The minister was also seen attending Wednesday\u2019s tree-planting event on the state broadcaster.\n\nWhen Chinese leader Xi Jinping began his third term in 2022, he stacked the Central Military Commission with six loyalists. Now, one of them has been expelled from the Communist Party for corruption, another was suspended under investigation, and a third missed a high-profile event this week. Yue Yuewei/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nMilitary purges\n\nAfter coming to power, Xi consolidated control over the world\u2019s largest military by taking down powerful generals from rival factions and replacing them with allies and loyal proteges.\n\nBut a decade on, having structurally overhauled the People\u2019s Liberation Army and stacked its top ranks with his own men, Xi is still knee-deep in his seemingly endless struggle against graft and disloyalty \u2013 and is increasingly turning against his own handpicked loyalists.\n\nSince the summer of 2023, more than a dozen high-ranking figures in China\u2019s defense establishment have been ousted in a sweeping purge that focused on the country\u2019s nuclear force and equipment procurement, including two defense ministers promoted to the CMC by Xi.\n\nThe ongoing turmoil roiling the senior ranks of the PLA has raised questions over Xi\u2019s ability to end systemic corruption in the military and enhance its combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201cRecurring purges of the senior-most PLA leaders indicate that Xi Jinping distrusts his officer corps,\u201d said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the RSIS.\n\n\u201cThe constant removal of so many senior officers, as well as the extent of corruption running to the very top undoubtedly has an effect on the PLA\u2019s morale, and likely also its military capabilities,\u201d Thompson added.\n\nBut some analysts noted that by this point, the PLA may have well become accustomed to the shake-ups in its high command.\n\n\u201cLeadership purges in the PLA seem to have become normalized to a point that it\u2019s just part and parcel of being the PLA,\u201d said Collin Koh, another research fellow at RSIS.\n\nThe Chinese military may have started to grow accustomed to the purges \u2013 to a point where it is able to isolate them from its daily operational activities and go on with business as usual, Koh noted.\n\n\u201cIt does not necessarily mean that because of the purges, the PLA has started to relent on readiness. These purges might potentially have the effect of reminding the PLA to do their work better \u2013 if anything, if you want to escape the purges, then one way to do that is to obey what the party is telling you, which is to be prepared for conflict,\u201d he said.\n\nA close confidant\n\nLike Miao, He is widely believed to have forged close personal ties with Xi during their overlapping years in Fujian, where the future Chinese leader was rising through the ranks as a local official in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBoth He and Miao spent most of their early career serving in the former 31st Group Army in Fujian, which became a major power base for Xi. A string of military officers hailing from the 31st Group Army have been fast-tracked for promotion since Xi took power in late 2012.\n\nGen. He was no exception. In 2013, he was promoted to commander of Jiangsu Military District; less than a year later, he became commander of the Shanghai Garrison. In 2016, he was promoted yet again to command ground forces of the Western Theater Command, which oversees China\u2019s border with India.\n\nHe was promoted to full general in 2017, when he became commander of the Eastern Theater Command, responsible for leading any military invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nBut the ultimate sign of Xi\u2019s trust in He came at the 20th Party Congress in 2022, when He landed the CMC vice chairmanship \u2013 an unusually rapid rise for an official who hadn\u2019t served on the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nDuring that leadership reshuffle, Xi stacked the CMC with six loyalists. If confirmed to be under investigation, He would be the powerful military body\u2019s first sitting vice chairman to be purged by Xi and the third member on the current CMC to fall from grace.\n\nThe last time a sitting CMC vice chair was purged was more than three decades ago, when then-Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was ousted for sympathizing with student protesters in the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement.\n\n\u201cWhat happens finally to He Weidong gives us a window into how the political system in China is being restructured further under Xi Jinping,\u201d Char said, noting the PLA\u2019s reform of its rigid political structure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the system now is irreplaceable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what a political strong man does. He\u2019s ruthless\u2026 he\u2019s continuously purging his own ranks to keep his generals on their toes.\u201d"
