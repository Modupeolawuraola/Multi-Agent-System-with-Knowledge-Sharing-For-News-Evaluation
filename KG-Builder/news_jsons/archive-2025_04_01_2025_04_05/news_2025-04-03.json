            "full_content": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday officially fulfilled a campaign promise to unleash sweeping tariffs, a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war and prompted a major question about what has become the centerpiece of his economic agenda: What\u2019s his endgame?\n\nIn both size and scope, Trump\u2019s ultimate blueprint for global tariffs \u2014 a 10% baseline tariff on virtually every country, with higher numbers on countries with which the United States has larger trade deficits \u2014 was more than most expected. It has left global financial markets tumbling and Trump\u2019s Republican supporters trying to thread the political needle of not criticizing him while also understanding the economic peril the tariff plan may usher in ahead of 2026 midterm elections in which the GOP will try to defend its slim House and Senate majorities.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has so far not had a clear message to either explain the strategy behind the tariffs that his political allies can echo or his thought process behind the decision to go much further than even supporters were expecting.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, multiple elements of the sweeping measures made it seem as if the administration rushed through the process \u2014 including its decision to levy tariffs on uninhabited islands and its initially listing tariff numbers on the White House list published Thursday that were different from the ones on the chart Trump held in the Rose Garden on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks about his tariffs Wednesday at the White House as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick holds a chart showing the rates. Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images\n\nOne day after the announcement, Trump was not helping provide any of that clarity, posting cryptic messages on Truth Social that the \u201cpatient lived,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. economy, and that the \u201coperation is over,\u201d though the tariffs have yet to be imposed.\n\n\u201cTHE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,\u201d he posted on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 1,600 points. \u201cTHE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE.\u201d\n\n\u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump doubled down on the analogy in defending his move to reporters who asked about the financial markets\u2019 tanking one day after his tariff announcement.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an operation like when a patient gets operated on.\u201d\n\nTrump at various points has framed the tariff plan as a revenue generator for the country, saying last week that the tariffs would raise \u201cbillions of dollars, even trillions of dollars, coming into our country.\u201d At the same time, though, he has discussed them in terms of \u201cfairness,\u201d the idea that they could be used as a tool to rebalance the global economy, which, according to Trump, has been plagued by foreign nations\u2019 taking advantage of the United States.\n\nTrump has long viewed a trade deficit as a \u201csubsidy\u201d the United States provides another country. Economists have almost uniformly rejected that idea, pointing out that many countries are either too small or too poor to buy enough U.S. goods to offset their exports.\n\nThe sheer size of the tariff proposal and the lack of clear communication from the administration have left some Trump supporters skeptical and unsure what\u2019s coming next.\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d a Trump supporter and 2024 donor said when asked what they thought Trump\u2019s end goal was. \u201cThis is much larger than I think most thought would happen during the campaign. I guess the best case is he gets some concessions from countries quickly and pulls back. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide said White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller spoke at a lunch with Senate chiefs of staff Thursday to address concerns. This person said Miller handled the tough questioning well and made strong points about the national security rationale behind reshoring critical supply chains, given the Covid crisis.\n\nBut this person said the White House has yet to offer effective messaging on other fronts related to the wide-ranging tariffs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got the broad, overarching theme down of what they\u2019re trying to say with reorienting the economy,\u201d this person said. \u201cThe difficult part of this is what do you say to the small business that says these tariffs are going to put me under. And I\u2019ve yet to hear a compelling talking point on that.\u201d\n\nThe tariffs give congressional Republicans even more urgency to pass tax cuts to alleviate some of the pressures of the tariffs, said this person, who believes Trump is \u201cwilling to make a deal\u201d on the trade measures, though.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump views everything as a negotiation, right?\u201d this person said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of his worldview. So I think this is a negotiation, and there\u2019s going to be countries that come to the table one by one and make a deal to do business with the No. 1 economy in the world.\u201d\n\nSince Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Trump advisers have been dispatched to do rounds of media interviews to explain the plan. At times, the explanations have only muddied the water.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN on Thursday morning that Wall Street should \u201ctrust President Trump\u201d and that no level of negotiation by other countries would reduce or eliminate the outlined plan before the tariffs go into effect.\n\n\u201cThe president made it clear yesterday this is not a negotiation, this is a national emergency,\u201d she said.\n\nWhite House talking points obtained by NBC News also emphasized that the tariffs were not a negotiating tool.\n\nThe message about \u201cnot a negotiation,\u201d however, has been contradicted by Trump\u2019s own economic advisers \u2014 who insist the move is part of a negotiating ploy to bring back what they call \u201cfair trade\u201d \u2014 as well as his own family and even Trump himself.\n\n\"The tariffs give us great power to negotiate. Always have,\" Trump told reporters Thursday on Air Force One.\n\nTrump\u2019s son Eric posted Thursday morning on X: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump. The first to negotiate will win \u2014 the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life\u2026\u201d\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday night that the tariffs would prompt negotiations by foreign trade partners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to imagine that a lot of these countries are not going to like the tariffs that go into effect tonight at midnight, and they are going to want to negotiate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think I\u2019m wrong?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that he was not part of tariff talks within the administration and was not sure whether negotiations with foreign countries would happen before the baseline tariffs take effect Saturday.\n\n\u201cI am not part of the negotiations, so we will see,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a lot of calls. I\u2019m just not sure there will be negotiations.\u201d\n\nThough the announcement did broadly fulfill a Trump campaign promise to institute tariffs, it is also seemingly in contradiction with another big message he used on the campaign trail: that he would lower prices.\n\n\u201cWhen I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one,\u201d Trump said in August.\n\nThat theme has transformed in recent weeks as the impact tariffs would be likely to have on the cost of most consumer goods came into view. The administration now says that its tariff-focused economic policy will lead to some \u201cshort-term pain\u201d for consumers but that it is all part of a larger plan to usher in what Trump has called the \u201cGolden Age of America.\u201d\n\nIt is the message being echoed by Trump\u2019s most staunch congressional allies, even those concerned about economic and political blowback.\n\n\u201cSometimes in business you have to have short-term pain to have long-term gain, and we don\u2019t think this is even going to be that long of a short term, if it is at all,\u201d Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La, acknowledged to reporters that the Trump administration might have to \u201crecalibrate\u201d if the original tariff plans prove negative for the domestic economy.\n\n\u201cIf they make things better, they should want more. If it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the tariffs end up hurting America, I think you\u2019ll see President Trump recalibrate.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans members of Congress, it has become a delicate balancing act. They are trying not to criticize Trump while keeping an eye toward the 2026 midterms and taking into consideration recent polling that has found the tariff plan to be increasingly unpopular.\n\nA CBS/YouGov poll released this week found that 55% of respondents feel Trump is focusing too much on tariffs, while 64% think he is not focused enough on lowering prices. A Fox News poll released last month found similar sentiment, with 53% of registered voters saying tariffs \u201churt the economy.\u201d\n\nEven before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, voters have increasingly questioned Trump\u2019s economic agenda. Last month, an NBC News survey found Trump underwater on the economy for the first time in either of his presidential administrations.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, blasted Trump and his White House as officials say Americans merely need to trust Trump\u2019s instincts on trade as the market takes a nosedive.\n\n\u201cIt is insane to me that the stock market has plummeted, economists are sounding the alarm that we\u2019ll plunge head-first into a recession, 900 workers were laid off from Stellantis in Indiana and right here in Michigan and the Trump White House has the gall to call this \u2018Liberation Day,\u2019\u201d said Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who announced a bid for an open U.S Senate seat Wednesday.\n\nDespite the polling numbers, most Republicans are maintaining faith in Trump\u2019s trade agenda. They include Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., who said he understands the concerns but trusts Trump to protect West Virginians.\n\n\u201cYou've got to grow,\u201d Justice said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I believe our president\u2019s trying to do. I mean, we\u2019re not making anything. We have to grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet it play out,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens, especially in the next seven days. You\u2019ll see a lot of activity in the next seven days, a lot of different things.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, our Capitol Hill team explores how Republicans are joining with Democrats in efforts to check President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Plus, Allan Smith dives into the success Democrats have found in elections so far this year.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n\u2014 Adam Wollner\n\nLawmakers in both parties ramp up their efforts to rein in Trump on tariffs\n\nBy Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong\n\nThe fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive new tariffs has spurred Congress into action, with a growing number of Republicans joining Democrats to express interest in using their power to restrain him.\n\n1. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced a bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., that would reassert Congress\u2019 authority and slap restrictions on the president\u2019s power to levy tariffs.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., praised Grassley for the bill because \u201che does believe that we\u2019re a coequal branch.\u201d He said he\u2019d vote for it, though it\u2019s unclear if the bill will be brought to the Senate floor.\n\n2. That move came after four Senate Republicans delivered a rare rebuke to Trump on Wednesday evening, joining with every Democrat to pass a measure to revoke his tariffs on Canada. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the author of the resolution, said he\u2019s looking to build on that success with more bills to block Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nHe said \u201cmany more\u201d than four Republicans were interested in his resolution than ultimately voted for it, predicting that more will come aboard \u201cas the economic reality sets in.\u201d\n\n3. Across the Capitol, senior House Democrats said they were looking to pass a resolution halting Canadian tariffs, similar to what the Senate voted on this week. Since Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is reluctant to show any daylight with Trump, Democrats are exploring an end run around House GOP leaders.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said he would file what\u2019s known as a discharge petition, a legislative tool that would allow supporters to bypass GOP leaders and force a vote on legislation if they can secure 218 signatures. At least one moderate Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he would consider supporting it.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nStocks plunge: Major U.S. stock indexes on Thursday saw their worst one-day drops since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Rob Wile reports.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 4.8%, while the Nasdaq fell 6% \u2014 both their worst since 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 4%, or more than 1,600 points \u2014 its worst sell-off since 2022.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t budge: Still, Trump downplayed any panic over his new tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nFollow live tariffs coverage \u2192\n\nDemocratic performance is improving in a slew of elections this year, as a weary party looks for signs of hope\n\nBy Allan Smith\n\nDemocrats have spent the first months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration wandering the political wilderness \u2014 facing record-low popularity while competing factions battle over how exactly to take on the president.\n\nAnd yet, in special election after special election so far this year, Democrats are faring miles better against Republican opponents than they did last fall in Trump\u2019s faceoff with Kamala Harris.\n\nIn 16 special state legislative and congressional elections held so far this year, Democrats have bettered their margin of victory or defeat compared to the 2024 Trump-Harris battle by an average of about 11.5 points, according to data collected by the political site The Downballot. The Democrat overperformed in 14 of those 16 contests, including flipping deep-red state Senate districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania.\n\nThose trends continued Tuesday. In Florida, though Republicans comfortably held on to two very pro-Trump House seats, Democrats improved on their margin of defeat in the 1st District by 22 points and by 16 points in the 6th District compared to Harris\u2019 results there last fall.\n\nAnd in the high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race that earned the most national attention of any of the contests held so far this year, liberal candidate Susan Crawford defeated conservative candidate Brad Schimel by 10 points, just months after Trump won the battleground state by less than a point. More than 2.36 million voters turned out in that race, only 300,000 or so fewer than did in the 2022 midterms.\n\nThe election results have injected a jolt of confidence in Democrats, who\u2019ve had little to celebrate since Trump\u2019s win in November and as he and Elon Musk aggressively pursue substantial cuts to federal programs and workforces.\n\nRead more from Allan \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's other top stories \u27a1\ufe0f Loom-ing pressure: Trump fired at least three National Security Council officials this week after far-right activist Laura Loomer met with the president and expressed dissatisfaction with some members of his national security team.

            "full_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants Americans to see history his way, historians be damned.\n\nOn the one hand, Trump is actively trying to forbid any reevaluation of American racial history, on campuses and in museums, to spare the country any \u201cnational shame\u201d for its stained past.\n\nOn the other hand, he is actively rewriting economic history to convince Americans that everything they\u2019ve been taught is wrong and that his jarring new tariff policy won\u2019t be the largest tax hike in American history, as some economists and fellow Republicans argue.\n\nThe accepted version of history, which you might, or might not, recall from Ben Stein\u2019s history teacher in \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d is that Congress raised tariffs with the Smoot-Hawley tariff act in 1930 in an effort to \u201calleviate the effects of the Great Depression.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d Stein asked the class. \u201cAnyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work and the United States, sank deeper into the Great Depression.\u201d\n\nBored Kids in the Classroom \"Anyone? Anyone?\": Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)\n\nTrump took the opposite view Wednesday, telling Americans that if only Congress had stuck to tariffs, the Great Depression \u201cwould have been a much different story.\u201d\n\nThat Trump should need to goose up the facts to re-educate the population maybe shouldn\u2019t be surprising from the leader of a movement built on a backward-looking promise to make the country \u201cgreat again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a 20th century president in a 21st century economy who wants to take us back to the 19th century,\u201d wrote Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth economics professor, on X.\n\nIrwin is the author of multiple books, including \u201cClashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy.\u201d We talked last year, when he gave me a crash course in US tariff history that bore almost no resemblance to what Trump told Americans on Wednesday.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Trump described history, with some added context.\n\n\u201cFrom 1789 to 1913, we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been.\u201d Trump\n\nTrump didn\u2019t say what he meant by \u201cproportionately the wealthiest,\u201d but by any standard definition of the word wealth, he\u2019s not on solid ground.\n\nBy the numbers, the US today is an extremely wealth country, as former Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican, explained on Fox Business as he trashed Trump\u2019s tariff plan.\n\n\u201cFor all this discussion about how badly we\u2019ve been abused and ripped off and how terrible it\u2019s been, well, we\u2019re the world\u2019s biggest economy with four percent of the world\u2019s population,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cWe have 25 percent of the world\u2019s economic output. We are the biggest agricultural exporter in the world. We \u2013 our manufacturing, domestic manufacturing is at an all-time high. We\u2019re doing it with fewer workers, mostly because automation has allowed us to do it much more productively.\u201d\n\nAmericans are wealthy in terms of a standard of living. Most people today have indoor toilets, air conditioning, access to modern grocery stores, vaccines and carry a super computer around in their pocket. Back then, pretty much nobody had any of those things.\n\nThere was no Medicare of Social Security, so older people were left to fend for themselves at a level modern Americans would not understand.\n\n\u201cIn the 1880s, they established a commission to decide what they were going to do with the vast sums of money they were collecting. We were collecting so much money so fast, we didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Isn\u2019t that a nice problem to have?\u201d Trump\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what commission Trump is referring to. A tariff commission in 1883 under President Chester A. Arthur recommended lowering tariffs, but was ignored by Congress. The Constitution puts Congress in charge of tariffs, but lawmakers have, over the years, handed much of this authority to the president.\n\nSurpluses of the 1880s probably had more to do with the government being much smaller. Things like Medicare and Social Security, the biggest drain on US tax dollars today, did not exist and the US military, the largest recipient of discretionary funding, was a fraction of what it is today.\n\nTrump has also lionized President William McKinley, who before he was president pushed for the McKinley Tariff, by which Congress raised tariffs in the 1890s. Voters perceived the tariff as benefiting the wealthy and Republicans subsequently lost the House in one of the biggest power swings in US history.\n\nThe Stanford professor emeritus Richard White told me in a Q&A about the Gilded Age that there are structural differences between the country in the 19th Century and the country today that make these comparisons extremely difficult to make.\n\n\u201cOne of the things McKinley was trying to do, and the Republicans were trying to do, was to raise the tariff in order to reduce the federal deficit by making the tariffs so high, it would take down tax revenue because they really were worried about the deflation that was coming with the Gold Standard,\u201d White said.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re in a very different situation, because now we have great deficits and the idea that the tariff is going to bring in revenue is really not something that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d White added.\n\nIn the 1880s, the US was rapidly industrializing and many other countries, which are industrializing today, were not yet on that path.\n\n\u201cThen in 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government.\u201d Trump\n\nThe reasons for the income tax are pretty simple. Congress tried to establish an income tax earlier in a bill where it tried to lower tariffs, according to the National Archives. But the Supreme Court struck the income tax down. Earlier in US history, an income tax had been temporarily enacted to pay for the Civil War. Enacting a Constitutional Amendment requires the assent of three quarters of states, so this was the will of the majority at the time.\n\nTrump frequently says foreign countries pay tariffs. It\u2019s not true. US importers pay them, but really US consumers and businesses end up footing the bill.\n\n\u201cThen in 1929, it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy. It would have been a much different story.\u201d Trump\n\nHe must be referring here to the aforementioned Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, passed not long after the 1929 stock market crash, according to the National Archives, which notes that historians debate what role the Smoot-Hawley tariff, or already in-place tariffs played in causing or deepening the Great Depression."

            "full_content": "Photo: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nShortly after noon on Thursday, the staff at Vanity Fair received an email from Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Anna Wintour inviting them to a meeting with editor-in-chief Radhika Jones. To the surprise of almost everyone, including most of the magazine\u2019s senior-most editors, a visibly emotional Wintour announced that Jones would be stepping down after seven years at the post. As Wintour spoke for a few minutes about Jones\u2019s accomplishments, she was seemingly on the verge of tears, according to two sources present. Jones followed up the meeting with a memo in which she said she had accomplished \u201cvirtually all\u201d of the goals she had set out to achieve when she started the job in 2017, adding, \u201cI have always had a horror of staying too long at the party.\u201d\n\nIn truth, the party has been over for quite a while. Jones is purportedly leaving of her own accord. She has been privately discussing doing as much since last fall, according to a person familiar with the situation. But, inevitably, rumors are swirling inside One World Trade about whether there\u2019s more to the story, given the long slow slide Vanity Fair (where I used to work) has undergone since its heyday at the top of the magazine industry. \u201cI have to imagine that there were more than enough financial reasons to warrant her leaving,\u201d one Cond\u00e9 staffer said. \u201cWe never get good news on the traffic front. It just seems like a constant precipitous decline. We never meet our benchmarks, and there\u2019s just no stated mission or mandate for what we should be doing.\u201d\n\nJones, who prior to leading Vanity Fair was an editorial director of the New York Times\u2019 books department and, before that, a top editor at Time, will stay on until June. Wintour will now have to appoint her successor. If Cond\u00e9 chooses someone within Vanity Fair, executive digital director Mike Hogan will likely be in the mix, as he was last time Vanity Fair was looking for a new top editor after Graydon Carter stepped down. Wintour could also tap a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to lead it, like Mark Guiducci, who before joining Vogue ran Vice\u2019s Garage magazine, or Will Welch, a Wintour favorite, who runs GQ.\n\nIn her memo, Jones spoke proudly of her major achievements, such as running the magazine\u2019s \u201cepic party machine,\u201d which includes its vaunted Oscars party, and commissioning Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Breonna Taylor for the cover. But the mood at Vanity Fair, as at many other Cond\u00e9 publications, has for months been one of general malaise. The weekly features meetings, which Jones used to run but handed over to two of her top editors last year, have been particularly brutal of late \u2014 \u201can astounding dearth of ideas,\u201d as one staffer put it. Cond\u00e9\u2019s unofficial internal slogan for the past few years has basically been \u201cDo more, but with less!\u201d Now, for the time being anyway, they\u2019ll have to do more with one less editor."

            "full_content": "Tariff Man. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions to President Trump\u2019s big new protectionist push have been mostly negative. From economists, judgments have largely ranged from skeptical to horrified. In the political realm, Democrats have been almost uniformly hostile, while Republicans have generally fallen silent or hoped for the best. From the generally Trump-aligned business community, the glass-half-empty opinion is that the president\u2019s program is so obviously ill advised that he will eventually curtail or abandon it. The glass-half-empty faction is freaking out over its terrible mistake in assuming Trump didn\u2019t mean what he said (over and over) about the need for high permanent tariffs until the end of time.\n\nIf Trump persists in this strategy to build a new Fortress America, the consequences for daily life in this country will determine whether it represents a political catastrophe of historic dimensions, a consolidation of MAGA policies, or something in between. But it\u2019s worth taking a look at public opinion as it existed before \u201cLiberation Day\u201d to determine if the public is predisposed to support or oppose the new universal tariff program before the inevitable international backlash and domestic fallout are known.\n\nFirst of all, Trump\u2019s public standing generally (at least outside his GOP base) is mixed at best and slowly but steadily deteriorating. His job-approval average according to Silver Bulletin is currently at 46.6 percent positive and 49.9 percent negative, or a net minus-3.3 percent. When he began his second term, it was at 51.6 percent positive and 40 percent negative, or plus-11.6 percent. So that\u2019s a 14.9 percent erosion of his popularity in just over ten weeks. Since Trump did not have (and did not pursue) any honeymoon with Democrats, and Republicans remain thrilled with him, much of this deterioration is with the independent voters who were crucial to the 47th president\u2019s 2024 victory. An April 2 Reuters-Ipsos poll, for example, showed Trump deep underwater with independents for a job-approval ratio of 37 percent positive and 59 percent negative.\n\nAt a more general level than tariffs or trade policies, Trump\u2019s job-performance ratings for handling the economy \u2014 by general assent the most important issue in 2024 \u2014 have been mediocre with ratings on prices and inflation coming in significantly lower. An April 1 Economist-YouGov survey showed a 45 percent to 48 percent approval ratio on Trump\u2019s handling of \u201cjobs and the economy,\u201d which slipped to 40 percent to 53 percent on \u201cinflation/prices.\u201d A March 11 NBC News poll gave Trump a 44 percent approval to 54 percent disapproval job performance rating on \u201cthe economy\u201d and a 42 percent approval to 55 percent disapproval rating on \u201cinflation and the cost of living.\u201d Most impressively, a March 31 CBS News survey showed 64 percent of Americans thought Trump\u2019s focus on lowering prices was \u201cnot enough.\u201d\n\nAnother potential danger sign on an issue adjacent to the economy has been the deteriorating popularity of DOGE leader Elon Musk, whose profile has become exceptionally high during the first weeks of the Trump administration. The April 2 Reuters-Ipsos survey assessed Musk\u2019s job performance at 39 percent favorable and 57 percent unfavorable (with 43 percent very unfavorable). A March 27 Marquette Law School national poll showed Musk at 38 percent favorable and 60 percent unfavorable (with 46 percent very unfavorable). This is a growing problem for Trump.\n\nDrilling down to public attitudes about Trump\u2019s tariffs, the Washington Post has a good summary of recent data:\n\nA CBS News-YouGov poll last week found 56 percent of Americans oppose \u201cplacing new tariffs on goods imported from other countries.\u201d A Fox News poll in March found most registered voters supported tariffs on products from China (55 percent). But the same poll found most opposed tariffs on products from Mexico (56 percent) and Canada (61 percent).\n\nA Post-Ipsos poll in February, the Fox poll and a Reuters/Ipsos poll all found about 7 in 10 saying tariffs will make products U.S. consumers buy more expensive.\n\nThe Fox poll and a separate Marquette poll found majorities saying that tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy. And the Post-Ipsos poll found more Americans saying tariffs would hurt rather than help both U.S. manufacturers and workers.\n\nTo be clear, these not-so-positive assessments are being measured before prices have risen on any of the items affected by Liberation Day. They do not suggest Americans expect a good outcome for Trump\u2019s trade war. And unlike many other aspects of the economy, negative consequences from tariffs imposed by Trump personally with a blare of trumpets can\u2019t and won\u2019t be blamed on his predecessor. It\u2019s his show now."

            "full_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nAn adrift Democratic Party received a much-needed jolt of energy this week when Democratic senator Cory Booker took to the Senate floor to speak in protest of the Trump administration\u2019s policies, vowing to hold it for as long as he was physically able. Over the course of 25 hours, Booker railed against the Trump administration\u2019s handling of immigration and education and the looming threats to Social Security and Medicare, urging his fellow Democrats to seize this \u201cmoral moment\u201d and, in the words of the late congressman John Lewis, to get into some \u201cgood trouble.\u201d Booker\u2019s marathon speech officially broke the record set decades earlier by South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond, the notorious segregationist who took part in a day-long filibuster in protest of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nOne day after his record-breaking speech, I spoke to Booker about why he decided to speak, how his Republican colleagues responded, and where Democrats go from here.\n\nWhat compelled you to do this?\n\nMy constituents and people around the country. People who are hurting as a result of his policies, people who\u2019ve lost health care or have had their Social Security payments undermined by the service cuts that they\u2019re doing, the veterans that are being laid off, the people around the world who, frankly because America is not there, are facing the most incomprehensible horrors. People were demanding that I do more and the demand was sinking into me that even though we were trying \u2014 my staff is working, for these last 71 days, working longer hours doing everything we can \u2014 it was not enough. As I said in my speech, it was insufficient. Especially after the very contentious fight over the continuing resolution that, I think, left a lot of people just even more discouraged with what Democrats were doing. I just said, okay, I\u2019ve got to think really hard here about other tactics and strategies I could put forward.\n\nYour remarks focused on the impact that the White House\u2019s policies are having on everyday Americans. You shared letters from your own constituents about their concerns. What has the reaction from voters been like?\n\nI mean, that was very important to me. I didn\u2019t want to be one elected leader just talking about another elected leader. I really wanted to elevate the voices of the people affected. I wanted to center their stories. I wanted to try to trigger a more courageous empathy. When people heard these courageous people who would write to me and laid bare their pride, their hurt, their anger, their frustrations, their fears. I mean, those stories were so raw and so real and such a damning indictment of how this administration\u2019s policies over the last 71 days are really affecting people. I\u2019ve just learned that in my whole career \u2014 and I\u2019m talking beyond my career in elected office \u2014 that speaking from the heart, speaking your own personal truth, is so compelling. And so, that was what we decided to do. A few things shaped the way we organized our official remarks, the ones that were written out. I ended up speaking a lot even away from the binders we\u2019d prepared. But we said, number one, we want to center the voices of Americans who are affected. There were some elected leaders, there were some policy people, think tanks and the like. And then the number-two guiding thing that we said is we want to elevate voices from the right. That we want to quote Republican governors. We want to quote Republican think tanks. We want to talk about everybody from the Manhattan Institute to the Cato Institute and how they themselves are condemning a lot of the actions that are being taken because we didn\u2019t want this to become a call to the Democratic base. No, we wanted to speak to a higher moral calling, to common sense, to the character of our country which, I believe, is far beyond the partisan lines that divide us. I think the character of our country is something that we share in common. It lays the groundwork for our common cause and common purpose.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, one of your Republican colleagues, made a point to congratulate you on Twitter after you broke the Senate record while the White House, unsurprisingly, mocked your speech. What has the response been across the aisle, and has there been anything that\u2019s surprised you?\n\nThis may surprise you, but it has been extraordinarily affirming and really sincere extensions of congratulations, respect, and even comments I would describe as admiring of the physical feat. You saw Lisa\u2019s tweet, but she came up to me at the end and gave me a huge hug. We joked about it today because I was smelling quite ripe, and it was fortifying to me. Senator John Curtis, who was in the chair, slipped me a note beforehand and nobody could see it on TV, but in the chamber, you could see that as I thanked him, he put his hand over his heart and gave me a nod.\n\nI live in a community as a senator where I try to focus on policies and not people. I try to focus on the issues and elevate those, and not demean and degrade other people. I\u2019ve learned that I may have fierce disagreements with you, but if I can find lines of humanity and connection, I can draw upon those at times to get to a compromise. I can draw upon those at times to even get some latitude in getting something done that I might not be able to get done if I didn\u2019t treat people well. And that\u2019s why in the speech, it was important to me to talk about not hating the opposition, about not letting somebody drag you so low as you become what you\u2019re working against.\n\nI saw Curtis on the steps today. It was the first time since I saw him at the end and he kept the parliamentarian\u2019s final instructions to him. He pulled it out and he read it, and he goes, \u201cYou know what? I think this is something that I\u2019m going to put in my scrapbook. Would you sign it?\u201d And then when I went to sign it, I saw it had his handwriting on it \u2014 in quotes, the words \u201cno hate.\u201d And I looked at that and I knew he wrote that in real time. I said at the end about Strom Thurmond that as much as this segregationist was doing everything he could, not just so nobody like me would serve in the Senate, but that nobody like me would get equality \u2014 that moment when I said we shouldn\u2019t hate him, no hate, I think Curtis wrote it down.\n\nI have to say, the journey of 25 hours was healing for me. It was great to be able to confess to my constituents and, indeed my country, that Democrats have made real mistakes. We are where we are because of a lot of mistakes that people made, not just Democrats, but others. It was good to confess to people that I had hit a point where I knew that what I was doing was inadequate. It was insufficient, I think was the word I used. That was important to say on the journey that I took that night towards trying to be someone that is making a difference in inspiring, empowering, encouraging, or even begging all of us to do more in what I believe is a moral moment in our country.\n\nSome have likened your speech to a stunt, pointing out that it didn\u2019t block legislation or a nomination, for example. What were you actually hoping to achieve?\n\nFirst of all, I wanted to take the floor and as I said explicitly, to let us not do business as usual. This is not normal. What we\u2019re seeing is not normal and it\u2019s important for me that we don\u2019t normalize it. And I wanted to take an opportunity to speak directly to the challenges that this nation is facing in the most detailed way possible, to bring before the American people the voices of those who are really suffering and struggling as a result of the decisions this President has made. So, I wanted to disrupt the normal order and center the people in this country who are struggling and try to call to the conscience of the country for all of us to see them, hear them, and do more for them, for each other, for ourselves, for our country.\n\nDo I feel like I achieved our goal of raising consciousness, of breaking through with a really powerful message, and elevating, really breaking through with a powerful message, and the powerful voices of my own constituents? I succeeded far beyond what I thought possible. The fact that hundreds of millions of people on one platform tuned in. Or when I sat down today and my staff started playing me news and the coverage from multiple different countries. The letters I\u2019m getting, from text messages to emails to what I see online when I\u2019m going there \u2014 I\u2019m seeing people that are not just saying kind things about me, but I\u2019m seeing people who are showing their new conviction to fight, to stand up, to do what I asked people to do, in the spirit of our ancestors, and one in particular, to cause good trouble.\n\nYour speech comes at a moment when voters are questioning the direction of the Democratic Party, with many feeling as if their leaders are playing it too safe. What can and should the party do to meet the urgency of this moment?\n\nIt\u2019s hard when I hear that. We\u2019re not a homogeneous Democratic Party. I was texting with a state legislator today in Iowa. I communicate regularly with my state attorney general, who\u2019s a Democrat. People treat Democrats and Republicans as homogeneous organizations controlled by one leader. There\u2019s a lot of diversity there. But here in Washington, it\u2019s clear. The Democrats who are in the House and the Senate are faced with legislation that we don\u2019t have the numbers to stop. But that should not stop us from being imaginative, creative in the way that we try to get that legislation stopped. What I mean by that is we did not have the numbers to stop Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to take down the Affordable Care Act, but when we started engaging with other leaders, people around the country to elevate the voices of Americans \u2014 when little lobbyists, these beautiful children with disabilities were rolling their wheelchairs around the halls of Congress, when breast-cancer survivors and people with rare diseases were showing up with their medical equipment in tow to talk about preexisting conditions \u2014 suddenly, this love army came out from around this country demanding that Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t let this legislation pass. And minds were changed.\n\nSo, this is a moment that demands all of us to figure out how can we be better catalytic agents, so that we may not have the elected leaders to stop something but that we call to something greater, which is the conscience of our country, the moral imagination of a nation, the better angels of the nature of the people that do have the power. I read a lot about John McCain that night because I think he was a profile in courage. I read his whole speech that he gave after he put his thumb down and it was as if he was talking to us in this moment. I know that your question was about this party and that party. But I said during the 25 hours that this is a moral moment. It is bigger than right or left. It is right or wrong and we have to shift our thinking away from traditional politics and start talking about what we stand for and who we are. And when we start with that, it makes it very hard for people to justify taking away health care from 70 million people in Medicaid cuts in order to get more tax cuts that go disproportionately to billionaires. That\u2019s not who we are and I must have repeated that for a dozen or two examples and that\u2019s what I want us to get back to.\n\nAnd as a Democratic Party, as a leader amongst this party, I want our party to learn from its mistakes, to be bolder in its vision, to not define itself by who they\u2019re against, but define themselves by who they\u2019re fighting for, and define themselves not about where we are but what the possibilities are for where we can go. I think it\u2019s time for a new generation in our country. I really do. The baby boomers are slowly leaving the stage, called home by John Lewis. Who\u2019s going to stand up in the next generations, the millennials and Gen Z who are just starting to take official positions of leadership? I want us to dream America anew, redeem the dream that people feel like needs some redemption now. I\u2019m excited about the future. I know we\u2019re in very difficult times. I know what Donald Trump is doing has hurt people already and I know what he intends to do will hurt the character of our country, not to mention people\u2019s health care, people\u2019s retirement security, and more. But I love the fact that in the heat of the painful political times of my parents, what that generation did is not just point at the unacceptable segregation of people like Strom Thurmond, of people like Bull Connor, of people like George Wallace. They also used that moment, that painful moral moment of their generation to go onto a mountaintop and tell America, it is time to dream again. It\u2019s time to think more boldly again. It\u2019s time to use our moral imagination again. That\u2019s the inspiration my parents gave me, and by God, if that\u2019s our inheritance in this generation, we should take some leadership from that, some instruction from that, and yes, fight these tough battles. March, demonstrate, just like our parents did. But never forget to start telling people to stop just looking right or left. It\u2019s time for America to look up again and get our dream back again and inspire some people, so that we can leave the next generation a little bit better, just like my parents did for me.\n\nYou mentioned your mother frequently during your remarks, talking about how she was watching back home in Nevada and sharing your family\u2019s own personal experiences like your father\u2019s battle with Parkinson\u2019s disease. What was it like for her to witness her son making history?\n\nI called all the Las Vegas crew, my mom, her siblings. I think there\u2019s nothing better in this world to give your mom nachas. I don\u2019t know if you know that word, but one of the things I think is a blessing is to make your mother proud. She lived a life of breaking barriers and overcoming challenges and suffering indignities during a whole different generation because she was a woman, because she was Black. My parents were so hard on my brother and I to appreciate the blessings that we had, to never forget what had to happen to have what we have and that we had to pay it back by paying it forward. I know that\u2019s always been the measure my mom has of me, and to hear one of the last voices before I went to bed last night that my mom was proud of me. That meant a lot.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity."

            "full_content": "There\u2019s a lot of sketchy stuff in Lindsey Graham\u2019s so-called budget blueprint. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nTime is running out for House-Senate agreement on a congressional budget resolution necessary to \u201cunlock\u201d a future budget-reconciliation bill, which is the only way to enact Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda without any input from Democrats. So Senate Republicans, led by Budget Committee chairman Lindsey Graham, have made a fateful decision. They decided not to bother with a real budget, in the sense of one that would significantly restrain their future actions in cutting or raising taxes or spending. Instead, they adopted a shell resolution in which up to $3.8 trillion in tax cuts is deemed as costing nothing and the budget cuts to pay for the few tax cuts they are willing to commit to are minimal. It\u2019s about as pain free of a \u201cbudget blueprint\u201d as you can imagine, given the Trump administration\u2019s determination to vastly cut taxes and spending despite levels of debt and deficit spending that are already deemed unacceptable by Republicans.\n\nThe resolution is fuzzy on what senators are voting on now versus what will ultimately be in the reconciliation bill, as Roll Call reports:\n\nThe measure would punt, for now, on the overall size of offsetting spending cuts, but the text clearly states a preference for a minimum $2 trillion in cuts over 10 years. Given the difficulty of achieving that hefty figure, however, the document provides a huge amount of wiggle room to go lower than that and still meet the Senate\u2019s \u201cByrd rule\u201d requirements for what can go into a filibuster-proof reconciliation bill.\n\nAnd the draft budget resolution would provide enough fiscal headroom in the Senate to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts that expire after this year, while offering new tax breaks sought by President Donald Trump, such as exempting tips and overtime pay from income tax. The budget appears to carve out room for more than $5.2 trillion in tax cuts overall, including a $1.5 trillion cost ceiling on new provisions that weren\u2019t part of the 2017 law.\n\nIt also would increase the nation\u2019s borrowing limit by as much as $5 trillion \u2014 a level designed to give the Treasury enough borrowing authority to get past the midterm elections next year.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem, though: The House passed its own budget resolution in late February that does have real cuts in it (including, almost certainly, Medicaid cuts), that doesn\u2019t pretend tax cuts have no effect on the budget deficit, and that boosts the debt limit a trillion dollars less than the Senate\u2019s. All these differences reflect different GOP factions\u2019 strongly held positions, particularly those of the fiscal hawks in the House Freedom Caucus, who will look for quiet assurances that the reconciliation bill will be a lot more vicious than the Senate\u2019s budget resolution suggests. It\u2019s all very hush-hush and sketchy. Word is Trump himself will be deployed not only to squelch dissent in the Senate but to insist the House accepts the Senate resolution without the kind of changes that could require further votes in the upper chamber. Another major piece of unprecedented deceit is the decision to let the resolution provide vastly different \u201creconciliation instructions\u201d to House and Senate committees, as though two budgets are actually in play. In a very real sense, there are.\n\nBut the Senate move that was probably the most audacious was Graham\u2019s sudden assertion of the right (previously understood as being exclusively the prerogative of the Senate parliamentarian) to adopt a \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline for expiring Trump tax cuts, which makes extending them until the end of time deficit-neutral and thus \u201cfree.\u201d Had the parliamentarian ruled otherwise, it could have thrown a major monkey wrench into the entire Trump legislative agenda. Now Republicans are just assuming the answer they want is the right one, and it\u2019s unclear whether the parliamentarian can wrest back that power later on in the process.\n\nFor now, the Senate is on track to adopt its unique and dishonest version of the budget resolution, and the House will then be under pressure to go along with it. All these differences of option between fiscal hawks and \u201cDeficits don\u2019t matter\u201d Republicans won\u2019t go away but will be kicked down the road. In the end, Trump will have to resolve all the problems on highly technical spending and revenue issues that he almost surely doesn\u2019t understand. What he does understand are the dynamics of dominance and submission."

Nancy Mace claimed \u201cphysically accosted\u201d her in December, according to recent court filings.\n\nIn December, police charged James McIntyre of Illinois with one misdemeanor charge of simple assault. He pleaded not guilty and was released at the time with a \u201cstay away\u201d order.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why the charge was dismissed.\n\nMcIntyre said he was \u201cpleased but not surprised\u201d the charge was dropped and called the experience \u201ctraumatic\u201d in a statement issued through Illinois state Rep. Kelly Cassidy.\n\n\u201cBy falsely accusing me of a violent crime and having me jailed, Congresswoman Mace demonstrated her desire to criminalize anyone who advocates for the needs of our trans youth,\u201d his statement reads.\n\nMcIntyre\u2019s lawyer declined to comment on the matter. CNN has reached out to the US attorney\u2019s office in Washington, DC, for comment.\n\nAsked in December about Mace\u2019s claim, Capitol Police said it received a report from a member of Congress\u2019 office regarding an incident in the Rayburn House Office Building. Officers and agents with the Threat Assessment Section arrested a suspect, charging them with assaulting a government official, the agency said.\n\nMace told law enforcement the person placed their hands over hers and \u201cbegan to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a hand shaking motion\u201d for a few seconds, according to a police filing.\n\nThe filing also showed she said McIntyre stated \u201ctrans youth deserve advocacy\u201d during the shaking motion. Following the interaction in December, Mace posted on X that she was \u201cphysically accosted\u201d by \u201ca pro-tr*ns man.\u201d\n\nMcIntyre is the co-founder of the Illinois chapter of Foster Care Alumni and was present to celebrate the 25th anniversary of a law expanding federal support for foster care, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAfter prosecutors dropped the charges, Mace said she \u201cwon\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI filed charges, and they were inexplicably ignored. But I will not be. I will not back down. I will not be intimidated. And I sure as hell won\u2019t stay silent,\u201d Mace said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe Imprint first reported the charge had been dismissed.\n\nDespite previously calling herself \u201cpro-transgender rights,\u201d Mace introduced a resolution in November to ban transgender women from using women\u2019s restrooms at the Capitol and filed broader legislation that would apply to every federal building and federally funded school.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker also used a phrase considered a slur to refer to transgender people during a House Oversight Committee hearing in February. Her comments were challenged by Democratic Rep.\n\nGerry Connolly of Virginia, prompting the congresswoman to double down on the slur and respond with, \u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Summary Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to skip next week's Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels.\n\nThe US has been gradually pulling back from the group, which coordinates military equipment delivery to Ukraine.\n\nIn the last administration, the defense secretary or a senior Pentagon official always chaired the group\u2019s monthly meetings, but Hegseth has ceded that role to the UK in recent months.\n\nThe Trump administration has adjusted military support to Ukraine to push Kyiv toward negotiations.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend next week\u2019s meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, marking the first time since the group\u2019s founding three years ago that a senior Pentagon official will not be there to represent the US, officials familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThe US has for months been steadily pulling back from the group, which was founded by former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in 2022 after Russia\u2019s invasion as a way for dozens of countries to streamline the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine to quell Russian military advances.\n\nWhereas Austin or a senior Pentagon official always chaired the group\u2019s monthly meetings, Hegseth has ceded that role to the UK in recent months\u2014even as a senior US general told lawmakers on Thursday that \u201ccontinuing to assist Ukraine on the battlefield daily\u201d is \u201cvery important\u201d when it comes to maintaining leverage over the Russians.\n\nHegseth attended a meeting of the UDCG in February at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where he told allies that the US would no longer be a guarantor of European security and that it was highly \u201cunlikely\u201d that Ukraine would ever join NATO\u2014a comment that, at the time, marked a dramatic shift from the longtime US position that Ukraine would one day join the alliance.\n\nDefense News was first to report Hegseth is likely to skip the meeting next week.\n\nThe Trump administration has turned on and off its military and intelligence support to Ukraine in recent months as a way to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. The US hasn\u2019t imposed any penalties on Russia, even as Moscow has refused to agree to a White House proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and continues to place conditions on even a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea.\n\nRussia also wasn\u2019t on the list of countries the Trump administration announced it is imposing tariffs on this week.\n\nTrump attacked Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly last weekend and threatened tariffs on countries which buy Russian oil, but days later temporarily suspended sanctions on a Russian financier and Putin ally in order to host him for meetings this week in Washington, DC\u2014the first time a Russian official has traveled to DC for such talks since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAs the Russian negotiator, Kirill Dimitriev, was in DC for meetings on Thursday, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the head of US European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe was testifying to Congress that Russia poses a \u201cchronic\u201d and \u201cgrowing\u201d threat to the US and the west saying Russia is \u201cactively waging a campaign of destabilization across Europe and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year, has revealed Russia to be a chronic threat, and we see in the future it will be a growing threat, one that is willing to use military force to achieve its geopolitical goals,\u201d Cavoli told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n\n\u201cFurther exacerbating this threat from Russia are the deepening partnerships among our adversaries \u2014 Iran, the Communist Chinese Party, the DPRK, and Russia itself. And these are increasingly posing a global risk,\u201d he said.\n\nDimitriev and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff met on Wednesday, sources told CNN.\n\nUS and western intelligence officials do not believe that Russia is interested in negotiating a ceasefire deal with Ukraine in good faith, CNN has reported. Moscow still believes it can sustain its war effort and outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.\n\nA senior NATO official reiterated that on Thursday, saying that \u201cRussia still believes that time mostly is on its side.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had questions for a long time about whether Putin intends to negotiate in good faith,\u201d the official said. Russia is \u201cwilling to continue those talks [about mending ties with the US] at the same time that it is delaying and stalling and saying that they can\u2019t accept the US proposals right now, on the actual ceasefire. I think all of that supports the idea that Russia\u2019s goals haven\u2019t changed at all\u2014that right now, what it is trying to do is probably stall for time, make less concessions on the war, and try to instead make progress on sanctions, on Russia\u2019s place in the international community.\u201d"

            "full_content": "Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/Bloomberg/ Getty Images\n\nGive Donald Trump some credit: He is following through, absolutely, on a campaign promise.\n\nWhile few Americans imagined that electing Trump again would make Elon Musk a de facto president, tasked with eviscerating the federal bureaucracy, it was no secret that tariffs would be on the menu if Trump returned to the White House. Tariffs and trade deficits have been a Trump obsession for decades. He could be heard talking them up in the 1980s and 1990s, and he has long romanticized a protectionist economy.\n\nAnd while Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs are unnecessarily punitive and ultimately counterproductive in an inflationary environment, not all of them can be dismissed out of hand. It is true that globalization and free-trade agreements crippled onetime industrial powerhouses in the Northeast and Midwest. The white and Black working classes were punished in cities like Gary and Youngstown and Detroit as manufacturers fled the country and cheap, foreign-produced clothing, toys, and automobiles flooded the market. Joe Biden\u2019s industrial policy targeted China for tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels, and there are plenty of reasons for Trump to continue or even stiffen tariffs on our greatest geopolitical rival. It is true, as his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, recently said, that the American Dream is not merely \u201caccess to cheap goods.\u201d The American worker shouldn\u2019t suffer so another export champion overseas can flourish.\n\nOf course, Trump is Trump, and there is no subtlety to his latest tariffs and no sense of proportion. Trump announced a 10 percent universal tariff on all goods \u2014 barring certain exemptions \u2014 imported into the U.S., beginning April 5. Goods from China were hit with an enormous tariff rate of 54 percent. Japan was taxed at 24 percent, Europe at 20 percent, and there are many more \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which will take effect on April 9. This morning, a 25 percent tariff on all automobile imports kicked in. Canada and Mexico, already targeted for tariffs, were not a focus of the so-called Liberation Day.\n\nVarious analysts rate these tariffs as among the very highest in American history, surpassing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and rivaling the protectionist regimes of the 1890s. An open question remains how long they will last \u2014 or if most of them represent yet another Trump negotiating tactic. Bessent seemed to suggest that the tariffs could be provisional. \u201cOne of the messages that I\u2019d like to get out tonight is everybody sit back; take a deep breath; don\u2019t immediately retaliate. Let\u2019s see where this goes,\u201d he said, according to CNN. \u201cBecause if you retaliate, that\u2019s how we get escalation.\u201d\n\nIf the tariffs hold, trade wars are coming and life is going to get more expensive, whether American manufacturing glory is restored or not. Inflation could increase, and the economy may, in the short term, tip toward a recession. For the market-conscious Trump, it will be grim times on Wall Street, which wrongly gambled that Trump wasn\u2019t serious about levying heavy tariffs on America\u2019s trading partners. Investors are bound to get more skittish. The postelection stock-market gains have already been wiped out.\n\nThis is the real problem for Trump. His calling card has always been the economy. As Democrats, throughout his first term, fulminated about the state of the Republic, Trump could point to low inflation, low interest rates, and a strong stock market. During Biden\u2019s presidency, Americans felt nostalgia for the pre-pandemic 2010s, and that was Trump\u2019s time in the sun. As much as they may have found his conduct disconcerting, voters believed he could be an adequate steward of the economy. Individual presidents can\u2019t wholly dictate economic conditions, but it\u2019s inarguable that Trump, less radicalized than he is today, did relatively little to destabilize the 2010s\u2019s financial environment. Tariffs were reasonable, the federal bureaucracy was preserved, and the GOP-run Congress failed in its politically toxic bid to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSurveys already show Trump posting poorer numbers on the economy. His strong suit is gone, and it\u2019s probably not coming back \u2014 not with tariffs, DOGE, or attempts to gut Medicaid. There is virtually nothing Trump is doing in his second term to improve the everyday reality of working-class people. Mass layoffs of federal employees merely punish those who had stable jobs and make interacting with crucial bureaucracies like the Department of Veterans Affairs all the more challenging. A stiff tariff won\u2019t lower a grocery bill. And if Republicans do follow through on their bid to lower the deficit by slashing Medicaid, which offers health care to some 70 million Americans \u2014 plenty of them Republicans in rural areas \u2014 the backlash will be severe.\n\nThe bloom is already off the MAGA rose. The Wisconsin Supreme Court race was a devastating outcome for the Trump-Musk wing of the party \u2014 at this point perhaps its only real wing \u2014 and an indication of where we are probably headed. Democrats and independents are furious and ready to vote against Trump-aligned candidates. Had Elise Stefanik not been returned to her district in the North Country, there\u2019s an outside chance that a special election there could have turned a deep-red seat blue. If Trump is serious about bringing back 1930s- or 1890s-style protectionism to America, he should consult a history textbook and find out what happened to the Republican governments that instituted the tariffs. Neither of them survived, with Herbert Hoover, in the teeth of the Great Depression, giving way to Franklin D. Roosevelt and a Democratic majority that wouldn\u2019t be broken for a generation.\n\nDemocrats have a long, long way to go to reach their FDR-era heights. But Trump, through his chaos, is helping them along plenty."

            "full_content": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a press conference at City Hall in New York City on March 11, 2025. Photo: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter months of speculation about the status of his largely dormant and seemingly doomed reelection campaign, New York City mayor Eric Adams announced that he is no longer seeking the Democratic nomination and will, instead, run as an independent candidate in the general election. His announcement comes just one day after U.S. District Judge Dale Ho officially dismissed the federal government\u2019s pending corruption case against him, which accused Adams of soliciting illegal bribes from foreign nationals in exchange for luxury travel perks.\n\nIn a six-minute direct-to-camera video shared to social media on April 3, Adams said that more than 25,000 city residents signed his Democratic petition, but the drawn-out process of dismissing the case against him made it impossible to mount a reelection campaign for the June 24 primary. The mayor said that while he\u2019s running as an independent, he still identifies as a Democrat.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that this city is better served by truly independent leadership, not leaders pulled at by the extremists on the far left or the far right. But, instead, those rooted in the common middle, the place where the vast majority of New Yorkers are firmly planted,\u201d Adams said.\n\nAdams once again professed his innocence, but he acknowledged the impact the corruption charges have had on his reputation with New York voters. \u201cI know that the accusations leveled against me may have shaken your confidence in me and that you may rightly have questions about my conduct,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd let me be clear, although the charges against me were false, I trusted people I should not have, and I regret that.\u201d\n\nThe mayor then turned to the other candidates in the race, urging voters to check their records on addressing their concerns with public safety and rising costs. Without naming anyone directly, Adams said some of his opponents opposed the creation of new housing or the addition of more police officers while advocating for it now in their campaigns. In a not-so-subtle dig against former governor Andrew Cuomo, the current mayoral front-runner, Adams said that some of his challengers \u201csat at home and did nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the candidates will tell you that they have solutions to all that. You should hear them out. But you should also ask them where they were and what they did over the last four years to address those concerns before they were running for more,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile running as an independent will give Adams more time to make his case to New Yorkers, it\u2019s not immediately clear if his reelection chances will improve. A recent Data for Progress poll showed Cuomo receiving 39 percent of the vote in the first round of ranked-choice voting, followed by Queens assemblymember Zohran Mamdani with 15 percent and comptroller Brad Lander with 8 percent. Adams trailed behind in fourth place, receiving only 7 percent.\n\nAs news of Adams\u2019s reelection shift spread, the mayor\u2019s mayoral challengers began to weigh in on his decision. In a statement, Mamdani said, \u201cRegardless of what party Adams flees to, New Yorkers deserve better than a self-interested, disgraced mayor who has and always will put his needs before their own.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie similarly criticized Adams\u2019s move, invoking Cuomo and the president. \u201c\u201cLet me get this straight. Donald Trump\u2019s doing his best every day to destroy our country. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s trying to use our city for own personal redemption tour. And now Eric Adams\u2026 don\u2019t even get me started. This isn\u2019t leadership, this is a circus,\u201d he said.\n\nLander resurfaced an old social media post that predicted that Adams could translate his local success following his 2021 mayoral win to a future Democratic Party presidential nomination. \u201cThis aged well,\u201d he quipped."

            "full_content": "Photo: As Ever\n\nWell before Meghan Markle\u2019s As Ever products launched on April 2, it was clear that confusion was at the heart of her brand. Shouldn\u2019t her jams and teas have gone on sale when her Netflix show launched a month ago? Why is the show called With Love, Meghan while the home-goods line is named after a different sign-off phrase? Should that name be styled \u201cAs Ever\u201d or \u201cAs ever\u201d? And who, exactly, is Meghan? An expert homemaker graciously sharing her recipe for homemade dog biscuits or a novice eager to learn from her celebrity friends? Real-life fairy-tale princess (okay, duchess) or chill-yet-stylish California girl espousing the joys of Jack in the Box?\n\nI had hoped that the As Ever launch might provide some clarity. Instead, I realized that in addition to being confused about what her whole deal is, Meghan has no idea who I am.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing Meghan does get right about me: I\u2019m a lady who\u2019s highly susceptible to the suggestion that I should slather everything in slightly overpriced raspberry jam. As Ever\u2019s initial collection includes eight products: three teas, honey, raspberry spread, shortbread cookie mix, cr\u00eape mix, and \u201cflower sprinkles.\u201d Each costs a few dollars more than an equivalent product you\u2019d find in Whole Foods; for example, the teas are $12 for 12 sachets and the jam is $9, or $14 if you go for the \u201ckeepsake packaging.\u201d But these aren\u2019t outrageous Goop-esque prices.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to the quality of the products or the ordering process, as everything sold out in an hour on Wednesday morning. While that seems like a sign of success, we have no way of knowing if As Ever has sold 50 or 5,000 packages of shortbread-cookie mix.\n\nSo all I could do on launch day was peruse the newly unveiled product information and read a new New York Times profile that takes us \u201cInside Meghan\u2019s Real Kitchen\u201d (as opposed to the fake one where she filmed the Netflix show). This journey through the Meghan Markle lifestyle brand brought on a mild existential crisis.\n\nEach product page includes an item description and several of Meghan\u2019s \u201cTips for Enjoyment.\u201d These ping-ponged between insultingly basic and depressingly out of reach. For example, here are Meghan\u2019s ideas for enjoying her \u201cHerbal Peppermint Tea\u201d:\n\nMeghan felt the need to explain (twice!) that tea is prepared by steeping bags in hot water, resulting in a flavorful beverage that can be enjoyed at midday or by a fire. It felt a tad insulting.\n\nBut here are the tips for the \u201cHerbal Hibiscus Tea\u201d:\n\nThis had me reeling. Am I doing enough to create \u201cchildhood memories of wonder\u201d for my family? How exactly do I cook down hibiscus tea into a simple syrup? Am I supposed to be hosting virtual happy hours for co-workers I mainly interact with on Slack? Should my loved ones be using clear glass water bottles so they can see the hibiscus-tea ice cubes I lovingly brew, freeze, and add to their drinks each day for a \u201cpop of color\u201d?\n\nNext, I turned to the Times piece for some clarification on whether Meghan wants me to relate to her or aspire to be her. At first it seemed like the former, as she declared that Kraft cheese and Wonder bread make the \u201cbest after-school snack\u201d:\n\nAs a self-described latchkey kid, whose parents were divorced, Meghan loved to pick up fast food \u2014 Jack in the Box curly fries were a favorite \u2014 and go home to watch back-to-back cooking shows on Food Network. \u201cOr I\u2019d go to Grandma Jeanette\u2019s after school,\u201d she said. \u201cShe made the best after-school snack: Kraft grilled cheese on white Wonder bread,\u201d Meghan recalled, dreamily. \u201cAll that butter.\u201d\n\nYet the As Ever website suggests that after a long school day children should be greeted with freshly made cr\u00eapes:\n\nMaybe this is all for Prince Harry\u2019s benefit? The Times reports that when he\u2019s out, Meghan\u2019s kids are mainly eating food handcrafted by the good folks at Tyson and Ore-Ida:\n\nWhen it\u2019s just her and the kids for dinner, she said, she often relies on chicken nuggets, veggie burgers and Tater Tots (the freezer is stuffed with them).\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Meghan tosses \u201cflower sprinkles\u201d on those tots, or if they\u2019re more of a breakfast garnish:\n\nBy the time I got to the end of the Times piece, I felt like I was annoying Meghan. Don\u2019t I understand her journey from super-relatable mildly famous person to literal royal who is still very relatable?!\n\nBut she is clearly bothered by accusations that she is unrelatable and out of touch. She may be living a fairy tale, but not all that long ago, she was a not-very-famous actress on a medium-popular TV series. She was divorced, in her mid-30s and unsure where her next job or home would be.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they know my life hasn\u2019t always been like this?\u201d she said, gesturing at the sweeping views and sleeping dogs.\n\nI\u2019ve consumed a lot of Martha Stewart content and tons of amateur cooking videos on TikTok. I\u2019m fine either way, I just need the Duchess to tell me what she\u2019s going for. When Martha tells me I can make a souffl\u00e9 as perfect as hers, we both know it\u2019s just a fantasy, and that\u2019s okay. If Meghan truly believes I can replicate her lifestyle because we\u2019re both normal 40-something working women with slightly above-average crafting skills, that\u2019s fine too. What\u2019s stressing me out is Meghan wavering between acting like I\u2019ve never made tea and assuming I regularly throw together Champagne-honey vinaigrette for my ladies\u2019 lunches:\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s not fair to expect Meghan Markle to have a consistent brand identity. Some days I eat fresh-baked muffins with fancy jams, but most mornings I cook my breakfast in the microwave. Hey, maybe \u201cflower sprinkles\u201d would make my Jimmy Dean Delights frozen egg sandwich more joyful! Don\u2019t put me or Meghan in a box! Unless, as Meghan recommended earlier this week, you\u2019re using her jam\u2019s \u201ckeepsake packaging\u201d as a \u201ctime capsule\u201d to \u201cremember this pivotal moment with me.\u201d For $14, that jam box better contain multitudes."

            "full_content": "Photo: Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s time to consider the remote possibility that Donald Trump will attempt to violate the Constitution and seek a third term. In a recent interview with NBC News, he appeared distinctly open to the prospect of running again, and The Wall Street Journal reported his attorney had studied the idea in 2023. Whether Trump\u2019s kidding or not, it\u2019s worth pondering the dark logistics of such an endeavor. After all, he did attempt to, quite haphazardly, overturn the results of the 2020 election. How close he genuinely came is up for debate, but he did spur a deadly insurrection at the Capitol. A replay of January 6, at a minimum, should not be ruled out.\n\nThere is a long-standing, if tiring, debate about whether Trump is a fascist. He certainly has authoritarian tendencies and longs for far greater power \u2014 whether he can truly attain it in this unwieldy Federalist system remains an open question. Even now, with the malicious new deportation regime and the wanton budget cutting of DOGE, much of what lies before us is distinctly American, as the writer and academic Daniel Bessner recently argued. Trump isn\u2019t the first president to ignore the rule of law or forcibly try to deport legal residents without serious justification. He\u2019s not the first president to flirt with foolhardy imperialism, either.\n\nBut Trump is uniquely unpredictable. George W. Bush never mused about a third term for himself; Bill Clinton once did but made clear it was not allowed under the Constitution. Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he holds political norms in contempt. And the unsettling undercurrent of our current moment \u2014 and the American Republic, broadly \u2014 is that much of it does rest on these precedents and traditions. If Trump decides never to listen to another federal judge, the judicial branch can\u2019t marshal its own military and arrest him. And if Trump does declare sometime in 2027 that he\u2019s feeling wonderful and would like the unconstitutional third term, what\u2019s to stop him from trying to get it?\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a scenario. Upon announcing at a 2027 campaign rally that he is running again, Trump successfully cows the rest of the Republican Party. If the likes of J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio are deeply ambitious, pining for the presidency themselves, they still defer to Trump. In July or August 2028, the Trump-dominated Republican National Committee renominates him. As is its right, it cancels state primaries or holds them while some nominal anti-Trump opposition is batted away. Come late summer, Trump is the GOP nominee for the fourth straight time. The Democrats declare him illegitimate, but what does it matter? All they can do is run in the election. After a protracted primary fight, they\u2019ve got their own battle-tested nominee. The nominee is ready for Trump.\n\nIn the fall of 2028, it\u2019s difficult to see how Trump, nearing the end of his second term, will be very popular. Approval ratings slide over time, and Americans weary of their leaders. As of now, it doesn\u2019t appear Trump will have a strong hand to play. Inflation persists, tariffs won\u2019t help, and if the Republican Congress slashes Medicaid, there will be a backlash. The economy may boom in a few years, but Americans are, for now, pessimistic. Come 2028, Democrats should have control of the House, assuming a typical midterm wave year and the overperformance Democrats have enjoyed in lower-turnout elections. If Hakeem Jeffries is the speaker, Trump\u2019s legislative agenda is dead on arrival.\n\nCould Trump, attempting his third term, win the Electoral College? Possibly. But a more likely scenario is a version of 2020, where a surge in Democratic turnout dooms him. We can assume, of course, Trump won\u2019t care. He\u2019ll say the election is stolen. He\u2019ll run his old playbook. He\u2019ll declare he wants to remain in the White House and should.\n\nThen the United States will enter a new crisis phase. Trump could refuse to participate in the transition and declare he\u2019ll refuse, on January 20, to vacate the White House. The new Democratic president, in control of the military, would then force Trump out \u2014 maybe literally with the MAGA monarch ushered out onto Pennsylvania Avenue. Or consider this scenario, even less likely but worth mulling: Trump does, like the fascist dictators of old, assume absolute control of the military and the so-called deep state. Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Rubio, and the rest are able to install blind loyalists at all levels of the Pentagon, CIA, and FBI. Trump has his own version of the Brownshirts. The new president-elect, a Democrat, comes to the White House without his or her own army. Trump dares the Democrat to come inside, to walk across the lawn. He\u2019s got his shock troops stationed around Washington. Their guns are raised.\n\nThis is the most remote possibility. Trump, at 82, would have to become a far more dominant executive than he is today. Military personnel do have to listen to their commander-in-chief, but they\u2019re also permitted to disobey orders that are blatantly unconstitutional. The federal courts, still not fully under Trump\u2019s dominion, could support them. If Trump\u2019s second administration is more efficient and dastardly than his first, it\u2019s still a long way from imposing a personality cult on the entire federal bureaucracy and military. Xi and Putin are dictators because their nations do not have traditions of democracy or a free press. It is far easier for them to suppress dissent. If Trump wants that kind of control, he\u2019ll need more time \u2014 or another country.\n\nWhat\u2019s hardest to imagine is Trump, well into his 80s, successfully governing the U.S. in 2029. This doesn\u2019t mean that the flaws of our Republic aren\u2019t ripe for exploitation or that smarter and younger people won\u2019t rise to power in the future and attempt, on a much more terrifying level, to erode the democracy we have left. Americans should be prepared. In the meantime, Trump will flail about, sometimes meaning what he says and other times clearly not. Whether he\u2019s joking or not right now \u2014 arguments can be made for either possibility \u2014 it\u2019s worth entertaining his potential for greater lawbreaking. Trump has proved he has few limits."

            "full_content": "A protest at the U.S. Capitol for equal rights in public accommodations for people with disabilities in 1972. Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIn 1959, a teenage Kitty Cone was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. The daughter of a well-off military family, she discovered that her disability often worked against her family\u2019s wealth and political connections. She attended five different high schools, including the posh Holton-Arms School where her cousins had to carry her up the stairs so she could attend classes. At the Mount Vernon Seminary in Washington, D.C., the headmistress imposed certain rules on Cone: She had to bathe in her housemother\u2019s bathroom under the supervision of an adult even though she couldn\u2019t get out of the unwieldy tub. She improvised and began taking baths in her dorm suite on her own power, but \u201cthat was considered disobedience,\u201d she would later say. She also walked down to the hockey field, another infraction. The school expelled her, a decision that humiliated her even though she didn\u2019t think of it as discrimination \u2014 and neither did the law.\n\nThe world outside the Mount Vernon Seminary was hardly more progressive. Public schools could, and often did, force students with disabilities into separate classes regardless of their abilities. Businesses were not usually accessible to them, and employers could refuse to hire them. Many were forced into institutions where some were sterilized against their will. Cone came of age in a society that preferred not to think of her at all or, when it did, sought to wipe her out altogether. But Cone, a gay woman in a wheelchair, never surrendered her expectations, or her humanity, to anyone. By the time President Richard Nixon signed the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 into law after vetoing it twice, she had become a professional organizer, and she would soon join the fight for disability rights.\n\nSection 504 of the act barred publicly-funded entities from discriminating against people with disabilities. Yet by 1977, the federal government had not developed the regulations that would allow it to fully implement the law, which forced activists to take dramatic measures. That April, they launched nationwide sit-ins at the offices of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Cone and roughly 100 other demonstrators occupied HEW\u2019s regional office in San Francisco for nearly a month, an effort that may have failed were it not for the participation of Brad Lomax, a member of the Black Panther Party who had multiple sclerosis. The Panthers kept the demonstrators fed, covered the protest in their official newspaper, and paid for Lomax and his attendant to join Cone and others in Washington, D.C., where they confronted top HEW officials. \u201cWe will no longer allow the government to oppress disabled individuals. We want the law enforced,\u201d the prominent disability-rights activist Judith Heumann told one representative. HEW secretary Joseph Califano Jr. signed the regulations in the following weeks.\n\nLomax died a few years later, and as one contemporary would later tell the New York Times, \u201cI don\u2019t think that all of his aspirations were fulfilled, even after the demonstration. He really wanted more.\u201d So did the disability-rights movement. In 1990, more than 1,000 activists descended upon Washington to demand passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which banned discrimination in employment on the basis of disability and expanded protections for the disabled in most areas of public life. After a speech, many climbed out of their wheelchairs or cast aside their assistive devices to pull themselves up the steps of the Capitol. The Capitol Crawl was strenuous, and activist Jennifer Keelan-Chaffins remembered years later that she had to stop several times so she could ask for water. Her mother, Cynthia, was arrested the next day as part of a mass demonstration in the Capitol Rotunda. The ADA passed shortly thereafter and President George H.W. Bush signed it into law that July. In a speech, he cited the Civil Rights Act of 1964, adding, \u201cToday\u2019s legislation brings us closer to that day when no Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\nThirty-five years later, the Trump administration has disability rights in its sights. The eradication of so-called \u201cDEI\u201d programs has already reduced accessibility for people with disabilities, as the White House itself made clear in an announcement earlier this month. Trump, it said, had signed a memo removing the \u201cdiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\u201d precept concerning tenure and promotion within the U.S. Foreign Service. Last week, the Department of Justice removed 11 guidelines that helped businesses comply with the ADA\u2019s public-accommodations requirements. Though the requirements are still in effect, and Trump cannot overturn the ADA by fiat, the news is a warning. The president doesn\u2019t have the constitutional authority to dismantle the Department of Education, either, but he\u2019s ordered the firings of thousands of workers. \u201cI don\u2019t think most Americans recognize how much the Department of Education does for disabled students,\u201d Jess Davidson of the American Association for People With Disabilities tells me. Many of the fired workers handled civil-rights investigations and, Davidson says, without them, disabled students \u201cwill fall through the cracks\u201d and potentially suffer abuse.\n\nTrump claimed earlier this month that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who heads the Department of Health and Human Services and who incorrectly believes that vaccines cause autism, would now oversee \u201cspecial needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else.\u201d Nobody knows what exactly that means, and Trump may not, either, but students, parents, and activists all fear cuts to services and the erosion of basic protections that are guaranteed by laws like the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. As the ACLU warned in a recent explainer on its website, \u201cWithout the department to enforce these protections, millions of students who rely on IDEA for necessary accommodations, such as specialized instruction and assistive technology, are at risk of losing access to the education they are legally entitled to receive.\u201d\n\nMillions of Americans who cannot work due to their disabilities receive Social Security benefits and they, too, are under threat. Cuts to the Social Security Administration have already led to crashing websites and long wait times as seniors and people with disabilities struggle to reach workers about their benefits. Some field offices have closed, and workers told the Washington Post that they often don\u2019t have the time or the staffing necessary to process complicated benefit cases with any efficiency. Millions of people with disabilities also rely on Medicaid for health-care coverage and in-home care, but proposed spending cuts by Republican lawmakers would jeopardize that lifeline.\n\nEven Section 504 may be in danger. Seventeen Republican-led states sued the Biden administration last year, arguing that updated Section 504 guidelines distorted federal law in order to define gender dysphoria as a disability. The truth is more complicated, says Alison Barkoff, a law professor at George Washington University who helped update the policy. Although the preamble to the new regulations say that gender dysphoria may be considered a disability based on a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the updated rule itself does not mention the condition, a fact that Republican states have ignored in favor of a sweeping demand. \u201cThey went on and said, \u2018Declare Section 504 unconstitutional,\u2019\u201d Barkoff says. \u201cIt\u2019s really breathtaking.\u201d The lawsuit is on pause for now, she adds, but the states have not dropped it, either.\n\nThough the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act had bipartisan support and were signed by Republican presidents, it\u2019s hard to imagine Trump signing either piece of legislation. A more ruthless strain of conservatism always percolated within the party, and now it dominates and threatens the protections that Cone, and Lomax, and so many others once fought to win. At risk is the concept of civil rights itself.\n\nBy the time I was born in 1988, Section 504 had been in place for over a decade and the ADA wasn\u2019t far away. When I began suffering from severe depression at the age of 15, it occurred to me, dimly, that my Christian high school should help me. My parents are conservative, but they sent me to a real psychiatrist. The school was less amenable. When teachers or classmates talked about depression at all, it was to say that any teenager thus afflicted should depend on prayer and preaching, not medication or psychology. The school later expelled me despite my clean disciplinary record, and I could hardly believe my bad luck; I thought my brothers and sisters in Christ would care for me no matter what was going on in my brain. I had never heard of Cone or the disability-rights movement, but the expulsion radicalized me in its own way. This, I thought, was discrimination.\n\nAfter my expulsion, I ended up at a public high school. There, I had something called a \u201c504 plan,\u201d or a set of accommodations undergirded by the Rehabilitation Act, which gave me extra time on assignments and the ability to leave the classroom for short breaks. I was able to graduate and go to college, but I chose a Christian university, and when I was diagnosed with a genetic blood disease during my junior year, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone on campus. I\u2019d grown up hearing about Joni Eareckson Tada, a popular Evangelical author and speaker who became a quadriplegic after a diving accident and who campaigns against abortion rights, embryonic-stem-cell research, and IVF. If she was the model, my prospects were limited; I could only be a mascot, not a person. It is a truism to say that the anti-abortion movement wants people like me to be born and will not care for us after the fact, but the argument lingers because it is mostly accurate. I could not pray my way out of a genetic disease \u2014 I found no spiritual meaning in it whatsoever. Instead, I had material needs, and the conservative world I lived in told me I had no right to need anything at all. Not health care, not paid sick leave, not even a high-school education.\n\nSome conservative Christians profess what they call a \u201cconsistent ethic of life,\u201d which calls for a more robust welfare state in addition to bans on abortion. But they have always been outliers, often within their own churches. Religious schools like the one I attended can discriminate against disabled students because Evangelicals lobbied for an exemption from the ADA. They wanted \u2014 and won \u2014 the right to bar children and adults with HIV or AIDS from their day cares, schools, and sanctuaries, a carve-out that applies to anyone with a disability. Then there was the matter of finances. Evangelicals, sounding much like secular business owners, said it was simply too expensive to make churches and religious schools accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nThe idea that disabled people might need too much, cost too much, and drain resources better allocated elsewhere is much older than the fight over the ADA, and it has not always been limited to the right wing. Years on, the bipartisan popularity of that basic concern gives it staying power. When Nixon signed the Rehabilitation Act in 1973, he spoke of the need for \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d and \u201cself-sufficiency.\u201d In 1977, Cone and her fellow activists learned that Carter officials had not yet implemented Section 504 in part because they feared the expense. They believed the regulations \u201cjust went too far,\u201d she said in an oral history collected in the late 1990s.\n\nEvangelicals would thrill, later, to the \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d of George W. Bush, who said that the government should have an active role in American life while cutting the very taxes that helped fund it. To Bush and his allies, economic efficiency and benevolent social policy were not inherently at odds, but even their limited vision of charity would soon fall decidedly out of fashion within the GOP. The Tea Party gunslingers had no interest in compassion at all. In 2015, the year Cone died, Trump was taking over the GOP and a decade later, the efforts of conservatives like Eareckson Tada, who lobbied for the ADA, almost look quaint. The day belongs to Trump, who reportedly once said of the disabled, \u201cThe shape they\u2019re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.\u201d\n\nA commitment to laissez-faire economics does not make a person a social Darwinist by default, and the term has been popularized by critics to discredit various economic and social theories over the years of its popular use, as the scholar Robert Bannister observed. No one calls themselves a social Darwinist, either, not even Trump\u2019s lieutenant Elon Musk, but the latter\u2019s obsession with efficient public spending and the heritability of IQ provoke bleak comparisons. The historian Richard Hofstadter argued in 1944 that American businessmen saw in Darwin\u2019s theory an opportunity to justify the widespread inequality that enriched them: They had wealth not because of exploitation or greed but because they deserved it. \u201cIf the fittest are to be allowed to survive, if the benefits of efficient management are to be available to society, the captains of industry must be paid for their unique organizing talent,\u201d Hofstadter wrote. Those attitudes persist into the 21st century.\n\nAfter Trump first took office, House Republicans introduced a bill that would have made it more difficult to sue businesses for violating the ADA. It failed, but the party wasn\u2019t finished. Later the same year, Republicans attempted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with a bill that would have provided weaker benefits to people with \u201cpreexisting conditions,\u201d which sparked dramatic protests from members of ADAPT, a disability-rights group. That bill failed, too, but it belonged to a trend. Keelan-Chaffins, who participated in the Capitol Crawl, said in 2020 that \u201cI kind of feel like we\u2019ve stepped backward a bit,\u201d and her mother added that people \u201cjust kind of feel like they don\u2019t have to comply\u201d with the ADA anymore. During the height of COVID, Republican politicians and conservative billionaires like Tim Dunn of Texas urged the Trump administration to prioritize the economy while, in Dunn\u2019s words, allowing the \u201cat-risk population\u201d to \u201ctake extreme precautions with support from their communities,\u201d not the government. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce complains that \u201cabusive\u201d ADA lawsuits unfairly penalize small-business owners. In most states, it\u2019s still legal for businesses to pay disabled workers a subminimum wage.\n\nThe reelection of Trump brought us DOGE, and as Elon Musk and his young engineers search for fraud, they spin a familiar tale: Where there is need, there must be waste. Musk has claimed, falsely, that \u201cmillions\u201d of dead people are receiving Social Security benefits. Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, tells me that the Social Security Administration\u2019s payment accuracy rate is over 99 percent, and when errors do happen, they\u2019re often caused by paperwork delays. Disabled people who receive benefits aren\u2019t living in luxury, either. Many fall into the \u201cpoverty trap,\u201d which happens when \u201cthe rules of a program inhibit a person\u2019s opportunities either to work or to otherwise get out of poverty,\u201d Romig explains. To qualify for Supplemental Security Income, an individual with disabilities is subject to an asset limit of $2,000. \u201cAnd the moment you go over $2,000, if you have $2,500 in your account or something, you lose access to your whole benefit,\u201d she adds. The asset limit has not been updated since 1989. \u201cI think it is very much a poverty threat because there\u2019s a lot of research now on how having at least some kind of financial cushion, or an emergency fund, can really help your situation from spiraling out of control and keep you at a subsistence level of existence,\u201d she says.\n\nSocial Security and Medicaid are popular with voters, but the disabled among them remain vulnerable to the GOP\u2019s social Darwinists. Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, says that Medicaid cuts could threaten the program\u2019s home- and community-based services, which often covers personal and home care for people with disabilities, depending on the state. Most people don\u2019t want to live in a residential or institutional setting, Gross explains. \u201cThey\u2019ll be cut off from their communities,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s more abuse in those settings than in community settings, and you just lose a lot of autonomy and choice in your life if you\u2019re put in a residential setting.\u201d That independence is now at risk. \u201cSo if states get a big Medicaid cut, like a cut to how much the federal government is giving them to spend on Medicaid, the first place states will cut their own Medicaid spending is HCBS,\u201d she adds, which would jeopardize \u201cone of the most important services the government provides autistic people.\u201d\n\nThe Medicaid cuts as proposed may fund tax breaks for corporations and wealthy households, which the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute recently described as \u201cthe clearest legislative priority of the Trump administration and the Republican congressional majority.\u201d There are moral implications to any economic policy, and the abrogation of basic rights and care would plunge millions into uncertainty.\n\nASAN, in a bid to prevent that possibility from coming to pass, is lobbying members of Congress against Medicaid cuts and the Trump administration\u2019s mass layoffs of government workers. \u201cWe\u2019re also doing a lot of work to try to empower our community to get more involved in policy,\u201d Gross says. The organization is creating plain-language guides that explain complex policy topics and offers guidelines and scripts that help autistic people contact their representatives. \u201cA lot of autistic people struggle with speaking on the phone or may not be able to speak at all,\u201d she says, so ASAN provides proxy calling where a person will craft the message they want to deliver, and a volunteer places the call for them. \u201cPhone calls are really prioritized over emails and text-based communications in terms of just how Congress works,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s the way that we\u2019re trying to make sure that all of our grassroots can have their voices heard.\u201d\n\nHours before I spoke to Gross, the Washington Post reported that RFK Jr. had hired David Geier to lead a new government study into the debunked link between vaccines and autism. Geier was disciplined by Maryland regulators in 2011 for practicing medicine without a license, which has not stopped Kennedy from citing his dubious research as part of a crusade against vaccines. But Geier\u2019s problems are far more extensive than his retracted studies. He and his father, Mark, who lost his Maryland medical license in 2012, built a laboratory in their basement and injected autistic children with a prostate cancer drug for years, a treatment they falsely billed as a cure. \u201cThe fact that this person has been appointed to run this study just shows that they\u2019re going to really put their thumb on the scale in terms of the results of this study, and that\u2019s going to be terrible for vaccine hesitancy in this country, and people will die as a result,\u201d Gross tells me.\n\nYet the Trump administration and its supporters deny the stakes of their policies. By eliminating \u201cDEI,\u201d they are defending merit; by elevating Geier, or Kennedy himself, they make America healthy again. When they use slurs, they simply exercise their free speech, and anyone who objects is a snowflake. Musk said he is autistic, but he likes to call his critics \u201cretards,\u201d and he is not alone. As one anonymous banker told the Financial Times last year, \u201cI feel liberated. We can say \u2018retard\u2019 and \u2018pussy\u2019 without the fear of getting canceled.\u201d\n\nSlurs are more than hot air, and Musk uses them to reinforce a revanchist strategy that is as material as it is semantic. Disabled Americans already had to worry about the poverty trap, and now a far-right billionaire wants to kick millions off the socioeconomic ladder into darkness. That he does so while complaining of anti-white bias is no coincidence. Black Americans are likelier than white Americans to have a disability, owing to structural inequalities that Musk and the Trump administration are poised to exacerbate \u2014 by design. Lomax, a Black disabled man, spent much of his short life fighting a version of America that is not so distant. To the right wing, \u201cDEI is less \u2018white fragility\u2019 and silly posters about \u2018white-supremacy culture\u2019 than it is the mere presence of a woman or nonwhite person or disabled or transgender person in any high-skilled, high-status position,\u201d Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times wrote. \u201cAnd their alternative isn\u2019t some heretofore unknown standard of merit; it is the reintroduction of something like segregation.\u201d Today\u2019s war on disabled people is part of a much older campaign against civil rights for all minorities.\n\nThe integration of people with disabilities into American life only became possible through the restructuring of a hostile society. Autonomy, for the disabled, is not defined by the absence of need but the pursuit of liberation, which means it is about power. It is, as Davidson of the AAPD tells me, \u201cabout treating us like human beings.\u201d She adds that we \u201cdeserve to be able to speak for ourselves in whatever way we can, for our essential human nature and human desire, to have control over our lives as much as possible to be recognized by the world around us.\u201d Her comment reminded me of a speech by Cone, who, after the 504 sit-in, said that activists had \u201cwritten a new page in American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe showed strength and courage and power and commitment,\u201d Cone recalled, adding \u201cthat we the shut-ins, or the shut-outs, we the hidden, supposedly the frail and the weak, that we can wage a struggle at the highest level of government and win.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s time to write another page."

(That view holds across party lines, including 78% of Republicans, 82% of independents and 90% of Democrats.)\n\nTrump, Republicans and allies like Elon Musk have railed against courts that sided against the administration as the White House pushes a historically aggressive agenda.\n\nAt the forefront has been US District Judge James Boasberg, who has blocked the Trump administration\u2019s ability to use the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport some migrants. Boasberg\u2019s move last month led to Trump calling for his impeachment. Chief Justice John Roberts, in an extraordinarily rare move, rebuked Trump for his comments on March 18.\n\nRoberts\u2019 statement did not mention Trump by name, but it came hours after the president stepped up his attacks on federal judges by specifically calling for Boasberg to be impeached.\n\n\u201cThis judge, like many of the Crooked Judges\u2019 I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nSeveral Trump allies, including Elon Musk, have been calling for weeks to impeach judges amid a slew of preliminary rulings against the Trump administration. Trump\u2019s rhetoric opposing the judiciary has been far more aggressive than during his first term, and the administration\u2019s approach has raised fears of a constitutional crisis.\n\nRepublican members of Congress, responding to the president, have moved to impeach federal judges, who serve lifetime appointments. A Texas Republican, Rep. Brandon Gill, said on social media last month that he introduced articles of impeachment against Boasberg.\n\nImpeaching judges is exceedingly rare, and those resolutions are unlikely to advance.\n\nThe Marquette Law School poll was conducted March 17-27 and surveyed 1,021 US adults, using the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative online panel. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.\n\nCNN\u2019s John Fritze contributed to this report."

            "full_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump just took the greatest political gamble with the US economy of any modern president.\n\nPresidents normally try to do everything they can to avoid upsetting the country\u2019s economic engine and global stability \u2014 especially if unemployment is low and growth is ticking over, as it was when he took over from Joe Biden.\n\nBut with his stunning outburst of new tariffs on almost all imports from 185 nations, Trump administered an extraordinary shock that went against the advice of almost every economic expert and the lessons from some of history\u2019s grimmest omens.\n\nHe went with a lifelong belief in the mystical power of making imported goods uncompetitive to boost domestic production. No matter that trade wars tend to end badly and that tariffs are more a feature of the 19th century than the 21st.\n\nIn a surreal appearance in the White House Rose Garden Wednesday, Trump clung onto a big poster that showed new tariff rates as it swayed in the wind. The world saw an unrestrained president in the sole spotlight he adores, hazarding the economic fates of billions of people with an outlandish political bet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nThe biggest political surprise is that Trump \u2014 in the name of reviving the economic prospects of post-industrial regions ravaged by the loss of jobs and factories abroad \u2014 is about to inflict real pain on Americans.\n\nHe was elected five months ago in large part because voters were frustrated at high prices for groceries and housing after grinding inflation inflicted by Covid-19 and after the Biden administration\u2019s spending helped overheat the economy. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris had few good answers when asked how she\u2019d cut prices. But Trump projected blue-collar solidarity by working the fries station at a Pennsylvania McDonalds.\n\nYet he\u2019s gone all-in on a policy that will make almost everything people buy \u2014 from fast food to electronics, cars to new homes \u2014 pricier. Poorer people will get hurt more than Trump\u2019s rich friends, as will those who live on fixed incomes and can\u2019t bear to look at their plunging 401ks.\n\nHe told NBC at the weekend that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if the cost of buying cars shoots up. His new tariff experiment suggests that he means it. It\u2019s a staggering piece of political positioning for a billionaire president who heads a Cabinet of fellow billionaires and millionaires.\n\nForeign nations sure to hit back\n\nNo one can predict exactly how this gambit will play out.\n\nAssuming the full range of tariffs are implemented and there are no last minute opt-outs \u2014 a possibility that can\u2019t be ignored given Trump\u2019s past reversals \u2014 the world is set for a full-scale trade war.\n\nForeign leaders are as subject to political factors as Trump is. And they will be under fierce pressure to hit back at the US for a universal tariff of 10% on almost all nations, plus much higher rates for nations he said are the worst offenders.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a more loyal US ally than Australia. But its Prime Minister Anthony Albanese warned, \u201cThis is not the act of a friend.\u201d Foreign reprisals could set up an escalation ladder and make Trump \u2014 who always wants to get the last word \u2014 feel he\u2019s got no option but to respond.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t explain why it made sense for the world\u2019s mightiest economy to launch a trade war with tiny, troubled nations like Cambodia with a 49% tariff. Or why it\u2019s a good idea to make life even harder for developing countries in Africa. And is he really going to wage economic fights with penguins? The White House tariff list included the tiny Heard and McDonald Islands in Antarctica which are getting hit with a 10% tariff \u2013 despite being little more than a haven for seabirds.\n\nThe other great political risk from his new approach \u2014 which obliterates the free trade global system the United States spent decades building \u2014 is that it\u2019s unlikely Trump will get a short-term political payoff from his wager.\n\nMany analysts believe that it\u2019s a fantasy that manufacturers will decide to build new factories and supply chains in the US as Trump promises they will. But even if they did, the chances of it happening during his term \u2014 or even in the third term he\u2019s teasing despite constitutional prohibitions \u2014 are very slim.\n\nWhile the tariffs will raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the US Treasury, it\u2019s unclear whether voters will buy into his claim that they will all get compensated for higher prices \u2014 an effective new tax \u2014 in his promised tax cut bill. And all signs point to a measure, if it passes, that proportionally favors the very rich.\n\nA test of Trump\u2019s brand as defiant businessman\n\nThere is no doubting the audacity of Trump\u2019s big declaration of \u201cLiberation Day\u201d on Wednesday.\n\nFor weeks, he\u2019s made tariff threats and then suggested he\u2019d pull back. His supporters on Capitol Hill voiced the familiar trope that his bluster represented the master chess moves of an unbeatable deal maker. But barring a reversal that would turn into a major political climbdown, given his choreographing of a \u201chistoric\u201d turning point for America, Trump is not blinking this time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tries to reach a MAGA hat, on the day of his remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\u201cThis will be a very big moment. I think you\u2019re going to remember today,\u201d Trump told Cabinet members and congressional leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a day that hopefully you\u2019re going to look back in years to come and you\u2019re going to say, \u2018You know, he was right. This has turned out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s sense that he created a turning point is probably right: Some economists predict a return to the kind of trade barriers that caused the 1930s Great Depression will spark a recession.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It\u2019s our declaration of economic independence,\u201d the president said. For once, Trump\u2019s hyperbole could come back to haunt him.\n\nYet, Trump has an army of faithful voters who share his hatred of experts and establishment economists. His argument that the world is always ripping America off helped him win two elections.\n\nAs he put it on Wednesday, \u201cFor decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.\u201d He added: \u201cAmerican steel workers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen \u2026 they really suffered gravely. They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s two terms are proof that the benefits of globalization are not universally shared. Many of the swing states Trump won in 2016 and 2024 are scarred by industrial decline. Voters there remember promises made to them by previous presidents and think they were lied to.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsourcers, and special interests and the fake news,\u201d Trump told his audience at the White House \u2014 and his supporters sitting at home. \u201cBut never forget every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong.\u201d\n\nIf Trump bucks economic orthodoxy and returns prosperity to depressed regions his against-the-grain beliefs will be validated and his legacy will reflect his boldness.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville explained that his constituents still trust the president. \u201cThey believe him, and he\u2019s trying something different. We have to have a different game plan.\u201d The Alabama Republican and former Auburn football coach insisted: \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to run up the middle; sooner or later, we\u2019re going to have to throw a pass, and that\u2019s what he just did.\u201d\n\nAn opening for Democrats if things go wrong\n\nBut the economic situation is more complicated than a college football playbook.\n\nOne reason why the US has sometimes had smaller tariffs than its rivals is because of the power of the American consumer, the wealth of its own economy and the reasoning that a free trade system in which the United States is the dominant force makes the country even more powerful.\n\nIt\u2019s now going to get much harder for Americans to afford new cars, flat screen televisions and even to fill their grocery carts every week. If prices rise and inflation spikes, consumers could pull back, causing growth to slow into a recession \u2014 and the president will have handed Democrats a political gift. Footage of his Rose Garden session will anchor thousands of campaign ads in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 election.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade \u201cLiberation Day\u201d comes at a moment when the turmoil of the last two months may be souring voters on Republicans. In one of the first political tests of Trump\u2019s second term, a liberal candidate easily won a critical election in Wisconsin that decided the political destiny of the state Supreme Court. Chalk up a clear rebuke for Trump and his government-gutting friend Elon Musk.\n\nThe Democratic Party that has struggled to find an effective message against Trump could hardly miss after the pageantry of his tariff party.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge tax on American families, all to help billionaires get a tax cut,\u201d Democratic Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nSome Republicans might agree. Four of their number in the Senate tried to send a warning to the president on Wednesday evening, by voting with Democrats on a purely symbolic measure aimed at blocking tariffs on Canada.\n\nBut whether the country is headed over an economic cliff or to the new golden age that he\u2019s promising, his party \u2014 and every other American \u2014 is going with him."

            "full_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President JD Vance told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday evening that he and President Donald Trump are \u201cfocused on governing\u201d right now, not on who\u2019s running for president in 2028.\n\nVance said when Trump accomplishes all the agenda items he\u2019s currently focused on, Americans will be clamoring for another Trump term in the White House\u2014but that neither of them are thinking about the 2028 presidential election right now.\n\n\u201cWell, look, I think President Trump is going to accomplish so many great things for the American people, and he already has, but of course, we\u2019re only a few months into this, that I think by the end of his term, the American people were going to say, yeah, we\u2019d love to have a third term of President Trump,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cAt the same time, President Trump is not focused on politics, and I\u2019m not focused on politics. We\u2019re focused on governing, on actually delivering on the mandate that the American people gave us. So I expect to work with and for President Trump for years to come, not just over the next few years. We\u2019ll see what happens in 2026 and 2028, but I\u2019m focused on doing a good job for the American people right now, and I know that\u2019s what President Trump believes. If we take care of business now, yeah, the American people are going to want four more years of President Trump\u2019s leadership. But we got to deliver first, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s comments come after President Trump said in an interview this weekend that he would not rule out seeking a third term in the White House. Trump, who served as the 45th and is currently the 47th president of the United States, is technically term-limited per the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution from seeking a third term as president.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want me to do it,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News this weekend when asked if he would try to run again despite the Constitutional amendment that prohibits it. \u201cBut, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it\u2019s very early in the administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on the current,\u201d Trump also told NBC News.\n\nHere\u2019s more from the NBC News story from Kristen Welker and Megan Lebowitz:\n\nWhen asked whether he wanted another term, the president responded, \u201cI like working.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d Trump said, when asked to clarify. \u201cBut I\u2019m not \u2014 it is far too early to think about it.\u201d When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, \u201cThere are methods which you could do it.\u201d NBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that \u201cthat\u2019s one\u201d method. \u201cBut there are others, too,\u201d Trump added. Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded \u201cno.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to see, without another amendment to the Constitution altering the 22nd Amendment, how Trump could run for and win another term in the White House. It is also an understatement to say that amending the Constitution is a notoriously difficult process and unlikely to realistically happen in the timeframe between now and the 2028 presidential election.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this whole thing is that after Trump\u2019s comments to NBC News, the entire political establishment flew into a frenzied furor over the idea, when it\u2019s pretty clear Trump said right from the get-go that he is currently focused on working on the agenda. That\u2019s what Vance is saying to Breitbart News as well, that he and Trump are focused on accomplishing their campaign promises from the last election\u2014they have not even crossed the 100-day mark yet\u2014and this whole uproar seems to have just been a creation of NBC News in its questioning. Nonetheless, now the vice president, thanks to this Breitbart News interview, is on record on the matter as saying he believes in a few years after Trump\u2019s policies benefit Americans, they will be pining for another term of Trump, but he and the president are focused on those policies at this point and not on answering that 2028 presidential election question right now."
