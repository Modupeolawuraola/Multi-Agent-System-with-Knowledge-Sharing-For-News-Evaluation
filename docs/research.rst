Research Methodology
===================

Problem Statement
--------------
This research study addresses the challenge of media bias in news reporting and the need for automated tools to detect, analyze, and mitigate such bias. The proliferation of news sources with varying political leanings makes it difficult for readers to access balanced information, creating a need for systems that can identify bias and provide more objective summaries.
Research Areas
------------
Our research spans several key areas:

1. **Bias Detection in Media**: Techniques for identifying political slant, framing bias, and emotional manipulation in news articles
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Exploring how specialized agents can collaborate to achieve complex tasks
3. **Knowledge Graph Applications**: Using graph-based knowledge representation for contextual understanding
4. **Large Language Model Customization**: Fine-tuning LLMs for specific bias detection and fact-checking tasks

Methodology
----------
Our research methodology combines qualitative and quantitative approaches:

1. **Literature Review**: Analysis of existing research on media bias detection, multi-agent systems, and knowledge graphs
2. **System Development**: Iterative design and implementation of the multi-agent system
3. **Data Collection**: Gathering diverse news articles from various sources across the political spectrum
4. **Experimental Testing**: Evaluating system performance using controlled inputs and comparing against human assessments
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarking our system against existing bias detection tools

Results Analysis
--------------
The effectiveness of our system is evaluated based on several metrics:

1. **Bias Detection Accuracy**: The system's ability to correctly identify political bias in news articles
2. **Fact-Checking Reliability**: The accuracy of fact verification against trusted sources
3. **Summary Quality**: The objectivity and completeness of generated summaries
4. **System Efficiency**: Performance metrics including response time and resource utilization
5. **Knowledge Graph Effectiveness**: Evaluation of how knowledge sharing enhances agent performance

Key Findings

Future Research Directions
------------------------
Potential areas for future research include:

1. Extending the system to handle more languages and cultural contexts
2. Implementing more sophisticated bias detection mechanisms
3. Exploring different knowledge sharing architectures among agents
4. Developing more advanced summarization techniques for presenting balanced viewpoints
