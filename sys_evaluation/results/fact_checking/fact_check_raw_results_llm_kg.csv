The Cleveland Clinic recently warned that millions of COVID-19 vaccinated will die within 5 years.,False,False,"This claim is false and appears to be misinformation. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information related to this claim, which is a strong indicator that it is not based on factual reporting. The Cleveland Clinic is a highly reputable medical institution, and if they had made such a dire warning about COVID-19 vaccines, it would have been widely reported and included in recent, verified news articles. Additionally, such a claim contradicts the overwhelming scientific consensus on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. In the absence of any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and given the extraordinary nature of the claim, it can be confidently assessed as false."
P urports to show an X post from Elon Musk claiming the DOGE team found ‘tens of millions of dollars spent on golf by one government official’  False,Unknown,True,"The claim states that an X post purportedly from Elon Musk about the DOGE team finding 'tens of millions of dollars spent on golf by one government official' is false. While the knowledge graph context does not provide any specific information about this claim, it also does not show any evidence of such a post by Elon Musk. Given Musk's high profile and the controversial nature of such a claim, it's highly likely that if he had made such a statement, it would have been included in the knowledge graph. The absence of any related information supports the assertion that the claim about this post is false."
"During a March 2025 congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. Keith Self, a Republican from Texas, quoted Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels as saying, “It is the absolute right of the state to supervise the formation of public opinion.",True,False,"The claim refers to a specific event in March 2025 involving U.S. Rep. Keith Self quoting Joseph Goebbels during a congressional hearing. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about this event, Keith Self, or the quoted statement. The context only shows multiple empty relationships for the Republican Party, which is not directly relevant to the claim. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and given that the event is said to occur in the future (2025), it's not possible to verify this claim as true. Therefore, based on the lack of corroborating information and the future date, I'm inclined to consider this claim false."
Video of gray skies in northern Michigan is proof of weather modification.,False,False,"The claim that a video of gray skies in northern Michigan is proof of weather modification is false. While the knowledge graph context provided no specific information related to this claim, it's important to note that gray skies are a common natural occurrence and do not inherently indicate any form of weather modification. Weather patterns, including cloudy or overcast conditions, are the result of complex atmospheric processes. Without substantial scientific evidence, it is incorrect to attribute gray skies to deliberate weather modification. The claim appears to be based on speculation rather than factual evidence."
No perpetrator of a school shooting has ever been sentenced to death.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information about school shootings or death penalty sentences for such perpetrators, I can rely on my internal knowledge to address this claim. There has been at least one case where a perpetrator of a school shooting was sentenced to death, which makes the claim false. Nikolas Cruz, the perpetrator of the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, was sentenced to death in 2022 for some of the murders he committed during the shooting. However, my confidence is not at the highest level because the knowledge graph doesn't provide supporting information, and there could potentially be more recent developments that I'm not aware of."
Claim by Laura Loomer: Conservative activist Laura Loomer’s reporting proves “Alex Wong is the individual who added (journalist) Jeffrey Goldberg” to the Trump administration Signal group text about bombing Yemen.,False,False,"The claim by Laura Loomer cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information linking Alex Wong to adding Jeffrey Goldberg to a Trump administration Signal group text about bombing Yemen. There is no evidence or mention of such a group text, Alex Wong's role, or any connection between these individuals in the given context. The knowledge graph only shows isolated entities (Jeffrey Goldberg, Laura Loomer, and Alex Wong) without any relationships or additional information that could support this claim."
"U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Tex., collected her dead grandmother’s Social Security checks for 13 years.",False,False,"The claim that U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Tex., collected her dead grandmother's Social Security checks for 13 years is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Crockett's grandmother, Social Security checks, or any fraudulent activity. While the knowledge graph confirms that Jasmine Crockett is associated with the United States House of Representatives, it does not provide any evidence to support the specific allegation made in the claim. In the absence of supporting evidence, and given the serious nature of the accusation, it is more likely that this claim is false. However, the confidence score is not 100 because the knowledge graph does not explicitly refute the claim either."
"If you update your iPhone to iOS 18.3, you are going to have Starlink automatically installed in your phone.",False,False,"The claim that updating an iPhone to iOS 18.3 would automatically install Starlink is false. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1) iOS 18.3 does not exist yet. As of now, the latest version of iOS is 16.x, with iOS 17 expected to be released later in 2023. 2) Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX, not a mobile phone application. It requires specialized hardware to connect to the satellite network and cannot be 'installed' on a phone like a typical app. 3) Apple has strict control over what is pre-installed on iPhones, and they would not automatically install third-party services without user consent. 4) The knowledge graph context provided no information to support this claim, which would be a major tech industry development if true. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph further reinforces that this claim is false."
"The Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) discovered there were 394 million Social Security recipients in the U.S., while there were only 344 million U.S. citizens.",False,False,"The claim is false for multiple reasons. First, there is no 'Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE)' in the U.S. government structure. More importantly, the numbers cited in the claim are grossly inaccurate. While the knowledge graph doesn't provide specific information about Social Security recipients or U.S. population, as an AI with access to general knowledge, I can confidently state that the U.S. population is approximately 330 million, not 344 million as claimed. Furthermore, the number of Social Security recipients is significantly less than the total population, not more. As of 2021, there were about 65 million Social Security beneficiaries, far fewer than the 394 million claimed. The claim's numbers are so wildly inaccurate that it can be confidently labeled as false, even without specific information from the knowledge graph."
A post made on X claims more Wisconsin voters showed up to vote for the State Supreme Court Judge Election than the 2024 Presidential Election. ,False,False,"The claim is false because it compares voter turnout for an event that has already occurred (the Wisconsin State Supreme Court Judge Election) with an event that has not yet taken place (the 2024 Presidential Election). The 2024 Presidential Election is still in the future, so it's impossible to compare its voter turnout with any past election. The knowledge graph context does not provide any specific information about voter turnout for either election, but the presence of '2024 Presidential Election' as a node confirms that this is a future event. Therefore, any claim comparing its turnout to a past election is inherently false."
Claim by amdailynews.com: Elon Musk reported to be in talks to buy the Cincinnati Bengals.,False,False,"The claim that Elon Musk is in talks to buy the Cincinnati Bengals appears to be false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no connections or nodes related to the Cincinnati Bengals, NFL team purchases, or any negotiations involving Elon Musk and the Bengals. Given Musk's high-profile status, if such talks were occurring, it would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph. The absence of any supporting information strongly suggests this claim is false. Additionally, the source 'amdailynews.com' is not a widely recognized reputable news outlet, which further raises suspicion about the claim's validity."
Claim by Cory Booker: “The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down.,True,False,"The claim by Cory Booker that 'consumer confidence in this country has gone way down' cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any specific information about consumer confidence trends in the United States. Without concrete data or recent statistics about consumer confidence levels, it's not possible to confirm or deny Booker's statement. However, given that consumer confidence is a regularly tracked economic indicator, and significant changes in it would likely be reflected in economic reporting, the absence of such information in the context suggests that there may not have been a dramatic downturn as implied by the claim. It's important to note that this reasoning is based on the lack of evidence rather than contradictory evidence, which reduces the confidence in the verdict."
"Fox News removed a live stocks ticker from its broadcast for the first time in 28 years when the stock market crashed after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, 2025.",False,False,"The claim is false for multiple reasons. First, the date mentioned in the claim (April 2, 2025) is in the future, so it cannot be a factual event that has already occurred. Second, the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Fox News removing a live stocks ticker or any stock market crash related to Trump's tariffs. Additionally, there is no evidence in the given context to support the claim that Fox News has had a continuous live stocks ticker for 28 years. The lack of any supporting information in the knowledge graph, combined with the future date, strongly indicates that this claim is fabricated."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Boasberg “seems to be grabbing the ‘Trump Cases’ all to himself.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about Judge Boasberg or case assignments, the claim made by Donald Trump appears to be false based on general knowledge of the U.S. judicial system. Federal judges do not 'grab' cases for themselves. Cases are typically assigned randomly or through a predetermined system to ensure fairness and impartiality. Trump's statement suggests improper behavior by Judge Boasberg, which is a serious allegation without evidence. The lack of supporting information in the knowledge graph for this claim, combined with the known procedures of the court system, leads to the conclusion that the statement is likely false."
President Trump’s tariffs will increase consumer prices.,True,True,"While the provided knowledge graph context does not contain specific information about tariffs or consumer prices, the claim that President Trump's tariffs will increase consumer prices is generally considered true based on economic principles. Tariffs typically raise the cost of imported goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers. However, the lack of direct evidence in the given context reduces the confidence score. This verdict relies more on general economic understanding rather than specific information from the knowledge graph."
Article states that a recent study shows that people who identify as LGBTQ have a lower IQ than average.,False,False,"The claim that a recent study shows LGBTQ individuals have a lower IQ than average is likely false. There is no information provided in the knowledge graph context to support this claim. Moreover, such a claim would be highly controversial and not supported by credible scientific research. Reputable studies on intelligence have not found a correlation between sexual orientation or gender identity and IQ. The claim appears to be promoting a harmful stereotype without scientific basis. In the absence of any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph and given the nature of the claim, it can be confidently assessed as false."
Claim by JD Vance (R): Kilmar Armado Abrego-Garcia “was a convicted MS-13 gang member.,False,False,"The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Kilmar Armado Abrego-Garcia or his alleged connection to MS-13. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, it's not possible to verify JD Vance's claim. The lack of relevant information in the context makes it difficult to determine the truthfulness of the statement with any certainty. Given the seriousness of the claim and the absence of corroborating data, I'm inclined to lean towards false, but with very low confidence."
"Claim by Suzanne Humphries, Joe Rogan: Polio renamed to hide its existence; polio vaccine doesn’t work; mercury, SV40 and DNA contamination in vaccines are harmful.",False,False,"The claim contains multiple false statements about polio and vaccines that are not supported by scientific evidence. While the knowledge graph context does not provide specific information about polio or vaccines, it's important to note that reputable medical and scientific organizations consistently affirm the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, including the polio vaccine. The claim that polio was simply renamed is a common misconception that ignores the well-documented success of polio vaccination programs. The allegations about mercury, SV40, and DNA contamination in vaccines are either outdated or misrepresented. Modern vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the overwhelming scientific consensus on vaccine safety and effectiveness, strongly indicates that this claim is false."
"Did she say it?: Former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney told fellow Republicans during a June 2022 hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots: “There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.",True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about Liz Cheney's statement, the claim is well-known and widely reported. As a fact-checking assistant with access to comprehensive U.S. politics knowledge, I can confirm that Liz Cheney did indeed make this statement during a June 2022 hearing on the January 6 Capitol riots. The quote is accurate and has been widely circulated in reputable news sources. The statement was made as part of Cheney's role on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 events, where she addressed her fellow Republicans who continued to support former President Donald Trump despite evidence presented during the hearings."
Screenshots show Speaker Mike Johnson messaging on Grindr.,False,False,"The claim that screenshots show Speaker Mike Johnson messaging on Grindr is likely false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no mentions of Grindr, screenshots, or any messaging activities related to Mike Johnson. Given that Mike Johnson is a public figure and the current Speaker of the House, if such screenshots existed and were legitimate, it would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph with connections to related concepts or news events. The absence of any such information suggests that this claim is likely a fabrication or unsubstantiated rumor."
"Wisconsin ran out of ballots in “red” districts on state supreme court election day, 2025.",False,False,"The claim states that Wisconsin ran out of ballots in 'red' districts during the state supreme court election in 2025. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about ballot shortages, election issues, or even a state supreme court election in Wisconsin in 2025. Additionally, 2025 is a future date, and we cannot verify events that have not yet occurred. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the future date, strongly suggests that this claim is false."
"Claim by Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) : On PBS, “they now have drag queen storytime instead of good old ‘Sesame Street.’.",False,False,"The claim by Marjorie Taylor Greene that PBS has replaced 'Sesame Street' with drag queen storytime is false. The knowledge graph context does not provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, the context shows that both 'Sesame Street' and PBS are still separate entities, implying that 'Sesame Street' continues to be a part of PBS programming. There is no mention of drag queen storytime replacing 'Sesame Street' or any other PBS content. Additionally, 'Sesame Street' is a long-running, iconic children's program that continues to air on PBS, and there is no credible information suggesting it has been replaced."
Trump posted on Truth Social he was going to end all dual citizenship and that he would “denaturalize and deport” all these traitors under the espionage act.,False,False,"The claim states that Trump posted on Truth Social about ending dual citizenship and deporting 'traitors' under the espionage act. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no nodes or relationships mentioning Truth Social posts, dual citizenship, denaturalization, deportation, or the espionage act in relation to Donald Trump. The absence of such information in the context, which would likely be included if such a significant and controversial statement had been made, suggests that the claim is false."
"In February 2025, Pope Francis wrote a letter to U.S. bishops addressing what he described as the “major crisis” of mass deportations.",True,False,"The claim is false based on two main factors: the date mentioned and the specific event described. First, the claim refers to an event in February 2025, which is in the future and hasn't occurred yet. Second, while Pope Francis has addressed various social and political issues, including immigration, there is no evidence in the provided knowledge graph context of a specific letter to U.S. bishops about a 'major crisis' of mass deportations. The knowledge graph doesn't provide any information related to this claim, which would be significant if it had occurred. Given the lack of supporting evidence and the future date, we can confidently say this claim is false."
Elon Musk funded a Neuralink implant procedure for a 7-year-old girl “who was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder.,False,False,"The claim states that Elon Musk funded a Neuralink implant procedure for a 7-year-old girl with a rare neurological disorder. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no connections or nodes related to Neuralink implants, funding of medical procedures, or any mention of a 7-year-old girl with a neurological disorder. The absence of relevant information in the context, which should contain recent verified facts about Elon Musk, suggests that this claim is likely false or at least not supported by recent verified news."
A March 2025 video demonstrated that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi had issued an arrest warrant for Hillary Clinton.,False,False,"The claim is false for several reasons. First, Pam Bondi is not the U.S. Attorney General in March 2025 or at any other time. The knowledge graph does not provide any information about Pam Bondi being the U.S. Attorney General. Secondly, there is no evidence in the provided context of an arrest warrant being issued for Hillary Clinton. The knowledge graph does not contain any information about recent legal actions against Hillary Clinton. Additionally, the claim refers to a future date (March 2025) which has not occurred yet, making it impossible for such a video to exist at the present time. The lack of any supporting information in the knowledge graph for these key elements of the claim strongly suggests that this is a false statement."
Elon Musk said “Tesla is finished” and needs “drastic changes immediately.,False,False,"The claim states that Elon Musk said 'Tesla is finished' and needs 'drastic changes immediately.' However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no nodes or relationships that indicate Elon Musk making such statements about Tesla. Given Musk's position as CEO of Tesla and his typically optimistic public statements about the company, it seems unlikely he would make such a negative declaration without significant evidence. The lack of supporting information in the knowledge graph, which should contain recent and verified news, suggests this claim is likely false."
This is evidence “the elites” got fake vaccine shots.,False,False,"The claim that 'the elites' received fake vaccine shots is not supported by any evidence provided in the knowledge graph context. In fact, no relevant information was given in the context to either support or refute this claim. This type of assertion is often associated with conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns, which typically lack credible evidence. Without any supporting data from reliable sources, and given the serious nature of such an accusation, it would be irresponsible to consider this claim as true. The absence of evidence in the knowledge graph, which is supposed to contain recent, verified information, further suggests that this claim is likely false."
"Ford plans to move four factories back to the U.S., along with 25,000 high-paying jobs, all thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2025 tariffs.",False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on the lack of supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Ford moving factories back to the U.S., creating 25,000 high-paying jobs, or any 2025 tariffs implemented by Donald Trump. While Donald Trump is mentioned in the context, there are no connections or information related to the specific claims made about Ford or job creation. The absence of any relevant information in a comprehensive knowledge graph strongly suggests that this claim is fabricated or misinformed."
Remdesivir is responsible for a significant number of COVID-19 deaths and was found to be “deadly” during a 2019 trial. ,False,False,"The claim that Remdesivir is responsible for a significant number of COVID-19 deaths and was found to be 'deadly' during a 2019 trial is false. While the provided knowledge graph context does not offer specific information about Remdesivir, this claim contradicts well-established medical research and regulatory approvals. Remdesivir has been approved by the FDA and other health authorities for the treatment of COVID-19 based on clinical trials demonstrating its safety and efficacy. No reputable studies have shown it to be 'deadly.' The claim appears to be misinformation. However, due to the lack of specific information in the provided context, I cannot be 100% certain, which is reflected in the confidence score."
C laims MSNBC was purportedly caught using leftist plants to pretend they’re Trump voters with ‘Buyer’s Remorse’ ,False,False,"The claim suggests that MSNBC was caught using leftist plants pretending to be Trump voters with 'Buyer's Remorse'. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting or refuting this specific claim. There are no connections or nodes that relate to MSNBC using plants, Trump voters, or any concept of 'Buyer's Remorse'. The lack of relevant information in the knowledge graph makes it impossible to verify this claim based on the given context. In the absence of supporting evidence, and given the serious nature of the accusation against a major news network, it's more likely that this claim is false or unsubstantiated."
"Claim by Sydney Batch (D): North Carolina “always had nonpartisan judicial races, and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it.",False,False,"The claim by Sydney Batch (D) that North Carolina 'always had nonpartisan judicial races, and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it' cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about North Carolina's judicial races or their partisan nature. Without specific evidence from the knowledge graph to support or refute the claim, we must rely on general knowledge. Historically, North Carolina has had both partisan and nonpartisan judicial elections at different times, which contradicts the claim that they 'always had nonpartisan judicial races.' Additionally, changes to judicial election systems have occurred under different party controls over the years, not exclusively when Republicans took over. However, due to the lack of specific information in the provided context, we cannot be entirely certain about the exact timeline or details of these changes."
"An authentic video show members of the Danish Parliament laughing at a recording of March 2025 remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump, outlining his intent to acquire Greenland.",False,False,"The claim is false based on several key factors. First, the claim refers to events in March 2025, which is in the future and cannot have occurred yet. Second, while Donald Trump did express interest in acquiring Greenland during his presidency, this occurred in 2019, not 2025. Third, Trump is not currently the U.S. President, and there's no indication in the knowledge graph that he will be president again in 2025. Lastly, there's no information in the provided knowledge graph context about any video of Danish Parliament members laughing at Trump's remarks. The lack of any supporting evidence in the extensive knowledge graph about Trump strongly suggests this claim is fabricated."
A photo authentically showed White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wearing a T-shirt that reads: “Make America Blonde Again.,True,False,"The claim appears to be false based on the available information and context. The knowledge graph does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Karoline Leavitt wore a T-shirt with the phrase 'Make America Blonde Again.' In fact, the knowledge graph doesn't contain any information about Leavitt's clothing choices or any controversial statements she may have made. As the current White House Press Secretary, it would be highly unusual and inappropriate for her to wear such a politically charged and potentially offensive shirt. Additionally, there is no credible news source or official statement mentioned in the context that would corroborate this claim. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the improbability of such an action from a high-ranking White House official, strongly suggests that this claim is false and likely a fabrication or misrepresentation."
A post shared on X claims that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth messaged his Signal group a picture of carrier locations. ,False,False,"The claim is false based on several key factors. First, Pete Hegseth is not the current Defense Secretary of the United States. The current Defense Secretary is Lloyd Austin. Second, there is no evidence in the provided knowledge graph context or in reliable public sources that Pete Hegseth has ever held the position of Defense Secretary. Pete Hegseth is known to be a former Army National Guard officer and a television host, but not a high-ranking government official in the Department of Defense. Additionally, sharing classified information like carrier locations through a messaging app would be a serious security breach, which is highly unlikely for any Defense Secretary to do. The lack of any supporting information in the knowledge graph context about such an incident further reinforces the conclusion that this claim is false."
Girls have sperm in their bone marrow and can make a baby on their own but the only result is a babygirl.,False,False,"This claim is entirely false and not supported by any scientific evidence. The knowledge graph context provided is empty, which is appropriate because there is no factual basis for this claim. Human reproduction requires both sperm from males and eggs from females. Girls do not produce sperm in their bone marrow or anywhere else in their bodies. The process of creating a baby without sperm (parthenogenesis) does not occur naturally in humans. This claim appears to be a complete fabrication or misunderstanding of human biology."
Claim by CO2 Coalition: CO2 is not correlated with global temperatures.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided is empty, I can confidently state that the claim by the CO2 Coalition is false based on well-established scientific consensus. However, I must note that this verdict is based on my internal knowledge rather than the provided context, which lowers the confidence score. Extensive scientific research has shown a strong correlation between CO2 levels and global temperatures over both geological timescales and in recent history. The greenhouse effect of CO2 is a fundamental principle in climate science, and numerous studies have demonstrated the relationship between rising CO2 levels and increasing global temperatures. The lack of context in the knowledge graph prevents me from citing specific supporting evidence, which is why the confidence score is not higher."
Richard Gere is leaving the United States because of Trump.,False,False,"The claim that Richard Gere is leaving the United States because of Trump is not supported by any evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Richard Gere, his residency status, or any plans to leave the country. Additionally, there is no mention of Donald Trump or any political motivations for anyone leaving the United States. While the knowledge graph context does not explicitly refute the claim, the absence of any supporting information, combined with the fact that such a high-profile move by a celebrity would likely be reported if true, suggests that this claim is likely false."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): “We have automobile plants being built at levels we’ve never seen … and they’re going up fast.,False,False,"The claim by Donald Trump about automobile plants being built at unprecedented levels and going up fast cannot be verified or supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about automobile plants, their construction, or the automotive industry in general. Without supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and considering Trump's tendency to exaggerate economic achievements, this claim is likely to be false or at least significantly overstated. However, due to the lack of specific contradicting information in the provided context, the confidence score is moderate."
"Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint for a Republican presidency, recommended government officials use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal to evade transparency and recordkeeping laws.",False,False,"The claim states that Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint, recommended government officials use encrypted messaging apps like Signal to evade transparency and recordkeeping laws. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information that supports or refutes this claim. There are no connections between Project 2025 and Signal or any other encrypted messaging apps. The lack of relevant information in the knowledge graph makes it difficult to verify the claim with high confidence. Based on the absence of supporting evidence and the serious nature of the accusation (recommending evasion of transparency laws), I am inclined to consider the claim false. However, my confidence is limited due to the lack of specific information in the provided context."
claims General Motors has purportedly ended its relationship with Canadian parts makers ,False,False,"The claim states that General Motors has ended its relationship with Canadian parts makers. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to this claim. There are no nodes or relationships that mention Canadian parts makers or any changes in General Motors' business relationships. Due to the lack of relevant information in the knowledge graph, I cannot confidently verify or refute this claim based on the given context."
Says Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “engaged in election interference by campaigning” in Pennsylvania for former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.,False,False,"The claim is false based on several key factors. First, the knowledge graph context provides no information to support the claim that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy campaigned in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris. Second, Kamala Harris was never a Democratic presidential nominee; she was Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate in the 2020 election. This fundamental error in the claim significantly undermines its credibility. Additionally, there is no evidence in the provided context or in widely reported news that Zelenskyy has ever campaigned in U.S. elections, which would be highly unusual and likely controversial for a foreign leader. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the factual errors in the claim itself, strongly indicates that this statement is false."
Leaked J.D. Vance audio in which he criticizes Elon Musk is authentic.,False,False,"The claim states that leaked audio of J.D. Vance criticizing Elon Musk is authentic. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about J.D. Vance, leaked audio, or any criticism of Elon Musk. The context only shows multiple empty relationships connected to Elon Musk, without any specific information. Due to the lack of relevant information in the knowledge graph to support or refute the claim, I cannot confirm its authenticity. In the absence of supporting evidence, and considering the specific nature of the claim, it is more likely to be false than true."
"In March 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense removed references of the Holocaust from its website.",True,False,"The claim states that the U.S. Department of Defense removed references to the Holocaust from its website in March 2025. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to this claim. There are no connections or nodes that mention the Department of Defense, website changes, or any actions taken in 2025. Additionally, the claim refers to a future date (March 2025) which has not occurred yet, making it impossible for this event to have happened. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the future date mentioned, the claim is likely false."
Trump has a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper up in the Oval Office.,False,False,"The claim that Trump has a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper up in the Oval Office is likely false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information linking Trump, the Oval Office, or Bitcoin. While the context includes mentions of both Trump and the Oval Office, there is no evidence or suggestion of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency-related items being displayed in the Oval Office. Given the high-profile nature of both Trump and the Oval Office, it's likely that such an unusual display would have been reported if it were true. The absence of this information in the context suggests the claim is false."
Tesla permanently closed its Manhattan location.,False,False,"The provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Tesla's Manhattan location or its closure. Without specific evidence to support or refute the claim, it's not possible to definitively determine if Tesla has permanently closed its Manhattan location. The lack of relevant information in the context reduces confidence in any verdict. Given the absence of supporting evidence, I'm leaning towards false, but with very low confidence."
"Claim by Brooke Rollins: A $600,000 federal grant went to study “menstrual cycles in transgender men.",False,False,"Based on the provided knowledge graph context, there is no information to support or refute the claim made by Brooke Rollins about a $600,000 federal grant for studying menstrual cycles in transgender men. The knowledge graph does not contain any relevant information about this specific grant or study. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and considering the specific nature of the claim, it's more likely to be false or at least unverified. However, due to the lack of contradictory information, the confidence in this verdict is relatively low."
"C laims Warren Buffett purportedly said, ‘President Trump [is] making [the] best financial decisions in 50 years’ ",False,False,"The claim that Warren Buffett said 'President Trump [is] making [the] best financial decisions in 50 years' appears to be false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Warren Buffett making such a statement or any reference to Trump's financial decisions being praised. Additionally, while the context includes multiple mentions of Donald Trump, there is no connection to Warren Buffett or any positive financial assessment. Given Buffett's well-known political leanings and past statements, it would be highly unusual for him to make such a strong positive statement about Trump's financial decisions. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the improbability of such a statement, leads to the conclusion that this claim is likely false."
"The U.S. Department of Defense in early 2025 removed a webpage about Ira Hayes, a Marine and Pima Nation member best known for being one of the six men who raised a U.S. flag on Iwo Jima during WWII.",True,False,"The claim states that the U.S. Department of Defense removed a webpage about Ira Hayes in early 2025. However, this claim cannot be true because it refers to a future event (early 2025) that has not yet occurred. As of now, we are not in 2025, so it's impossible for the Department of Defense to have already taken this action. Additionally, the knowledge graph context provided is empty, which means there's no specific information to support or refute the claim. The verdict is based on the logical impossibility of the stated timeframe rather than any evidence from the knowledge graph."
"Claim by RFK Jr.: “A lot of studies” show that getting measles “boosts your immune system later in life against cancers, atopic diseases, cardiac disease.",False,False,"The claim by RFK Jr. suggesting that 'a lot of studies' show measles boosts the immune system against cancers, atopic diseases, and cardiac disease later in life is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. In fact, the knowledge graph does not provide any information about measles having beneficial effects on the immune system or protecting against the mentioned diseases. The absence of such information in a comprehensive knowledge graph about measles strongly suggests that there is no scientific consensus supporting this claim. Measles is generally known to be a serious and potentially dangerous disease, and reputable health organizations recommend vaccination to prevent its spread and complications."
Kash Patel has ordered investigations of 13 Congressional Democrats for inciting violence against the President.,False,False,"The claim states that Kash Patel has ordered investigations of 13 Congressional Democrats for inciting violence against the President. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no connections between Kash Patel and Congressional Democrats, nor any mention of investigations or inciting violence against the President. The knowledge graph shows multiple entries for Kash Patel and the President, but no relationships between them that would suggest such an action. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the serious nature of the claim, it is highly likely to be false."
Claim via Social Media : Did Donald Trump Use Autopen For Jan 6 Pardons?.,False,False,"The claim asks whether Donald Trump used an autopen for January 6 pardons. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Trump using an autopen for pardons related to January 6 or any other pardons. The context appears to be empty or lacking relevant information to support or refute this specific claim. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and considering that pardons related to the January 6 events were a significant topic, it's more likely that this claim is false or unsubstantiated. However, the lack of concrete evidence in either direction limits the confidence in this assessment."
Pfizer announced a goal to reduce the number of people in the world by 50%. False,Unknown,False,"The claim that Pfizer announced a goal to reduce the number of people in the world by 50% is false. This is an extreme and unfounded claim that would be widely reported if true. No reputable pharmaceutical company would publicly announce such a goal, as it would be unethical and illegal. Pfizer, as a healthcare company, is generally focused on improving and saving lives through medical advancements, not reducing population. The lack of any supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context further reinforces that this claim is likely a fabrication or misinformation."
French politician Raphaël Glucksmann said the United States should return the Statue of Liberty to France.,True,False,"The claim that French politician Raphaël Glucksmann said the United States should return the Statue of Liberty to France cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Raphaël Glucksmann or any statements regarding the Statue of Liberty. Without specific evidence to support or refute this claim, we must rely on general knowledge. It is highly unlikely that a prominent French politician would make such a statement, as the Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States and is a symbol of friendship between the two nations. However, due to the lack of direct evidence in the knowledge graph, we cannot be completely certain."
"USAID paid Nintendo $9,000,000 to study infantilism in games.",False,False,"The claim that USAID paid Nintendo $9,000,000 to study infantilism in games is likely false. The provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about USAID funding Nintendo or any studies related to infantilism in games. USAID (United States Agency for International Development) typically focuses on international development and humanitarian efforts, not on funding video game research. The absence of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the unusual nature of the claim, strongly suggests that this is false information."
Claim by CO2 Coalition: Natural gas is a clean-burning fuel.,Misleading,False,"The claim that natural gas is a clean-burning fuel is an oversimplification and potentially misleading. While natural gas does burn cleaner than some other fossil fuels like coal or oil in terms of certain pollutants, it is not entirely 'clean' as the claim suggests. Natural gas is still a fossil fuel that produces significant amounts of carbon dioxide when burned, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Additionally, the extraction and transportation of natural gas can lead to methane leaks, which is a potent greenhouse gas. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not offer any specific information to directly support or refute this claim, which limits the confidence in this assessment."
Claim via Social Media : U.S. President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social account that he would annex Greenland and Alaska.,False,False,"The claim that U.S. President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social account that he would annex Greenland and Alaska is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. Additionally, Alaska is already a part of the United States, so it cannot be annexed. While Donald Trump has previously expressed interest in purchasing Greenland (which is not mentioned in the given context), there is no credible evidence of him stating he would 'annex' either Greenland or Alaska. The claim appears to be misinformation or a fabrication. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the implausibility of the claim, strongly suggests it is false."
"Claim by President Donald Trump (R): Former President Joe Biden’s pardons of lawmakers on the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack “are hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force or effect,” because “they were done by autopen.",False,False,"The claim is false on multiple levels. First, Joe Biden has not issued pardons to lawmakers on the January 6th committee. Second, Donald Trump, as a former president, does not have the authority to declare any presidential actions 'void' or 'of no further force or effect.' Third, the use of an autopen for signing official documents, including pardons, is a legally accepted practice and does not invalidate the documents. The claim appears to be a fabrication or misunderstanding of presidential powers and recent events. The knowledge graph context provided does not offer any information to support this claim, which further reinforces its falsity."
"Claim by Seattle Times: In early 2025, an 82-year-old man named Ned Johnson in Seattle was declared “dead” by the U.S. Social Security and deprived of his benefits.",True,False,"The claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Ned Johnson, Social Security benefits, or any incidents of mistaken death declarations in Seattle. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the specificity of the claim (including a name, age, date, and location), suggests that this information is not widely reported or verified. Additionally, the claim refers to an event in early 2025, which is in the future from our current perspective, making it impossible to have occurred yet. While errors in Social Security administration can happen, without any corroborating information in the provided context, we cannot confirm this specific incident."
"DOGE found former first lady Michelle Obama “has been receiving a monthly $122,000 payment from the (General Services Administration) since 2009.",False,False,"The claim that Michelle Obama has been receiving a monthly $122,000 payment from the General Services Administration (GSA) since 2009 is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. Additionally, as a fact-checking assistant with knowledge of U.S. politics, I can confidently state that there is no credible evidence or official record of such payments to former first ladies. The GSA does provide certain benefits to former presidents, but not regular, large monthly payments to former first ladies. This claim appears to be a fabrication or misinformation."
"In March 2025, France offered U.S. right-wing conspiracy theorist Candace Owens millions to stop spreading the rumor that France’s first lady Brigitte Macron is trans.",False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on several factors. First, the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information related to this claim, which would be significant news if it were true. Additionally, the claim refers to events in March 2025, which is in the future at the time of this assessment. Making definitive statements about future events is inherently problematic. Furthermore, the claim involves serious allegations about a foreign government's actions and personal details about public figures, which would likely be widely reported if true. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the future date and the sensational nature of the claim, strongly suggests this is a fabricated story."
Claim via Social Media : Elon Musk acquired MSNBC for 900 million.,False,False,"The claim that Elon Musk acquired MSNBC for 900 million is false. The provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Elon Musk acquiring MSNBC or any other media company. Given Musk's high-profile status and the significance of such an acquisition, if it had occurred, it would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph. The absence of any related information strongly suggests that this claim is false. Additionally, as of my last update, MSNBC is owned by NBCUniversal News Group, a division of NBCUniversal, which is ultimately owned by Comcast. There have been no credible reports of Musk purchasing MSNBC."
Purports to show banners with Trump’s image currently hanging at the Kennedy Center. ,False,False,"The claim purports to show banners with Trump's image currently hanging at the Kennedy Center. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Trump banners at the Kennedy Center or any recent events involving Trump at this venue. The lack of relevant information in the context suggests that this claim is likely false. If such banners were currently hanging at the Kennedy Center, it would likely be mentioned in recent news articles or official statements, which would be reflected in the knowledge graph. Without any supporting evidence from the provided context, we cannot verify the claim as true."
Authentic photo shows sign that says “Due to Dishonesty self-checkout is CLOSED. Sorry to all the white people.,False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on several factors. First and foremost, the knowledge graph context provided is empty, which suggests there is no verified information supporting this claim from recent news articles or reliable sources. This absence of evidence is significant for a claim that would likely generate substantial news coverage if true. Additionally, using my general knowledge, such a sign would be highly controversial and discriminatory, making it extremely unlikely for a legitimate business to post. The claim seems designed to provoke racial tensions rather than reflect a real policy. Without any corroborating evidence from the knowledge graph or other reliable sources, and given the inflammatory nature of the alleged sign, it's highly probable that this is a fabricated or manipulated image rather than an authentic photo."
"Following Gene Hackman’s death, the FBI discovered a secret tunnel under the actor’s home where 701 bodies were found.",False,False,"The claim is false and appears to be a fabricated story. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1) Gene Hackman is not dead. As of my last update, he is still alive. 2) There is no credible news or official report of such a gruesome discovery. 3) The FBI conducting such an investigation and finding hundreds of bodies would be a major news event, yet there is no mention of it in the provided knowledge graph context or any reputable source. 4) The specific number (701) and the sensational nature of the claim are typical characteristics of false internet rumors or satirical articles. While the knowledge graph does not provide direct information to refute this specific claim, the absence of any related information in a context that includes FBI-related data is telling. If such a significant event had occurred, it would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph."
Claim by Brad Schimel (R): “Eliminate school choice” is on Susan Crawford’s agenda. ,False,False,"Based on the provided knowledge graph context, there is no evidence to support Brad Schimel's claim that 'Eliminate school choice' is on Susan Crawford's agenda. The knowledge graph does not contain any information about Susan Crawford's stance on school choice or any plans to eliminate it. Additionally, there is no context provided about Susan Crawford's policy positions or agenda items. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph or any contradicting information, it appears that this claim is likely false or at least unsubstantiated."
Claim via Social Media : “Pro-US/Trump political party won Greenland’s election last night. The people of Greenland want to end European colonial rule and build a future with America” False,Unknown,False,"The claim is false based on several factors. First, the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about a recent election in Greenland, a pro-US/Trump political party, or any desire to end European colonial rule and build a future with America. The absence of such significant political events in the context suggests that this claim is likely fabricated. Additionally, Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, not a European colony in the traditional sense. The claim's characterization of Greenland's political status is inaccurate. Lastly, there is no credible evidence of a major pro-US or pro-Trump movement in Greenland's politics. While the knowledge graph doesn't provide specific contradictory information, the lack of any supporting evidence for such a significant political shift strongly indicates that the claim is false."
Claim by Rick Scott (R): “The number of full-time jobs (was) dropping almost the entire Biden administration.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about full-time jobs during the Biden administration, the claim by Rick Scott that 'The number of full-time jobs (was) dropping almost the entire Biden administration' is likely false based on widely available economic data. The U.S. economy has generally been adding jobs, including full-time positions, throughout most of Biden's presidency. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports show consistent job growth since Biden took office in January 2021, with only a few months showing slight declines. The overall trend has been positive job growth, contradicting Scott's claim of a consistent drop in full-time jobs."
"Claim by Task & Purpose: The Arlington National Cemetery website removed links to webpages about Black, Hispanic and female veterans buried at the site.",True,False,"There is insufficient information in the provided knowledge graph context to verify or refute this claim. The claim states that the Arlington National Cemetery website removed links to webpages about Black, Hispanic and female veterans buried at the site. However, no relevant information about Arlington National Cemetery's website or its content is present in the given context. Without specific evidence from the knowledge graph, I cannot confidently determine the truth of this claim. My verdict is based on the lack of supporting evidence and the general principle that significant changes to official websites, especially those involving representation of diverse groups, are typically not made without public notice or explanation."
"purports to show an X post from Elon Musk that reads, ‘Defund the Poor’ ",False,False,"The claim purports to show an X post from Elon Musk that reads 'Defund the Poor'. However, the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about such a post or statement from Elon Musk. While Elon Musk is mentioned multiple times in the context, there are no associated statements or posts linked to him, especially nothing as controversial as 'Defund the Poor'. Given Musk's high-profile status and the controversial nature of such a statement, if it were true, it would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph. The absence of any supporting evidence in the context, combined with the extreme and unlikely nature of the claimed statement, strongly suggests that this is a false claim, likely a fabricated or manipulated post."
"Claim by Donald Trump (R): “We have a couple of bases in Greenland already,” said Trump. ",False,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about U.S. bases in Greenland, the claim made by Donald Trump is factually correct based on widely available information. The United States does indeed have a military presence in Greenland, most notably Thule Air Base. This base has been operational since the 1950s and is a critical part of the U.S. military's global network. Additionally, there are other smaller facilities and installations that could be considered 'bases' in a broader sense. However, the confidence score is not 100 because the knowledge graph doesn't directly confirm this information, and we're relying on general knowledge about U.S. military presence globally."
"Did He Say It?: U.S. President Donald Trump’s adviser, Elon Musk, reposted another user’s post on X in March 2025, showing a screenshot reading, “Stalin, Mao and Hitler didn’t murder millions of people. Their public sector workers did.",True,False,"The claim is false for multiple reasons. First, the knowledge graph context provides no information to support this claim. Second, the claim contains several factual errors and implausible elements that can be identified based on general knowledge. Elon Musk is not an adviser to Donald Trump. The date mentioned (March 2025) is in the future and cannot be verified. Additionally, the content of the alleged post is highly controversial and historically inaccurate. There's no evidence that Elon Musk has made such a statement, and it would be extremely out of character for a public figure to make such a claim."
Claim by Alex Jones: Deceased InfoWars reporter Jamie White was on a “Ukrainian enemies hit list.,False,False,"The claim by Alex Jones that deceased InfoWars reporter Jamie White was on a 'Ukrainian enemies hit list' cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Jamie White, Ukrainian hit lists, or any related topics. Without supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and given Alex Jones' history of making unsubstantiated claims, it is more likely that this statement is false. However, the lack of specific contradictory information in the context limits the confidence in this assessment."
Claim by Karoline Leavitt: “Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people.,False,False,"The claim that 'Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people' is false. While the knowledge graph context does not provide specific information about tariffs or their economic impact, this claim contradicts well-established economic principles. Tariffs are, by definition, a form of tax imposed on imported goods. They typically result in higher prices for consumers, not a tax cut. The cost of tariffs is usually passed on to American consumers through higher prices on goods, effectively acting as an indirect tax on the American people rather than a tax cut. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph for this claim, combined with the fundamental mischaracterization of what tariffs are and how they function, leads to the conclusion that the statement is false."
"Elon Musk left his home country, South Africa, in part to avoid mandatory military service.",True,True,"While the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any specific information about Elon Musk's reasons for leaving South Africa or mandatory military service, the claim is generally considered to be true based on widely reported biographical information about Musk. However, due to the lack of supporting evidence in the given context, I cannot be completely certain. The confidence score reflects this uncertainty. In this case, I had to rely on general knowledge about Musk's background, as the knowledge graph did not provide relevant information to confirm or refute the claim."
Videos authentically show 200-foot Jesus statue being erected on the White House lawn.,False,False,"There is no credible evidence or information in the provided knowledge graph context to support the claim that a 200-foot Jesus statue is being erected on the White House lawn. Such a significant event would be widely reported and documented. The absence of any corroborating information in the knowledge graph, which typically contains recent and verified news, strongly suggests this claim is false. Additionally, erecting such a large religious statue on government property would likely violate the principle of separation of church and state in the United States."
Claim by Alina Habba: Claims she discovered Biden’s secret Oval Office set.,False,False,"The claim that Alina Habba discovered Biden's secret Oval Office set is likely false. The knowledge graph context does not provide any information supporting this claim. In fact, there is no mention of an Oval Office set or any discovery related to it. The existence of a replica Oval Office set for certain presidential communications is actually public knowledge and has been used by multiple administrations, not just Biden's. This set is typically located in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and is not a secret. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph and given the public nature of this information, the claim appears to be false."
"Claim by End Wokeness: During President Joe Biden’s four years in office, “31% of U.S. job growth” came from public-sector jobs.",False,False,"The claim is false on multiple levels. First, Joe Biden has not been in office for four years yet - he was inaugurated in January 2021, so his presidency has lasted less than three years at this point. Second, while the knowledge graph doesn't provide specific information about job growth statistics, it's highly unlikely that such a large percentage (31%) of job growth would come from public-sector jobs. Typically, private sector job growth far outpaces public sector growth. Without concrete evidence from the knowledge graph to support this claim, and given the factual errors in the statement itself, we can confidently say this claim is false."
U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s cousin Nate Vance fought in Ukraine for three years during its war with Russia.,True,False,"The claim contains multiple inaccuracies that can be identified based on the knowledge graph context and general knowledge. First, JD Vance is not the U.S. Vice President. He is a U.S. Senator from Ohio. Second, there is no information in the provided context about JD Vance having a cousin named Nate Vance or any relative fighting in Ukraine. The knowledge graph does not provide any information to support the claim, and given JD Vance's public profile, such a significant detail about a close relative fighting in Ukraine for three years would likely be mentioned if it were true."
Trump posted on Truth Social A bunch of BROKIES are crying about the stock market today GROW UP I don’t care about the stock market.,False,False,"The claim states that Trump posted a specific message on Truth Social about the stock market. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about this alleged post or any recent statements by Trump regarding the stock market. The lack of supporting evidence in the context, which would likely include such a notable statement if it were true, suggests that this claim is likely false. While Trump has been known to make controversial statements on social media platforms, without any corroborating information in the knowledge graph, we cannot verify this specific claim."
"Claim by JD Vance (R): “Under the previous administration … the cost of a median-price home in America more than doubled, and that was just in four years.",True,False,"The claim by JD Vance that the cost of a median-price home in America more than doubled under the previous administration in just four years is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about housing prices or their changes during the previous administration. Without specific data to support this claim, it appears to be an exaggeration. Typically, such a dramatic increase in housing prices over such a short period would be widely reported and discussed. The absence of this information in the context suggests the claim is likely false. However, since the knowledge graph does not provide direct contradictory evidence, we cannot be 100% certain."
"Claim by Donald Trump (R): “[W]e were richest, the richest, relatively, from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913 … because we collected tariffs from foreign countries.",False,False,"While the knowledge graph context does not provide specific information about U.S. economic history or tariff policies between 1870 and 1913, the claim made by Donald Trump contains several inaccuracies that can be addressed based on historical facts. The U.S. was not necessarily the 'richest' country during this entire period, and its economic growth cannot be attributed solely or primarily to tariffs. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant industrial growth, technological advancements, and natural resource exploitation that contributed to U.S. economic expansion. While tariffs played a role in U.S. economic policy during this era, they were not the sole or primary reason for the country's wealth. Additionally, the claim oversimplifies complex economic factors and ignores other significant contributors to U.S. economic growth during this period."
The Department of Government Efficiency found a $6 million grant awarded to Whoopi Goldberg to “promote diversity” on “The View.,False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on the lack of supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about a Department of Government Efficiency, Whoopi Goldberg, 'The View', or any $6 million grant for promoting diversity. The absence of any relevant connections or information in the knowledge graph strongly suggests that this claim is fabricated or misinformed. Additionally, there is no widely known U.S. federal agency called the 'Department of Government Efficiency', which further undermines the credibility of the claim."
Video shows President Donald Trump admitting he became president because of a “rigged” 2024 election.,False,False,"The claim is false for several reasons. First, the 2024 election has not yet occurred, so it's impossible for Donald Trump to have become president because of a 'rigged' 2024 election. Trump was president from 2017 to 2021, following the 2016 election. Second, there is no evidence provided in the knowledge graph context or otherwise to support the claim that Trump admitted to becoming president due to a rigged election. The knowledge graph does not contain any information related to this specific claim or any video showing such an admission. Given the nature of the claim and the lack of supporting evidence, it can be confidently assessed as false."
Nancy Pelosi’s Vineyard Received $14 Million from USAID for “experimental farming.,False,False,"The claim that Nancy Pelosi's vineyard received $14 million from USAID for 'experimental farming' is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information linking Nancy Pelosi to a vineyard or to any funding from USAID. Additionally, there is no mention of experimental farming or any specific funding amount. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, which would likely contain such significant information if it were true, strongly suggests that this claim is false."
"Claim by Donald Trump (R): “All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever” because of Trump policies, and “it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.",False,False,"The claim by Donald Trump that 'All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever' and that this is due to Trump policies is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. In fact, there is no relevant information in the given context about military recruiting or Trump's policies affecting it. Recent reports and data from the U.S. military actually indicate that most branches of the armed forces have been struggling with recruitment, facing some of their most challenging recruiting environments in decades. This trend has been ongoing and was not suddenly reversed 'a few months ago' as Trump claims. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with widely reported recruitment challenges, strongly suggests that this claim is false."
"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, area fires were intentional to build a “smart city.",False,False,"The claim that fires in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area were intentional to build a 'smart city' is not supported by any evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about fires in Myrtle Beach, intentional fires, or plans for a 'smart city'. In the absence of supporting evidence, and given the serious nature of the claim (implying widespread arson), it is highly unlikely to be true. While the knowledge graph doesn't explicitly refute the claim, the lack of any related information in a context about South Carolina suggests this is likely a false or unsubstantiated rumor."
"Claim by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins: The U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled a $600,000 grant for a study on menstrual cycles in transgender men.",False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on several factors. First, the knowledge graph context does not provide any information supporting or directly refuting the claim. However, there are some key issues with the claim that suggest it is likely false:

1. Brooke Rollins is not the current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. The current Secretary is Tom Vilsack, who was appointed by President Biden in 2021.

2. There is no evidence in the provided context or in my general knowledge of a $600,000 grant for a study on menstrual cycles in transgender men being canceled by the USDA.

3. While the USDA does fund various research projects, a study on menstrual cycles in transgender men would be more likely to fall under the purview of the Department of Health and Human Services or the National Institutes of Health, rather than the Department of Agriculture.

Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the factual errors in the claim itself, it is likely false. However, my confidence is not at the highest level due to the limited information provided in the knowledge graph context."
"Did he Say it?: Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, said: “The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy.",True,False,"The claim is false for multiple reasons. First, Elon Musk has never been an official adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. While Musk did participate in some advisory councils early in Trump's presidency, he resigned from these positions in 2017. Second, there is no credible evidence that Musk ever made the statement 'The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy.' This quote does not align with Musk's known public statements or views. The knowledge graph context provided does not offer any information supporting this claim or connecting Musk to Trump in an advisory capacity. The absence of any relevant information in the context about Elon Musk or this alleged quote further supports the conclusion that this claim is fabricated."
Photo shows first lady Melania Trump crying.,False,False,"The claim states that a photo shows first lady Melania Trump crying. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Melania Trump crying or any specific photo of her. The context appears to be empty or lacking relevant information to support or refute this claim. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and given the nature of such claims often being misrepresented or taken out of context, I am inclined to consider this claim as likely false. However, my confidence is limited due to the lack of specific information in the provided context."
"President Trump posted a message on Truth Social that contained an image of a pink triangle, a symbol used in Nazi camps to identify homosexual prisoners.",True,False,"The claim states that President Trump posted a message on Truth Social containing an image of a pink triangle, which was a symbol used in Nazi camps to identify homosexual prisoners. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to this specific claim. There is no mention of Truth Social, pink triangles, or any posts by President Trump containing such imagery. Without any supporting or contradicting evidence from the knowledge graph, it's not possible to verify or refute this claim based solely on the given context. The low confidence score reflects the lack of relevant information in the provided context."
Claim by Laura Loomer: U.S. Agency for International Development subsidized CNN and MSNBC hosts’ salaries.,False,False,"The claim by Laura Loomer that the U.S. Agency for International Development subsidized CNN and MSNBC hosts' salaries is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information linking USAID to the salaries of CNN or MSNBC hosts. While the graph shows multiple connections for both CNN and MSNBC, none of these connections relate to USAID or any form of government subsidy for host salaries. The lack of evidence in the provided context, which would likely include such significant information if it were true, suggests that the claim is false."
Ohio Turnpike is sending text messages to collect unpaid toll bills. ,False,False,"There is insufficient information in the provided Knowledge Graph Context to verify or refute this claim. Without any relevant data about the Ohio Turnpike's toll collection practices or recent policy changes, it's not possible to determine with certainty whether they are sending text messages to collect unpaid toll bills. The lack of context forces me to rely on general knowledge, which suggests that such a practice would be unusual for a state turnpike authority, but not impossible. Given the absence of supporting evidence and the somewhat uncommon nature of the claimed practice, I'm inclined to lean towards false, but with very low confidence."
Elon Musk walked off and leaves his four year old son wandering off stage by himself.,False,False,"The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information relevant to the claim about Elon Musk walking off and leaving his four-year-old son wandering off stage. The context only shows multiple empty relationships connected to Elon Musk, without any specific details. Due to the lack of relevant information in the provided context, I cannot confidently verify or refute the claim. My verdict is based on the absence of supporting evidence and the general improbability of such an event occurring without significant media coverage, but the confidence is very low due to insufficient information."
Donald Trump has declared a war on chemtrails and asked for military intervention.,False,False,"The claim that Donald Trump has declared a war on chemtrails and asked for military intervention is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. In fact, the context appears to be empty, with no connections or information related to Donald Trump's actions regarding chemtrails or military intervention. Chemtrails are a conspiracy theory, and there is no credible evidence of any U.S. president, including Donald Trump, declaring war on them or requesting military intervention. If such a significant and unusual action had been taken, it would likely be present in the knowledge graph and widely reported in credible news sources."
Claim by dailyjournal24hr.com: The View was officially cancelled after decades on air.,False,False,"The claim that 'The View was officially cancelled after decades on air' is false. While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information about the show's current status, the absence of any cancellation information in the context is significant. 'The View' is a high-profile, long-running daytime talk show, and its cancellation would be major news in the entertainment industry. If it had been cancelled, this would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph with multiple connections to news articles or statements about the cancellation. The lack of such information strongly suggests that the show has not been cancelled. Additionally, as of my last update, 'The View' was still airing and there have been no credible reports of its cancellation."
Husbands of Pelosi and Feinstein made millions off high speed rail land deals.,False,False,"The claim that the husbands of Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein made millions off high-speed rail land deals is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about land deals, high-speed rail projects, or the financial activities of the husbands of these politicians. While the knowledge graph mentions Nancy Pelosi, it does not provide any relevant information to verify or refute the specific claim. In the absence of supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and based on my understanding that such significant financial gains by politicians' spouses would likely be well-documented if true, I am concluding that the claim is false. However, the lack of specific contradicting information in the provided context limits the confidence score."
"Fox News article from “February 10, 2025,” headlined, “Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine received $140,000,000 per month from USAID.",False,False,"The claim is likely false for several reasons. First, the date mentioned in the claim, 'February 10, 2025,' is in the future, which immediately raises suspicion about the authenticity of the article. Secondly, the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting the claim about USAID providing $140,000,000 per month to a 'Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine.' The knowledge graph only shows multiple empty connections from Fox News, without any substantive information related to the claim. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the future date, this claim appears to be fabricated or misinformation."
"A March 2025 video authentically shows a liquor store in Ontario, Canada, removing American liquor bottles from its shelves in response to U.S.-imposed tariffs.",True,False,"The claim is false for several reasons. First, the claim refers to a future event in March 2025, which cannot be verified with current information. Second, there is no evidence in the provided knowledge graph context to support this specific claim about Ontario liquor stores removing American products due to U.S. tariffs. The context does not mention any trade disputes, tariffs, or actions related to liquor stores in Ontario or Canada more broadly. Without any supporting information from the knowledge graph, and given the future date mentioned, this claim cannot be considered true."
"Claim by Joe Rogan: The members of the Patriot Front are “feds,” and “the day after Kash Patel gets in, they disband.",False,False,"The claim by Joe Rogan that members of the Patriot Front are 'feds' and that they would disband after Kash Patel 'gets in' is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. There is no information in the given context that links Kash Patel to the Patriot Front or suggests any connection between his potential appointment or role and the group's existence. Additionally, there's no evidence provided that supports the assertion that Patriot Front members are federal agents. The knowledge graph does not offer any relevant information to verify or support these claims, which appear to be speculative or based on unsubstantiated conspiracy theories."
The House budget cut 880 billion to Medicaid.,False,False,"The claim states that the House budget cut $880 billion to Medicaid. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Medicaid cuts or budget decisions related to Medicaid. The lack of relevant information in the context makes it impossible to verify the claim directly. Given the significant nature of such a large budget cut, it would likely be mentioned if it had occurred recently. The absence of this information in the context suggests that the claim is likely false or at least not supported by recent evidence. However, without more specific information to directly refute the claim, we cannot be entirely certain."
Apple quietly removed International Women’s Day from their calendar app.,False,False,"The claim states that Apple quietly removed International Women's Day from their calendar app. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to this claim. There are no nodes or relationships mentioning Apple's calendar app, International Women's Day, or any actions taken by Apple regarding their calendar. In the absence of supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and based on my understanding that International Women's Day is a widely recognized global event, it seems unlikely that Apple would remove it from their calendar app without significant public notice or backlash. Therefore, I am inclined to believe this claim is false. However, due to the lack of specific information in the provided context, I cannot be entirely certain, which is reflected in the moderate confidence score."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Border crossings were the lowest ever recorded in February.  TRUE,Unknown,False,"The claim that border crossings were the lowest ever recorded in February is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about border crossing statistics or any specific data for February. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph or contradicting information, we cannot verify this claim as true. In fact, the lack of any mention of border crossings or related statistics in the context about Donald Trump suggests that this claim may be inaccurate or misleading."
"Claim by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Doctors treating measles patients in Texas are getting “very, very good results” from cod liver oil, budesonide (a steroid) and clarithromycin (an antibiotic).",False,False,"The claim by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about doctors in Texas getting 'very, very good results' from cod liver oil, budesonide, and clarithromycin for treating measles patients is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about these specific treatments or their effectiveness against measles in Texas or elsewhere. Moreover, the standard medical consensus is that measles is a viral infection, and antibiotics like clarithromycin are not effective against viruses. The use of cod liver oil and steroids for measles treatment is not part of established medical protocols. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the contradiction to established medical knowledge, strongly suggests that this claim is false."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Social Security databases show “3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149 and money is being paid to many of them.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context does not provide specific information about this claim, it is highly implausible and can be confidently assessed as false based on general knowledge and demographic realities. The claim that there are 3.5 million people aged 140-149 receiving Social Security benefits is not supported by any credible evidence or demographic data. The oldest verified person in recorded history lived to 122 years old, and there are no known living individuals over 140 years old, let alone millions. This appears to be a significant exaggeration or misinterpretation of data. Social Security databases may contain errors or placeholder birthdates for some individuals, but not on the scale claimed. The statement seems designed to suggest widespread fraud or mismanagement in the Social Security system, but does not reflect reality."
Claim by Lavender Magazine: The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis policy manual has omitted “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” from a rule prohibiting “intelligence activities” targeting someone on the basis of their identity.,True,False,"The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information related to the claim about the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis policy manual or its treatment of 'sexual orientation' and 'gender identity' in rules prohibiting intelligence activities. Without relevant information from the knowledge graph to support or refute the claim, it's not possible to make a definitive judgment based solely on the given context. The low confidence score reflects the lack of pertinent information in the provided knowledge graph."
Claim by Larry Kudlow: Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is “polling very well. It’s very popular.,False,False,"The claim that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is 'polling very well' and is 'very popular' appears to be false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about a Department of Government Efficiency or any polling related to such a department. In fact, there is no evidence in the given context that such a department even exists. Elon Musk is mentioned multiple times, but there are no connections or information provided about him creating or being involved with any government department. The lack of any supporting information in the knowledge graph for this claim, combined with the fact that no such official department is known to exist in the U.S. government structure, leads to the conclusion that this claim is likely false."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.",False,False,"The claim about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wealth and assets is likely false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting these extravagant claims about Zelenskyy's wealth. In fact, the lack of any connections or information related to significant personal wealth, multiple homes, private planes, or large bank accounts in the knowledge graph strongly suggests that these claims are unfounded. Reputable sources typically report on the assets and wealth of world leaders, especially if they were as extensive as claimed. The absence of such information in the knowledge graph, which is based on recent verified news articles, indicates that these claims are likely false or greatly exaggerated."
DOGE Halted $2.6 Million Annual Payment To Obama For ‘Obamacare Royalties’.,False,False,"The claim that DOGE halted a $2.6 million annual payment to Obama for 'Obamacare Royalties' is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information related to this claim, DOGE (presumably referring to Dogecoin), Obama, Obamacare, or any royalty payments. Additionally, based on factual knowledge about cryptocurrency, U.S. politics, and healthcare policy, there is no credible evidence or logical reason why a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin would be making royalty payments to a former president for a healthcare policy. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is a law, not a product that generates royalties, and former presidents do not receive royalties for policies enacted during their terms."
Claim by President Donald Trump (R): Did Europe Spend More on Russian Oil and Gas Than Ukraine Aid?.,True,False,"Based on the provided knowledge graph context, there is insufficient information to directly verify or refute the claim made by President Donald Trump regarding Europe's spending on Russian oil and gas compared to Ukraine aid. The knowledge graph does not contain any specific data about European energy purchases from Russia or aid to Ukraine. Without this crucial information, it's not possible to make a definitive comparison. However, the claim is marked as false with low confidence because such broad generalizations are often oversimplifications of complex economic and geopolitical situations. Additionally, recent global events and policy changes, particularly in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have likely affected both European energy purchases from Russia and aid to Ukraine, making such a comparison potentially outdated or inaccurate."
"Claim by Patrick Flynn: “COVID-19 ‘vaccinated’ people are sicker”; “‘Vaccinated’ individuals experienced […] higher rates of COVID-19 infections, and increased musculoskeletal issues compared to the unvaccinated.",False,False,"The claim by Patrick Flynn that vaccinated people are sicker and experience higher rates of COVID-19 infections compared to unvaccinated individuals is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. In fact, there is no relevant information in the given context to either support or refute this claim. Without any supporting evidence from reliable sources, and given the overwhelming scientific consensus that COVID-19 vaccines are effective in reducing the severity of illness and lowering infection rates, this claim is likely false. However, it's important to note that the lack of specific contradicting information in the provided context slightly reduces the confidence score."
Wisconsin bill supported by Gov. Tony Evers completely replaces “mother” with “inseminated person” in state law.,False,False,"The claim states that a Wisconsin bill supported by Gov. Tony Evers completely replaces 'mother' with 'inseminated person' in state law. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about this specific bill or changes to terminology in Wisconsin state law. Without supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, we cannot verify this claim. The lack of relevant information in the context suggests that this may be a false or exaggerated claim. However, due to the limited information provided, we cannot be entirely certain, which is reflected in the moderate confidence score."
President Trump posted “Cardano is the future of America.” on Truth Social.,False,False,"The claim states that President Trump posted 'Cardano is the future of America' on Truth Social. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about such a post or any mention of Cardano. The context appears to be empty, with no specific information about Donald Trump's social media activities or statements about cryptocurrencies. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the unusual nature of such a statement from a former president about a specific cryptocurrency, it is highly unlikely that this claim is true."
Claim by President Donald Trump (R): “We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.,False,False,"The claim by President Donald Trump that 'We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud' cannot be substantiated based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about fraud discoveries or investigations that would support this claim. In fact, the knowledge graph provides no relevant information to verify or refute the statement. Given the magnitude of the claim (hundreds of billions of dollars) and the lack of supporting evidence in the context, it is highly unlikely that such a significant finding would go unreported or unmentioned in the knowledge graph if it were true. Additionally, claims of such massive fraud would typically be accompanied by official reports, investigations, or widespread media coverage, none of which are indicated in the provided context."
"Did he say it?: Tech billionaire and adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme.",True,False,"The claim states that Elon Musk, described as a tech billionaire and adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, called Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme.' However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Elon Musk, his relationship with Donald Trump, or any statements about Social Security. The context only shows multiple empty relationships connected to Donald Trump, without any specific information. Due to the lack of supporting evidence in the given context, and the absence of any widely known public statement by Musk to this effect, the claim is likely false. However, the confidence score is moderate because the knowledge graph doesn't provide any information to directly refute the claim either."
"President Donald Trump posted on X that “If the Dow drops 1,000 points in two days the President should be impeached immediately.",False,False,"The claim states that President Donald Trump posted on X (formerly Twitter) that 'If the Dow drops 1,000 points in two days the President should be impeached immediately.' However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about this specific tweet or statement. Given Trump's prolific use of social media, especially during his presidency, if he had made such a significant and controversial statement, it would likely be included in the knowledge graph. The absence of this information in the context suggests that this claim is likely false. Additionally, such a statement would be highly unusual and inconsistent with typical presidential communications about the stock market."
President Trump changed U.S. divorce law.,False,False,"The claim that President Trump changed U.S. divorce law is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Trump altering divorce laws in the United States. As president, Trump did not have the authority to unilaterally change divorce laws, which are primarily governed at the state level. The knowledge graph shows multiple empty relationships for Donald Trump, suggesting that if such a significant legal change had occurred, it would likely have been included in the context. The absence of any mention of divorce law changes strongly indicates that this claim is false."
Trump stole someone’s Facebook post about Zelenskyy for use on Truth Social.,False,False,"The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information about Trump stealing someone's Facebook post about Zelenskyy for use on Truth Social. The context only shows connections between Trump, Truth Social, and Facebook, but does not provide any details about content sharing or plagiarism. Without more specific evidence from the knowledge graph, it's not possible to definitively confirm or refute this claim. The low confidence score reflects the lack of relevant information in the provided context."
"Video shows an authentic podcast episode in which Donald Trump Jr. says, “I truly can’t understand why anyone in their right mind would choose Ukraine as an ally when Russia is the alternative. The U.S. should have been supplying weapons to Russia instead.",False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on the lack of supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Donald Trump Jr. making such a statement on a podcast or anywhere else. Additionally, the alleged quote is highly controversial and would likely have generated significant media attention if it were true. The absence of any related information in the knowledge graph, which is drawn from recent verified news articles, strongly suggests that this claim is fabricated or misattributed. Furthermore, the statement contradicts the known public stance of the Trump family and the U.S. government's official position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
Claim by Joel Kitchens (R): “90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy” banning cellphones during class time.,True,False,"The claim by Joel Kitchens (R) states that 90% of school districts in Wisconsin already have a policy banning cellphones during class time. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to school districts, cellphone policies, or classroom regulations in Wisconsin. Without supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, it's not possible to verify this claim as true. Given the lack of relevant information, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the 90% figure. The claim appears to be an unsupported statement, which leads me to conclude it is likely false, but with limited confidence due to insufficient data."
Prosecutors Fani Willis and New York Alvin Bragg been disbarred.,False,False,"The claim that prosecutors Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg have been disbarred is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. In fact, the context doesn't provide any relevant information about the disbarment of either prosecutor. As a political fact-checking assistant, I am aware that both Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg are currently active prosecutors. Fani Willis is the District Attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, and Alvin Bragg is the District Attorney of Manhattan, New York. If either of these high-profile prosecutors had been disbarred, it would have been major news and would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph. The absence of such information, combined with my understanding of their current roles, strongly indicates that the claim is false."
Proposed constitutional amendment would allow Obama to run for third term ,False,False,"The claim that a proposed constitutional amendment would allow Barack Obama to run for a third term is false. While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about this claim, it's important to note that no such constitutional amendment has been seriously proposed or considered. The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1951, limits presidents to two terms in office. This amendment would need to be repealed or modified for any president, including Obama, to serve more than two terms. There is no credible evidence or political movement to change this fundamental aspect of the U.S. presidential system. Additionally, Barack Obama has already served two full terms as president from 2009 to 2017, making him ineligible for another term under current constitutional law."
Claim by nypost.com: President Zelenskyy met with a group of exclusively Democrats before heading into the February 28 White House meeting with Trump.,False,False,"The claim states that President Zelenskyy met with a group of exclusively Democrats before a White House meeting with Trump on February 28. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about this specific meeting or any exclusive meetings between Zelenskyy and Democrats. The lack of supporting evidence in the context, combined with the unusual nature of such an exclusive meeting before a White House visit, suggests the claim is likely false. However, without explicit contradicting information, we cannot be entirely certain."
Elon Musk “contracted a helicopter and the first DOGE payments are being” dispersed in California.,False,False,"The claim states that Elon Musk has contracted a helicopter and is dispersing the first DOGE payments in California. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting this claim. There is no mention of helicopters, DOGE payments, or any specific actions by Elon Musk in California related to cryptocurrency disbursements. The lack of relevant information in the context, despite numerous connections to Elon Musk, suggests that this claim is likely false or at least unsubstantiated by recent verified news."
A picture authentically shows Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell photographed together.,True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information about a photograph of Elon Musk and Ghislaine Maxwell together, there is well-documented evidence from reliable sources that such a photograph does exist. The image in question was taken at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party and has been widely circulated and verified. Musk has acknowledged the photo's existence but stated that he did not know Maxwell and was simply photographed with her at the event. Given the lack of contradictory information in the knowledge graph and the well-established existence of this photograph, I've determined the claim to be true. However, the confidence score is not 100 due to the absence of direct supporting evidence in the provided context."
USAID funded Jeffrey Epstein.,False,False,"The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information linking USAID (United States Agency for International Development) to Jeffrey Epstein. There are separate entries for both USAID and Jeffrey Epstein, but no connections or relationships are shown between them. The absence of any direct link or mention of funding in the given context strongly suggests that the claim is false. However, it's important to note that the lack of evidence in this limited context does not definitively prove the absence of any connection, which is why the confidence score is not 100."
Doctors: don’t eat fish when you’re pregnant to avoid mercury getting into your baby Also doctors: vaccines containing mercury are safe to inject into your baby.,Misleading,False,"This claim is false and misleading on multiple levels. While the knowledge graph does not provide specific information about this claim, it's important to address the misinformation it contains based on well-established medical facts. First, doctors do not universally advise against eating fish during pregnancy. They recommend limiting certain types of fish high in mercury, but many fish are safe and beneficial during pregnancy due to their omega-3 fatty acids. Second, the claim falsely equates dietary mercury with thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound that was previously used in some vaccines. Thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines in the U.S. in 2001 as a precautionary measure, despite no evidence of harm. Most importantly, the type of mercury in thimerosal (ethylmercury) is fundamentally different from methylmercury found in fish, behaving differently in the body. The claim misrepresents medical advice and vaccine safety to create a false equivalence."
Transcript of Trump Zelenskyy meeting shows Zelensky talking about real estate deal and burning cities.,False,False,"The claim states that a transcript of a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy shows Zelenskyy discussing a real estate deal and burning cities. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about such a transcript or the alleged contents. The context only shows multiple empty relationships connected to Donald Trump, without any mention of Zelenskyy, real estate deals, or burning cities. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the unusual nature of the claim (a head of state discussing burning cities), strongly suggests that this claim is false."
C laims Gov. Kathy Hochul is purportedly implementing a $1.00 walking fee for pedestrians in New York City. False,Unknown,False,"The claim that Governor Kathy Hochul is implementing a $1.00 walking fee for pedestrians in New York City is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about such a fee or any related policy. Additionally, implementing a walking fee in a major city like New York would be an extraordinary and highly controversial measure that would likely generate significant public discussion and media coverage. The absence of any mention of this in the provided context strongly suggests that this claim is fabricated or misinformation. It's important to note that while the knowledge graph doesn't explicitly refute the claim, the lack of any supporting evidence for such a significant policy change in a major city like New York is telling."
The administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden created jobs every month and was the first presidential administration to do so.,True,False,"The claim states that the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden created jobs every month and was the first presidential administration to do so. However, this claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not provide any information about job creation during Biden's administration or any comparative data with previous administrations. Without specific evidence from the knowledge graph to support or refute this claim, we must rely on general knowledge. It's known that economic fluctuations can lead to job losses in some months, even during generally successful administrations. Additionally, the claim that Biden's administration was the 'first' to create jobs every month is a strong statement that would require substantial evidence to prove. Given the lack of supporting information in the context and the improbability of such a consistent job creation record, the claim is likely false."
Trump removed caps on prescription drug prices that Biden ordered.  False,Unknown,False,"The claim that Trump removed caps on prescription drug prices that Biden ordered is false. This conclusion is primarily based on the lack of supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Trump removing caps on prescription drug prices or Biden ordering such caps. In fact, the knowledge graph provides no relevant information about prescription drug prices, caps, or actions taken by either Trump or Biden regarding this issue. Given the absence of supporting evidence and the lack of any contradictory information, the claim appears to be false."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): “We gave you (Ukraine) $350 billion.,False,False,"The claim by Donald Trump that 'We gave you (Ukraine) $350 billion' is false. While the knowledge graph context does not provide specific information about U.S. aid to Ukraine, the amount stated in the claim ($350 billion) is vastly exaggerated compared to actual U.S. aid figures. Public records and official government sources indicate that U.S. aid to Ukraine, even when considering cumulative assistance over several years, falls far short of $350 billion. The actual figure is closer to tens of billions, not hundreds of billions. This claim appears to be a significant overstatement, likely made for political effect rather than based on factual data."
Claim by Children’s Health Defense: Measles vaccine caused Texas outbreak; measles vaccine is responsible for measles outbreaks.,False,False,"The claim that the measles vaccine caused the Texas outbreak or is responsible for measles outbreaks in general is false. This conclusion is based on well-established scientific evidence and public health data, even though the provided knowledge graph context does not offer specific information about this claim. Measles outbreaks are typically caused by a lack of vaccination, not by the vaccine itself. The measles vaccine is highly effective and safe, and it has been crucial in reducing measles cases worldwide. Outbreaks usually occur in areas with low vaccination rates or when unvaccinated individuals come into contact with the virus. The Children's Health Defense organization is known for promoting anti-vaccine misinformation, which further reduces the credibility of this claim."
Claim by JD Vance: Zelenskyy “went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.,False,False,"The claim by JD Vance that Zelenskyy 'went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October' appears to be false based on the available information. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. There is no mention of Zelenskyy visiting Pennsylvania or campaigning for any opposition in October. Given that such a high-profile visit by a foreign leader during a time of war would likely be well-documented and included in the knowledge graph if it had occurred, the absence of this information strongly suggests the claim is false. However, without explicit contradictory evidence, we cannot be 100% certain."
"Claim by Montgomery County Republican Party: The Department of Government Efficiency in the U.S. discovered that a Louisiana man was using 34 different names, addresses, and Social Security numbers to collect more than $1 million annually in Social Security benefits.",False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on the provided knowledge graph context. The key element of the claim is the existence of a 'Department of Government Efficiency' which allegedly discovered a case of Social Security fraud. However, the knowledge graph shows no connections or information related to this department. In fact, the repeated empty relationships for 'Department Of Government Efficiency' strongly suggest that this department does not exist in the U.S. government structure. If such a department existed and made such a significant discovery, we would expect to see some connections or information in the knowledge graph. The lack of any supporting evidence in the context, combined with the non-existence of the mentioned department, leads to the conclusion that this claim is likely fabricated or based on misinformation."
"Zero votes for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in Rockland County, New York, precinct proves Elon Musk hacked 2024 presidential election.",False,False,"The claim is false for several reasons. First, the 2024 presidential election has not yet taken place, so it's impossible for Elon Musk to have hacked it. Second, Kamala Harris is not currently a declared candidate for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination. Third, a single precinct reporting zero votes for a particular candidate is not evidence of hacking or fraud. Lastly, the knowledge graph context provides no information supporting any part of this claim. There are no connections shown between Elon Musk and the 2024 election, Kamala Harris, or any hacking activities."
Maine will not send federal taxes from paychecks as revenge against Trump.  False,Unknown,True,"The claim states that Maine will not send federal taxes from paychecks as revenge against Trump, and this claim is marked as false. However, based on the lack of any supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context and the highly unlikely nature of such an action, the original claim is actually true. States do not have the authority to withhold federal taxes, and such an action would be illegal and unconstitutional. The knowledge graph does not provide any information suggesting that Maine has taken or plans to take such an action against Trump. Therefore, the claim that Maine will not do this is true."
Claim by Kevin O’Leary: “We’ve never audited government for 100 years.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information related to government audits, the claim by Kevin O'Leary that 'We've never audited government for 100 years' is demonstrably false based on widely available information. The U.S. government has been subject to various forms of auditing for many decades. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), formerly known as the General Accounting Office, was established in 1921 and has been conducting audits of government agencies and programs since then. Additionally, the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires annual audits of federal agency financial statements. These facts directly contradict O'Leary's claim. However, without specific information from the knowledge graph to support or refute this claim, I've slightly reduced the confidence score."
A post shared on X claims that Fox News reported a Ukrainian psychological unit got $140 million per month from United States Agency for International Development (USAID). ,False,False,"The claim states that Fox News reported a Ukrainian psychological unit receiving $140 million per month from USAID. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no connections or nodes related to Ukrainian psychological units, USAID funding, or any specific monetary amounts. The knowledge graph only shows multiple empty connections from Fox News, which suggests that if such a significant story had been reported by Fox News, it would likely have been reflected in the graph. The absence of any supporting information in the context strongly indicates that this claim is false or at least not verifiable based on the given information."
A photograph accurately shows a U.S. “distress” flag hung upside down from the side of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park by a group of employees.,True,False,"The claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context, which is empty. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, we must rely on general knowledge and critical thinking. The claim makes a very specific assertion about a photograph showing a U.S. 'distress' flag hung upside down on El Capitan by park employees. Such an event would likely be newsworthy and documented if it had occurred. The lack of any corroborating information in the knowledge graph suggests this claim may be false or unverified. However, the absence of evidence is not definitive proof that the event did not occur, which is why the confidence score is not higher."
Electric vehicles cause infertility. Being in an electric car will lower your testosterone.,False,False,"The claim that electric vehicles cause infertility or lower testosterone is not supported by any scientific evidence provided in the knowledge graph context. In fact, the knowledge graph does not contain any information relating electric vehicles to infertility or testosterone levels. This claim appears to be a misconception or misinformation. There is no established scientific link between electric vehicles and reproductive health or hormone levels. The absence of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the lack of scientific basis for such a claim, strongly suggests that this statement is false."
"It’s “official” that President Donald Trump is signing an “order from Elon Musk giving taxpayers who have filed their 2024 tax returns a stimulus check for $5,000.",False,False,"The claim is false for multiple reasons. First, Donald Trump is not currently the President of the United States, so he does not have the authority to sign such an order. Second, Elon Musk, as a private citizen and business leader, does not have the power to issue government orders for stimulus checks. Third, tax returns for 2024 have not been filed yet as we are still in 2023. Finally, there is no credible information in the knowledge graph context or from reliable sources about any such stimulus check plan. The claim appears to be entirely fabricated."
Kash Patel ordered SWAT raids on three Pentagon officials six hours into his tenure and a four star general was seen shredding documents on surveillance footage before fleeing the country.,False,False,"The claim makes several extraordinary assertions about Kash Patel's actions and a four-star general's behavior, none of which are supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The knowledge graph does not contain any information about SWAT raids, Pentagon officials, document shredding, or a general fleeing the country. In fact, the knowledge graph provides no substantive information about Kash Patel or any events related to the claim. Given the sensational nature of the claim and the complete lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, it is highly likely that this claim is false."
‘Video footage shows giant tree stump in Antarctica that grew when Earth’s climate was different’.,False,False,"The claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context, which is empty. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, we must rely on general knowledge about Antarctica and its climate history. Antarctica has been covered in ice for millions of years, and there is no credible scientific evidence of large trees growing there in recent geological history. The existence of a 'giant tree stump' in Antarctica would be an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence, which is not provided. The claim likely stems from misinterpretation of other geological features or is a fabrication."
Trump Gaza” video was published on Donald Trump’s official social media channels.,True,False,"The claim states that a 'Trump Gaza' video was published on Donald Trump's official social media channels. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about such a video or its publication on Trump's social media channels. The context appears to be empty or incomplete, showing only 'Donald Trump -[]-> ' repeated multiple times without any additional information. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the provided context and the absence of any mention of a Gaza-related video or social media activity, it's highly unlikely that this claim is true. If such a video had been officially published by Trump, it would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph."
"The Philadelphia Eagles have declined their invitation to the White House,” as of Feb. 24.",False,False,"The claim states that the Philadelphia Eagles have declined their invitation to the White House as of February 24. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about the Philadelphia Eagles or their invitation to the White House. The lack of relevant information in the context suggests that this claim is likely false or at least unsubstantiated. It's important to note that typically, NFL teams that win the Super Bowl are invited to the White House in the months following their victory, and any declination would be widely reported. The absence of such information in the knowledge graph, which is supposed to contain recent verified news, further supports the conclusion that this claim is false."
"Target lost $15.7 billion in market value since dropping its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies.",False,False,"The claim states that Target lost $15.7 billion in market value since dropping its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Target's market value, DEI policies, or any changes in either. The lack of relevant information in the context makes it impossible to verify this specific claim using the given data. Without supporting evidence, and considering the specific nature of the claim (exact monetary value and cause-effect relationship), it's more likely to be false than true."
Elon Musk threatened to withdraw support to the World Boxing Organization if it did not revoke a championship title and $25 million in prize money it had awarded to Algerian boxer Imane Khelif.,False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on the lack of supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context contains no information about Elon Musk's involvement with the World Boxing Organization, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, or any threats to withdraw support from a boxing organization. While Elon Musk is mentioned multiple times in the context, there are no connections or relationships shown that would support the claim. Given Musk's primary involvement in technology and space industries, it would be unusual for him to be deeply involved in professional boxing affairs without significant media coverage, which is not reflected in the provided context."
Listening Devices Discovered in Oval Office: President’s Desk Removed for Scanning.,False,False,"The claim states that listening devices were discovered in the Oval Office and that the President's desk was removed for scanning. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting these assertions. The context appears to be empty, with no connections or related information about the Oval Office, listening devices, or any desk removal. Given the significance of such an event, if it were true, it would likely be prominently featured in recent verified news articles and thus reflected in the knowledge graph. The absence of any supporting information strongly suggests that this claim is false."
"On Feb. 24, 2025, an unauthorized video appeared on TV monitors in the Washington headquarters of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development featuring the caption “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING” superimposed over fake, AI-generated footage of President Donald Trump kissing the feet and toes of tech billionaire and government efficiency adviser Elon Musk.",True,False,"The claim describes a very specific event allegedly occurring on Feb. 24, 2025, involving an unauthorized AI-generated video at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. However, the provided knowledge graph context contains no information related to this event, Donald Trump's activities in 2025, Elon Musk's role as a government efficiency adviser, or any unauthorized videos at government agencies. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph for such a notable and specific incident strongly suggests that this claim is false. Additionally, the claim refers to a future date, which makes it impossible to verify with current information."
Claim by Libs of TikTok: Doge uncovered a secret 2 billion federal grant to Power Forward Communities a nonprofit organization linked to Democrat activist Stacey Abrams.,False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on the lack of supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about a $2 billion federal grant to Power Forward Communities or any connection to Stacey Abrams. Additionally, there is no mention of 'Doge' uncovering any such information. The absence of any relevant information in the knowledge graph strongly suggests that this claim is unfounded or fabricated."
"Aircraft are spraying chemical gas with traces of aluminum, barium, and other metals to manipulate the weather by blocking the sun and creating chemical rains and fogs.",False,False,"The claim about aircraft spraying chemical gases to manipulate weather is a common conspiracy theory known as 'chemtrails.' This theory has been thoroughly debunked by scientific evidence and expert consensus. While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information related to this claim, the lack of credible evidence supporting such a widespread, covert operation in reputable scientific or governmental sources strongly suggests its falsehood. Aircraft contrails, which are visible trails of condensed water vapor, are often misinterpreted as 'chemtrails.' These contrails are a natural result of aircraft exhaust in certain atmospheric conditions and do not contain harmful chemicals for weather manipulation."
Cancers are not dangerous as they are just storage bags for toxins which are made fatal with medical intervention.,False,False,"This claim is demonstrably false based on well-established medical knowledge. While the knowledge graph context provided is empty, this claim contradicts fundamental scientific understanding of cancer. Cancers are not 'storage bags for toxins' but rather the result of uncontrolled cell division due to genetic mutations. They are inherently dangerous as they can invade nearby tissues, spread to other parts of the body, and interfere with normal organ function. Medical intervention, far from making cancers fatal, is often life-saving and can significantly improve patient outcomes. The claim's assertion about medical intervention is particularly dangerous as it could discourage people from seeking necessary treatment."
"Video shows cross being installed in the Oval Office by President Trump, as first sitting President to do so.",False,False,"The claim that a video shows President Trump installing a cross in the Oval Office as the first sitting President to do so is likely false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. There are no mentions of a cross being installed in the Oval Office or any religious symbols being added by Trump. Additionally, while the graph shows many connections to Donald Trump, none of them relate to this specific action or any religious modifications to the White House. Given the high-profile nature of such an act, if it had occurred, it would likely be reflected in the knowledge graph. The absence of any supporting evidence in the context strongly suggests the claim is false."
Claim by Donald Trump: Canada gets 95 percent of its imports from the United States.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about Canada's imports from the United States, the claim that Canada gets 95 percent of its imports from the United States is highly implausible and can be confidently labeled as false. This percentage is unrealistically high for any country's imports to come from a single source, even for close trading partners like the U.S. and Canada. Actual trade statistics show a much lower percentage. The U.S. is indeed Canada's largest trading partner, but other countries also contribute significantly to Canada's imports. This claim appears to be a significant exaggeration by Donald Trump."
US Debt Clock” numbers prove “DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days.,False,False,"The claim that 'DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days' based on the US Debt Clock is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. Additionally, Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency and has no direct impact on US taxpayer savings or the national debt. The US Debt Clock is a real-time estimation of the United States national debt and other economic data, but it does not track or relate to cryptocurrency performance. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of financial data, possibly confusing cryptocurrency market movements with national economic indicators."
Claims DOGE has purportedly forwarded the names of 163 members of Congress to the IRS for ‘immediate audit’ False,Unknown,False,"The claim that DOGE (presumably referring to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin) has forwarded names of 163 members of Congress to the IRS for 'immediate audit' is highly implausible and lacks any supporting evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. Cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin do not have the authority or capability to initiate IRS audits of elected officials. Additionally, the knowledge graph does not provide any information linking DOGE, Congress members, and IRS audits. The claim appears to be a fabrication or misinformation."
Barron Trump tweeted about ‘uncovering a dark legacy in this country’.,False,False,"The claim that Barron Trump tweeted about 'uncovering a dark legacy in this country' is likely false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Barron Trump tweeting or making such a statement. Moreover, Barron Trump, as a minor and the son of former President Donald Trump, has generally maintained a low public profile and does not have a known public social media presence. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph or reliable public sources, it's highly improbable that this claim is true."
Elon Musk announced that he will not sell Tesla Cybertruck to anyone belonging to the ‘pride’ community.,False,False,"The claim that Elon Musk announced he will not sell Tesla Cybertruck to anyone belonging to the 'pride' community is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information supporting this claim. In fact, there is no information in the given context about Tesla Cybertruck sales policies or any discriminatory practices against the LGBTQ+ community. Such a discriminatory policy would be highly controversial and likely widely reported, but there is no evidence of this in the provided context. Additionally, implementing such a policy would be illegal in many jurisdictions and go against Tesla's business interests. Without any supporting evidence and given the implausibility of the claim, it can be confidently assessed as false."
DOGE triggered a mass exodus from Washington and housing listings are surging.,False,False,"The claim states that DOGE (presumably referring to Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency) triggered a mass exodus from Washington and caused housing listings to surge. However, the provided knowledge graph context contains no information related to this claim. There are no connections or data points linking Dogecoin to Washington state, population movements, or housing market trends. The absence of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the implausibility of a cryptocurrency directly causing large-scale migration and housing market changes, leads to the conclusion that this claim is false."
"Project 2025 seeks to ban nearly 3,000 books.",False,False,"The claim states that Project 2025 seeks to ban nearly 3,000 books. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Project 2025 or its goals regarding book banning. Without any relevant information from the knowledge graph to support or refute this claim, I cannot confidently verify its accuracy. My verdict is based on the lack of evidence rather than contradictory information."
"Claim by Donald Trump (R): Zelenskyy has a 4% approval rating, as of February 2025.",False,False,"The claim by Donald Trump that Zelenskyy has a 4% approval rating as of February 2025 is false for multiple reasons. First and foremost, the claim refers to a future date (February 2025) that has not yet occurred, making it impossible to have accurate approval ratings for that time. Additionally, the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Zelenskyy's approval ratings or any data supporting this claim. Given Trump's history of making unsubstantiated claims and the lack of evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the impossibility of having future approval ratings, we can confidently say this claim is false."
Claim by Elon Musk: President Joe Biden’s immigration policy was “a giant voter importation scam.,False,False,"The claim by Elon Musk that President Joe Biden's immigration policy is 'a giant voter importation scam' is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Biden's immigration policy or its potential impact on voting. Without any evidence from the knowledge graph to support this claim, it appears to be an unsubstantiated accusation. It's important to note that non-citizens, including recent immigrants, are not legally allowed to vote in federal elections in the United States. Therefore, characterizing immigration policy as a 'voter importation scam' is misleading and false. However, due to the limited information provided in the context, we cannot be 100% certain about all aspects of the current immigration policy."
Official White House social media accounts posted an image of President Donald Trump wearing a crown with the caption “Long live the king.,True,False,"The claim states that official White House social media accounts posted an image of President Donald Trump wearing a crown with the caption 'Long live the king.' However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information supporting this claim. There is no mention of White House social media accounts, images of Trump wearing a crown, or any captions referring to him as a king. Given that such a controversial post from official White House accounts would likely be significant news, the absence of any related information in the knowledge graph strongly suggests this claim is false. Additionally, such a post would be highly unusual and inappropriate for official government communication channels, further supporting the conclusion that this claim is likely fabricated or misinformed."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Did Donald Trump win “almost 40%” of Black votes?.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about Donald Trump's performance among Black voters, the claim that he won 'almost 40%' of Black votes is highly unlikely and not supported by any credible evidence. Historical voting patterns and exit polls from recent elections consistently show that Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, typically receive a much smaller percentage of the Black vote. In the 2020 election, exit polls and post-election analysis estimated Trump's share of the Black vote to be around 8-12%, which is far from the claimed 'almost 40%'. Without any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph or from reliable sources, this claim appears to be a significant exaggeration or misrepresentation of Trump's actual performance among Black voters."
Claim by Nancy Mace (R): “You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options.,False,False,"While the claim by Nancy Mace (R) appears to be a simplified statement about human sex chromosomes, it is not entirely accurate from a scientific standpoint. The knowledge graph context provided does not offer any relevant information to support or refute this claim, so I must rely on established scientific knowledge. In reality, human sex chromosome combinations are more complex than just XX or XY. There are several other chromosomal variations that occur naturally, such as XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), XO (Turner syndrome), XXX, and others. These variations, while less common, demonstrate that sex chromosome combinations are not limited to just XX and XY. Therefore, the claim is oversimplified and does not account for the full spectrum of biological possibilities."
"Did he say it?: Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency, said he would ask U.S. President Donald Trump about a proposal to use savings made by his department to issue a $5,000 refund to every U.S. taxpaying household.",True,False,"The claim is false based on several key factors. First, there is no Department of Government Efficiency in the U.S. government, and Elon Musk has never held a position in the federal government. Second, while Donald Trump is mentioned in the knowledge graph context, there is no information connecting him to this alleged proposal or to Elon Musk in this capacity. The claim appears to be entirely fabricated, mixing real public figures (Elon Musk and Donald Trump) with fictional scenarios and government departments."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Trump says USA spent $350 billion in Ukraine.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about U.S. spending in Ukraine, the claim that the USA spent $350 billion in Ukraine is highly unlikely to be true based on publicly available information. The amount stated is significantly higher than any reported figures for U.S. aid to Ukraine. According to various reputable sources, the total U.S. aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022 has been in the range of $75-113 billion, which is far less than the $350 billion claimed. Without specific evidence from the knowledge graph to support this claim, and given the vast discrepancy between the claimed amount and widely reported figures, it's reasonable to conclude that this statement is false."
"Actor Zach Galifianakis was friends with an unhoused woman for years, paying her rent and inviting her to Hollywood events.",True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided is empty, I have internal knowledge about this claim that suggests it is true. Zach Galifianakis did indeed befriend a homeless woman named Mimi Haist and helped her for years. However, due to the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, I cannot be completely certain, which is reflected in my confidence score."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Volodymyr Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.,False,False,"The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'started' the war in Ukraine with Russia is false. While the provided knowledge graph context does not offer specific information about the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, it's widely known and documented that Russia, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, initiated the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Zelenskyy, as the President of Ukraine, has been leading his country's defense against this unprovoked aggression. The claim contradicts established historical facts and appears to be a misrepresentation of events. It's important to note that the absence of specific information in the knowledge graph about this topic doesn't change the well-documented reality of how the war began."
"In February 2025, Toyota and Honda were planning to shutter manufacturing plants in the U.S. as a result of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.",False,False,"The claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. There are several issues with the claim that make it likely false: 1) It refers to events in February 2025, which is in the future and cannot be factually known yet. 2) The knowledge graph does not contain any information about Toyota, Honda, or manufacturing plant closures. 3) While the Trump administration is mentioned in the context, there is no information about specific tariffs or their effects on the auto industry. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the future date mentioned, strongly suggests this claim is false or at least currently unverifiable."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Judges “want to try and stop us from looking for corruption” and “hold us back from finding all of this fraud.,False,False,"The claim by Donald Trump suggesting that judges are trying to stop the search for corruption and prevent the discovery of fraud is not supported by the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about judges attempting to obstruct investigations into corruption or fraud. In fact, the knowledge graph provides no relevant information to support or refute this specific claim. Given the lack of evidence in the provided context and the nature of the U.S. judicial system, which is designed to uphold the law and support legitimate investigations, this claim appears to be false. Judges typically act based on law and evidence, not to hinder legitimate inquiries into corruption or fraud."
Claim by thepeoplesvoice.tv: Bill Gates Caught Pumping Deadly Bird Flu Jabs Into America’s Food Supply.,False,False,"The claim that Bill Gates is 'caught pumping deadly bird flu jabs into America's food supply' is false and appears to be a baseless conspiracy theory. There is no credible evidence provided in the knowledge graph context or from reliable sources to support this claim. Bill Gates, through his philanthropic work, has been involved in global health initiatives, including vaccine development and distribution, but there is no indication of him being involved in secretly administering bird flu vaccines to the food supply. This claim seems to be a misrepresentation or fabrication likely aimed at spreading misinformation. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph context, which would typically contain relevant factual information from verified news sources, further reinforces the falsehood of this claim."
"Since the invention of the nuclear weapon, the United States has misplaced at least three such weapons.",True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information about lost nuclear weapons, the claim is actually true based on historical records. The United States has indeed lost control of nuclear weapons on multiple occasions, in incidents known as 'Broken Arrow' events. However, due to the lack of supporting evidence in the given context, I'm relying on my internal knowledge, which reduces the confidence score. The exact number of lost weapons is difficult to verify, but it is known to be at least three, as the claim states."
Walmart decreasing its food prices back to pre inflation rates within one month of President Donald Trump inauguration.,False,False,"The claim that Walmart decreased its food prices back to pre-inflation rates within one month of President Donald Trump's inauguration is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Walmart's pricing policies or any changes in food prices related to Trump's inauguration. Additionally, there is no established connection between a president's inauguration and immediate, widespread price changes by major retailers. Such significant price adjustments would typically be influenced by broader economic factors and market conditions rather than a change in political leadership. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the implausibility of such a rapid and specific price change tied to a presidential inauguration, strongly suggests that this claim is false."
"Claim by Ashley Moody (R): The National Human Trafficking Hotline “in the last four years decided that they would no longer report tips to law enforcement, that they would take a more victim-centered approach.”  False",Unknown,False,"The claim by Ashley Moody (R) regarding the National Human Trafficking Hotline's reporting practices cannot be definitively verified or refuted based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context is empty, offering no information to support or contradict the claim. Without specific evidence from the knowledge graph, I cannot confidently assess the truthfulness of the statement. The verdict of 'False' in the original claim is not substantiated by the given context, but neither is it disproven. In such cases where there is a lack of relevant information, it's important to maintain a neutral stance and seek additional verified sources before making a judgment."
Claim Libs of TikTok: An ICE minivan was reportedly set on fire in Philadelphia.,False,False,"The provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to the claim about an ICE minivan being set on fire in Philadelphia. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, I cannot verify the accuracy of this claim. The context only mentions 'Libs Of Tiktok' and 'Philadelphia' as isolated entities without any connections or additional information. Due to the lack of relevant information, I have to rely on my internal knowledge, which does not include any recent verified reports of such an incident. However, given the limited context and the possibility that this event could have occurred without being included in the provided knowledge graph, I have assigned a low confidence score."
DOGE subcommittee discovered $2.7 trillion in improper” Medicaid and Medicare payments to people overseas.,False,False,"The claim appears to be false based on several factors. First, there is no mention of a 'DOGE subcommittee' in the provided knowledge graph context, which would be a significant oversight if such a committee had made such a massive discovery. Second, the alleged amount of $2.7 trillion in improper payments is extraordinarily large and would represent a major scandal if true. Such a finding would likely be prominently featured in the knowledge graph if it were accurate. Third, Medicaid and Medicare are primarily domestic programs for U.S. residents, so large-scale payments to people overseas would be highly unusual and likely illegal. The knowledge graph does not provide any information supporting this claim, which would be expected for such a significant issue if it were true."
George Floyd statue removed from National Mall. False,Unknown,False,"The claim that the George Floyd statue was removed from the National Mall is likely false, but I cannot be entirely certain based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context provided is empty, which means there is no specific information from recent, verified news articles to support or refute this claim. Without any contextual evidence, I have to rely on my general knowledge, which suggests that such a significant event would likely have been widely reported if it had occurred. However, the lack of context also means I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty."
"In February 2025, Republican U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney introduced a bill that would make President Donald Trump’s birthday a federal holiday.",True,False,"The claim states that in February 2025, Rep. Claudia Tenney introduced a bill to make Donald Trump's birthday a federal holiday. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about this specific bill or action by Rep. Tenney. Additionally, the claim refers to a future date (February 2025) which has not occurred yet, making it impossible for such an event to have already taken place. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the future date mentioned in the claim, strongly suggests that this statement is false."
"Claim by Donald Trump (R): “We have office space, it’s occupied by 4%. Nobody’s showing up to work because they were told not to.",False,False,"The claim by Donald Trump about office space being occupied by only 4% and nobody showing up to work because they were told not to cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about office occupancy rates or work attendance policies. Without supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and given Trump's history of making exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims, it's more likely that this statement is false or significantly overstated. However, due to the lack of specific contradicting information in the provided context, we cannot be entirely certain, hence the moderate confidence score."
Sen. Warren said citizens don’t have a right to see how taxes are spent.    False,Unknown,False,"The claim that Senator Warren said citizens don't have a right to see how taxes are spent is likely false. However, the provided knowledge graph context is empty, which means there's no specific evidence from recent verified news articles to directly support or refute this claim. Given the lack of context, I'm basing this assessment on general knowledge about Senator Warren's political stance and the principles of government transparency in the United States. It would be highly unusual and contrary to Warren's known positions for her to make such a statement. Transparency in government spending is a fundamental aspect of democratic accountability, and Warren has generally advocated for more transparency, not less. Without any supporting evidence for this claim, and considering it goes against typical democratic principles and Warren's known positions, it's more likely to be false than true."
We’ve had the flu vaccine for 78 years. We still have the flu.,Misleading,False,"The claim is false because it contains an inaccurate statement about the age of the flu vaccine. While the knowledge graph context doesn't provide specific information about the flu vaccine's history, my internal knowledge indicates that the first flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s, making it approximately 80 years old, not 78 years as claimed. The second part of the claim, 'We still have the flu,' is true, but it doesn't negate the effectiveness of flu vaccines in reducing the severity and spread of influenza. The claim seems to imply that vaccines should completely eradicate a disease to be considered effective, which is not accurate."
"An image authentically shows a Truth Social post from U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he said of the prices of eggs and gas in October 2024, “On DAY ONE, I’ll SLASH prices.",False,False,"The claim states that there is an authentic Truth Social post from Donald Trump about slashing egg and gas prices on 'DAY ONE' in October 2024. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about such a post or statement from Donald Trump. The context appears to be empty, with no relevant connections or information provided about Trump's social media activity, policy statements, or promises regarding egg and gas prices. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the specificity of the claim, it is highly likely that this post is fabricated or misattributed."
Babies under 6 months have the second highest hospitalization rate after the elderly.,True,False,"The claim states that babies under 6 months have the second highest hospitalization rate after the elderly. However, the provided knowledge graph context is empty, which means there is no specific information to directly support or refute this claim. Without concrete evidence from the knowledge graph, I cannot confidently verify or deny this statement. My verdict is based on general medical knowledge, which suggests that while infants can be vulnerable to certain illnesses, their hospitalization rates vary depending on many factors and may not consistently be the second highest across all conditions or time periods. The lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph context reduces the confidence in this assessment."
Elon Musk spent $40 million buying Super Bowl commercials.,False,False,"The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Elon Musk spending $40 million on Super Bowl commercials. While Elon Musk is mentioned multiple times in the context, there are no connections or details related to Super Bowl advertising or any specific spending. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the significant nature of such a large advertising expenditure, I cannot confirm this claim. However, my confidence is not extremely high due to the limited information available in the provided context."
The US Mint said it hasn’t made pennies since April 2023.   False,Unknown,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided is empty, I can confidently state that this claim is false based on my internal knowledge of U.S. Mint operations. The U.S. Mint has not announced any cessation of penny production, and such a significant change would have been widely reported. Pennies continue to be produced and circulated in the United States. However, without specific evidence from the knowledge graph to support or refute this claim, I cannot be 100% certain, which is reflected in the confidence score."
It is illegal to display the U.S. flag upside down. ,False,False,"While the provided knowledge graph context does not contain specific information about this claim, I can confidently state that the claim is false based on well-established U.S. law and First Amendment protections. Displaying the U.S. flag upside down is not illegal. In fact, it is a recognized form of protected speech under the First Amendment. The U.S. Flag Code describes the proper way to display and handle the American flag, but it is not enforceable law and there are no penalties for non-compliance. An upside-down flag is traditionally used as a distress signal, but it has also been used as a form of protest, which is protected by freedom of speech."
Bill Gates said in January 2025 that he would leave the US if the Epstein client list is released.,False,False,"The claim that Bill Gates said in January 2025 that he would leave the US if the Epstein client list is released is false. The primary reason for this conclusion is that the claim refers to a future date (January 2025) that has not yet occurred. It's impossible for Bill Gates or anyone else to have made such a statement in a time that hasn't happened yet. Additionally, the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information related to Bill Gates, Epstein client lists, or any statements about leaving the US. The absence of relevant information in the context, combined with the logical impossibility of the claim's timeframe, strongly supports the verdict of false."
Claim by Lisa Murkowski (R): “Our nation’s tallest mountain … has been called Denali for thousands of years.,True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about Denali or its naming history, the claim made by Lisa Murkowski (R) is generally accepted as true based on historical and cultural knowledge. Denali, which means 'the high one' or 'the great one' in the Koyukon Athabascan language, has indeed been called by this name by Alaska Natives for thousands of years. The mountain was officially renamed Denali in 2015, reverting from the name Mount McKinley, which it had been called since 1896. The long-standing indigenous name predates Western exploration and naming conventions by millennia. While I cannot directly cite the knowledge graph for this information, the claim aligns with widely documented historical and cultural facts."
Did Trump Overturn Ban on Forever Chemicals in Drinking Water?.,False,False,"The claim that Trump overturned a ban on forever chemicals in drinking water cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Trump's actions regarding forever chemicals or drinking water regulations. Without specific evidence from the knowledge graph to support or refute the claim, we cannot confidently say it is true. However, given the lack of supporting information in what appears to be an extensive set of connections related to Trump, it seems more likely that this specific action did not occur or was not a significant policy change during his administration. If it had been a major policy decision, it would likely have been included in the knowledge graph."
Claim by Mario Nawfal: Former USAID Administrator Samantha Power’s net worth “skyrocketed” from $6.7 million to $30 million in three years.,False,False,"The claim that Samantha Power's net worth 'skyrocketed' from $6.7 million to $30 million in three years cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Samantha Power's net worth or financial status. Without specific evidence to support or refute this claim, it is likely false or at least unsubstantiated. Claims of such significant wealth increases for public officials typically require substantial evidence and would likely be widely reported if true. The lack of any supporting information in the context suggests this claim is probably false or greatly exaggerated."
Reuters and Politico received government funding during the Biden administration but not the Trump administration.,False,False,"The claim states that Reuters and Politico received government funding during the Biden administration but not the Trump administration. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about government funding for Reuters or Politico during either administration. The context only mentions the Trump Administration without any connections or relevant information. Due to the lack of specific evidence in the knowledge graph to support or refute the claim, I cannot confidently verify its accuracy. My verdict is based on the absence of supporting information and the general principle that extraordinary claims require evidence."
A photograph authentically shows a framed mug shot of U.S. President Donald Trump hanging on a wall in the White House.,True,False,"The claim that a framed mug shot of Donald Trump is authentically hanging on a wall in the White House is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about a mug shot of Donald Trump being displayed in the White House. Given the high-profile nature of such an event, if it were true, it would likely be mentioned in the context. Additionally, as of my last update, there has been no credible report of such a photograph being displayed in the White House. Mug shots are typically associated with arrests, and while former President Trump has faced legal challenges, there is no evidence of an official White House display of such an image. This claim appears to be misinformation or possibly a misinterpretation of satirical content."
Claim by Donald Trump (R): Trump says Russia has lost 1.5 million troops In Ukraine war.,False,False,"The claim that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war is highly exaggerated and not supported by any credible evidence. While the knowledge graph context doesn't provide specific information about Russian troop losses in Ukraine, such an enormous casualty figure would be widely reported and known if it were true. Reliable estimates from military experts and intelligence agencies typically put Russian losses in the tens of thousands, not millions. The claim of 1.5 million troops lost is so far beyond realistic estimates that it can be confidently labeled as false. Donald Trump has a history of making exaggerated or false claims, and this appears to be another instance of that pattern."
Donald Trump Forgot To Swear In Tulsi Gabbard.,False,False,"The claim that Donald Trump forgot to swear in Tulsi Gabbard is false. This conclusion is based on several key factors: 1) The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Trump swearing in Gabbard or forgetting to do so. 2) Tulsi Gabbard has never held a position that would require being sworn in by a president. She was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and representatives are sworn in by the Speaker of the House, not the President. 3) Donald Trump and Tulsi Gabbard were not in office at the same time in positions where Trump would have authority to swear in Gabbard. 4) Presidents generally do not swear in members of Congress or other officials outside of their direct appointees. While the knowledge graph doesn't directly refute the claim, the absence of any supporting evidence, combined with the factual impossibility of the scenario, leads to a high confidence in the false verdict."
"Antarctica’s perimeter is larger than Earth’s circumference which should not be possible, proving Antarctica is an ice wall and we live on a flat Earth.",False,False,"The claim is false and is based on a misunderstanding of geography and a misinterpretation of measurements. While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about Antarctica or Earth's circumference, the claim can be refuted based on well-established scientific facts. The Earth is not flat, but a spheroid, which has been proven through numerous scientific observations, measurements, and space exploration. Antarctica is a continent, not an 'ice wall,' and its coastline length, while extensive, does not exceed Earth's circumference. The claim's premise is fundamentally flawed and contradicts established geographical and astronomical knowledge."
Video captioned “BOO THE BASTARD” authentically shows Donald Trump being booed at the 2025 Super Bowl.,False,False,"The claim is false because it refers to an event in the future (the 2025 Super Bowl) that has not yet occurred. As of now, we are not in 2025, so no video from a 2025 Super Bowl can exist. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Donald Trump at a future Super Bowl or being booed at any specific event. Without any supporting evidence from the knowledge graph and given the impossibility of having authentic video footage from a future event, we can confidently say this claim is false."
Claim by Tucker Carlson: Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.,False,False,"The claim by Tucker Carlson that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States appears to be false based on the available information. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any evidence supporting this claim. In fact, the context does not provide any specific information about Ukraine selling armaments or misusing aid from the United States. While the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph doesn't definitively prove the claim false, it's a significant indicator that there's no credible basis for such a substantial allegation. Given the serious nature of the claim and the absence of corroborating evidence, it's more likely to be false than true. However, the confidence score is not at maximum due to the limited information provided in the context."
Trump signed executive order kicking people out of public housing after two years.,False,False,"The claim states that Trump signed an executive order kicking people out of public housing after two years. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to this claim. There are no nodes or relationships mentioning public housing, executive orders, or any time-limited housing policies. Given the lack of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the absence of any widely known policy matching this description, the claim is likely false. However, the confidence score is moderate due to the limited information provided in the context."
"In February 2025, a statue of a goat covered in $100 bills featuring the face of U.S. President Donald Trump was displayed at Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.",True,False,"The claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about a statue of a goat covered in $100 bills featuring Donald Trump's face being displayed at Mar-a-Lago in February 2025. Additionally, the claim refers to a future event (February 2025) which has not occurred yet, making it impossible to verify as true. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph, combined with the future date, leads to the conclusion that this claim is likely false."
President Donald Trump “just reversed all the cost caps Biden negotiated for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid.,False,False,"The claim that President Donald Trump 'just reversed all the cost caps Biden negotiated for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid' appears to be false based on the available information. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information about Trump reversing cost caps for Medicare or Medicaid that were negotiated by Biden. Additionally, as of my last update, Trump is not currently in office and does not have the authority to make such changes. The claim seems to conflate past and present actions, or possibly misattributes recent healthcare policy changes. Without any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph or recent factual events, this claim cannot be substantiated."
Elon Musk is ‘blocking Pride on X’  False,Unknown,False,"The claim that Elon Musk is 'blocking Pride on X' cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about Elon Musk's actions regarding Pride or any content moderation on X (formerly Twitter). Without specific evidence supporting or refuting the claim, it's more appropriate to consider it false. However, the lack of relevant information in the knowledge graph reduces the confidence in this assessment."
A study concluded that ozempic causes blindness.,False,False,"The claim states that a study concluded ozempic causes blindness. However, the provided knowledge graph context is empty, which means there is no specific information from recent, verified news articles to support or refute this claim. Based on my internal knowledge, while Ozempic (semaglutide) is a medication used for type 2 diabetes and weight loss, there is no widely reported or conclusive study linking it directly to causing blindness. Some diabetes medications may have side effects related to eye health, but a direct causal link to blindness would be a significant finding that would likely be well-documented. Without any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph or from reliable sources, this claim appears to be false or at least greatly exaggerated."
"On Feb. 8, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump called teachers “ugly” in a Truth Social Post.",False,False,"The claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided knowledge graph context. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1) The knowledge graph does not contain any information about a specific Truth Social post by Donald Trump on Feb. 8, 2025. 2) The date mentioned in the claim (Feb. 8, 2025) is in the future, which makes it impossible to verify at the current time. 3) There is no information in the provided context about Donald Trump calling teachers 'ugly' or making any statements about teachers at all. The knowledge graph appears to be empty or lacking relevant information to support this claim. Given the lack of supporting evidence and the future date, the claim is determined to be false."
"Claim by President Donald Trump (R): “[W]e don’t need the products that [Canada and Mexico] have. We have all the oil you need. We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber.",Misleading,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not offer specific information about U.S. trade relations with Canada and Mexico or details about oil and lumber resources, the claim made by Donald Trump is likely false based on general economic knowledge. The U.S. does engage in significant trade with both Canada and Mexico, including imports of various products. Specifically, Canada is a major supplier of lumber to the U.S., and both Canada and Mexico export oil to the United States. The statement that the U.S. doesn't need products from these countries and has all the oil and lumber it needs oversimplifies complex trade relationships and ignores the benefits of international trade. However, without specific data from the knowledge graph to directly refute the claim, we cannot be 100% certain."
China has imposed 75% tariffs on American goods.,False,False,"The claim states that China has imposed 75% tariffs on American goods. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Chinese tariffs on American goods, let alone a specific 75% tariff rate. The lack of relevant information in the context makes it difficult to verify or refute the claim directly. Based on my general knowledge, a 75% tariff rate would be exceptionally high and likely to make headlines if implemented. Without any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and considering the extreme nature of the claim, I am inclined to believe it is false. However, my confidence is limited due to the absence of specific contradictory information."
Bill Gates Said ‘Defunding USAID Will Bring About Another Mystery Illness Across The World. MILLIONS WILL DIE’.,False,False,"The claim attributes a specific quote to Bill Gates about defunding USAID leading to 'another mystery illness' and 'MILLIONS WILL DIE'. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Bill Gates, USAID, or any such statement. There is no evidence in the given context to support this claim. While USAID is mentioned, there are no connections or information provided that relate to the specific claim. In the absence of supporting evidence, and given the sensational nature of the alleged quote, it is highly likely that this claim is false or at least significantly misrepresented."
"Claim by Tommy Tuberville (R): As head football coach at Texas Tech University, “I recruited (Patrick Mahomes) … I’ve got to be very good friends with him.",False,False,"The claim by Tommy Tuberville that he recruited Patrick Mahomes and became very good friends with him while head football coach at Texas Tech University is false. The knowledge graph context provided does not contain any information to support this claim. Moreover, based on publicly available information (which I'm using since the KG context is empty), Tommy Tuberville was never the head football coach at Texas Tech University. Tuberville was the head coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008 and at the University of Cincinnati from 2013 to 2016. Patrick Mahomes played for Texas Tech from 2014 to 2016 under head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Therefore, Tuberville could not have recruited Mahomes or become friends with him in the capacity he claims."
"Katherine Long, the journalist of the hit piece that got a DOGE employee to resign for spicy posts, is a USAID employee. How is this not a conflict of interest?.",False,False,"The claim states that Katherine Long, a journalist who wrote an article leading to a DOGE employee's resignation, is a USAID employee, suggesting a conflict of interest. However, the provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information about Katherine Long, USAID, or the alleged conflict of interest. The context only contains empty relationships related to 'Doge', which is likely referring to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Without any relevant information from the knowledge graph to support or refute the claim, I cannot confidently verify its accuracy. The low confidence score reflects the lack of pertinent information in the provided context."
"Did he say it?: In 2012, future U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, “Why is Barack Obama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?.",True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information about this tweet, the claim can be verified as true based on widely available public records. Donald Trump did indeed tweet this exact statement on October 10, 2012. This tweet has been extensively documented and fact-checked by numerous reputable sources. The wording and timing of the tweet are consistent with Trump's communication style and political stance during that period, particularly his criticism of President Obama. However, it's important to note that the knowledge graph did not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim."
‘Direct File’ tax program is no longer available to Americans.  False,Unknown,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about the 'Direct File' tax program, the claim states that this program is 'no longer available to Americans,' which implies it was previously available. As a fact-checking assistant with access to recent political information, I can confidently state that this claim is false. The IRS actually launched a pilot program called 'Direct File' for the 2024 tax filing season (for 2023 taxes) in certain states. This program is new and expanding, not being discontinued. The lack of information in the knowledge graph about the program's discontinuation, combined with my knowledge of its recent implementation, supports the conclusion that the claim is false."
Bill Gates wrote an article headlined “Depopulation through forced vaccination: the zero carbon solution!”  False,Unknown,False,"The claim that Bill Gates wrote an article titled 'Depopulation through forced vaccination: the zero carbon solution!' is false. This claim appears to be a conspiracy theory that misrepresents Bill Gates' work in global health and vaccination efforts. While Bill Gates has been involved in funding vaccine research and distribution through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, he has never advocated for depopulation or forced vaccination. The alleged article title is sensationalist and does not align with Gates' known public statements or the foundation's mission. Although the knowledge graph context provided no specific information to directly refute this claim, the absence of any corroborating evidence, combined with the outlandish nature of the claim, strongly suggests it is false. It's important to note that reputable sources and fact-checking organizations have repeatedly debunked similar claims about Bill Gates and vaccines."
There is evidence Coca Cola called ICE on their own latino workers in Texas.,False,False,"The provided knowledge graph context does not contain any information related to Coca Cola, latino workers, or ICE raids in Texas. There is no evidence presented to support the claim. The lack of relevant information in the context, which should contain recent verified news, suggests that this claim is likely false or at least unsubstantiated. Without any supporting evidence from reliable sources, we cannot verify this serious allegation against a major corporation."
Early reports of four survivors show “this DC plane crash story isn’t adding up.,False,False,"The claim suggests that early reports of four survivors indicate inconsistencies in the DC plane crash story. However, the provided knowledge graph context is empty, which means there is no supporting evidence for this claim. In the absence of any corroborating information from reliable sources, and given the serious nature of such an allegation about a plane crash, it would be irresponsible to consider this claim as true. Moreover, initial reports during emergencies are often subject to change as more information becomes available, and the presence of survivors does not inherently suggest a conspiracy or inconsistency in reporting."
"Did he say it?: U.S. Vice President JD Vance once said, “The professors are the enemy.",True,False,"The claim contains two significant errors that can be identified based on the available information and general knowledge. First, JD Vance is not the U.S. Vice President. Second, there is no evidence in the provided knowledge graph context to support the alleged quote 'The professors are the enemy.' The knowledge graph does not contain any information about JD Vance's statements or positions on professors. While JD Vance is a known political figure, he is currently a U.S. Senator from Ohio, not the Vice President. The lack of any supporting evidence in the knowledge graph for the claimed statement, combined with the factual error about his position, strongly suggests this claim is false."
Claim by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Research “suggests that Blacks need fewer antigens” in their vaccines.,False,False,"The claim by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that research 'suggests that Blacks need fewer antigens' in their vaccines is false. This statement is not supported by any credible scientific evidence. The provided knowledge graph context does not offer any information to support this claim. In fact, vaccine recommendations are based on extensive research and are generally the same for all racial and ethnic groups. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of vaccine science, potentially promoting harmful misinformation. Reputable health organizations like the CDC and WHO do not differentiate vaccine schedules or compositions based on race."
Screenshot of Donald Trump Truth Social Post saying the Department of Education was wasting millions on a spoon & fork (spork) hybrid is real.,False,False,"The claim that a screenshot of Donald Trump's Truth Social post about the Department of Education wasting millions on a spork hybrid is real cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about such a post or the Department of Education's spending on sporks. Given the absence of supporting evidence in the knowledge graph and the unusual nature of the claim, it is likely to be false. However, without explicit contradictory information, we cannot be 100% certain."
"Claim by Donald Trump (R): “We spend more money per pupil than any other nation in the world, and yet we’re rated No. 40. … We have to tell the teachers union, we’re rated last in the world in education, of the Top 40.",False,False,"The claim made by Donald Trump contains several inaccuracies that can be addressed based on available data, even though the provided knowledge graph context doesn't offer specific information to directly refute or support the claim. First, the U.S. does not spend more per pupil than any other nation in the world. While the U.S. does spend a significant amount on education, it is not the highest. Second, the U.S. is not rated 40th in education globally, nor is it rated last among the Top 40 countries. Various international assessments like PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) typically place the U.S. around the middle of developed nations, not at the bottom. The claim appears to significantly misrepresent the U.S. education system's global standing and funding."
Senator Elizabeth Warren said “There is nothing in the constitution that says ordinary Americans have a right to see what we’re spending tax dollars on.,False,False,"The claim attributes a quote to Senator Elizabeth Warren that is not supported by any evidence in the provided knowledge graph context. Moreover, this statement contradicts well-established principles of government transparency and the public's right to information about government spending. The U.S. Constitution, while not explicitly mentioning tax dollar transparency, does provide for checks and balances and accountability in government. Additionally, laws like the Freedom of Information Act ensure public access to government records, including spending information. The alleged quote would be highly controversial and inconsistent with Warren's known positions on government accountability and transparency."
"During his time in office, U.S. President Bill Clinton oversaw the termination of 377,000 federal employees.",True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain any specific information about Bill Clinton's presidency or federal employee terminations, this claim is generally considered to be true based on my internal knowledge. During Clinton's administration, there was a significant effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce as part of his 'Reinventing Government' initiative. The number of approximately 377,000 federal employees being terminated during his tenure is consistent with historical records. However, due to the lack of supporting evidence in the given knowledge graph context, I cannot be completely certain, which is reflected in the confidence score."
"Claim by Brian Mast (R): From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, “10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.",False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not offer specific information about USAID's funding allocation, the claim made by Brian Mast (R) that only '10 to 30 cents on the dollar' of USAID funding goes to actual aid appears to be inaccurate based on general knowledge about USAID operations. Typically, USAID is known for its relatively efficient use of funds, with a significant portion going directly to aid programs. The extremely low percentage claimed (10-30%) seems highly unlikely for a major government agency dedicated to international development. However, without specific data from the knowledge graph to directly refute this claim, we cannot be 100% certain, hence the moderate confidence score."
DOJ allows death penalty as punishment for being an undocumented immigrant. ,False,False,"The claim that the DOJ allows the death penalty as punishment for being an undocumented immigrant is false. The knowledge graph context does not provide any information supporting this claim. In fact, there are no connections shown between the DOJ, death penalty, and immigration status. The death penalty in the United States is typically reserved for the most serious crimes, such as first-degree murder with aggravating factors, and not for immigration offenses. Imposing the death penalty for being an undocumented immigrant would be an extreme and unconstitutional measure that goes against established U.S. law and international human rights standards."
Claim by Elon Musk: U.S. gov gave the NY Times “tens of millions.,False,False,"The claim by Elon Musk that the U.S. government gave the New York Times 'tens of millions' cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context does not contain any information about government funding to the New York Times or any related financial transactions. While Elon Musk is mentioned multiple times in the context, there are no connections or information provided that support or refute his claim. Due to the lack of relevant information in the given context, I have to rely on general knowledge, which suggests that such a large direct government payment to a private news organization would be unusual and likely controversial if true. However, without specific evidence to definitively disprove the claim, I cannot be entirely certain, hence the moderate confidence score."
Claim by Slay News: “Japan sounds alarm as heart failure surges among Covid-vaccinated.,False,False,"The claim that Japan has sounded an alarm about heart failure surging among Covid-vaccinated individuals cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge graph context. The context is empty and does not contain any information about Japan, Covid-19 vaccinations, or heart failure rates. Without supporting evidence from reliable sources, this claim appears to be false or at least unsubstantiated. It's important to note that reputable health organizations worldwide continue to monitor vaccine safety, and no such widespread alarm has been raised by official Japanese health authorities."
Claim by RFK Jr.: GLP-1 drugs are “the first front-line intervention” to treat obesity “for 6-year-old kids.,False,False,"The claim by RFK Jr. that GLP-1 drugs are 'the first front-line intervention' to treat obesity 'for 6-year-old kids' appears to be false. While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about GLP-1 drugs or obesity treatments for children, this claim is highly unlikely to be accurate based on general medical knowledge. Typically, first-line interventions for childhood obesity involve lifestyle modifications such as diet changes and increased physical activity, not medication. GLP-1 drugs are primarily used in adults and are not commonly prescribed as a first-line treatment for young children. The use of such drugs in 6-year-olds would be extremely rare and only considered in severe cases after other interventions have failed. Without supporting evidence from the knowledge graph, and given the extreme nature of the claim, it is highly probable that this statement is false or at least significantly exaggerated."
Claim by RFK Jr.: “We brought that petition after CDC recommended COVID vaccine without any scientific basis for 6-year-old children.,False,False,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information related to this claim, it's important to note that the CDC's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines are typically based on scientific evidence and rigorous clinical trials. The claim that there was 'no scientific basis' for recommending the vaccine for 6-year-old children is likely false. The CDC generally relies on data from clinical trials and expert advisory committees before making vaccine recommendations. However, without specific information from the knowledge graph to directly refute this claim, my confidence is not at the highest level."
"In 2021, during former U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, Mexico increased numbers of troops at its borders an effort to reduce migration.",True,True,"While the knowledge graph context provided does not contain specific information about Mexico increasing troops at its borders in 2021, this claim is generally considered to be true based on widely reported events during that time. However, due to the lack of direct supporting evidence in the given context, the confidence score is moderate. The claim aligns with actions taken by Mexico in cooperation with the Biden administration to address migration issues, but without explicit confirmation in the provided information, we must rely on broader knowledge of U.S.-Mexico relations during this period."
Graph shows Chelsea Clinton taking home $84 million.,False,False,"The claim that Chelsea Clinton took home $84 million is not supported by any evidence provided in the knowledge graph context. In fact, no information about Chelsea Clinton's earnings or finances was provided at all. Without any supporting evidence from reliable sources, and given the extraordinary nature of the claim, it is likely to be false. However, the lack of specific contradicting information in the provided context limits the confidence in this assessment."
