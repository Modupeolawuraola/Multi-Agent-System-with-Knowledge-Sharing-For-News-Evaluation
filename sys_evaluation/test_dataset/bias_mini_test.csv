The Justice Department has placed on administrative leave a government immigration lawyer who in court this week expressed frustration at not being able to answer key questions from a judge over a mistaken deportation case, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Erez Reuveni argued the government’s case in the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the government has said was sent to his native El Salvador last month due to a clerical error, despite a court order that he not be deported.

Reuveni said in court of the government’s position: “Our only arguments are jurisdictional. … He should not have been sent to El Salvador.”

Asked why the US couldn’t simply ask for his return, Reuveni said, “The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” adding that he did not get a direct answer.

Attorney General Pam Bondi took issue with how Reuveni handled the case in court.

“At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,” she said in a statement to CNN.

Bondi issued a memo on her first day as attorney general requiring lawyers to “zealously” advocate for administration positions or face disciplinary action and potential firing.

August Flentje, Reuveni’s supervisor, was also placed on administrative leave, according to one person familiar with the matter. ABC News reported earlier Saturday that Flentje was told he had failed to supervise a subordinate. CNN has reached out to Flentje and the Justice Department for comment.

Reuveni didn’t respond to a request for comment. On LinkedIn five months ago, he posted that he had been promoted to a new position as acting deputy director at the Office of Immigration Litigation.

Flentje, whose LinkedIn profile lists his title as deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation, is known for his work defending the travel ban in the first Trump administration, a role that garnered criticism from some DOJ colleagues.

In a court filing earlier this week, the Trump administration conceded that Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father of three, was deported “because of an administrative error.” That filing appeared to be the first time the administration has admitted an error related to its recent deportation flights to El Salvador, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.

“On March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the Trump administration’s March 31 filing said.

A Maryland judge has ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned by Monday night, but the Trump administration on Saturday filed an emergency stay attempting to block the order. The administration has said it cannot return him because he’s now in Salvadoran custody.

Abrego Garcia, who attorneys say fled gang violence in El Salvador more than a decade ago, had been identified by his wife in a photo of detainees entering intake at CECOT, the country’s notorious mega prison.

A district court judge awarded $6.6 million combined to four whistleblowers who were fired shortly after they reported Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to the FBI.

“By a preponderance of the evidence,” Travis County Judge Catherine Mauzy wrote in her Friday judgment, the plaintiffs proved liability, damages and attorneys fees in their complaint against the attorney general’s office.

“Because the Office of the Attorney General violated the Texas Whistleblower Act by firing and otherwise retaliating against the plaintiff for in good faith reporting violations of law by Ken Paxton and OAG, the court hereby renders judgment for plaintiffs,” Mauzy wrote.

The court found that the four Paxton aides were fired in retaliation for reporting allegations that he was using his office to accept bribes from an Austin real estate developer who employed a woman with whom Paxton was having an extramarital affair. Paxton has denied accepting bribes or misusing his office to help Nate Paul, the real estate developer.

The judgment also stated that the employees made their reports to law enforcement “in good faith” and that Paxton’s office did not dispute any claims or damages in the lawsuit.

“It should shock all Texans that their chief law enforcement officer, Ken Paxton, admitted to violating the law, but that is exactly what happened in this case,” Tom Nesbitt, an attorney for Blake Brickman, and TJ Turner, an attorney for David Maxwell, said in a joint statement.

In a statement to the media, Paxton, a Republican, called the ruling “ridiculous” and “not based on the facts or the law.” He also said that his office intends to appeal the ruling.

Paxton was at the center of a federal investigation after eight employees reported his office to the FBI in 2020 for bribery allegations. Paxton in 2023 agreed to a $3.3 million settlement and an apology, but no admission of wrongdoing, with four of the whistleblowers. After Paxton asked state lawmakers to fund the settlement, the Texas House rejected his request, conducted its own investigation and impeached him in 2023. He was later acquitted in the state Senate.

In November, the Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling that Paxton testify in the lawsuit.

The US Justice Department decided not to pursue its investigation into Paxton in the final weeks of the Biden administration, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

No longer shadowed by the federal corruption investigation that hung over his rising profile in the Republican Party, Paxton is now gearing up for a potential US Senate run. Paxton, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has hinted at challenging GOP Sen. John Cornyn for more than a year but has not said when he will make a decision.",Left

President Donald Trump arranged for far-right activist Laura Loomer to join him in the Oval Office this week for an extraordinary meeting that preceded a shake-up of his national security leadership, two sources familiar with their meeting told CNN.

Their sit-down came after Loomer reached Trump by phone, the sources told CNN. As a result of their call, Trump instructed staff to invite her to the White House, the sources added.

Within 24 hours of their meeting, the administration had fired the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, the United States’ powerful cyber intelligence bureau, as well as staff members on the National Security Council. Loomer had advocated for their dismissal during her conversation with Trump, CNN previously reported.

“This is called vetting,” Loomer wrote on X early Friday, adding of the NSA leaders: “Their firings are a blessing for the American people.”

The stunning series of events recalled Trump’s first term, when informal advisers, fringe figures and longtime associates often bypassed traditional channels to gain direct access to the Oval Office. His aides have insisted the president’s second term would be marked by discipline and structure.

Loomer’s previous inflammatory rhetoric has drawn rebukes from Republican leaders, and her access to then-candidate Trump was limited last fall after her appearances on the campaign trail alongside him prompted internal tensions and public criticism. Now, by securing a White House visit just 72 days into Trump’s second term, Loomer has once again cast a spotlight on the external sources shaping the president’s decision-making in what was supposed to be a closely guarded Oval Office.

And it appears Loomer’s work isn’t finished. In the days since her meeting with Trump, Loomer has publicly accused the president’s advisers of failing to block Republicans whom she sees as unfaithful to Trump from top White House and administration jobs. In response to what she calls a “vetting crisis,” Loomer recently announced she was starting an opposition research firm to dig into the backgrounds of executive branch hires on her own.

“I literally have a binder of receipts,” she said in a recent podcast appearance, “and I know who’s loyal and I know who is disloyal.”

Loomer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. However, she told CNN earlier this week that she would “decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump.”

“It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security,” she said in a statement Thursday.

CNN has reached out to the White House about the meeting.

As a conservative provocateur who is fiercely loyal to Trump, Loomer has publicly positioned herself as a protector of the president against people she views as insufficiently committed to the MAGA movement and its leader. In social media posts, she shares her deep suspicions of Elon Musk and other tech billionaires who have lately cozied up to the president and is especially critical of Republicans who failed to stand by Trump after his defeat in 2020.

Until this week, she had largely operated from outside the halls of power in Washington — though not for lack of trying. Loomer, who twice ran unsuccessfully for Congress, has spent months attempting to gain access to the West Wing. On social media, she has accused the president’s inner circle of pushing aside her and others whom she considers faithful Trump followers.

While she regularly talks to Trump by phone, sources familiar with their relationship said, senior advisers had until recently largely thwarted her efforts at greater access and had limited her ability to gain an in-person audience with the president. The White House hasn’t approved her attempts to secure a press credential and attend daily briefings, she has said on social media. The press office didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment about the status of her application.

But the president was intrigued by Loomer’s latest overture during their recent phone conversation, the sources familiar with the meeting said, which included detailed critiques of many officials serving in key intelligence agencies. After Loomer presented her case to the president in person — carrying a list of roughly a dozen names she encouraged him to dismiss over their political backgrounds — the White House moved to oust the individuals.

On Thursday, Trump acknowledged meeting with Loomer but downplayed her role in the dismissal of National Security Council staff, calling her “a very strong person” who “recommended some people for jobs.”

“And sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody, I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.

Hours later, CNN reported that Trump had dismissed two more individuals flagged by Loomer, including the NSA director, Gen. Timothy Haugh, a Senate-confirmed official who also leads US Cyber Command.

But sources familiar with Loomer’s Oval Office visit on Wednesday told CNN the meeting was a one-off, and they insisted her access to the president remained in check.

The firings also came amid intense internal scrutiny of national security operations following the revelation that top administration officials discussed an attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen over a Signal chat that mistakenly included a journalist. While it’s unclear whether this week’s dismissals were related to that incident, Trump and other top administration officials have remained wary behind the scenes of how the intelligence community is operating, CNN previously reported. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who was at the heart of the Signal scandal, was in the room Wednesday while Loomer condemned the staffers on his team.

Still, it’s the second time in recent weeks that Loomer has appeared to claim credit for a Trump decision. Loomer, in a mid-March social media post, accused the son of former President Joe Biden, Hunter, of vacationing in South Africa with the protection of US Secret Service agents. Asked about the allegations several days later, Trump said he “just heard about it for the first time” and would “take a look at that.” Shortly after, Trump wrote on Truth Social he was revoking Hunter Biden’s protective service.

Loomer has long occupied a place on the outer edges of Trump’s inner circle, a position that brought considerable challenges for the Republican’s 2024 campaign. For a time, Loomer accompanied then-candidate Trump on his private plane or met with him at his personal resort clubs, where she would share with him her theories.

When Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ ethnicity during an especially tense interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last summer, an adviser blamed Loomer — who, leading up to Trump’s appearance, baselessly accused Harris on X of hiding her Black heritage — for planting the seed. Asked by CNN last fall, Loomer did not weigh in on whether she influenced Trump’s remarks.

Loomer notably accompanied Trump on his flight to the Republican National Convention last summer, just one day after an assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. And she was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane ahead of his September debate against Harris.

Her proximity to Trump, though, soon became a source of friction. Democrats pounced and Republicans groaned when she appeared alongside Trump at a memorial service honoring those who died on September 11, 2001. Loomer had previously posted a video claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job.” (Loomer, in a phone interview with CNN last year, said, “I’ve never denied the fact that Islamic terrorists carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks.”)

After the controversy stirred by that appearance, advisers largely curtailed Loomer’s access to Trump for the remainder of the campaign. This week, though, Loomer demonstrated her staying power as she defended Trump’s firing of national security officials.

“Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you,” she wrote on X, “and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.”",Left

Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is expected to take aim at the Department of Homeland Security in the coming days, seeking potentially major cuts to personnel across its agencies, including the US Secret Service, multiple sources tell CNN.

DHS is bracing for what could amount to significant layoffs, four sources familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely told CNN, though no final decisions have been made, and the ultimate scale and scope has not been set.

This week, two of the sources said, there was back-and-forth negotiation and lobbying between DOGE, the White House, and Homeland Security leadership, with each of the department’s components expected to be impacted differently. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is expected to be decimated, one of the sources said.

Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are also facing potential cuts, two of the sources said.

A senior DHS official told CNN the department is “determined to eliminate government waste that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer. Across DHS, we will be eliminating non-mission critical positions and bureaucratic hurdles that undermine our mission to secure the homeland. Secretary Noem is determined to return DHS to its core mission of keeping America safe.”

CNN has reached out to DHS and DOGE for comment. The Secret Service declined to comment.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to send an email to her department’s personnel in the coming days laying out the expected cuts, with a separate email in the works detailing potential options for employees to include voluntary separations and early retirements. One of the sources made clear that Noem’s name may be on that email – but it is top Trump aide Stephen Miller, DOGE and other White House staff making the key decisions.

Cuts to the Secret Service would come at a particularly challenging time for the agency, which has been strained by what top officials have cast as an unprecedented and dynamic threat environment, including two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump last summer. The agency has been wracked with low morale, burnout, low staffing, and retention issues.

The agency spent an unprecedented $2 million last February on a television recruiting advertisement, tapping blockbuster movie director Michael Bay for the ad.

Officials have repeatedly argued in testimony on Capitol Hill following the assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, that the agency is underfunded and under-resourced.

Any cuts at the agency, one of the sources said, are likely to impact administrative and technical staff, but could also impact new hires and those who are within their probationary period, positions that are more easily cut. It is not expected, that source said, to immediately impact the agency’s core missions and readiness – though it could in time, particularly if those in law enforcement roles need to backfill vacant support positions.

There is tremendous anxiety about what could ultimately take place at the USSS among rank-and-file staff, the sources said, and hesitancy to speak to reporters due to the threat of polygraph tests.

“It’s hard for the Service to execute on a strategy, which is to bolster their resources and funding – especially in the wake of the attack on President Trump in Butler. How do they build that strategy now having to reduce a workforce?” questioned Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN contributor and former USSS agent.

Wackrow continued, “The mission is not directly impacted with what is being proposed at this moment – but it will over time. You start creating these intrinsic vulnerabilities in your workforce that could lead to another Butler.”

News of the potential cuts sent shockwaves across DHS component agencies Saturday, multiples sources said, with personnel desperately seeking clarity from their managers regarding whether they might be impacted.

At the Secret Service, senior managers told personnel Saturday that DHS was conducting a downsizing assessment for each of its component agencies, sources said, but any possible cuts remained unclear. Senior Secret Service officials also told the rank-and-file they were awaiting further clarity from DHS leadership, which they hoped to have in the coming days.",Left

A trio of election results this week have Republicans confronting a new reality: not only are they facing political headwinds as the party in power but simultaneously grappling with a dramatic reversal in the partisan preferences of the country’s most reliable voters.

For years, Republicans were seen as the party that dominated lower profile elections outside presidential years, while Democratic voters were less consistent. But under President Donald Trump, Republicans worry their base has shifted to include low propensity voters who turn out for him but are not as motivated as Democrats to show up when he’s not on the ballot.

Democrats have overperformed the top of the 2024 ticket in nearly every special election this year, flipped control of two state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania, halved the margins for two open US House seats in Florida and won a high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race by a resounding 10 points. While Democrats have said those results are a sign that voters are rejecting the Trump administration’s agenda, some top Republicans have raised alarms about turning out the base.

“The political problem on the Republican side of the aisle is how to get our base to vote in off-cycle elections,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X, adding that it was time for the GOP establishment to learn from Trump’s political success.

Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, argued that Republicans must acknowledge that they are the party of low propensity voters, or people who don’t consistently show up to vote.

“Special elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy,” he wrote on X.

Kirk, whose organization worked to engage low propensity voters in swing states during the 2024 election cycle, said politics is an “afterthought” for many of their voters and Republicans needed to “begin to fully fund the infrastructure to match the Democrat machine” ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Turning out Trump loyalists who vote infrequently could be key to Republicans’ electoral fortunes, especially as the president’s agenda risks pushing away independent and moderate swing voters.

Republicans are also hoping to maintain control of the Virginia governor’s seat, despite the state’s Democratic lean and potentially build on their narrow House and Senate majorities.

The party that wins the White House historically loses seats in midterm cycle that follows, and voters have become increasingly willing to back split government – Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden all lost the House two years after first being elected.

One GOP political operative familiar with House campaigns said the party is still on offense and pointed to the 13 US House districts Trump won in 2024 that are held by Democrats. Republicans have also noted it’s too early to say what the political climate, the economy or Trump’s approval ratings will look like next year.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that Trump had a 43% approval rating, with 52% of Americans saying they agree tariffs on imported goods would do more harm than good and 57% viewing the president’s moves to shake up the economy as too erratic.

The party of low propensity voters

Throughout the Trump era, Democrats have pointed to special and off-year election victories and closer-than-expected losses as evidence of a momentum advantage. During Trump’s first term, Democrats won a GOP-held Pittsburgh-area US House seat and an Alabama US Senate seat in special elections ahead of winning back the House in 2018. The party also significantly cut into GOP margins in a handful of special elections for deep-red US House seats in states such as Kansas and South Carolina.

Mike DuHaime, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, said Republicans would have to learn the same lesson Democrats did under Obama. Despite his 2008 and 2012 wins, Democrats suffered substantial downballot losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterms.

“When it comes down to turning out Republicans, it takes money, it takes a message, and it takes an exciting candidate,” DuHaime said.

He pointed to Wisconsin, where Brad Schimel, a conservative state Supreme Court candidate endorsed by Trump, lost to liberal Susan Crawford. Though Schimel won 63% of the number of votes Trump received in November – exceeding the 60% mark Republicans estimated they needed to win – Crawford won 78% of the number of votes Vice President Kamala Harris received. Schimel lost despite Trump hosting a tele-rally to back him and Tesla CEO Elon Muskcombining with allied groups to spend more than $20 million to boost him.

“In Wisconsin, the money was certainly there,” DuHaime. “Whether or not the message and the candidate were there, that’s where the question lies.”

Sean Noble, an Arizona-based Republican strategist, said Republicans have failed over the years to build up a long-lasting get-out-the-vote infrastructure to compete with Democrats.

“Democrats have an advantage over Republicans on what I would call a permanent infrastructure of turnout that Republicans have never taken the time or effort or money to really build and sustain over the long term,” he said.

In 2024, the Trump campaign and its allies made the risky decision to focus on turning out infrequent voters for the president. That bet paid off for the president, but Republicans in other races struggled to harness that support for themselves, even when they shared the ballot with Trump.

While Trump won in Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin last year, the Republican Senate candidates he endorsed in those states lost after receiving several thousand fewer votes than the president. The Democratic Senate candidates were able to hold onto most of Vice President Kamala Harris’ support or, in the case of Ruben Gallego in Arizona, surpass it.

Republican pollster Whit Ayres dismissed the idea that the Republican Party as a whole had become the party most likely to benefit from turning out infrequent voters.

“Donald Trump is president in no small part because of low propensity voters who turn out to vote for him,” he told CNN. “That doesn’t mean they’re going to turn out to vote for other Republicans.”

Ayres said Democrats’ performance in recent special and off-year elections was reminiscent of the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats made huge gains in the House of Representatives. To avoid a similar fate next year, he said Republicans would need to avoid unpopular agenda items.

“You might want to not tank the entire world economy with massive tariffs,” he said. “That might be a good start.”

A 2018 repeat?

Democrats have argued that the issue for Republicans isn’t with infrequent voters, but with swing voters who elected Trump to lower prices and improve the economy.

“Their problem is not that they plan for low propensity voters to vote in these special elections and they’re not showing up,” said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. “What they’re losing is Republicans, either to inaction or questioning their policies.”

Jennifer Konfrst, Iowa’s Democratic House Minority Leader, said Democrats in her state wereable to flip a Republican-held state Senate seat thanks to solid candidate recruitment – Democrat Mike Zimmer was an elected school board leader and longtime high school principal in district – and connecting with Democrats who are ready to re-engage in politics after their defeat in November.

“There are some folks who have just been kind of unplugging for a while,” she said. “They are plugged back in now, and they are ready to fight.”

In Wisconsin, Democrats pointed to high turnout and Crawford’s success in red areas as evidence that she’d won over Trump voters. Crawford won ten counties that backed Trump in November, including Green Bay’s Brown County, where Musk gave out two $1 million checks to voters at an event the weekend before the election.

“There were clearly MAGA voters that were voting for Brad Schimel, but there were a lot of Republican voters that were voting for Susan Crawford,” Patrick Guarasci, a senior advisor to Crawford’s campaign, told CNN.

National Democrats have become increasingly bullish on their chances of winning back the House after Tuesday’s races.

Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin said recent special elections showed “voters moving en masse towards the Democratic Party,” during a press call this week.

State party leaders are echoing that optimism. Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried said this week’s special election results should scare any Republican who won by less than 15 pointslast November, while in Wisconsin, chair Ben Wikler said voters in his state sent a clear message: “Democrats are back.”",Left
