The Justice Department has placed on administrative leave a government immigration lawyer who in court this week expressed frustration at not being able to answer key questions from a judge over a mistaken deportation case, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Erez Reuveni argued the government’s case in the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the government has said was sent to his native El Salvador last month due to a clerical error, despite a court order that he not be deported.

Reuveni said in court of the government’s position: “Our only arguments are jurisdictional. … He should not have been sent to El Salvador.”

Asked why the US couldn’t simply ask for his return, Reuveni said, “The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” adding that he did not get a direct answer.

Attorney General Pam Bondi took issue with how Reuveni handled the case in court.

“At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,” she said in a statement to CNN.

Bondi issued a memo on her first day as attorney general requiring lawyers to “zealously” advocate for administration positions or face disciplinary action and potential firing.

August Flentje, Reuveni’s supervisor, was also placed on administrative leave, according to one person familiar with the matter. ABC News reported earlier Saturday that Flentje was told he had failed to supervise a subordinate. CNN has reached out to Flentje and the Justice Department for comment.

Reuveni didn’t respond to a request for comment. On LinkedIn five months ago, he posted that he had been promoted to a new position as acting deputy director at the Office of Immigration Litigation.

Flentje, whose LinkedIn profile lists his title as deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation, is known for his work defending the travel ban in the first Trump administration, a role that garnered criticism from some DOJ colleagues.

In a court filing earlier this week, the Trump administration conceded that Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father of three, was deported “because of an administrative error.” That filing appeared to be the first time the administration has admitted an error related to its recent deportation flights to El Salvador, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.

“On March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the Trump administration’s March 31 filing said.

A Maryland judge has ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned by Monday night, but the Trump administration on Saturday filed an emergency stay attempting to block the order. The administration has said it cannot return him because he’s now in Salvadoran custody.

Abrego Garcia, who attorneys say fled gang violence in El Salvador more than a decade ago, had been identified by his wife in a photo of detainees entering intake at CECOT, the country’s notorious mega prison.

A district court judge awarded $6.6 million combined to four whistleblowers who were fired shortly after they reported Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to the FBI.

“By a preponderance of the evidence,” Travis County Judge Catherine Mauzy wrote in her Friday judgment, the plaintiffs proved liability, damages and attorneys fees in their complaint against the attorney general’s office.

“Because the Office of the Attorney General violated the Texas Whistleblower Act by firing and otherwise retaliating against the plaintiff for in good faith reporting violations of law by Ken Paxton and OAG, the court hereby renders judgment for plaintiffs,” Mauzy wrote.

The court found that the four Paxton aides were fired in retaliation for reporting allegations that he was using his office to accept bribes from an Austin real estate developer who employed a woman with whom Paxton was having an extramarital affair. Paxton has denied accepting bribes or misusing his office to help Nate Paul, the real estate developer.

The judgment also stated that the employees made their reports to law enforcement “in good faith” and that Paxton’s office did not dispute any claims or damages in the lawsuit.

“It should shock all Texans that their chief law enforcement officer, Ken Paxton, admitted to violating the law, but that is exactly what happened in this case,” Tom Nesbitt, an attorney for Blake Brickman, and TJ Turner, an attorney for David Maxwell, said in a joint statement.

In a statement to the media, Paxton, a Republican, called the ruling “ridiculous” and “not based on the facts or the law.” He also said that his office intends to appeal the ruling.

Paxton was at the center of a federal investigation after eight employees reported his office to the FBI in 2020 for bribery allegations. Paxton in 2023 agreed to a $3.3 million settlement and an apology, but no admission of wrongdoing, with four of the whistleblowers. After Paxton asked state lawmakers to fund the settlement, the Texas House rejected his request, conducted its own investigation and impeached him in 2023. He was later acquitted in the state Senate.

In November, the Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling that Paxton testify in the lawsuit.

The US Justice Department decided not to pursue its investigation into Paxton in the final weeks of the Biden administration, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

No longer shadowed by the federal corruption investigation that hung over his rising profile in the Republican Party, Paxton is now gearing up for a potential US Senate run. Paxton, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has hinted at challenging GOP Sen. John Cornyn for more than a year but has not said when he will make a decision.",Left
